 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. crude extract showed MIC values of between 0.0625 and &gt;16 mg/mL. The most active inhibition was against 
 <italic>M. marinum</italic> at 0.0625 mg/mL. Mupirocin produced by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains has been reported to possess antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas palleroniana</italic> crude extract showed MIC values of between 0.250 and &gt;16 mg/mL. The most active inhibition was against 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> at 0.250 mg/mL. The crude extract showed activity against 
 <italic>E. aerogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at concentrations of 1.00 mg/mL and 
 <italic>M. marinum</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> at concentrations of 0.500 mg/mL. Endophytic crude extracts from 
 <italic>Pseudomonas palleroniana</italic> were reported to inhibit 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Pyoluteorin produced by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas palleroniana</italic> strains has been reported to contain antibacterial activity [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> crude extract showed MIC values of between 1.00 and &gt;16 mg/mL. The most active inhibition was against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at 1.00 mg/mL. Antibiotics pyoluteorin, phenazine-1-carboxamide, and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid were produced by 
 <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. This could explain the antibacterial activity observed. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas cichorii</italic> crude extract showed MIC values of between 0.125 and 16 mg/mL. The crude extract showed activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> at concentrations of 1.00 mg/mL, 
 <italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at concentrations of 0.125 mg/mL, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> at 0.250 mg/mL, and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> at 0.500 mg/mL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the antibacterial activity of crude endophyte extracts from 
 <italic>Pseudomonas cichorii</italic>.
