 <italic>Arthrobacter pascens</italic> crude extract showed MIC values of between 0.0625 and &gt;16 mg/mL. The most active inhibition was against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> at 0.0625 mg/mL. The crude extract showed activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. aerogenes</italic> at concentrations of 1.00 mg/mL. Arthrobacilin, an antibacterial compound produced by 
 <italic>Arthrobacter</italic> spp., showed inhibition against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
