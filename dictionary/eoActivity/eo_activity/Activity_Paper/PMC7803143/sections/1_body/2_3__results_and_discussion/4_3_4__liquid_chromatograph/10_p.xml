<p>The identified alkaloids lycorine, crinamidine, and powelline are true alkaloids of the Amaryllidaceae family [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>], and this supports the obtained results as 
 <italic>Crinum macowanii</italic> belongs to this plant family. The availability of these alkaloids leads to overuse and overharvesting of 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic> to obtain these bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. The bioprospecting of endophyte isolated metabolites could help save the environment since endophytes have been reported to contain similar bioactive compounds as the host plant [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>] and in some doing medicinal plants are being conserved and revenue is generated by the bioprospecting of metabolites from endophytes [
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>].
