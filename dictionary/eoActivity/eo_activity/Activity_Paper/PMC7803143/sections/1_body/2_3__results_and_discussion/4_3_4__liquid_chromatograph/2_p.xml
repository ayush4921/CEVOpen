<p>Not much work has been done to the leaves, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the identification of secondary metabolites from leaves of 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic> and their endophytes using LC-Q-TOF-MS. Endophytes are able to produce similar secondary metabolites as the host plants by exchanging fragments of their genomic DNA with the host plant [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. These secondary metabolites perform distinct functions such as antibacterial and anticancer activity as performed in this study [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Melicopicine is an acridone alkaloid isolated from leaves of 
 <italic>Teclea</italic> and 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. An acridone alkaloid melicopicine has been isolated from 
 <italic>Melicope fareana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] and has anthelmintic and antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. This would explain the noteworthy antibacterial activity of the crude leave extract observed in this study.
