<p>The extraction of secondary metabolites from the leaves was carried out using the method previously described by Yadav and Agarwala [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Sebola et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. macowanii</italic> leaves were washed, cut into small pieces, and air-dried at room temperature. The dried plant material was blended into a fine powder using a commercial blender. 150 g of the prepared plant material was mixed with 2 L of a 50 : 50 methanol : dichloromethane solution. This was allowed to shake for 3 days on a platform shaker (Amerex Gyromax, Temecula, CA, USA) at 200°rcf. The solution was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper; the filtrate was evaporated on a rotatory evaporator and allowed to air dry in a desiccator.
