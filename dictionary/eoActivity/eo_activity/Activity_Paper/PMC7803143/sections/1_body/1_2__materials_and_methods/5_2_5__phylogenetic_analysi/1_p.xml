<p>The obtained sequences were screened for chimeras using DECIPHER23 and subjected to BLAST analysis using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database against the 16S rDNA sequence database (bacteria and archaea) to identify the closest bacterial species. Bacterial species with 98â€“100% similarities were selected for phylogenetic analysis. Alignments of nucleotide sequences were performed using MUSCLE with default options. The positions containing gaps or missing nucleotide data were eliminated. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using a Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method (Saitou and Nei, 1987) based on the Tamura-Nei model [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. A total of 1000 replications were used for bootstrap testing. All branches with greater than 50% bootstraps were considered to be significant [
