<p>Bacterial endophytes were isolated from the leaves of the plant by a method described by Jasim et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Sebola et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, the leaves were cut into small pieces of about 10 cm using a sterile pair of scissors. The cut leaves were treated with 5% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, South Africa) (enough to cover the plant material) and vigorously shaken for 5 minutes. Tween 20 was removed by rinsing several times with sterile distilled water, followed by disinfection with 50 mL of 70% ethanol for 1 minute. Traces of the ethanol were removed by rinsing with sterile distilled water 5 times. The sample was then treated with 1% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) for 10 minutes and again rinsed five times with sterile distilled water. The last rinse was used as a control, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of this was plated on Potato Dextrose agar (PDA) (HiMedia, USA) and Nutrient Agar (NA) (Oxoid, USA). The sample was then macerated in sterilized phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The macerated sample was serially diluted up to 10
 <sup>−3</sup> dilution, and each dilution was inoculated (using a spread plate method) in triplicate on nutrient agar. The NA plates were incubated at 30°C (IncoTherm, Labotec, Johannesburg, South Africa). Growth was monitored periodically for 5 days. The effectiveness of the sterilization was monitored on the wash control plate, with growth indicating poor sterilization. Under such circumstances, the plates for the plant part were discarded and the sterilization was repeated. Distinct colonies were selected and subcultured on nutrient agar to obtain pure isolates. Pure bacterial isolates were preserved in 50% glycerol in a ratio of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L glycerol : 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L overnight broth culture and kept at −80°C.
