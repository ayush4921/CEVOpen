<p>Spectral data processing was performed on Bruker Compass DataAnalysis software version 4.3 (Bruker Daltonics, Brem Hub, California, USA). MetFrag web tool version 2.1 software (Git Hub, California, USA) was used to compare fragment patterns of fragmented ions with those from compound databases, namely, PubChem, ChemSpider, and KEGG [

Comparison of the two base chromatograms (from the crude extracts and endophyte extracts and the controls) allowed for filtering out impurities from the growth medium [
