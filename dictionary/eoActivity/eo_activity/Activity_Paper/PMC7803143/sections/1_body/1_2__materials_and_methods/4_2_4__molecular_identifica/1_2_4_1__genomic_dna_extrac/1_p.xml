<p>The 16S rRNA gene of the bacterial endophyte was amplified according to a method described by Kuklinsky-Sobral et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. DNA extraction was done using a ZR Fungal/Bacterial Kit™ (Zymo Research, catalog NO R2014) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was done to amplify the 16S rRNA gene of each bacterial endophyte with the primers 16S-27F: 5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′ and 16S-1492R: 5′-CGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′, using DreamTaq™ DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific™). PCR products were gel extracted (Zymo Research, Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery Kit) and sequenced in the forward and reverse directions on the ABI PRISM™ 3500xl Genetic Analyzer. The sequencing was performed at Inqaba Biotechnical Industries (Pty) Ltd., Pretoria, South Africa. The PCR products were cleaned with ExoSAP-it™ following the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified sequencing products (Zymo Research, ZR-96 DNA Sequencing Clean-up Kit™) were analyzed using CLC Main Workbench 7, followed by a BLAST search (NCBI).
