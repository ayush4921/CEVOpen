<p>Polysaccharides produced by plants and microorganisms have been widely studied due to their natural antioxidants properties. Three polysaccharides, namely exopolysaccharide (EPS), water-extracted mycelial polysaccharide (WPS), and sodium hydroxide-extracted mycelial polysaccharide (SPS), produced by 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> Dzf17 from 
 <italic>Guazuma tomentosa</italic> displayed antioxidant properties [

 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. displayed significant antioxidant properties. When subjected to the 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and DPPH radical assays, these compounds exhibited EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 580.02 and 2030.25 μg/mL, respectively [
