 <xref rid="B57-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Furthermore, another anticancer compound, “chaetoglobosin U”, was produced by the fungus 
 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic>, which lives synergistically in the stem of healthy 
 <italic>Imperata cylindrica</italic> [

 <xref rid="B58-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] also established that the endophyte 
 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> from the 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> plant contained three novel compounds that include azaphilone alkaloids, chaetomugilides A–C, and chaetoviridin E, all of which displayed high cytotoxic activities against the human cancer cell line HePG2 [

 <italic>Xylaria, Phoma, Hypoxylon,</italic> and 
 <italic>Chalara</italic> have also been reported to produce cytochalasins, which possess antitumor activities. In addition, three novel cytochalasins, namely cytochalasin H, cytochalasin J, and cytochalasin E, were also extracted from

 <sub>22</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>), a lignan-type bioactive compound which was originally isolated from 
 <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> L. in the 1880s, and its derivatives are well-known to possess a variety of biological properties and are used as cathartic, purgative, antiviral, vesicant, antibacterial, antihelminthic, and antitumor agents. Etoposide and teniposide are chemotherapeutic medications produced from podophyllotoxin, and they are currently available in the market. In addition, endophytes

 <italic>Trametes hirsute</italic>, as well as some belonging to the genera 
 <italic>Trichoderma, Penicillium</italic>, and
