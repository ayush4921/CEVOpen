<p>Antioxidant agents are utilized to combat, prevent, and treat diseases that are linked with the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and these agents have displayed very high efficacy against damage caused by ROS. ROS have been reported to boost the immune system by enabling cell signaling to occur. Various industries, such as the food, pharmaceutical, and agricultural sectors, use antioxidant compounds for beneficial purposes. Irrespective of the health concerns associated with oxidative stress, the search for safer, more efficacious, and cost-effective natural antioxidants is highly anticipated. Novel natural bioactive compounds have been reported to serve as a shelter against oxidative damage by preventing or reducing free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Various studies have demonstrated that molecules, including phenolic acids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids, lignin, melanin, and tannins, exhibited antioxidant activity [

 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> from the leaves of 
 <italic>Otoba gracilipes</italic> exhibited antioxidant activity with as much as 51.5% of a scavenging effect on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) after 5 min of reaction [

 <italic>Xylaria</italic> sp. were isolated from the medicinal plant 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, and these compounds displayed antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-cardiovascular, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties. Phenolic and flavonoid compounds, among others, have been shown to possess very effective antioxidant properties [

 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> AE1 isolated from 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> also revealed that it produced secondary metabolites that possess very effective antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. DPPH free radical and superoxide radical scavenging tests of the secondary metabolites displayed antioxidant potentials with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 38.0 and 11.38 Î¼g/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Chemical characterization of methanol extracts of two filamentous fungal strains revealed the presence of the residues chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, rutin, and quercetin 3-acetyl-glucoside (

 <italic>Pestalotiopsis microspore</italic> housed in 
 <italic>Terminalia morobensis</italic>, which also displayed very effective antioxidant activities [
