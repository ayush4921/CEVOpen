<p>Recently, endophytic fungi were isolated from medicinal plants of Egyptian origin, which displayed significant antiviral properties against herpes simplex (HSV-2) and vesicular stomatitis viruses (VSV) [
 <xref rid="B105-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. It was identified that the endophyte 
 <italic>Pleospora tarda</italic> was responsible for the potent antiviral agents classified as alternariol and alternariol-(9)-methyl compounds [

 <italic>Aconitum vilmorinianum</italic> [

Other bioactive compounds with antifungal activities included (â€“)-6-methoxymellein, 7-hydroxy-3, 5-dimethyl-isochromen-1-one, norlichexanthone, 6-methylsalicylic acid, and gentisyl alcohol [

 <italic>Nigrospora</italic> sp. YE3033 which resides in the plant
