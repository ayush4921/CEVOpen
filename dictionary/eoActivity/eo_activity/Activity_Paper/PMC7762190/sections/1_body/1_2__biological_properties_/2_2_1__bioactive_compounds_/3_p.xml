<p>Recently, numerous scientists have demonstrated that endophytic fungi have a variety of beneficial, novel, and effective bioactive metabolites possessing antibacterial activity. Endophytic 
 <italic>Alternaria alternate</italic> (AE1) was isolated from healthy and mature leaves of 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> plants located in Santiniketan. The fungal extracts exhibited excellent antimicrobial activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> MTCC 121, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> MTCC 657, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> MTCC 96 and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> MTCC 2639, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> MTCC 98, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> MTCC 741, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MTCC 1667) with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 300–400 μg/mL. The mode of action was determined as being cidal and further analysis demonstrated that cell lysis or leakage of cell membrane was occurring. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis confirmed that the fungal extracts consist of several bioactive compounds [

 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. demonstrated strong effectiveness against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> with an MIC value of 62.50 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Linoleic acid (9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)) and cyclodecasiloxane produced by endophytic 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp. were successfully isolated from native South African 
 <italic>Pelargonium sidoides</italic>, and this is considered as a first report. These fungal metabolites inhibited several food-borne and food spoilage bacteria, including 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium,</italic> and 
 <italic>E. gallinarum</italic> showed a 2–12-mm zone of inhibition [

 <italic>Meloidogyne incognita</italic> are persistent parasites in plants and contribute to about 5% of global crop losses [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a biocontrol investigation revealed that the endophytic fungus 
 <italic>Piriformospora indica</italic> was capable of inhibiting the root-knot nematode parasite and, thus, enhanced plant growth [
