<p>Oxidation is a chemical reaction resulting in the loss of electrons from an atom, and this may produce free radicals. Naturally occurring free radicals are unstable molecules produced during chemical reactions such as digestion. These free radicals may participate in chain reactions which might potentially cause cell damage in the human body [

 <xref rid="B71-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This is mainly due to the fact that after an atom losses an electron, the cell becomes imbalanced, thus resulting in cell damage. Hence, when exposed to oxidative stress, cells may suffer from a wide range of diseases that may also include chronic complications in humans [
 <xref rid="B72-microorganisms-08-01934" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Extensive studies have demonstrated that exposure of cells to oxidative stress contributes to cellular degeneration, cancer, atherosclerosis, coronary heart ailments, diabetes, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and hepatic and kidney damage as well as other neurodegenerative disorders [
