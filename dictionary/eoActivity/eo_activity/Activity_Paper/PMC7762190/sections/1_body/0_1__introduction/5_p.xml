<p>New biotechnological advances concentrate on the search for and utilization of novel bioactive compounds extracted from endophytic fungi. Despite all of this, only a tiny portion of endophytic fungi have been isolated and investigated for their biological activities. In this current review, we focus in depth on the various biological properties demonstrated by endophytic fungi. We also identify novel bioactive compounds associated with the activities. Furthermore, we shed light on the activities against resistant pathogenic microorganisms. Unexplored niche areas such as these will progress the drug development process tremendously. Endophytic fungi are an abundant source of natural bioactive compounds which are novel, renewable, and low in toxicity and more efficacious, more potent, more affordable, safer, and less resistant than conventional antimicrobial agents. Hence, this will alleviate the massive burden on public healthcare systems and aid in the medical and pharmaceutical industries. </p>
