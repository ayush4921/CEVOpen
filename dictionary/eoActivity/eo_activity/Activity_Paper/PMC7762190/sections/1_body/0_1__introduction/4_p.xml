<p>Bioactive compounds are primarily responsible for the beneficial characteristics displayed by endophytic fungi. History has shown that such metabolic compounds might aid in ground-breaking discoveries, e.g., the discovery of penicillin produced by 
 <italic>Penicillium chrysogenum,</italic> which was a milestone in the development of antibiotic drugs, as a “front-line” antibiotic which saved millions of lives; hence, it was referred to as “wonder drug” [

 <italic>Taxomyces andreanae</italic> for chemotherapy purposes [
