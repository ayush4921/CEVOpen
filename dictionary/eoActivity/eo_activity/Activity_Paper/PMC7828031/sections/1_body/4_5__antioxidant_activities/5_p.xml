<p>Liver is one of the many victims of oxidative stress, evident by increased associated between ROS levels and liver damage. Importantly, in isolated rat hepatocytes, aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> protects against cumene hydroperoxide (CHP)-induced oxidative stress [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract protected hepatocytes against several oxidative instigators such as glutathione depletion, lysosomal membrane oxidative damage, ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, cellular proteolysis, or mitochondrial membrane potential decrease [
