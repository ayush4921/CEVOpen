<p>Nowadays, there is an explosive increase in bacterial resistance to many antibiotics, making this issue a serious threat to humans [
 <xref rid="B129-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. One way to control and limit this resistance is identifying new antibacterial agents, ideally with novel mechanisms. The use of plants as potential sources for new drugs is an attractive route and is indeed receiving more attention. To this end, plants are rich with ethnomedicinal constitutes that play a distinguished role in the maintenance of human health against several diseases [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> on several bacterial strains. They showed that sumacâ€™s essential oil efficiently prevents the growth of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> with concentrations of 2, 3, or 15 mg/mL respectively [
