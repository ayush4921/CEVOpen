<p>Our group was the first to explore the anticancer activity of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> in breast cancer. 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> ethanolic extract (RCE) was found to decrease the cellular viability of various breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and T47D) in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, RCE was shown to induce DNA damage, irreversible G1 arrest and senescence associated with the expression of senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase [

 <xref rid="B121-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. We also showed that RCE reduced cell viability through the activation of the type II programmed (autophagic) cell death. Mechanistically, RCE elicits its effect through autophagy-dependent activation of p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Indeed, inhibition of autophagy reduced cell death and blocked p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> (AgSu/NPs) reduced cellular viability and induced apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 breast cancer cells line [
 <xref rid="B117-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Altogether, these findings identify 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> as a promising chemopreventive and therapeutic candidate that modulate breast cancer growth and metastasis. Quercetin, one of the first flavonoid identified in the composition of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic>, was shown to reduce cell viability, induce autophagy by inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway and triggers caspase-3 dependent apoptosis in various cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Hence, it is legitimate to suggest that quercetin can contribute, maybe not solely, to the anticancer activity of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic>.
