<p>Despite many studies on the non-volatile components of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic>, little is known about the volatile composition. In 2018, the volatile profile of sumac fruit from three different origins (Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt) was reported. Also, the volatile profile of its cold tea and post roasting preparation was determined. 74 volatile components belonging to alcohols, aromatics, esters, ethers, furan/aldehyde, hydrocarbons, ketones, monoterpenes, oxides, and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were identified. In fresh 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> fruit, sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons accounted for the major volatile class, while furan/aldehydes were the major classes in the roasted fruits. Moreover, the volatile profile changed according to the geographic location where the fruit was collected. Egyptian sumac, for instance, showed more difference among its tea or roasted profiles as compared to Palestinian and Jordanian sumac, which both showed similar profiles [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> fruit obtained from the southeastern region of Turkey [
 <xref rid="B37-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This study showed that malic acid, present in the volatile fraction, accounted for the sour taste of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> fruit. Other compounds, namely Î²-caryophyllene (spicy, woody), cembrene (woody), and caryophyllene oxide (spicy), are believed to contribute to the flavor of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> fruit [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> are illustrated in
