<p>Since ancient times, herbal medicines have been used by humans not only due to their efficacy and safety but also due to their lower toxicity. However, recent studies pointed out that many of these medicinal herbs could exhibit some adverse effects [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> was shown to be safe to be consumed by both humans and animals. Doğan and Çelik investigated the protective and therapeutic effect of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. They have conducted toxicity test using three different dosages (250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg) of the plant extract. The results showed optimum tolerance and non-lethal oral uptake of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> lyophilized extract even at very high dose (1000 mg/kg) and there was no signs of toxicity and mortality after daily administration of the extract for 3 days [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> seed extract has a favorable outcome in controlling some blood parameters in type 2 diabetic mice without causing any undesirable side effects [

 <italic>et al.,</italic> who demonstrated the antisecretory and antidiarrheal effect of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> crude extract in mice, reported that this extract was found to be safe even at dose of 5 g/kg [
 <xref rid="B112-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Our group also showed that chick embryo treated with 150 µg/mL of ethanolic extract of this plant, a concentration shown to inhibit tumor growth and invasion of breast cancer cells, were perfectly healthy [
 <xref rid="B119-antioxidants-10-00073" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that this plant and its extracts are very safe, making them even more attractive for medicinal use or drug discovery approaches.
