<p>The major fatty acids present in Handal seed oil from the desert of Jordan are Linoleic acid 74.8 ± 0.1 (%), Palmitic acid 8.35 ± 0.03 (%), Stearic acid 5.36 ± 0.06 (%), and Oleic acid 9.04 ± 0.09 (%), while Omega 3‐ and hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids are found at less than 1%. The content of linoleic oil in this study is higher than that of Handel oil from other regions. The results of the present study concluded that cancer cell viability was considerably affected after 48 hr exposure relative to the human fibroblasts upon treatment with the examined oil, suggesting a reasonable anticancer activity and safety profile against the human skin fibroblasts. The principal component analysis (PCA) suggests a potential relationship between the high omega‐6 fatty acid in natural Handal seed oil and the anticancer activities reported against the studied cancer cell lines.</p>
