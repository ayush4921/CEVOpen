<p>Overall, these findings indicate that Handal plant from Jordan has very high level of linoleic acid compared to other oils measured in different geographic locations and that there appears to be some anticancer activities associated with the fatty acid profile of Handel seed oil. Further studies using isolated constituents instead of the whole extract should be carried out to better understand the relationship between Handel seed oil composition and potential anticancer activity.</p>
