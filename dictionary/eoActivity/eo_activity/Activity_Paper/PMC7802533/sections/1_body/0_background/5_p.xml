<p>Vegetable oils are known as natural products that contain fatty acids of different saturation levels (Nesma et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). They also contain triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, and vitamins (A, D, E, and K) in small amounts (Emmanuel &amp; Mudiakeoghene, 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Nonetheless, fatty acids are often classified into long‐chain fatty acids, with more than 14 carbon atoms and higher melting points, and short‐chain fatty acids with lower than six carbon atoms and lower melting points (Fasina et al.,
