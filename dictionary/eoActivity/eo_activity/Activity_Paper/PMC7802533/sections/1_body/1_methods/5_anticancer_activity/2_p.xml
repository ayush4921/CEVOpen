<p>Normal skin fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Dulbecco's modified essential medium/Ham's 12 nutrient mixture, Gibco). Colorectal cancer cell lines, Caco‐2 and HCT‐116, were cultured in DMEM medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium). Both media were enriched with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 100 U/ml of Penicillin, and 100 µg/ml of Streptomycin. Cells were maintained at 37ºC in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Cell viability was determined by vital staining with trypan blue (0.4% (w/v); Sigma), and cells were counted using a light microscope (Bardaweel et al.,
