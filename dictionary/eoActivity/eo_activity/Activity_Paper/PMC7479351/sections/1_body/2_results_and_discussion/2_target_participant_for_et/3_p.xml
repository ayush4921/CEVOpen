They argued that the technique used in the evaluation is effective in identifying and treating tumour disease. Other physical observations encountered during diagnosis include foul breath, excessive coughing, bitterness in the mouth, numbness in the sole of the feet, hotness in the palm of the hands, among others. These observations serve as indicators for the presence of internal tumours (e.g., lung).
