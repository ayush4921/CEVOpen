<p id="p0075">For the period of data collection, we noticed that more than one local name described a single species, e.g., ‘
 <italic>Kayar kusa’</italic> or ‘
 <italic>bera’</italic> ascribed to 
 <italic>Asparagus Africanus</italic> Lam., ‘
 <italic>Runhuu’</italic> or ‘
 <italic>Runfuu’</italic> ascribed to 
 <italic>Cassia singueana</italic> Delile., ‘
 <italic>Dany'a</italic> or ‘
 <italic>Nunu</italic>’ ascribed to 
 <italic>Sclerocarya birrea</italic> (A.Rich.) Hochst, among others. The differences are attributed to different ethnic groups in the region as well as the traditional uses of the species for a different purpose. In some cases, both language and traditional use in the region mix up at least two if not more than two species having the same local name. For instance, “
 <italic>Girgizi</italic>” ascribing to 
 <italic>Cyperus difformis</italic> L. can also be described as 
 <italic>Borassus aethiopum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cyperus digitatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Hyphaene thebaica</italic>. There are other relevant instances, but we ensured the right plant is properly collected and identified in an appropriate manner.
