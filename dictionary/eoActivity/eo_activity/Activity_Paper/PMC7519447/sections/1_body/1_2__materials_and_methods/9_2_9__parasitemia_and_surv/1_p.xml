<p>Blood was collected from the tail snip of each mouse, and thin smear was prepared on microscope slides. After air drying, the smears were fixed with absolute methanol and stained with 10% Giemsa stain for 15 min. The slides were then gently rinsed with tap water and dried at room temperature. With little drop of oil immersion, the number of pRBC was counted using light microscope (Olympus N-120A, Philippines) with an objective lens of 100x magnification power. Five fields of approximately 100–200 cells in each slide were counted [
