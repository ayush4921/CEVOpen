<p>The fresh leaf of the plant was cleaned, dried in shaded area, and was then ground into a coarse powder using mortar and pestle. Two hundred grams of the course plant material was weighed by sensitive digital weighing balance (Mettler Toledo, Switzerland) and extracted by cold maceration technique. The plant material was soaked in a separate flask containing 80% methanol (1 : 5 (

The extract was filtered using Whatman grade No. 1 filter paper (Schleicher and Schuell MicroScience GmbH, Germany), and marcs were re-extracted for a second and third time by adding another fresh methanol in water. The filtrates were combined and concentrated in a rotary evaporator (Buchi Rotavapor R-200, Switzerland) with temperature not exceeding 40°C. Finally, the extract was transferred into vials and kept in a desiccator until use.
