<p>The potential of the plant to prevent further malaria attacks in an established infection was investigated using another model known as Rane's test [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this test, although there was no cure, there was significant reduction in parasitemia with all the doses used. The level of parasitemias in the extract-treated groups was consistently lower than those in the negative control. While this may indicate that the plant had rapid onset of action [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the overall lower curative than suppressive effect could possibly be due to too short duration of action to contain the exponentially growing parasites in an established infection [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The survival time was significantly prolonged only at the highest dose which could probably be related to the relatively higher parasitemia reduction by this dose.
