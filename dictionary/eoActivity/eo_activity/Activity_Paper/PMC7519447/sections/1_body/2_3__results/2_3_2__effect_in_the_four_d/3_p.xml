<p>Measurement of body weight at the end of the test (D4) showed that all animals in all groups were found to have lower body weight than their initial weight (DO). Analysis of this change in body weight indicated that none of the doses of the extract were able to prevent weight reduction. Likewise, despite the lower loss of PCV compared to the negative control, none of extract-treated groups had better PCV. With regards to temperature change, the larger doses (400 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg) were able to significantly prevent reduction of temperature as compared to the negative control as well as the smallest dose (100 mg/kg). The positive control, however, was significantly effective at preventing the loss of weight (
