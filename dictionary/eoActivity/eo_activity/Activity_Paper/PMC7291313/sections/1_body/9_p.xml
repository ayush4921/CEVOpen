<p>M. Shen et al. showed both in vitro and in vivo that betulinic acid induces ROS-dependent apoptosis by inhibiting the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway in human multiple myeloma. Betulinic acid exerted its effect mainly through mitochondrial apoptosis induction, cell cycle blockade, mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, intracellular ROS accumulation, and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling inhibition. This comprehensive study above all elucidated the complex regulatory interaction between ROS and the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway in multiple myeloma.
