<p id="p0040">Thin layer chromatography analysis of crude extracts was carried out on POLYGRAM® SIL G/UV
 <sub>254</sub> plates (Merck). 1.0 g of each extract was dissolved in 2ml of dichloromethane and shaken for complete dissolution. Using a micropipette, 5μl of each extract was spotted on TLC plate (4 cm × 8 cm). The plate was air dried and developed with a mixture of dichloromethane and ethanol (95:5) as a mobile phase. After development, the plate was air dried, sprayed with a solution of 10ml Tin (IV) Chloride in 160 ml equal volumes of chloroform and Glacial acetic acid and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. Visualization of plates was done using a transilluminator UV lamp fitted with a cannon camera (Syngene, UK).
