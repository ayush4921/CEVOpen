<p>The viability assay was used to determine the effect of two crude extracts, ethanol and ethyl acetate, on biosensor cell survival. The cells were continuously exposed to 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> crude extracts for 48 h. The results showed that the crude extracts from ethanol did not affect the biological activities of the biosensor cells even when the cells were treated with up to 100 μg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The viability of the ethanol crude extract group ranged from 84% to 100%. However, viability started to decrease when the cells were exposed to the ethyl acetate crude extracts. Specifically, the viability was reduced to 63% at 50 μg/mL and 0.03% at 100 μg/mL. It is probable that the ethyl acetate fraction contained chemical constituents that were toxic to the cells. Therefore, in further experiments, ethyl acetate was chosen to extract the crude metabolites from the isolated endophytes.
