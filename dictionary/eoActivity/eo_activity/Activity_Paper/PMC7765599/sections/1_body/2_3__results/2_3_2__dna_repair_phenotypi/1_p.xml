<p>To validate the phenotype of the biosensor cells, we performed a viability assay of the biosensor clones following exposure to the DNA-damaging agents CPT and etoposide (ETP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Both chemotherapeutic drugs generated DNA DSB that required HR and NHEJ repair pathways, respectively.

 <sup>−/−</sup> cells were used as the positive control in this experiment. Both biosensor clones showed a similar viability to the wild type in the ETP-treated group. However, the biosensor clones demonstrated a lower viability at 10 nM CPT, though a higher viability than the

 <sup>−/−</sup> clones. When the concentration of CPT increased to 20 nM, the viability of the biosensors clone was at a similar level to that of the

 <sup>−/−</sup> clones. These results demonstrated that heterozygous wild-type/fluorescent biosensor alleles function similarly in DNA repair and could represent a biosensor for DNA repair activities. Since biosensor clones 1 and 2 showed the same phenotype on both the cellular proliferation and viability assay, clone 1 was selected for further experiments and designated
