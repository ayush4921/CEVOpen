<p>Typically, a panel of DNA repair-deficient cell lines is used to mechanistically elucidate the DNA-repairing process following exposure to genotoxic agents [
 <xref rid="B68-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. When examining the crude extracts with NHEJ repair-deficient cell lines, both extracts showed a difference in viability profiles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f009">Figure 9</xref>), showing that each extract might have a distinct metabolic profile with similar mild DNA damage properties. Damage induced by the 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> extract did not seem to be repaired by 53BP1 and LIG4, as the viability profile in each corresponding knockout was similar to the wild type (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01680-f009">Figure 9</xref>). At 25 μg/mL of 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 extract, both 
 <italic>53BP1</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> and 
 <italic>LIG4</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> showed a different change in cell viability compared with the wild type. Unlike the 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> extract, 53BP1 and LIG4 seemed to participate in repairing the damage induced by 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 extract. Additionally, the killing potency of 
 <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 extract appeared to be greater than that of the 
 <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> extract. Further experiments on the purification of a positive fraction would provide more insight into the pure bioactive compounds affecting DNA damage and repair.
