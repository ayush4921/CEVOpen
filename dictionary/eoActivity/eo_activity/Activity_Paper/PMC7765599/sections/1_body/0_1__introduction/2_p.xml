<p>Natural products have been the major source of anticancer drugs for more than 50 years [
 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. They can be obtained from plants, microbes, and marine organisms. Recently, much attention has been devoted to investigating medicinal plants and their fungal endophytes for anticancer treatments [

 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-10-01680" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Fungal endophytes have been reported to produce diverse types of secondary metabolites used in medicine, agriculture, and industry. Moreover, it has been stated that parts of the metabolites from medicinal plants might come from the endophyteâ€™s metabolites [
