   <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> and 
   <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 crude extracts differentially affected NHEJ-deficient cells. The cells were treated continuously with ethyl acetate crude metabolites from 
   <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> Roxb. Ex Choisy and 
   <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41 to determine cell viability. The experiment was repeated with biologically independent replicates. Data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation. Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test was performed at 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL of 
   <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> and 
   <italic>Phyllosticta</italic> sp. YGE41. Definitions: DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide;
