  <p>Ethyl acetate crude extracts from 
   <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> Roxb. ex Choisy affected the biosensor cell viability. The viability assay of the biosensor cells was measured following exposure with either 
   <italic>Garcinia cowa</italic> Roxb. ex Choisy ethyl acetate or ethanol crude extract for 48 h. The experiment was repeated with biologically independent replicates. Each point is shown as the mean Â± standard deviation from one experiment.
