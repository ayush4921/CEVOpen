<p>Time–kill assay against the MRSA strains was performed according to Ramli et al. with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, the inoculum suspension of MRSA was diluted to approximately 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. The ethyl acetate fraction of the leaf was diluted with the MHB medium containing inoculum to obtain final concentrations of 0 × MIC, 0.5 × MIC, 1 × MIC, 2 × MIC, 4 × MIC and 8 × MIC for MRSA ATCC 700699 and MRSA KCCM 12255 and final concentrations of 0 × MIC, 0.5 × MIC, 1 × MIC, 2 × MIC and 4 × MIC for MRSA1 and MRSA2. Cultures (1 mL final volume) were incubated at 30 °C with 200 rpm agitation. At predetermined time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 h), 10 µL aliquots were transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes. The aliquots were serially diluted with 990 µL of 1% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 20 µL was staked onto the MHA plates. The number of colonies formed on the plates after incubation at 30 °C for 24 h was counted and the number of CFU/mL was calculated. Assays were carried out in triplicate. The graph of log CFU/mL versus time was plotted as described by Ramli et al. [
