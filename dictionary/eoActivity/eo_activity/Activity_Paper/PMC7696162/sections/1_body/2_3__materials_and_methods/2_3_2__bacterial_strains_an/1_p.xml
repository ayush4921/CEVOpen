<p>MRSA ATCC 700699 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) while MRSA KCCM 12255 was obtained from the Korean Culture Center of Microorganisms (Seoul, South Korea). Two clinical isolates (MRSA1 and MRSA2) were collected from the nasal swab of a 4th-year medical student from University Putra Malaysia, Malaysia. The MRSA strains are kept at the Laboratory of Natural Products (Institute of Bioscience, UPM, Malaysia). The MRSA ATCC 700699, MRSA KCCM 12255 MRSA1 and MRSA2 were grown on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) (Difco, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) aerobically for 24 h at 37 °C, whereas inoculum cell suspension was prepared by transferring and incubating a single colony of each bacterial species in 10 mL of Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) at 37 °C overnight with 200 rpm agitation. Then, 1 µL of bacteria suspension was transferred to new MHB in a ratio of 1:10 to yield an inoculum size of 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL.
