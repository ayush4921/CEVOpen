 <italic>z</italic> 289 and 125, corresponding to the (epi)catechin aglycone [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>9</bold>, which displayed a pseudomolecular ion at

 <italic>z</italic> 305.0663, was identified as (epi)gallocatechin based on the fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 179 for [M-H-126]
 <sup>−</sup>, due to the characteristic loss of the trihydroxybenzene moiety [

 <bold>10</bold>, with pseudomolecular ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 451.1254, was identified as (epi)catechin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-hexoside based on the fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 289, for the loss of a hexoxyl moiety [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Compounds 
 <bold>13</bold> (Rt = 5.44 min) and 
 <bold>15</bold> (Rt 7.74 min) showed similar pseudomolecular ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 289.0714 and 289.0717, respectively. By comparison of their elution order with a previous study by Stöggl et al. [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the compound eluted earlier was identified as catechin while the one eluted later was identified as epicatechin. Both compounds yielded the fragment ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 137 and 151 which were the results of retro-Diels–Alder (RDA) cleavage at ring C of the flavan-3-ol structure.
