<p>Compound 
 <bold>22</bold> was identified as myricetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-hexoside based on the presence of fragment ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 317, 316, 179 and 151, corresponding to the aglycone myricetin. The deprotonated aglycone peak observed at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 316.02 [M-H-162]
 <sup>−</sup> was due to the loss of a hexoxyl moiety [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>24</bold> with a pseudomolecular ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 447.093 was identified as kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-hexoside. This compound showed characteristic fragment ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 285 due to the loss of sugar moiety and fragment ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 255 and 227 which are due to the loss of [M-162-CHO]
 <sup>−</sup> and [M-162-H
 <sub>2</sub>O-CO], respectively. Similarly, the fragment ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 179 and 151 were due to RDA cleavage of C-ring [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Attachment of the sugar moiety at the C-3 position of these compounds was also determined based on the relative abundance of [Y
 <sub>0</sub> H]
 <sup>−</sup> and Y
 <sub>0</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> ions [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
