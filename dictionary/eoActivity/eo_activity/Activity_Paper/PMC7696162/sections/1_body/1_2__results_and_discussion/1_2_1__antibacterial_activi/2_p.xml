<p>The calculated relative inhibition zone diameter (RIZD) values of the test samples against the MRSA strains varied from 70.99% to 171.43%, as shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01539-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The RIZD value provides additional information showing the differential effects of the test extracts and fractions compared to the standard antibiotic used as a positive control. An RIZD value &gt;100% means that the tested extract is more effective than the antibiotic. The leaf EtOAc fraction demonstrated the highest RIZD values, ranging from 125.85% to 171.43% against all MRSA strains. The higher RIZD percentages demonstrated by the leaf EtOAc fraction are a good indication that the leaf of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> contained most, and probably in higher amounts, of the antibacterial compounds of this plant species. It is worthy of note that the local population frequently uses the leaf material for medicinal purposes [
