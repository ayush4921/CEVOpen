<p>Besides MIC and MBC values, the antibacterial activity against the MRSA strains was also determined based on the total activity of the extracts and fractions. Total activity is defined as the volume to which the biologically active component (extracts, fractions or compounds) present in 1 g of dried plant material can be diluted and still kill the bacteria [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01539" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Total activity is useful for the selection of sample material for isolating bioactive compounds. Extracts or fractions with large total activity values are considered the best material for isolating potentially bioactive compounds. As shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01539-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the total activity values of the extracts and fractions of 
 <italic>A. pavarii</italic> leaf and stem bark demonstrated high variation. The leaf methanolic extract diluted in 4007.60 mL of solvent can still inhibit the growth of MRSA ATCC 700699 (total activity: 4007.60 mL/g). The leaf n-BuOH fraction possessed higher total activity against MRSA ATCC 700699, with a value of 2235.89 mL/g. The leaf EtOAc fraction has higher total activity against MRSA2 and MRSA ATCC 700699, with 2158.97 and 1078.10 mL/g values, respectively. Both the extract and fractions of the stem bark exhibited lower total activity against all the tested MRSA strains as compared to leaf, with values ranging from 54.22 to 452.35.
