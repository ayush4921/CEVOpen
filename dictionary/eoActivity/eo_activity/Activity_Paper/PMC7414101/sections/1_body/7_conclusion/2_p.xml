<p id="p0200">Sennoside A was extracted from senna leaves extract and endeavoring as a reducing agent to the fabrication of Ag/sennoside A at room temperature. UVâ€“visible data indicates that the optical properties of resulting NPs were dominated by the sennoside A, which formed J-type of aggregates. The controlled morphology of Ag/sennoside A NPs are presented by adjusting the concentration ratio of silver ions to sennoside A in presence of CTAB. The sennoside A and Ag/sennoside A NPs exhibited excellent inhibitory effect against

 <italic>E. coil,</italic> and candida fungus (albicans ATCC 10231 and parapsilosis ATCC 22019), which might be due to the synergistic effect of both metallic silver and sennoside A. Hydrolysis experiments were performed for the isolation of rhein-9-anthrone from sennoside A in alkaline medium. The rhein-9-anthrone was also exhibited antibacterial and antifungal activities against human pathogens. These studies increase the use of sennoside A capped AgNPs and rhein-9-anthrone for the treatment of digestive disorder and anthropoids infection in colon ulcer.
