Generally, surfactant, polymer, carbohydrates, proteins, copolymer, lipids, natural plants extract were used as a capping agent. Out of these, an aqueous plant extract have superiority over the other stabilizers. The constituents of extract such as, water soluble biomolecules, flavonoids, glycosides, tannic acid, polyhydroxy phenols, betanin and others acted as a reducing and stabilizing agent. They eliminate the necessity of the externally added toxic stabilizer (
