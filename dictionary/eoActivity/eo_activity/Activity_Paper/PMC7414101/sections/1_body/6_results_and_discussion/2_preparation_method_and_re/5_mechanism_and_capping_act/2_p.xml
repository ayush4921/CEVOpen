<p id="p0100">Sennoside A has various –OH groups such phenolic –OH, primary and secondary –OH of glucose. In order to establish the role of glucose –OH groups, some kinetic runs were performed by using glucose as a reducing agent instead of sennoside A. In a typical experiment, glucose (5.0 ml of 0.01 mol/L) added in a reaction vessel containing Ag
 <sup>+</sup> (5.0 ml of 0.01 mol/L), CTAB (5 ml of 0.01 mol/L) and water (25 ml) for dilution. We did not notice the appearance of any yellow to brown color within a short reaction time, i.e., 30 min, whereas, an absorption peak develops at 396 nm just after the mixing of sennosideA into the mixture of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> and CTAB (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). Thus phenolic –OH group of sennoside A are responsible for the fast reduction of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> into Ag
 <sup>0</sup>. Thus, 
 <xref rid="f0065" ref-type="fig">Scheme 3</xref> mechanism is proposed for the reduction of Ag
 <sup>+</sup> by phenolic –OH group of sennoside A.
