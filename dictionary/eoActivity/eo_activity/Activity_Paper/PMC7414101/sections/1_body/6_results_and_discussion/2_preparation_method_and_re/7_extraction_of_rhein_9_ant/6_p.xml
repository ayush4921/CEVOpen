 <xref rid="f0090" ref-type="fig">Scheme 8</xref>, Eq. (8) represents the protonation of glycosidic bond of sennoside A. In the next step (rate determining step; Eq. (9)), glycosidic bonds were broken and rhein-9-anthrone was formed along with the unstable corresponding carbocation, which rapidly converted into the stable product, i.e., D-glucose (Eq. (10)).
