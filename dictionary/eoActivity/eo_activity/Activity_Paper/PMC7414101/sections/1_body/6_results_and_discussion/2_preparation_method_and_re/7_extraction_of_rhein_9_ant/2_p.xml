<p id="p0140">The rhein-9-anthrone was formed through bacterial degradation of sennosides A in the colon (
 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Sasaki, et al., 1979</xref>). Sennoside A, anthraquinone glycoside is water soluble due to the presence two β-D-glucopyranosyloxy groups. Borntrager’s reaction was used for the extraction of rhein-9-anthrone from sennoside A. In a typical experiment, 0.1 g of sennoside A was dissolved in 20 ml double distilled water. Standard HCl (5 ml of 2 M) was added to the as prepared sennoside A extract. To the complete hydrolysis of glycoside linkage, the solution was heated on boiling water bath for 30 min, cooled at room temperature and filtered. The 10 ml CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> was added to the filtrate and shaken. The lower CHCl
 <sub>3</sub> layer was separated and treated with 10% KOH solution. Finally, the upper aqueous layer became red (λ
 <sub>max</sub> = 514 nm;
