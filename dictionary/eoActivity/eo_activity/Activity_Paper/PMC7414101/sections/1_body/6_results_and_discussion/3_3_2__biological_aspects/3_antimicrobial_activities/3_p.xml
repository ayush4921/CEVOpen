The sizes of the zones inhibition were calculated produced by AgNPs for anti-bacterial S. aureus against gentamicin ranged from 7, 10, 15, 18, 20 and 24 mm for [AgNPs] = 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0, 12.0 and 15.0 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> mol/L, respectively. For antifungal activities, the zones of inhibition were found to be 5, 8, 14, 16, 20, and 22 mm for [AgNPs] = 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5 and 6.5 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> mol/L, respectively. These findings indicated that the diameter of zone inhibition increases with increasing AgNPs concentrations. 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> clearly showed that the inhibition zone diameter produced by AgNPs is higher than that of sennoside A, indicating the combined effect of sennoside A and AgNPs were responsible for higher zone of inhibition and larger surface area.
