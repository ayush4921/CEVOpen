<p id="p0120">The polydispersity index (PDI), which represents the distribution size population within a given sample and used for the acceptability of the AgNPs for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications such as antibacterial and antifungal (
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Raj et al., 2018</xref>). The numerical values PDI were ranges from 0 to 1.0 for a uniform mono-dispersed distribution and highly poly-dispersed particle size population. The hydrodynamic size distribution (z-average-size) and PDI of as prepared AgNPs were determined and found to be 18.2Â nm and 0.6, respectively, indicating higher poly-dispersed.
