<p id="p0195">Scientific literature contained abundant reports regarding the green synthesis of AgNPs by using an aqueous extract of natural plants under different reaction conditions. The morphology of AgNPs strongly depends on the capping nature of biomolecules present in the extract. Some of the reports are summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Natural plants (leafs, roots, flowers and seeds) were used as a drug to the treatment of human diseases. In the present study, we used sennoside A, extracted from senna leaves (sana makki, valuable herbs of 
 <italic>Tibb-e-Nabwi</italic>, and approved by the Food and Drug Administration as an over-the-counter laxative) extract for the synthesis of AgNPs for the first time. These finding implies that the sennoside A assisted preparation of AgNPs could be an ideal strategy to combat infectious diseases.
