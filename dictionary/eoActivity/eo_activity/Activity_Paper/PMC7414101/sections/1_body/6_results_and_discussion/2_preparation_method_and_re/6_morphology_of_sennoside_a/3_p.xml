The zeta potential values were found to be −10 mV and −25 mV, respectively, for freshly prepared Ag/Sennoside A and CTAB capped Ag/Sennoside A, which indicating that the CTAB acted as a good stabilizing agent and provides higher stability to the resulting NPs (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Bakshi, 2018</xref>). The stability of as prepared AgNPs were determined by recording the change in zeta potential for 7 days. The results of (ζ) versus time were plotted in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, which indicates the CTAB capped Ag/Sennoside A NPs are more stable than that of Ag/Sennoside A NPs. The negative charges might be due to the adsorption of Sennoside A on the surface of formed AgNPs (
