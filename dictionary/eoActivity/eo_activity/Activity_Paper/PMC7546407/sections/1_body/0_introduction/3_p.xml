<p>In recent years, due to the increasing wild resources of TDG have been over exploited, resulting in a phenomenon of mixed use of drugs with similar appearance and similar efficacy on the market. Therefore, on the basis of reviewing relevant literature at home and abroad, this paper systematically summarizes the botany, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, quality control, and clinical application of TDG. The aim is to provide valuable reference for the future development and the application of TDG.</p>
