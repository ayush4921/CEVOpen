<p>The emerging DNA-based techniques, such as inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS), and the internal transcribed spacer region II (ITS2) barcode have been used to distinguish TDG (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al., 2016b</xref>). These methods are not suitable for the rapid identification of TDG, as they are not only complicated, time-consuming, but also expensive. In view of these disadvantages, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Peng et al. (2016d)</xref> use the DNA mimic enzyme method to visually compares the true and the fake of TDG with the method of DNA mimic enzyme, to ensure the safety of clinical application of TDG. In addition, highly sensitive technologies are applied to the control the quality of traditional Chinese medicine, for example, the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with diode array detector (DAD) method (HPLC–DAD), ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem triple four bar mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and infrared spectroscopy (IR), and so on. 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al. (2019)</xref> study the relationship between genetic and chemical diversity of TDG based on ISSR and UHPLC. They analyze the genetic differentiation of 32 wild TDG varieties with ISSR markers and determine the content of eight phenols in the leaves of these germplasms with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC), as well as their antioxidant activities. The results suggest that the analyzed phenolics are likely the antioxidant ingredients, and the close relationships between genetic structure and UHPLC fingerprint patterns (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9928 for genetic distance and UHPLC fingerprint). 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Fu C. et al. (2017)</xref> use Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy in combination with stoichiometric modeling techniques to quickly and effectively determine TDG and some differences, lower values, and organizational effect specifications. A kernel density estimation (KDE) based supervised discrimination method, INBC-CFSFDP is proposed. The method consists of sections: INBC is used to distinguish between known and unknown samples in the training database, and CFSFDP further distinguishes the internal classification of unknown samples. INBC and CFSFDP are combined to rapidly and effectively identify the TDG by the near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) from varied geographical regions. (
