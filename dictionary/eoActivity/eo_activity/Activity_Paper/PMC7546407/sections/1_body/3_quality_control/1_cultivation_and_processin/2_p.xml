<p>Processing is a common step in TCM treatment of medicinal materials, which can improve the effectiveness of clinical medication. However, different processing methods may bring different effects, such as reducing toxicity, improving efficacy, changing drug performance, reducing irritation, and other results. Therefore, TDG should be processed in order to improve medicinal effect. Its traditional processing methods mainly include low temperature drying into powder, hot air drying after slicing, and decoction as soup, especially the latter two methods which are related to temperature. In the process of operation, it is easy to find the loss of effective ingredients, and at the same time, there are differences in different parts of the medicinal materials. Therefore, the related research aims at the above-mentioned problems and takes some measures to maximize the retention of active ingredients. For example: developing a highly active oral TDG micropowder, using different processing methods for the active ingredients contained in different parts, making medicine power into granules (
