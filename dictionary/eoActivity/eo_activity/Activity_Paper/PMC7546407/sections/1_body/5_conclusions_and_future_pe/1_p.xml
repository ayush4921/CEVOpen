<p>This review summarizes the knowledge of TDG in phytochemistry, pharmacology, quality control, and clinical application in recent years. As the root tuber of TDG can be extremely used as a medicine, wherefore the studies become more and more. However, the focus gradually shifts to the leaves of TDG, and TDG also shares many similar pharmacological activities. Pharmacological researches show that TDG possesses includes many pharmacological effects, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, and antioxidant. In addition, TDG is beneficial for lowering blood glucose and reducing blood lipids, and can also effectively treat vascular diseases. Many researchers carry out an exploration in the anti-tumor activity of TDG, briefly, mainly inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and inducing cell apoptosis through various pathways. However, the basis of anti-tumor effect of TDG is unclear. TDG is believed to have better effect of liver-protecting which is often used clinically to treat liver diseases, but the underlying mechanism of action and the relationship between chemicals and pharmacological activities should be further studied. In terms of quality control, there is lack of a complete evaluation system. Besides, the main components of content determination are flavonoids, with few studies on the content determination of other components. Furthermore, the relevant animal models had been established to verify that the clinical application of TDG is safe so that it can be taken for a long time. Simultaneously, the results of ames test, micronucleus test of bone marrow cells, and sperm deformity test of mice were negative, which proved that TDG had no mutagenicity (

 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al. (2006)</xref> had carried out an acute toxicity test, and the results showed that the maximum tolerated dose of intragastric administration in mice could reach 80 g/kg body weight, which is equivalent to 445 times of the daily clinical dosage of human beings. The above studies fully proved that TDG was safe under the clinical dose. The finding may greatly helpful to advance TDG into clinical practice. On the other hand, it had been reported that 33 compounds were found in plasma and urine after oral administration of TDG, mainly flavonoids. It speculated that the main metabolic reactions may be glucuronidation, sulfation, deglycosylation, and methylation in the body (

However, there were few researches about pharmacokinetics so that we need more to understand the complex components of TDG’s metabolism in the body, and clarified the effective ingredients, which was conducive to improving the clinical application value of TDG.
