<p>According to the existing literature, the extract of TDG also has important pharmacological activity in terms of anti-virus. The four extracts of TDG exert inhibitory effect on hepatitis B virus (HBV), especially the ethyl acetate part, so this extract can significantly reduce the level of DNA replication of HBV in serum (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Yang and Wu, 2009</xref>). These extracts have been found to possess certain inhibitory effects on different HIV-1 virus strains 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the mechanism of action is unclear (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Dong and Li, 2016</xref>). Pr8-ns1-gluc method is established for quantitative analysis of 10 compounds in 18 batches of gastrodia eluga, and HPLC-MS method and pr8-ns1-gluc method are used to detect the biological activity of the above samples against influenza virus. As a result, it is shown that the content of chemical components of TDG varies with the change of producing area, with the antiviral activity of different batches changing accordingly, as well as the antiviral activity of different batches altering as well. Among those chemical compositions, eight flavonoids are positively correlated with anti-H1N1 virus activity (
