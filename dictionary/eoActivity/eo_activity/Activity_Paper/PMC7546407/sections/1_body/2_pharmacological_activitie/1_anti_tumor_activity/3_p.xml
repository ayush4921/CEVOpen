<p>TDG has complex chemical components, mainly flavonoids and phenolic acids. Current researches on the anti-tumor effect of TDG have focused on aspects of the respiratory system, digestive system, reproductive system, and so on. In the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with different lung cancer cells (A549 cells and A431 cells), the total flavonoids of TDG can inhibit the proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells, and its mechanism of action involves the Bcl-2 family proteins, Caspase family proteins, MAPK pathway, and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Besides, the total flavonoids of TDG can markedly inhibit the metastasis and invasion of tumor cells, with migration and invasion being associated with the activation of MMPs and TIMPs proteins (
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">Zhong et al., 2019</xref>). The above studies indicate that the total flavonoids of TDG has a very good therapeutic effect on lung cancer at the cellular level. The miRNA profile of A549 cells treated with total flavones of TDG is established, and the change of miRNA expression profile is determined by using miRNA-seq analysis. As a result, 162 miRNAs have been identified to display expression changes &gt;1.2-fold in RTHF-treated A549 cells. On the basis of the above research, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Liu P. et al. (2019)</xref> also find that miR-4792 may be involved in the inhibition of A549 cell proliferation and metastasis mediated by total flavones of TDG. Meanwhile, total flavones of TDG is to down-regulate the overexpression of miRNA in cancer, and also up-regulate the expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs. In addition, according to experimental results, total flavonoids of TDG can induce cell apoptosis by modulating some apoptotic-related proteins. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al. (2006)</xref> find in SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells that total flavones of TDG inhibit tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis by down-regulating MMP-2 expression. A study shows that total flavonoids of TDG can inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells treated by PGE2, and also offset activator of EP2 receptor-induced proliferation of HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, the mRNA expression and protein expression associated with the COX-2-Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway are changed by the methods of PCR and Western Blot. The total flavonoids of TDG can promote the apoptosis of HepG2 cells through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and have a positive correlation with the drug concentration (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). A similar study exhibits that the total flavonoids of TDG may inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activation, thereby inhibiting multiple malignant biological behaviors of colorectal cancer (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the total flavonoids of TDG can also dose dependently induce cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition process (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al. (2019)</xref> find that the total flavones of TDG can inhibit the proliferation of different breast cancer cells, which may be induced by apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of Caspase-3. And they can inhibit cell proliferation in MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells by inhibiting the expression of p-p42/44 and blocking the MAPK signaling pathway. Previous studies have suggested that aberrant activation of hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and its receptor, Met, is involved in the development and progression of many human cancers. A flavonoid from the root of TDG, Isoquercitrin (quercetin3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside), and find that inhibits (HGF/SF met) signaling by decreasing the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation in human cancers (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">Xia et al., 2018</xref>), but the specific mode of action is not clear. In another study, Isoquercetin is obtained by selective enzymatic derhamnosylation of rutin using recombinant a-L-rhamnosidase from 
 <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic>, and the mechanism of its effect on human ovarian cancer cells is analyzed. After treatment with Isoquercetin, it can inhibit the production of SOD in the cell, and the concentration cannot be too high, otherwise it would have an adverse effect. These findings prove that the protective effect of Isoquercetin on ovarian cancer cells may be mediated through the antioxidant pathway (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Michalcova et al., 2019</xref>). Some studies have shown that the anti-tumor activity of TDG may be associated with the suppression of immune-related factors. Further research shows that TDG flavonoids can dramatically reduce the serum levels of TGF-β, PGE2, and cyclooxygenase-2 in tumor bearing mice, thus hindering the development of regulatory T cells (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2014a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2014b</xref>). There are many phenolic compounds in the roots of TDG. 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al. (2017a)</xref> purify solid 80% methanol crude extracts to obtain total phenol extracts and flavonoid extracts by solid-state extraction, and identifies and determines 24 individual phenolics in the extract 
 <italic>via</italic> chemical analysis, as well as investigating their anti-tumor effect in H22 tumor-bearing mice. The test results can show that the content of the semi-purified extract is higher than that of the crude extract. In addition, the extract increases the production of cytokines (TNF-α and IL-2) in the serum, the CD4/CD8
 <sup>+</sup> ratio and the level of NK cells, while regulating the expression of related proteases, as well as inhibiting the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These studies indicate that solid-state extraction technology can better retain effective ingredients, and the anti-tumor mechanism of TDG extract may be related to induction of apoptosis, inhibition of angiogenesis, immune function, and antioxidant activity. Most of the above studies focus on the underground part of TDG, and the research on the aerial part of TDG has also made some progress. 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Sun C. et al., (2018)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Sun Y. et al. (2018)</xref> study the phenolic acid components contained in TDG leaves extract with LC-QTOF-MS/LC-QqQ-MS techniques, and discovers that the main phenolic components are apigenin and luteolin glycosides, while exploring TDG extract anti-hepatic cancer mechanism. Experiments indicate that TDG leaves extract inhibits growth and induces apoptosis of liver cancer cells through the internal mitochondrial signaling pathway and the external death receptor signaling pathway 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Sun (2018)</xref>. The above researches strongly prove that TDG has its unique advantages in anti-tumor function, so it has a broader prospect to develop and utilize the anti-tumor medicinal value TDG. However, the structure-activity relationship between active ingredients and anti-tumor activity, as well as the metabolism of active ingredients 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been understood so far.
