<p>TDG can be used in the composition of anti-tumor prescriptions because of its remarkable capacity to anti-tumor in the clinical areas. In this respect, 120 cases of malignant tumors were treated with Jinqi tablet, which was mainly composed of TDG, Astragalus membranaceus, and Ginsenoside. It is shown that 94 cases got partial responses, and the total effective rate was 78.33% (

Moreover, Zhonggan Mixture and Jinsidijia capsule, consisting of active pharmaceutical ingredients from TDG, have been clinically found to remarkably ameliorate the quality of daily activities of patients with advanced hepatic carcinoma and prolong life (

Furthermore, clinical study is carried out to find that the pathological complete response rates of 55 patients with triple negative breast cancer (abbreviated as TNBC) in the treatment group (given with a prescription containing TDG) was significantly better than that of 52 patients in the control group after different chemotherapy methods, which proved that the prescription based on TDG was effective to improve the pathological complete response rates of TNBC neoadjuvant chemotherapy (

The above-mentioned clinical practice shows that TDG has a certain therapeutic effect on tumors, so it is worthy of further clinical verification. The efficacy of clearing away heat and detoxification, eliminating stasis in TDG have been firmly general accepted in Chinese since ancient times. Such as 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Liu (1997)</xref> used Sanye qingyin to treat 80 children with exogenous fever, and 41 cases were cured after treatment with a total effective rate of 93.75%. Similar to the above results, 72 cases of children with exogenous fever were treated by Sanyeqing Shigao decoction, and the total effective rate reached 94.4% (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Xu, 2006</xref>). Both clinical trials all gave evidence that TDG possessed more efficient on children with high fever. Finally, studies had reported that TDG had a good therapeutic effect on other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, mosquito bites, anal fissures and bleeding, leucorrhea, and so on. However, the well-designed clinical trials are absence, and continuous effort should be carried out for getting more reliable clinical data.
