<p id="p0085">From XRD it was evaluated that BM exhibits crystalline nature with prominent peaks (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The grain size corresponding to intense peak was determined using Scherrer's relation [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and found that the average particles size is 15.72 nm. (See
