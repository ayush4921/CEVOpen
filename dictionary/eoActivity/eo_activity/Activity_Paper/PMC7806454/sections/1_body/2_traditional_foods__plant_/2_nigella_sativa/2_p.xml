 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> (
 <italic>N. sativa</italic>) L. (Ranunculaceae) is an indigenous nutrient-rich herbaceous plant found around the world. The plant has various recognition in different languages e.g., black cumin, black seed, black-caraway (English), Habbah Al-Sauda, seed of blessing (Arabic), chernushka (Russian), çörekotu (Turkish), and Cyah-daneh in Persian (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> has attracted the attention of many healers in ancient civilizations and researchers in recent times. Since ancient times, it is used in different forms to treat illness, including asthma, hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, cough, bronchitis, headache, eczema, fever, dizziness, and influenza (

 <italic>N. sativa</italic> possess differential efficacy, including antiviral effects (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Past studies have revealed that Thymoquinone (TQ) is the most prominent constituent of its seeds and since 1960, approximately 406 research reports have been published on the ‘Pub Med’ database regarding TQ (

 <italic>N. sativa,</italic> particularly TQ, enhances immune-modulatory effects by boosting humoral immune system and induced the expression of cytokines, which lead to early viral clearance (

Recently, it was reported that the TQ analogues, (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) might be effective therapeutic drugs for treating world pandemic COVID-19 (
