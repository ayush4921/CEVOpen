<p id="p0010">Many different viruses can infect respiratory tract, a disease known as viral respiratory infection, which is now considering one of the life threatening diseases leading to a significant morbidity and mortality all over the World (
 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The most common viruses have the capacity to spread from person to person, therefore, people living in developing or developed countries are scared about the devastating infectious diseases due to their fast transmission. Researchers all over the world are facing a real challenge to prevent or treat them owing to some reasons such as simple alteration, high spread capacity, resistant viral pathogens, appearance of new viral strains, and the incompetence of antibiotics (

Currently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by newly discovered coronavirus (CoVs) and making serious health problems worldwide. The virus belongs to the family, Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales, having four subgroups, including

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). It is evident that CoVs are a group of highly contagious, positive-sense viruses with single-strand RNA genome that causes deadly diseases by affecting respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic systems (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). Primarily, they caused enzootic infections to their hosts, such as bat/civet and dromedary; however, they caused a major outbreak to humans in the last century (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al., 2005</xref>). Two coronaviruses, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in 2002 and 2012 which led to 10% and 35% mortality rate, respectively. It was reported that CoVs can cross their species barriers, which made a serious threat to humans(
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Schoeman and Fielding, 2019</xref>). To date, no effective therapeutic regimens or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of COVID-19. The first Wuhan Viral Pneumonia cases were reported in China in late December 2019. Later WHO has declared the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has named the resultant disease as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) (
 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib103" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). The report shows that human to human transmission is confirmed among close contacts (within 6 ft distance) due to its massive spreading capability (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Like SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 also belongs to the β-coronavirus family. The high throughput sequencing of virus genome has revealed that COVID-19 possesses positive single strand RNA genome structure that is highly homologous to SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV genome (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). A recently published report claims that COVID-19 has shown more than 82% similarity to those of the SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). The common symptoms of COVID-19 include respiratory syndromes, fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and dyspnea, which are very identical to that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected cases. In severe cases, the diseases cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. People of all ages with weak immune systems or certain diseases (diabetes, CVD, kidney disease, asthma, lung disease, and so on) are at high risk and experiencing death to COVID-19 pandemic (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). This virus has raised a global concern due to its high transmission capability with high mobility and mortality rate. It has been accounted that a vast number of infected patients were over the age of sixty years with major figures in male suggests that they are immune incompetent. Besides, the people who expired of SARS-CoV-2 were previously distressing from some other health troubles (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), which evidently points out that a hale and hearty immune system and general good health are vital for reducing the risk factors connected with COVID-19 and for rising the probability of survival and healing. Furthermore, good physical immune systems assist the host to manage and avert some pathogenic illnesses (
