<p>Overall, there is a convincing body of evidence to suggest that halogenated derivatives of natural product scaffolds could be a rich source of improved or entirely novel pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the site-specific introduction of halogens can facilitate production of a near-infinite number of other derivatives via cross-coupling reactions (

While achieving the site selective halogenation required for this has been historically difficult, the integration of halogenases or derivatized feedstocks into natural product biosynthetic pathways is beginning to open these exciting regions of chemical space.
