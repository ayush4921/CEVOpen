<p>The well-documented effects of halogen atoms on the ligand binding and pharmacokinetic properties of pharmaceuticals present a tantalizing prospect of new or improved pharmaceuticals being created by introducing halogens into these classes of already bioactive compounds. This field remains in its infancy, but the number of studies reporting microbial synthesis of new-to-nature variants of medicinal plant alkaloids is growing. This section will review the progress made toward microbial synthesis of halogenated and other new-to-nature MIA and BIA variants, and describe protein engineering efforts predating microbial refactoring that can be integrated into emerging microbial strains. While this review will focus on MIAs and BIAs, the work performed to assess and engineer derivative turnover of these pathways provides an effective template that should be possible to emulate with other plant medicinal alkaloids (
