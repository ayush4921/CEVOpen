<p>MIA biosynthetic pathways have been popular testbeds, both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, for the biosynthesis of new-to-nature derivatives of plant medicinal alkaloids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). An early 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, in which chemically synthesized tryptamines with substitutions on the indole ring were fed to 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> hairy root cultures or seedlings, observed production of fluorinated serpentine and ajmalicine, two “late-stage” MIA compounds with demonstrated pharmaceutical activities (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Mccoy and O’connor, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the authors speculated that fluorinated analogs could be widely incorporated into MIAs with minimal engineering effort due to the small size of fluorine. In another seminal study, two tryptophan halogenases (RebH and PyrH) were expressed in 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> and 
 <italic>de novo</italic> production of 12-chloro-19,20-dihydroakuamicine, 10-chloroajmalicine, 15-chlorotabersonine, and 12-bromo-19,20-Dihydroakuammicine was observed (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">Runguphan et al., 2010</xref>). Detection of multiple “late-stage” MIA variants indicates an encouraging level of native promiscuity. However, it was observed that production of MIAs required expression of a previously identified promiscuous STR mutant (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bernhardt et al., 2007</xref>) and, interestingly, that the halogenated substrates shifted the major MIA products, most likely due to promiscuity differences forcing substrate flux into different branches (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Bernhardt et al., 2007</xref>). It was further noted that accumulation of chlorotryptophan occurred, suggesting that the native tryptophan decarboxylase does not well tolerate substrate derivatives. The group were able to circumnavigate this in a follow up study in which one of the halogenases was engineered to target tryptamine instead of tryptophan (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Glenn et al., 2011</xref>). This strategy may also greatly simplify separation of halogenated and unhalogenated MIAs, which would not be possible by targeting tryptophan as complete halogenation of this proteogenic amino acid would be toxic.
