<p>BIAs are an important class of specialized plant metabolites that include the antimicrobials berberine and sanguinarine as well as the opiate analgesics (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Hagel and Facchini, 2013</xref>). Several semi-synthetic opiate analogs are widely used and are found on the WHO list of essential medicines (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organisation Model Lists of Essential Medicines, 2019</xref>). In higher plants, all known BIAs share a common precursor, (S)-norcoclaurine, which is the product of the first committed step in the pathway. (S)-norcoclaurine is synthesized via the norcoclaurine synthase (NCS)-catalyzed Pictet–Spengler condensation of two tyrosine derivatives (4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA and dopamine) (

This enzyme has been found to accept a variety of electron rich, electron deficient and polyfunctionalized analogs of the aldehyde 4-HPAA, including fluorine-containing (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Lichman et al., 2017</xref>) but excluding α-substituted aldehydes. This can be rationalized through analysis of the relatively shallow active site in which the R-group is partially solvent-exposed, while the α-carbon is more deeply buried (
