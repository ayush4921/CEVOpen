<p>The recent acceleration of refactoring elements of plant metabolism in microorganisms, discussed above, is creating an unprecedented resource of plant alkaloid pathways in a context more amenable their engineering. Such engineering efforts can be used to improve the pathway turnover of complex intermediate derivatives, thereby allowing researchers to produce previously inaccessible classes of compounds that can be screened for therapeutic potential. It is therefore timely to bring together these refactoring efforts and the studies reporting parts that can be integrated into future cell factories optimized for producing alkaloid derivatives. While there is a near infinite number of possible natural product derivatives, this review will first focus on the introduction of halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine) into natural product scaffolds, using the MIA and BIA pathways as test cases (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in planta</italic> studies have characterized the turnover of halogenated intermediates and developed parts relevant to achieving this goal. These will be reviewed with respect to the pathway sections that have been refactored in yeast. Finally, how such strains would represent an unprecedented opportunity to develop semi-synthetic medicinal chemistry campaigns that probe entirely new regions of chemical space will be discussed (
