<p id="Par59">The most active phytoconstituents, i.e., flavonoids and cardiac glycosides, when tested against the 34 drug resistant clinical isolates of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp. (CRIRS1–22) (Group 1) as well as MRSA (DSECI01–12) (Group 2) and an 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> sp., showed a significant antimicrobial potential with overall Inhibition Zone (IZ) ranging from 12.33–28.33 mm (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Among the two phytoconstituents, flavonoids showed the highest and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against the 33 out of total 34 clinical isolates, with IZ ranging from 14.66–28.33 mm, while Cardiac glycosides were active only against 14 out of total 34 clinical isolates with an IZ range of 12.33–17.33 mm. This difference in the antimicrobial efficacy of the two phytoconstituents was found to be statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05), as revealed by one way ANOVA followed by Post hoc Tukey’s t-test (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).
