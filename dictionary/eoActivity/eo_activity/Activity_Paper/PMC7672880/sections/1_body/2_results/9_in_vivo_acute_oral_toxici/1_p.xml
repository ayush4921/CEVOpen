<p id="Par64">The flavonoids, further tested for their toxicity in mice, did not show any toxic effects during the whole experimentation period as evident by the normal behavior and sleep patterns, salivation, breathing rate as well as the absence of any abnormalities on the skin, fur, eyes etc. No significant difference was seen between the weights of the tested (6/6) and the control (untreated) group (6/6) (Fig.A5 in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The weight of the vital organs obtained from each test group (6/6) showed no statistical difference from the control group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The kidney and liver functioning remained normal in the test group (6/6) was completely normal since no statistical difference was seen between the various kidney and liver-functioning parameters of the treated and control groups of both male and female mice (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Further, the general and histopathological evaluation showed normal color, texture, architectural details and structural organization of the three organs under study (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
