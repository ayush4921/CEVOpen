<p id="Par56">The flavonoids and cardiac glycosides effectively inhibited the attachment of the planktonic cells of these organisms (Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Flavonoids (% Inhibition: 61.01–69.33%) were found to be more active than cardiac glycosides (% Inhibition: 61.64–66.66%) against the tested organisms. The maximum % inhibition was seen against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> 1. The inhibitory potential of phytoconstituents was in close proximity to the respective antibiotics (gentamicin and amphotericin B) (Fig.
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). This inhibitory effect was statistically compared, where the inhibitory potential of the phytoconstituents and the standard antibiotics was statistically different (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) against all the four test organisms, as revealed by One way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s t-test. The individual effect of phytoconstituents and antibiotics on the four test organisms was statistically variable and significant, however, the inhibitory effect of flavonoids and cardiac glycosides against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 1; antibiotic (gentamicin) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 1 did not show any statistical difference (
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).
