<p id="Par57">The test preparations exhibited varying efficacy towards the pre-formed biofilms of the test organisms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Flavonoids were more effective to disrupt the pre-formed biofilms than the cardiac glycosides. In case of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, the inhibitory potential of flavonoids (61.85%) and cardiac glycosides (57.73%) was comparable to amphotericin B (65.97%), though the values showed statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05)
 <italic>.</italic> The inhibitory potential of the phytoconstituents and the standard antibiotics was statistically different (p ≤ 0.05) against all the four test organisms, as revealed by One way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s t-test, except for the inhibitory effect of flavonoids and cardiac glycosides against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> 1. The individual effect of phytoconstituents and antibiotics on the four test organisms was statistically variable and significant, however, the inhibitory effect of flavonoids against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>; antibiotic (gentamicin) against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> did not show any statistical difference (p ≥ 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b).
