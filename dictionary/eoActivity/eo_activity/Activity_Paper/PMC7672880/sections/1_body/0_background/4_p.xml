 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the present study has thus been further extended to evaluate the best organic solvent and hence the major groups of bioactive phytoconstituents. The organic extract and active phytoconstituents have been tested for their various bioactivities such as antimicrobial [Post Antibiotic Effect, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration studies and Time Kill Assay; antimicrobial efficacy against drug resistant clinical isolates; anti-biofilm activity] and anti-proliferative action against the cancerous cell lines (RD, L20B, Hep2) and normal cell line (Vero). The biosafety of all the test preparations was evaluated by Ames test and MTT assay. The in vivo biosafety of the flavonoids [at a single dose (5000 mg/kg)] has also been determined by acute oral toxicity assay using 8–10 weeks old Swiss albino mice (males and females) (Body weight: 25 g to 35 g) [
