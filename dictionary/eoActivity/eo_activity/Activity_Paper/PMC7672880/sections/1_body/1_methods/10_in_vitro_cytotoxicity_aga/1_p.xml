<p id="Par40">The flavonoids was studied for their activity against the three cell lines obtained from Central Research Institute (C.R.I), Kasauli (H.P.), India by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay as described previously [

Two fold serial dilutions (10 mg/mL to 0.039 mg/mL) were prepared from a stock (10 mg/mL), where the untreated cells (containing only diluent, i.e., 30% DMSO) were taken as control. The percent growth inhibition was calculated with respect to untreated control. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the flavonoids against the tested cancerous cell lines was deduced from the resultant graphs obtained.
