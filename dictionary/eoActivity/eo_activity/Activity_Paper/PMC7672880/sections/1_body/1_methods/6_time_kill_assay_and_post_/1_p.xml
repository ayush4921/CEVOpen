 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] at their respective stock concentrations as mentioned above. The test preparation was mixed with the 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> diluted inoculum of the test organism in the ratio 1:1. The inoculum containing only diluent was used as control. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C (bacterial cultures) and 25 °C (yeast strains). The 100 μL aliquot was plated on respective medium every 2 h upto 24 h. The mean number of colonies was counted for both test and control group and the % cell viability was calculated.
