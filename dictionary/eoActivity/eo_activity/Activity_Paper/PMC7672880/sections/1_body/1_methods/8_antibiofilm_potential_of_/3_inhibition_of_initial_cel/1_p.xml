<p id="Par35">The inhibitory potential of the partially purified phytoconstituents was carried out according to Jadhav et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and Onsare and Arora [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. One hundred microlitres of flavonoids (54.75 mg/mL) and cardiac glycosides (59.5 mg/mL) were added to the 96-well microtitre plates, to which an equal volume of the cultures was then added. The plates were incubated at suitable temperature for 24 h. Gentamicin and amphotericin B were used as positive control. Following incubation, the inhibition potential was established using crystal violet assay (as described above).
