<p>The trypanocidal effect estimated in the resorufin fluorescence-tested samples was expressed as the percentage viability of a 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> culture when mixed with plant extracts relative to untreated controls (pentamidine). The result showed that at a fixed concentration of crude extracts (25 µg/mL), the parasites survived the treatment with the extracts. The viability of the parasite cultures was 96.17 ± 8.27% and 103.93 ± 13.41% in water and ethanol extracts, respectively (
