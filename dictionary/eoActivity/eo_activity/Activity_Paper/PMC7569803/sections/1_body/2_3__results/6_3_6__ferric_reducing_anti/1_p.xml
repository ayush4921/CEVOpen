<p>The reducing capacity of aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>M. pruriens</italic> and of a standard drug estimated from the ferric (II) content showed that 
 <italic>M. pruriens</italic> had a high reducing capacity although lower than that of the standard drug (rutin). The result further showed that the ferric (II) content was concentration-dependent, as it increased with a corresponding increase in the concentration (
