<p>The toxicity and potential adverse effects of synthetic drugs have created fear in the mind of the people. This concern is a major driver for the patronage of natural products [

 <italic>M. pruriens</italic> seeds, however, showed that the seeds were not toxic at 50 µg/mL, therefore suggesting that 
 <italic>M. pruriens</italic> seeds are safe for human consumption [

 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain. An increase in the concentration of the crude extracts could increase the toxicity of the extracts toward 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. This corroborates previous folk and pharmacological reports that 
 <italic>M. pruriens</italic> is a natural antimalarial remedy [

 <italic>T. brucei</italic> cultures when mixed with the plant extracts compared to viability following treatment with pentamidine, a drug administered against trypanosomiasis, is an indication that the extracts were not toxic toward 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>. This may be related to the minimal toxicity exhibited by the extracts to human cells [
