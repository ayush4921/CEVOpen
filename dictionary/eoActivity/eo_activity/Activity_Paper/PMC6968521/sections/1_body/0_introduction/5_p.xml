 </xref>. In an effort to discover novel CDKs inhibitors with high inhibition potency against both cell cycle and transcriptional CDKs, we recently started a medicinal chemistry study based on ribociclib, a latest and selective CDK4 inhibitor and performed a rational drug design. According to the researches, many sulphur atom-containing compounds have immense importance in medicinal chemistry and exhibit anticancer activity

 </xref>. Sulphur atom or isothiocyanate-containing derivatives are biologically active agents for drugs used for the treatment of cancer. We reasoned to introduce sulphur atom and isothiocyanate moiety based on pyrrolo-[2,3-d] pyrimidines-2-amine skeleton to proceed structural optimisation on R, L and linker regions (

In our study, we synthesised a series of novel compounds simultaneously mediating the cell cycle and transcription control of CDKs with high potent inhibition against solid tumour. Compound
