<p>To better assess whether 
 <bold>X22</bold> could efficiently suppress tumour growth 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, homograft tumour models were established using 4T1 cells. Oral treatment with 
 <bold>X22</bold> significantly suppressed the tumour growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>). Representative photographs of excised tumours at day 18 were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(B)</xref>. 
 <bold>X22</bold> treatment with 15 or 30 or 60 mg/kg substantially inhibited the tumour growth with tumour inhibition rates of 51.8 ± 17.5%, 65.4 ± 11.7% and 70.3 ± 4.4%, respectively. In contrast, tumour volume in ribociclib-treated group decreased slightly compared with vehicle group. Tumour growth inhibitions of 17.2 ± 5.2% were observed at doses of 60 mg/kg of ribociclib. The potencies of ribociclib are relatively weaker than those of 
 <bold>X22</bold>. The average tumour weight of excised tumours in 
 <bold>X22</bold> groups was obviously lighter than those in other groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(C)</xref>). A preliminary toxicity evaluation for 
 <bold>X22</bold> was also carried out. Mouse weights were monitored twice per week over 18 days. There was no significant difference among the five groups of mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(D)</xref>). No obvious signs of toxicity were observed in the 
 <bold>X22</bold>-treated groups, indicating that compound 
 <bold>X22</bold> is well tolerated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
