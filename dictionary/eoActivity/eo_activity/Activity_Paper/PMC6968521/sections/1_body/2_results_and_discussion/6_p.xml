<p>In view of the importance of the 
 <bold>L</bold> position and the length of the tail, we attempt to insert a methylene between the 
 <bold>L</bold> position and the phenyl leading to derivatives 
 <bold>X14</bold>–
 <bold>X23</bold> (

 <bold>X19</bold>–
 <bold>X23</bold> were proved high inhibition on all three kinases as well as no obvious difference for the enzymatic activity but 
 <bold>X23</bold>. We summarised the structure–activity relationships as shown in
