<p>Molecular docking studies were carried out to investigate the binding modes of compound 
 <bold>X22</bold>. 
 <bold>X22</bold> is a potent CDK4 and CDK9 inhibitor with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 30 and 10 nM, respectively, and also has weak inhibition activity against CDK6 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 126 nM. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A)</xref>, 
 <bold>X22</bold> binds to the ATP-binding sites of CDK6 with two key hydrogen bonds formed by aminopyrimidine and the backbone VAL101 residue, which retained the binding mode of the scaffold of ribociclib and CDK6 as reported. Given no 3D CDK4-ligand was reported, the structure of CDK6-ligand complex (PDB code: 4EZ5) was used as a template for homology modelling to generate the 3D structure of CDK4-ligand (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(B)</xref>). Importantly, two additional hydrogen bonds were formed because of the hydrophobic side chain containing isothiocyanate. The sulphur atom formed two hydrogen bonds with the backbone of ALA16 and TYR17 at the front of the ATP binding site of CDK4, respectively, which might explain the better inhibitory activity of the compound 
 <bold>X22</bold> against CDK4 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 30 nM) than CDK6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=126 nM). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(C)</xref>, the 2-aminopyrimidine formed two hydrogen bonds with the CYS106 residue of 
 <bold>X22</bold> in CDK9 (VAL101 in CDK6, VAL in CDK4). As well, the nitrogen atom formed a key hydrogen-bond with the residue of the LYS151 at the front of the ATP binding pocket. At the back of the ATP binding site, the pyrrolo-[2,3-
 <italic>d</italic>]-pyrimidine scaffold exploited the hydrophobic region close to the gatekeeper residue to form a favourable π–π interaction in all three kinases region.
