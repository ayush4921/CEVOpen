<p>We next analysed whether 
 <bold>X22</bold> treatment promoted cell apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. After 48 h incubation, 
 <bold>X22</bold> dose-dependently increased the proportion of apoptotic cells (Q2 late apoptotic and Q3 early apoptotic) in A549 cells, compared to the cells treated with DMSO or ribociclib. Similar results were also observed in MCF7 cells. 
 <bold>X22</bold> at 0.1 to 0.5 µM increased the percentages of apoptotic cells by approximately 2.2 to 3.5-fold change, compared to DMSO-treated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>). To further confirm the apoptosis induction of compound 
 <bold>X22</bold>, we examined the expression of relevant proteins by Western blot. Cells were treated with or without compound 
 <bold>X22</bold> and control for 48 h and then lysed and analysed. Given the crucial role of p53 in regulating cell apoptosis, we detected whether compound 
 <bold>X22</bold> induced apoptosis depending on the expression of p53 and its downstream targets. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(B)</xref>, 
 <bold>X22</bold> treatment remarkably increased the expressions of p53 and promoted the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15. We also demonstrated that 
 <bold>X22</bold>-induced apoptosis in solid tumour cells, which reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and enhanced expression of Bax. These findings indicated that compound 
 <bold>X22</bold>-induced apoptosis is associated with upregulating pro-apoptotic protein p53 and Bax and downregulating anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression. Collectively, 
 <bold>X22</bold> may induce cell apoptosis through p53/Bax/Bcl-2 pathway in breast and lung cancer cells.
