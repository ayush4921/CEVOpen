  <p>Representation of the predicted binding modes of compound X22 with CDKs kinase domain. X22 is shown in green. Hydrogen bonds are shown in red. (A) Proposed binding mode of compound X22 with CDK6 (PDB code: 4EZ5), CDK6 backbone is shown in light pink. (B) Proposed binding mode of compound X22 with CDK4, which employed CDK6 (PDB entry: 4EZ5) as the template for homology modelling, CDK4 backbone is shown in yellow. (C) Proposed binding mode of compound X22 with CDK9 (PDB code: 4BCF), CDK9 backbone is shown in light blue.</p>
