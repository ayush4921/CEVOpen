 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the total content of phenolics (TCP), flavonoids (TCF), and condensed tannins (CCT) of methanolic and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic>. The highest TCP, TCF, and CCT are found in the methanolic extract. The ethanolic extract, on the other hand, has slightly lower levels of TCP and TCF, while the content of CCT is extremely low. This variation in results clearly shows that the difference in polarity of the solvents influences the extraction of phenolic compounds [
