<p>The methanolic extract of the aerial part of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> has a higher DPPH antioxidant activity than both the methanolic extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> (IC50 = 1950 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and the methanolic extract of the stems of 
 <italic>T. leptobotrys</italic> (IC50 = 430 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) using the DPPH test [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, the whole aerial part of the plant is logically more active than individual leaves or stems.
