<p>The ABTS radical scavenging activity is determined by the protocol described by Nounah et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Stock solutions of 7 mM ABTS and 2.4 mM potassium persulfate (K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>) in identical volumes are kept in the dark for sixteen hours at room temperature. Prior to testing, the ABTS+ solution is diluted in methanol or ethanol to give an absorbance of 0.700 ± 0.02 at 734 nm. 2 mL of the resulting solutions is allowed to react with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the sample (2 mg/mL), and the absorbance is measured after 30 min at 734 nm. The same procedure is used with Trolox at different concentrations (from 5 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The percentage of ABTS

 </sup> inhibition by different concentrations is calculated, and the antioxidant power of the sample is represented in Trolox equivalent (mg TE/g sample). The test is performed in triplicate.
