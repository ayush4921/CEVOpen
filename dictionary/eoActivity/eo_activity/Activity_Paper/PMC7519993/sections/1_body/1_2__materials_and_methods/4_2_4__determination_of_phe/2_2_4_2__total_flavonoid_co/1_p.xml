<p>The total content of flavonoids is determined using the aluminum chloride colorimetric method [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. 0.25 mL of the extract is placed in a test tube containing 1.25 mL of distilled water, followed by the addition of 0.075 mL of sodium nitrite solution NaNO
 <sub>3</sub> (5%), and the mixture is kept at rest for 5 minutes. Then 0.15 mL of 10% aluminum chloride is added. After 6 min, 0.5 mL 1M sodium hydroxide is added. The mixture is diluted with 0.275 mL of distilled water. The final mixture is then incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature, and the absorbance is measured at 510 nm. The flavonoid content is expressed in mg of rutin equivalent (RE) per gram of extract (mg RE/g E).
