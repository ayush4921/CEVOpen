<p>Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (HepG2, SK-Hep-1) seeded in 6-well plates were treated with CT extracts and CT-SNPs (100 μg/mL) then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Afterward, cells were collected by trypsinization, washed with PBS, and suspended in the dilution buffer. Samples were then added in FITC Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) (BD Sciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The mixture was gently vortexed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (25 °C) in the dark. Thereafter, early apoptosis, late apoptosis, and necrosis levels were determined based on the intensity that was recorded on a Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter FC500, Pasadena, CA, USA).
