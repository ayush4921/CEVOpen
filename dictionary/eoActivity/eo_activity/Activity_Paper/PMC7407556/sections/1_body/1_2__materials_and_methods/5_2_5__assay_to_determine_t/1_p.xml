<p>The reducing potential of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts was determined, according to the method described by [
 <xref rid="B22-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The reducing potential was expressed as ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE) per g of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts. The absorbance was quantified at 700 nm with a spectrophotometer (Evolutionâ„¢ 300 UV-Vis, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Tulsa, OK, USA).
