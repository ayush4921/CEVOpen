<p>For the reduction of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> to SNPs, 1 mM of aqueous silver nitrate solution was mixed with CT roots (CTR; 4 mg/mL), stems (CTS; 4 mg/mL), leaves (CTL; 4 mg/mL), and fruit extracts (CTF; 4 mg/mL), respectively. The mixture was incubated at 80 Â°C for 5 min, and the color changed from light yellow to yellowish-brown after 5 min, which confirmed the formation of SNPs. The formation of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF-SNPs was detected using an Evolution 300 UV-Vis absorption Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) from 300 to 800 nm.
