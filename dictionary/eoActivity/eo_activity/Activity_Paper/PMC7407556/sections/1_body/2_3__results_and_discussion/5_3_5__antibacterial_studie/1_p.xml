<p>The field of available antibacterial antibiotics can be expanded by “green” nanotechnologies. To compare the total bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties of CT-SNPs against gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>) and gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic>) bacteria with those of the CT extract, we used the microtiter broth dilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The MIC was assessed by the visual turbidity of the plates both before, and after, incubation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and serial dilution was performed to confirm the concentration of CT-SNPs for the MBC. All CT-SNPs under investigation demonstrated outstanding concentration-dependent antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The CT-SNPs verified having the highest antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with MIC value of 3.13 to 50 μg/mL and MBC value of 6.25 to 100 μg/mL, a clear suggestion that the MIC value of 3.13 to 12.5 μg/mL and MBC value of 6.25 to 25 μg/mL obtained for CTR-and CTS-SNPs against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. enteritidis</italic> indicates exceptional antibacterial activity. The CTL-SNPs were active against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria at a concentration equal to the CTF-SNPs, with an MIC value of 25 μg/mL. Amongst the CT-SNPs investigated in the present study, CTR-SNPs seemed to have most of the great inhibitors with an interesting bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (

On the other hand, no apparent effect of CT extracts (up to 100 μg/mL) was observed for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It is generally accepted that SNPs has a strong biocidal effect against bacteria which inhibits replication of DNA, thus affecting bacterial viability [
