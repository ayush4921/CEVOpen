<p>Organic azo dyes such as MB, MO, RB, and RB5, which are commonly used as an indicator in different methodical fields, were employed [

 <xref rid="B28-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The reduction of the MB, MO, RB, and RB5 dyes using sodium borohydride was studied using sodium borohydride in the presence of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs and monitoring by UV-Vis spectrophotometer. A characteristic absorption peak was observed corresponding to pure MB, MO, RB, and RB5 at 665 nm, 464 nm, 575 nm, and 597 nm, respectively. In the presence of CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs as a catalyst, the deep blue (corresponding to MB), red-yellow (corresponding to MO), pink-red (corresponding to RB), and black-gray (corresponding to RB5) color gradually decreased and finally disappeared. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01350-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the UV-Vis spectra revealed that the addition of all the CTR-, CTS-, CTL-, and CTF-SNPs completely decreased in the wavelength of maximum absorbance within 15â€“20 min. The catalytic reduction of MB was found in following order: CTR-SNPs &gt; CTS-SNPs &gt; CTL-SNPs = CTF-SNPs (

In the presence of CTR, CTL, CTS and CTF extracts only, the intensity of the deep blue (corresponding to MB), red-yellow (corresponding to MO), pink-red (corresponding to RB), and black-gray (corresponding to RB5) color did not alteration (

The reaction between the Organic azo dye (acceptor) and sodium borohydride (donor) is related to an electron transfer reaction. The treatment of CT-SNPs having intermediate potential between acceptor and donor makes the electron transfer between Organic azo dye and sodium borohydride very facile. Prior to the degradation, Organic azo dye and sodium borohydride were adsorbed to CT-SNPs. The phytochemical capping CT-SNPs completed this process by attracting Organic azo dye and sodium borohydride towards the CT-SNPs by electrostatic interaction. The good photocatalytic properties of the CT-SNPs might be attributed to their physicochemical characteristics and their functionalization with the CT extract. Previous studies have reported that photocatalytic activity may be contingent on the size, morphology, and crystallographic structure of the SNPs [

 <xref rid="B9-nanomaterials-10-01350" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CT-SNP photocatalysts also presented the essential photocatalytic activity to the degradation MB, MO, RB, and RB5 dyes. This can be majorly attributed to the higher surface area of CT-SNPs and synergetic coordination between CT extracts and Ag.
