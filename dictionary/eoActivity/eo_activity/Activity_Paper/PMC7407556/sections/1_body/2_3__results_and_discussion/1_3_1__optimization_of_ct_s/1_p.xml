<p>To assess the potential green-synthesized medium of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts on the reduction, capsulation, and stabilization of SNPs, the CT extracts were evaluated by five widely used in vitro chemical assays, namely, total phenol content, total flavonoid content, reducing power, ABTS assay, and DPPH assay. The total phenol content of CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-10-01350-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. The highest total phenol content was found in CTR extract, while CTF extract had the lowest content. Different from the ranking order of phenol content, the highest flavonoid content was found in the CTR extract, and the lowest in the CTL extract (

The reducing power as well as the DPPH and ABTS assays were based on the single-electron transfer processes, which could explain their important correlations. The reducing power of CT extracts were in the following order: CTS &gt; CTR &gt; CTL &gt; CTF (
