<p>The activities of GSH-Px (A005), SOD (A001-1), and CAT (A007) and contents of MDA (A003-1) and NO (A013-2) in serum of treated rats were detected via corresponding kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. In brief, the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 412 nm (GSH-Px) or 550 nm (NO) by a microplate reader (M200PRO, TECAN, Switzerland); the absorbance was assessed at a wavelength of 550 nm (SOD), 532 nm (MDA), or 405 nm (CAT) via a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV752N, Shanghai Yoke, China).</p>
