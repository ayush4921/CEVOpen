<p>It has been accepted that the overproduction of ROS in inflammation can cause OS, leading to joint injury [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. OS is referred to be the imbalance in the oxidative and antioxidative systems, which is able to mediate autophagy [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), SOD, and GSH-Px fight against OS and lipid peroxidation via eliminating free radicals [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Additionally, ROS degrade polyunsaturated lipids to form MDA, a biomarker of oxidative damage [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Excess NO has been reported to be generated through elevated inducible nitric oxide synthase level in monocytes and macrophages triggered by MSU crystals [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, Nrf2-mediated antioxidant pathway is tightly correlated with OS [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. ROS generation inside the cells can be controlled via the activation of Nrf2, an important transcription factor. It is well known that Nrf2 modulates the redox status through upregulating SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In our study, ZSD increased SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT activities but reduced MDA and NO contents, which was in agreement with the previous research [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, the result that the expression of Nrf2 in the nuclear was increased by ZSD in MSU-treated rats has not been reported. The above results elucidated that ZSD had antioxidative effect, possibly via activating the Nrf2 signaling pathway and enhancing the antioxidant status.
