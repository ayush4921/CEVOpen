  <p>ZSD increased Nrf2 activation. (a) The expression of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the rat ankle joint was evaluated utilizing western blotting, respectively. 
   <italic>β</italic>-Actin and histone H3 were utilized as internal references, respectively. (b) The Nrf2 mRNA level in the rat ankle joint was detected by qRT-PCR. 
   <italic>β</italic>-Actin was utilized as an internal control. Results were expressed as means ± SD.
