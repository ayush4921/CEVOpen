  <p>ZSD attenuated MSU-induced GA in rats. (a) Thickness of the right paw in each group was measured for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after MSU injection, respectively. (b) After the injection of MSU for 72 h, the swelling of the right paw in each group was observed and photographed. Then, rats were anesthetized again and sacrificed. (c) The pathological changes in the ankle joint were detected by H&amp;E staining. The scale bar = 200 
   <italic>μ</italic>m. ((d)–(f)) Histopathological changes in the joint space, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cartilage erosion were scored. Results were expressed as means ± SD (
   <italic>n</italic> = 6).
