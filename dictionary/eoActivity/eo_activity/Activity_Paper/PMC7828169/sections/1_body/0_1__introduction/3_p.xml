<p>The promotion of melanin synthesis in the skin using natural products as a treatment for hypopigmentation disorders has gained attention in the cosmetics field. Melanogenesis is a multi-step biosynthetic pathway that utilizes 
 <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine to produce brown/black melanin (eumelanin) and red/yellow melanin (pheomelanin) through the catalytic activities of melanogenesis enzymes tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT). TYR catalyzes the conversion of 
 <sc>l</sc>-tyrosine into 
 <sc>l</sc>-DOPA, the rate-limiting step in melanin synthesis [

 <sc>l</sc>-DOPA to dopaquinone. The conjugation of dopaquinone with cysteine or glutathione produces pheomelanin through a series of reactions. In the absence of thiol compounds, dopaquinone may spontaneously oxidize to dopachrome which is transformed by DCT into 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA). TRP1 catalyzes the oxidation of DHICA to indole-5,6-quinone-2-carboxylic acid, which will then polymerize to form eumelanins [
