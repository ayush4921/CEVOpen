<p>The spectrophotometric quantification of phenol content (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00371-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) showed that ALE has a high total phenol content (TPC) of 198.61 ± 0.20 tyrosol equivalent (TYE) mg/g dry matter (DM)) and a significant total flavonoid content (TFC) (128.41 ± 1.58 catechin equivalent (CAE) mg/g DM). Among the flavonoid subgroups, flavanols and proanthocyanidins contents were 59.59 ± 1.55 CAE mg/g DM and 6.85 ± 0.13 cyanidin equivalent (CYE) mg/g DM, respectively. The phenolic compounds that were identified using UPLC-ESI-HRMS analysis are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00371-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Component identification was based on the analysis of their retention times, exact mass spectra, and comparison with the data reported in the literature. A total of 14 polyphenols including catechins, flavonoids, and phenolic acids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00371-f004">Figure 4</xref>) were identified in ALE. The major phenolic compounds identified in ALE were quercetin-3-
