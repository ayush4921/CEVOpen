<p>The human skin is exposed to UV radiation (UVR) on a daily basis, which results in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that eventually will cause oxidative stress at the cellular level. ROS cause oxidation of DNA bases that lead to the formation of highly mutagenic lesions such as 8-oxo-deoxyguanine [

The use of natural products, such as those present in argan leaves extract, could be useful since aside from promoting melanogenesis, they can also attenuate some of the effect of UVR that the melanin cannot absorb. A lot of bioactive compounds with anti-oxidant properties, such as quercetin, have been reported to regulate melanogenesis, but the direct relationship between the anti-oxidant effect and melanogenesis regulatory effect have not been well-explained yet. The results presented here, however, suggest that the melanogenesis stimulation activities of ALE could be associated with its antioxidant effect. The presence of the flavonoids chemical group, and their synergistic interaction with other ALE compounds, provides ALE with both melanogenesis promotion effect and antioxidant properties making it a promising therapeutic agent against hypopigmentation and UV-induced oxidative stress in the skin.
