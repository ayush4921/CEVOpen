<p>The results of the MTT assay showed that ALE did not significantly affect cell viability at all tested ALE concentrations, indicating that it is non-cytotoxic to B16 cells. The quantification of melanin content revealed that ALE significantly enhances melanin synthesis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, ALE appears to be more effective than α-MSH in stimulating melanogenesis (
