<p>Argan leaves were collected in July 2012 from trees with fusiform fruits in the Sidi Ifni region (southwest of Morocco), and verified by Prof. Ahmed Ouhammou, head of the regional herbarium MARK of the Faculty of Sciences Semlalia, Marrakech, Morocco. Voucher samples (MARK10888-2) are kept in the herbarium of the same institution. They were dried in the dark at 25 °C. Ten grams (10 g) of argan leaves powder was extracted with 100 mL of 70% ethanol for 2 weeks at room temperature. The obtained extract was then centrifuged (1000×
