<p>DPPH stable free radical scavenging assay was performed as previously described by Von Gadow et al., with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Free radical working solution was prepared by dissolving 4 mg of DPPH* in 100 mL of methanol. ALE (100 µL) at different concentrations was mixed with 3 mL of DPPH* working solution. After 60 mn incubation, the absorbance was read at 517 nm. The scavenging activity, corresponding to the inhibition of DPPH discoloration, was determined by the following Equation (1):
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = 100 × [(Ac − As)/Ac]
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where As represents the sample absorbance and Ac is the control absorbance. The experiment was repeated three times. BHT and ascorbic acid were used as standard controls. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against extract concentration, and denoted the concentration of sample required to scavenge 50% of DPPH radicals.
