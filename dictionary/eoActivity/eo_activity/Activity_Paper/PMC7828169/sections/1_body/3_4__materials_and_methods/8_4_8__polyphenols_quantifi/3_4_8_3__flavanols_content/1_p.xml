<p>Flavanols content of ALE was determined by 
 <italic>p</italic>-(dimethylamino)-cinnamaldehyde (DMACA) reagent using the optimized protocol established by Nigel and Glories [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-26-00371" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The extract (0.2 mL) was mixed with 0.5 mL HCl (0.24 N in methanol) and 0.5 mL DMACA solution (0.2% in methanol). The mixture was allowed to react for 5 min at room temperature, and the absorbance was measured at 640 nm. The total flavanols content was calculated from a calibration curve, using catechin as a standard. The results are expressed as mg of catechin equivalents (CTE) per g of DM.
