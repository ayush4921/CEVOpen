<p id="p0130">Diabetes mellitus is a multi-factorial disorder which causes several other complications such as diminished response of T-cells, neutrophil function, and humoral immunity disorders (
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it demands multiple therapeutic approaches. α-glucosidase aids the digestion of dietary carbohydrates and starches to produce glucose for intestinal absorption, which thus prompts upsurge in blood glucose concentrations. In diabetics, this enzyme inhibition leads to delayed glucose absorption and lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia. In fact, 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Ngozi and Olatunbosun (2016)</xref> reported that α-glucosidase inhibition partially diminished the degree of HbA

In the present study, ethanolic extract was observed as the most active agent to inhibit α-glucosidase with respect to the aqueous extract. The high α-glucosidase inhibitory trait might be because of saponins present in the extract. Saponins have been found to play a significant impact in the cause of diabetic complications, and its hypoglycemic effect is mediated by distinct mechanisms, particularly the restoration of insulin response, α-glucosidase activity inhibition, and gluconeogenesis inhibition (

 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2004)</xref> established that hydroxyl group corresponds to the inhibition mechanism. In fact, it forms hydrogen bonds with the polar side chains of the amino acids, thereby modifying the molecular conformation of enzyme along with its hydrophilic and hydrophobic characteristics, prompting a decline in enzyme activity.
