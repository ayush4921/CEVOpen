 <p>This context was investigated to assess the 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition traits of 
  <italic>Punica granatum</italic> fruits peel extract. Initially, among various extracts tested, aqueous and ethanolic peel extracts depicted the presence of diverse phytoconstituents. 
  <italic>In vitro</italic> antioxidative properties of peel extracts were determined using standard methodologies. Results showed that aqueous and ethanolic extracts had IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 471.7 and 509.16 μg/mL, respectively in terms of 1,1,diphenyl 2,2,picrylhydrazyl scavenging. Likewise, IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of aqueous and ethanol extract were obtained as 488.76 and 478.47 μg/mL towards the degradation of hydrogen peroxide. The ethanolic extract exhibited the highest inhibition of α
  <bold>-</bold>glucosidase by showing activity of 53.34 ± 2.0 to 15.18 ± 1.4 U/L in a dose dependent manner (100–1000 µg/mL). Ethanolic extract was reported as the most active inhibitor of lipase with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 603.50 µg/mL. Ethanolic extract showed increased inhibition of ACE in a concentration dependent manner (100–1000 µg/mL) with IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 519.45 µg/mL. Fourier transform-infrared spectrum revealed the availability of various functional groups in the ethanolic extract of peel. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry chromatogram of peel extract illustrated 23 diversified chemical constituents including 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol, Dimethyl sulfone, 9-octadecenamide, and Pentadecanoic acid as predominant compounds. In summary, 
  <italic>P. granatum</italic> fruits peel extract revealed promising antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and anti-hypertensive properties.
