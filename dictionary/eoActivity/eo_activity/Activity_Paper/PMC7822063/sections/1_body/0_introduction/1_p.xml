 </xref>. It has been reported that loss of cholinergic transmission is one of the major causes of AD. Therefore, small molecule cholinesterase inhibitors that enhance cholinergic transmission can be used as a remedy for AD. One such example is donepezil hydrochloride (E2020, Aricept
 <sup>®</sup>), which is currently used in the palliative treatment for mild to moderate AD. Analysis of the crystal structure of donepezil in complex with human AChE suggested that the benzyl, piperidine and indanone rings of donepezil are important pharmacophores for binding to the active site
