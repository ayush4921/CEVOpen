 </xref>. The results are summarised in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Most of the tested compounds showed promising AChE inhibitory activity when screened at 10 µM. Based on the structure–activity relationship analysis, it is clear that AChE inhibitory activity was closely related to the C4-substituent. Generally, the tertiary amine substituted compounds possessed better AChE inhibitory activity than that of tertiary amide substituted compounds. The results of 
 <bold>8a</bold>, 
 <bold>8 b</bold>, and 
 <bold>8d–f</bold> demonstrated that compounds with piperidine or pyrrolidine substituted at C4 position were comparably potent as that of donepezil and tacrine against AChE. When examining the efficacy of compounds 
 <bold>4a–e</bold>, the presence of 6′-methoxy substituent in the A ring favour the AChE activity. Compounds 
 <bold>4f–h</bold> which lack of a tertiary nitrogen substituent in B ring were inactive, indicating that the carboxylic group is not favoured for interaction. Besides, the length of the C4 side chain also played a significant role in the AChE inhibitory activity. Tertiary amine-bearing derivatives 
 <bold>8a–f</bold> which contain a side chain of 2 carbon atoms, displayed a better inhibition than those derivatives without side chain described in our previous work
