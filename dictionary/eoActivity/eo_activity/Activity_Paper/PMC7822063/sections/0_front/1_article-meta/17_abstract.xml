 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>A series of C4-substituted tertiary nitrogen-bearing 2′-hydroxychalcones were designed and synthesised based on a previous mixed type acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Majority of the 2′-hydroxychalcone analogues displayed a better inhibition against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) than butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). Among them, compound 
  <bold>4c</bold> was identified as the most potent AChE inhibitor (IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 3.3 µM) and showed the highest selectivity for AChE over BuChE (ratio &gt;30:1). Molecular docking studies suggested that compound 
  <bold>4c</bold> interacts with both the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic anionic site (CAS) regions of AChE. ADMET analysis confirmed the therapeutic potential of compound 
  <bold>4c</bold> based on its blood–brain barrier penetrating. Overall, the results suggest that this 2′-hydroxychalcone deserves further investigation into the therapeutic lead for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
