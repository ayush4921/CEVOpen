<p id="p0080">Forty five male albino rats were randomly divided into nine groups (n = 5). Group 1 was injected with saline and served as normal control. Group 2 to 9 were injected intraperitoneally with 0.2 mL of 0.025 mgkg
 <sup>−1</sup> lethal dose concentration (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] dissolved in 1 mL of normal saline. Treatment of envenomed rats commenced 1 h post envenomation. Group 2 was left untreated post envenomation (venom control) while group 3 was treated by intravenous injection of 0.2 mL of polyvalent anti-venom. However, group 4, 6 and 8 were treated with oral dose of 0.2 mL of 300 mgkg
 <sup>−1</sup> of N-hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> in saline respectively. Additionally, group 5, 7 and 9 were treated orally with 0.2 mL of 600 mgkg
 <sup>−1</sup>of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> in saline respectively. Treatment of envenomed rats was done for seven consecutive days thereafter blood was collected through the abdominal veins from the experimental rats for haematology and biochemical analyses. Rats were then sacrificed following guides [
