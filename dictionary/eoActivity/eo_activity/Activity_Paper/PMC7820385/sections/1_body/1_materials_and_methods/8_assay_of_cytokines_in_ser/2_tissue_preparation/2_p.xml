<p id="p0095">Frozen samples were homogenized in 1.5 mL RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS pH = 7.6) supplemented with Protease inhibitors at 4 °C. The homogenate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10, 000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred to labelled Eppendorf and stored at −80 °C for cytokine measurement.</p>
