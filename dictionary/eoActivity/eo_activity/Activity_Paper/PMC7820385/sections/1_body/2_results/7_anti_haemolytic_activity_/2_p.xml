 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom had 88% haemolysis of citrated bovine erythrocytes however, extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> inhibited haemolysis induced by the venom at different concentrations. The highest inhibitory activity was observed in sample mixed with 600Â mg/kg of ethyl acetate with 72% inhibition while antivenom recorded 48% inhibition (
