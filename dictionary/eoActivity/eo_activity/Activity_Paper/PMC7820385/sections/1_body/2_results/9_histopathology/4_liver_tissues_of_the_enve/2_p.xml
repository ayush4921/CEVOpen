<p id="p0185">Normal control showed unaffected hepatocytes but a moderate portal congestion, with very mild diffuse hydropic degeneration of hepatocytes was noticed in liver tissue of untreated rats. Group treated with anti-venom showed severe diffuse vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes. Further, a mild portal congestion with a moderate diffuse vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes was noticed in group treated with 300 mg/kg, and 600 mg/kg of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. Group treated with 300 and 600 mg/kg of ethyl acetate showed a severe diffuse vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of the hepatocytes. In addition, a severe portal congestion was noticed in liver tissues of group treated with 300 mg/kg of ethanol partition. Envenomed group treated with 600 mg/kg of ethanol partition showed a severe portal and central venous congestion with severe diffuse vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes (
