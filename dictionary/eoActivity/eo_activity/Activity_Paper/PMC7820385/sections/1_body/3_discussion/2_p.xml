<p id="p0190">Envenoming by poisonous snake is a serious medical problem, especially in rural areas of tropical region. Thus, efficacious treatment should be available [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Screening of medicinal plants antidotes to ameliorate snake venom induced toxicity is very key in snakebite management [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] due to limitations of anti-venom. In this study, high mortality was observed in untreated envenomed rats as death was observed 2Â h post-envenomation indicating 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom was highly toxic and fatal [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, extract partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> reduced mortality in envenomed treated groups suggesting the protective effects of the plant against 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom toxicities.
