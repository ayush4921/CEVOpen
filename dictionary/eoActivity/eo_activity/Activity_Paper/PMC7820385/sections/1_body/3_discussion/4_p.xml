<p id="p0200">Higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes obtained in serum and brain tissue of untreated rats might indicate that 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom induce oxidative stress and the effect may be attributed to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are known do play a significant role in venom-induced toxicity by actively involved in inflammatory responses altering cellular physiology and playing a major role in pathological conditions [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>]. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a known biomarker of oxidative stress and cellular damage [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Significant increase in the MDA of serum and brain tissue of untreated rats further confirmed the ability of 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom to induced oxidative damage as MDA is generally considered as a strong indicator of lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) are key antioxidant enzymes because of their role in eliminating ROS directly [
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Indeed, the RBC is the major source of ROS due to auto-oxidation of oxy-haemoglobin following envenomation. Superoxide radicals generated due to the snake venom toxicity are taken up by SOD and converted to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. The hydrogen peroxide, if not taken care of, can be converted to hydroxyl radicals by interacting with metals such as iron leading to exacerbation of the oxidative stress. The dangerous hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) is later broken down to oxygen and water in a concerted effort to detoxify the ROS and prevent oxidative damage to biomolecules [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The activities of catalase and SOD was significantly high in serum and brain tissue of untreated rats confirming increased free radicals production and suggesting possible oxidative damage cause by the venom in the erythrocyte and brain tissue of rats. Studies have reported oxidant damage due to 
 <italic>N. haje</italic> venom toxicities [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>]. However, polyvalent antivenom and various partitions of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> extract showed significant normalised the antioxidant enzyme activities with ethanol extract partition of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> as the most effective. Studies have shown that 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> is capable of ameliorating oxidative stress induced by snake venom in rats [
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The ability of the extracts to normalize the activity of SOD and CAT as well as reducing the level of MDA may be attributed to its antioxidant properties due to the presence of electronâ€“donating phytochemicals which has anti-ROS effects.
