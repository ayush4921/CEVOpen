    "<h4>Background</h4>Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating antineoplastic agent and its major limitation is injury to normal tissue, leading to multiple organ toxicity, including kidney, heart, liver and reproductive toxicity. <i>Croton macrostachyus</i> (Euphorbiaceae) has been used in Ethiopian traditional medicine to manage renal diseases.<h4>Objective</h4>The present study aims to assess the protective effect of the stem bark extract and solvent fractions of <i>Croton macrostachyus</i> on cyclophosphamide-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.<h4>Methods</h4>Nephrotoxicity was induced using cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg i.p injection on the first day of the experiment. The negative control groups were administered with cyclophosphamide alone (200 mg/kg, i.p.). The crude extracts were administered at three dose levels (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), while aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions were given at two dose levels (100 and 200 mg/kg). Excepting the normal control, all groups were subjected to cyclophosphamide toxicity on the first day.<h4>Results</h4>Treatment with crude extract 100 mg/kg and ethyl acetate fraction significantly decreased kidney-to-body weight ratio (P < 0.001). In addition, treatment with <i>Croton macrostachyus</i> crude extract and solvent fractions significantly decreased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (P < 0.001). Treatment with 100 and 200 mg/kg of ethyl acetate fraction significantly decreased serum creatinine level. Histopathological results confirmed the protective effect of the crude extract and solvent fractions of <i>Croton macrostachyus</i>.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Croton macrostachyus possesses nephroprotective activities and it could be a possible source of treatment for cyclophosphamide-induced nephrotoxicity."
