<p>Fractionation was carried out using a separatory funnel. Sixty-five grams of the crude extract were dissolved in 325 mL of distilled water. Then, extraction was performed by hexane 325 mL, consecutively for three times, followed by ethyl acetate 325 mL consecutively for three times in order to attain complete fraction. After collecting the hexane and ethyl acetate fractions the remaining residue was considered as aqueous fraction. The fractions were concentrated using oven dryer at 40°C and weighed. Hexane fraction was yellowish oily. Dried powders of the aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions were kept in an airtight container and wrapped with the aluminum foil and stored in a refrigerator at 4°C until further use.</p>
