<p>For the evaluation of nephroprotective activities of the ethyl acetate fractions of 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic>, group VIII served as normal control (NC), administered with 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (2% DMSO) orally for 10 days, group IX served as cyclophosphamide (CP) control (single dose of CP 200 mg/kg, i.p, was administered on the first day of the experimental period). Group X and XI rats were treated with the ethyl acetate fractions of 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> (100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively). Crude extract and aqueous fractions were dissolved in normal saline, whereas ethyl acetate fraction were dissolved in 2% DMSO (
