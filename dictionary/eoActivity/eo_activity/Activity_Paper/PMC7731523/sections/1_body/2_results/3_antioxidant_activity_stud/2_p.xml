<p>DPPH exhibits the maximum absorption at 517 nm owing to its stable nitrogen-containing free radicals, and its purple color turns yellow when the free radicals are scavenged by antioxidants. The antioxidant capacity of the nanoemulsion was evaluated and compared with that of the suspension using ascorbic acid as a positive control. As shown in

 </xref>, the DPPH scavenging activity of nanoemulsion was increased with the concentration from 0.2 to 1.0 mg/ml, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the nanoemulsion were 0.52 mg/ml. The DPPH radical scavenging activity curve of the suspension was also gradually increased, but at the concentration of 1.0 mg/ml, its scavenging activity was 37.1%, which was significantly lower than that of the nanoemulsion (81.92%). The results suggested that the nanoemulsion possessed potent DPPH free radical scavenging capacity.
