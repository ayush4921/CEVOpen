<p>The model of the regression equations of the particle size was significant with 
 <italic>P</italic> valueâ€‰&lt;0.05, 
 <italic>P</italic> value of the lack of fit of the particle size was 0.1383, and the coefficient of 
 <italic>R</italic> was fine. The predicted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> (0.8236) reasonably agreed with the adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> (0.9420). The adequate precision was measured by the signal-to-noise ratio. A ratio greater than 4 was desirable. The ratio of 11.044 indicated an adequate signal. This model could be used to navigate the design space.
