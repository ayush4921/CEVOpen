<p>In our study, the AUC for the nanoemulsion was 1621.2 ±141.60 ng/ml·h, which was 2.2-fold higher than that of the control suspension (734.48±109.81 ng/ml·h). The

 <sub>max</sub> (the maximum plasma drug concentration) of the nanoemulsion was 156.15±8.14 ng/ml, which was 2.6-fold higher than that of the suspension (59.89±6.49 ng/ml). The

 <sub>max</sub> (the maximum plasma drug concentration) of the nanoemulsion reached peak concentrations faster than the suspension within 0.90±0.22 h, which might be related to the good solubility of buckwheat flavonoids in the nanoemulsion. The nanoemulsion of buckwheat flavonoids exhibited significantly higher AUC than the suspension (
