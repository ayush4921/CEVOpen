<p>Particle size and zeta potential are two important properties of nanoemulsion. Size of the droplets of buckwheat flavonoids nanoemulsion was 23.22±0.13 nm (

 </xref>), and the particle size distribution was uniform. The encapsulation efficiency of the nanoemulsion was 98.35%±0.04%. After the storage at different temperatures for 30 days, the particle size and the zeta potential exhibited no significant change. No noticeable creaming was observed after centrifuging at 3000
