<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> release of the buckwheat flavonoids nanoemulsion and suspension were continuously monitored for 48 h. The cumulative release of the suspension was 5.17% in 15 min, and only 15.14% drug was released in 48 h because of its poor solubility (

The results showed that the cumulative release efficiency of the nanoemulsion was 5-folds higher than that of the suspension, and the effect of drugs
