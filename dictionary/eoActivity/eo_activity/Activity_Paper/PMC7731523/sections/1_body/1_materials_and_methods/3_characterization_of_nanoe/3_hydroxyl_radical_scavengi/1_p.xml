<p>The hydroxyl radical scavenging activities of buckwheat flavonoid nanoemulsion and suspension and the ascorbic acid solution samples were measured as previously reported [
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In brief, FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> solution (2.5 mM, 1 ml) was added to the samples and then H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (2.5 mM, 1 ml) and salicylic acid (2.5 mM, 1 ml) were added successively. The temperature of the mixture was adjusted to 37°C for 60 min. After completion of the reaction, the hydroxyl radical was measured by monitoring the absorbance at 510 nm. Meanwhile, distilled water in stead of the sample was used as the control. The scavenging activity of hydroxyl radicals was calculated with the following equation:
