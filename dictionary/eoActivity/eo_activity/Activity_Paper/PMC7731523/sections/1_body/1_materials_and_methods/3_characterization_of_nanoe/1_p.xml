<p>The particle size and zeta potential of the nanoemulsion were analyzed using the dynamic light scattering method with a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK). The morphology of nanoemulsion was observed under a transmission electron microscope (JEM-1011; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 200 kV accelerating voltage. Encapsulation efficiency was calculated using the formula: encapsulation (%) = W

 <sub>18</sub> column (Agilent Zorbax, 250 mm×4.6 mm, 5 μm). A mixture of methanol and acetic acid (50:50) aqueous solution (0.5%) was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The stability of the nanoemulsion was tested at different temperatures (−40°C, 4°C, 25°C, and 37°C) for 30 days. The nanoemulsion was also examined for the phase separation by centrifuging at 3000 
 <italic>g</italic> and 10,000 
 <italic>g</italic>. The nanoemulsion was diluted 10- and 100-folds with distilled water to investigate the particle size, zeta potential, and stratification of the system.
