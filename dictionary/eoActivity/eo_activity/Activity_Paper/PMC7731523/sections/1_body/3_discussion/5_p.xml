<p>Bioavailability, an important criterion for evaluating the effect of drugs 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, is usually assessed by three parameters: 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>, 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>, and AUC. AUC is the most reliable indicator of bioavailability. It is directly proportional to the amount of prototype medicine that enters the body. This study demonstrated that the buckwheat flavonoid nanoemulsion is absorbed 2.2-fold higher than the suspension, as the drug particles in the nanoemulsion are relatively small and more drugs can be released. The absorption of a poorly water-soluble drug is often limited by its insufficient dissolution in the gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The small droplets of the drug-loaded nanoemulsion can pass through the membrane directly and get absorbed easily [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system of persimmon leaf extract was shown to accelerate the drug absorption, and the drug was not precipitated in the gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, the main problems of poor solubility and weak absorption of flavonoids were solved through the self-nanoemulsifying technology, and the oral bioavailability was significantly improved [
