<p>Flavones possess antioxidant properties, but buckwheat flavonoid nanoemulsion showed significant antioxidant activity compared with suspensions in the three test methods because nanoemulsion technology can enhance the solubility and release of insoluble or poorly soluble drugs. A higher amount of drug might be responsible for the enhanced antioxidant potential [
