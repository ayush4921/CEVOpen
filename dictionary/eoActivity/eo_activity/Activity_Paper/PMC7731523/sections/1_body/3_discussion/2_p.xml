<p>The nanoemulsion was obtained by the CCD experiment, and the nanoemulsion with small particle sizes displayed a smaller surface tension and greater stability. The smaller particle size can lead to a greater interfacial surface area for drug absorption, and the solubility and bioavailability are enhanced [

The zeta potential of the nanoemulsion is caused by the adsorption of charged molecules on its surface, which depends up on the types of emulsifier and the conditions of the medium, and this charge can cause molecular repulsions between dispersed phase droplets, so the zeta potential can improve the stability of the nanoemulsion [
