<p>The CCD response surface experiment is a multivariate statistical method for optimization analysis [
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and it provides an idea of two more probability values, which can lead to a more comprehensive, intuitive, and accurate design. CCD was used in this study to determine the optimum conditions for nanoemulsion, which led to suitable particle size and encapsulation efficiency. The model effectively described and predicted the responses of the particle size and encapsulation efficiency with the changes in the constitution conditions in given experimental ranges. The particle size of nanoemulsion increased with the S
 <sub>mix</sub> and water phase, and the effect of oil phase was not very significant. The surfactant and cosurfactant showed the greatest effects, and the oil phase and water phase also affected the encapsulation efficiency. The results of these experiments were close to the predicted values from the optimization analysis, suggesting that the multiple regression models are reasonable and reliable.
