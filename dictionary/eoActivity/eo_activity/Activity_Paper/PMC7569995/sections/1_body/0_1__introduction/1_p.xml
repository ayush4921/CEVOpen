<p>The majority of Kurds inhabit a mostly mountainous land called Kurdistan that includes adjacent parts of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. The name of Kurdistan means the ‘land of the Kurds’ because it is the traditional country where the Kurdish people have been constituted ethnically as a homogeneous community since the dawn of recorded history, and where they have developed their culture and shaped their destiny. Indeed, their diverse and distinctive social and traditional lifestyle has been well preserved until today. However, although Kurds form a nation, they do not have their own state. About 4.2 million Kurds constitute approximately 19% of Iraq’s overall population and live in northern Iraq, in the Kurdistan Autonomous Region, which has received limited administrative autonomy from the Baghdad central government in 1991. The region comprises the governorates of Dohuk, Erbil, Halabja and Sulaymaniyah.</p>
