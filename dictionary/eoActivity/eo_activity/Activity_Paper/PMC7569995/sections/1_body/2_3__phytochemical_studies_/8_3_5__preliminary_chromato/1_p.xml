<p>To remove chlorophylls and residual highly lipophilic components, a sample of residue B (1.1 g) was filtered through an SPE C-18 cartridge (Discovery
 <sup>®</sup> DSC-18 SPE Tube, bed wt. 10 g, volume 60 mL, Supelco) previously conditioned with MeOH (100 mL), followed by H
 <sub>2</sub>O (100 mL). The sample was dissolved by stirring in MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90:10) in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h, loaded on the top of the column, and eluted by 200 mL of MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90:10). The liquid was taken to dryness under vacuum. Subsequently, to remove tannins and other polymeric material, the resulting residue (1.07 g) was filtered with a flow of 4 mL/min through a Sephadex LH-20 column (50 g, Sigma) that had previously been swollen in MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80:20) overnight. The sample was dissolved in 10 mL of MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80:20) in an ultrasonic bath for 1 h and, after loading on the column, was eluted by equal volumes (250 mL each) of MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80:20), MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (65:35), MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (50:50), and Me
 <sub>2</sub>CO/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (70:30) (in this order). The solutions were combined and evaporated to dryness under vacuum to give residue B’ (1.05 g). An analogous procedure was followed to remove possible lipophilic and tannin contaminants from a sample (100 mg) of extract C to give residue C’ (90 mg).
