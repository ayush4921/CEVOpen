<p>The total phenolic contents of the extracts B’ and C’ were determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu assay, according to the method described by Singleton et al. [
 <xref rid="B81-plants-09-01066" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Ten percent EtOH was the solvent for the standard and the samples. A calibration line was constructed using gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) as the standard in the concentration range of 1–5 µg/mL. The equation of the calibration curve was y = 0.0876(7) x + 0.006(2). Absorbances of tested samples were read at 760 nm, against a blank containing 1 mL of 10% EtOH. Analyses were conducted in triplicate. The total phenolic contents in samples B’ and C’, expressed as gallic acid equivalent/100 g extract, were 79.56 (±1.26) g and 74.91 (±0.19) g, respectively.
