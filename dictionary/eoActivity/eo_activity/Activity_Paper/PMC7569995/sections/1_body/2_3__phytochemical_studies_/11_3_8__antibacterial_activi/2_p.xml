<p>The MIC of each sample was determined by the method of dilution with culture medium [
 <xref rid="B83-plants-09-01066" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. ISB series of tubes containing constantly increasing concentrations of B’ or C’ were inoculated with the same amount of each microbial suspension. After 18–24 h of incubation at 37 °C, the MIC was determined by turbidity and expressed as the percentage volume of the extract used in the assay compared to the total volume (volume of microbial rich medium (mL) + volume antimicrobial agent (mL)) in the tube (% v/v). The MBC values were calculated by inoculating aliquots of culture medium taken from tubes where the MICs had been determined, in test tubes containing extract-free culture medium. Three replicates were performed for each test. The MICs of B’ and C’ against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were, respectively, &gt;1530 and &gt;1500, 918 and 1050, 612 and 750, &gt;1530 and &gt;1500 µg/mL. The MBCs of B’ and C’ were &gt;1500 µg/mL against all the tested strains. For comparison, the values determined for gentamicin were in the range of 0.25–1 µg/mL.
