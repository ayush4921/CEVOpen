 <sub>2</sub>O led to the isolation of aucubin (

 <bold>42</bold>, 10.8 mg) in the firstly eluted fractions, whereas mostly a mixture of phenolic derivatives (UV and NMR spectra) was contained in the most polar fractions, which were not analysed further. The structures of the two compounds were determined by spectral analysis. The data (see paragraph 3.1.12) fully corresponded to those reported in the literature [
