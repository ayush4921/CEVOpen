<p>The activity of TrxR is also inhibited by motexafin gadolinium (MGd), which is a drug used in anticancer therapy. Direct binding of MGd to TrxR has been observed, but not in the active centre of the enzyme

 </xref>. It has also been found that in the presence of suitable proteins (e.g. some metallothioneins), the administration of MGd may lead to the release of zinc as a byproduct of redox reactions, which is also an inhibitor TrxR. Thus, in addition to its direct inhibitory effects, MGd can also inhibit TrxR indirectly through generation of zinc ions
