<p>Spiroketal naphthoquinone derivatives such as pleurotin can be used to inhibit the Trx-TrxR system (

 </xref>. Some compounds from this group can preferentially act as Trx inhibitors while others more effectively inactivate TrxR. Moreover, some of the compounds in this group are effective inhibitors of the Trx-TrxR system although they do not interact directly with either Trx or TrxR. This suggests that in addition to inhibiting the biological activity of Trx or TrxR, spiroketal derivatives of naphthoquinone may affect other cellular metabolic processes, e.g. by reducing HIF-1 expression levels
