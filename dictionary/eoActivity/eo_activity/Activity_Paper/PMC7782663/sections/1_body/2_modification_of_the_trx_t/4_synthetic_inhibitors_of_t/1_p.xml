<p>Compounds from the group of alkyl-2-imidazolyl disulphides, including 1-methylpropyl-2-imidazolyl disulphide (known as PX-12 in formulation), which has been tested in clinical trials as a Trx1 inhibitor, can modulate the functioning of the Trx-TrxR system

 </xref>. PX-12 has been tested in the treatment of advanced, therapy-resistant cancers (e.g. non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic, breast, and gastrointestinal cancers, as well as multiple myeloma)

 </xref>. The action of this group of chemicals is based on the thiol alkylation reaction of Cys32 and Cys35 of the catalytic centre and Cys73 outside the catalytic centre of Trx that they induce. It has been observed that the PX-12-mediated thiol alkylation reactions of Trx within Cys32 and Cys35 are reversible and rapid whereas reaction with Cys73 is irreversible and much slower

 </xref>. This is important for the action of the Trx-TrxR system because the reaction with the cysteine residue located beyond the Trx catalytic centre causes the protein to be permanently inactivated. This results in a decrease in the expression of factors whose activity is associated with Trx antioxidant activity directly (e.g. factors induced by HIF-1α under hypoxia) as well as indirectly (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF, which is induced by HIF-1α)
