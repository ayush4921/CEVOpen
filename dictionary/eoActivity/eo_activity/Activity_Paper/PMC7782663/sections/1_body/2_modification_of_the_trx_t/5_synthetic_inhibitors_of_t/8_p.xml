<p>The ability to interact and modify thiol and selenium TrxR groups is exhibited by electrophilic organic compounds from the groups of nitrosoureas, dinitrohalobenzenes, and polyphenols

 </xref>. These compounds may also bind to other functional groups, effectively inhibiting not only the activity of TrxR, but also blocking the activity of GR in reactions involving NADH

 </xref>. TrxR modified in this way cannot reduce molecules, and oxidised Trx cannot bind ASK-1, leading to the initiation of a signalling cascade resulting in apoptosis

 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> studies have shown that these reactions are reversible by the addition of an appropriately reduced protein. One of the most significant features of nitrosourea derivatives is their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and influence the Trx-dependent system in brain cells
