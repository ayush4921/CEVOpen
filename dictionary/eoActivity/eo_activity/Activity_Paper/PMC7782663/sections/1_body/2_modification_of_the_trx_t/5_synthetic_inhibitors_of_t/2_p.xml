<p>In addition, auranofin – apart from increasing the generation of hydrogen peroxide – can also lead to an increase in intracellular concentrations of calcium ions. Since an increase in ROS promotes the transport of calcium ions across the cell membrane

 </xref>, it is suggested that hydrogen peroxide may cause the release of intracellular calcium ions, which are involved in regulating metabolic functions in cells

 </xref>. Calcium ions regulate the expression of various cytokines including IL-2 and IL-8, as well as COX2 and prostaglandin E2, influencing inflammatory processes in cells. Calcium gradients also participate in the homeostasis of permeability barriers

 </xref>. Based on circular dichroism spectra, it was found that calcium ions acting on the TrxR1 isoform cause a change in the conformation of the enzyme, which leads to a reduction in its cytosolic activity, whereas such changes were not observed for TrxR2. Moreover, it is suggested that the oxidised form of Trx, acting by way of feedback, may partially protect TrxR against inactivating calcium ions
