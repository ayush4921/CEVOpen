<p>It is believed that in some cancers, TXNIP may act as a tumour suppressor as the overexpression of TXNIP leads to significant Trx binding, which disrupts redox homeostasis in tumour cells. Inactivation of Trx leads to oxidative stress, inhibits cell proliferation, and activates cascades of signalling pathways involving kinases that regulate apoptosis

 </xref>. Interestingly, in many cancers, a decrease in TXNIP expression is observed. For example, it has been shown that TXNIP expression in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) cells isolated from patients is decreased by up to 11 times and levels are also reduced in primary breast and colon cancers

 </xref>. Therefore, to prevent and pharmacologically treat tumours, compounds that inhibit Trx-dependent system activity are being sought, and mainly those with natural origins.
