<p>The maintenance of redox balance is important in living organisms. Cellular metabolism, including the metabolism of xenobiotics, generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. Their formation and cellular effects under physiological conditions is controlled by antioxidant systems – mainly the glutathione or thioredoxin-dependent systems – which work independently, but can complement each other, particularly in cases involving pathological factors. The thioredoxin-dependent system is of particular relevance in the detoxification of harmful metabolites such as lipid peroxides and in the regulation of gene expression and modulation of cell signalling pathways. The possibility of modulating signalling pathways with exogenous substances/compounds that target the thioredoxin-dependent system creates a real possibility of extending the use of current pharmacotherapies, as well as fuel the search for new cancer pharmacotherapies, to activate apoptotic pathways in neoplastic cells.</p>
