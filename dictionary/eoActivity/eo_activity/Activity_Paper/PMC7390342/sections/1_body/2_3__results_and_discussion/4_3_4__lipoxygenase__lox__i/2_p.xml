<p>Both the ME and CF exhibited significantly higher LOX inhibitory activity than that of an NDGA positive standard (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.2 Î¼g/mL). Lipoxygenase is involved in arachidonic acid metabolism, generating various biologically active leukotrienes that play an important role in inflammation. Lipoxygenases are the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes which play an important role in the incidence of several inflammatory diseases such as cancer, arthritis, asthma, allergic diseases [
