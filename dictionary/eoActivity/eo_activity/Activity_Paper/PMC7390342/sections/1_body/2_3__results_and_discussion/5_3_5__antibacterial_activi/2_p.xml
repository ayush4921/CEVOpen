<p>The MIC values for antibacterial activity of various plant extract fractions obtained against all tested bacteria ranged from 0.01 to 10 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Gram-positive bacteria such as 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> were inhibited with an MIC value of 1.5 and 2.5 mg/mL for ME and CF, respectively, 10 mg/mL for AE and 5 mg/mL for EAF. In contrast, 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>subtilis</italic> was inhibited by ME and CF (both 5 mg/mL) and EAF (10 mg/mL), while the aqueous fraction did not inhibit the growth of this bacterial species. In the case of the gram-negative bacterium, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, growth was inhibited by CF (1.5 mg/mL); ME (2.5 mg/mL) and AE (10 mg/mL). 
 <italic>K</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniaeâ€™s</italic> growth was inhibited by ME (5 mg/mL) and EAF (10 mg/mL), while the other fractions did not inhibit the growth of this bacterial species. From the results we conclude that 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> was the most susceptible while 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic> were less susceptible. Moderate to high antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>cuspidifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> and 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> extracts have been reported [

 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> leaf extract and various fractions might contribute towards the diversity of antibacterial activities. The presence of several phytochemical compounds in 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> can be associated with its different biological activities particularly because of phenolic compounds that are associated with antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities [

 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Several biological activities are ascribed to phenolic and flavonoids including antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, antihepatotoxic, antiulcer, apoptotic and antiproliferative activities [
