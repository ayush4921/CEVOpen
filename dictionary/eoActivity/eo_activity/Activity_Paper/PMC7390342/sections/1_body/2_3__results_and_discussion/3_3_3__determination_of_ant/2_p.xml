<p>ROS, including hydroxyl radical, superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitryl, are continuously being synthesized in living systems because of metabolic reactions [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and they are known to cause several diseases associated with oxidative stress. Therefore such ROS need to be detoxified/scavenged with the help of natural products to enhance the host defense system. The scavenging effects of different fractions of
