<p>The scavenging power of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> fractions on DPPH, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical were in the following order: ME &gt; CF &gt; EAF &gt; AE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0236319.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for scavenging DPPH radicals for the ME and CF were 48±1.3 and 52±2.5 μg/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In agreement with these results, Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] found that, for 
 <italic>Jacaranda acutifolia</italic> flower, the DPPH radical scavenging ability of ME was relatively high compared to the valuefor the ethyl acetate fraction (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.049 mg/mL). Naz and Bano [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] also reported that methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> exhibited the maximum DPPH scavenging ability.
