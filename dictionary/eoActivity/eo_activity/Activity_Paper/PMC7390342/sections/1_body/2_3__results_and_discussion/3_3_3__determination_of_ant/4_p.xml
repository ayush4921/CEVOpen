<p>The hydroxyl radical and its associated radicals are known as very detrimental ROS, because in various biomolecules they are mostly responsible for oxidative injury [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Superoxide anion is another major biological source of ROS [

 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Although the superoxide radical is a weak oxidant, it gives rise to the generation of powerful and dangerous hydroxyl radicals as well as singlet oxygen, both of which contribute to oxidative stress [

 <sub>50</sub> 46±1.3 and 48±2.4 μg/mL, respectively) behaved as powerful superoxide anion scavengers. Though the antioxidant potential of the fractions was found to be lower (at P &lt; 0.05) than those of the standards, ME and CF had substantial antioxidant activity. Most of the phenolic content of the
