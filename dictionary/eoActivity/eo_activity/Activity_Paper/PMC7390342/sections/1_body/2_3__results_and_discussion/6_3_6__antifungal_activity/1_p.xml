<p>Antifungal activity of ME, AE, CF and EAF of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> was investigated against three fungal strains; i.e., 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). ME exhibited good antifungal activity (94%, 91% and 95%) while EAF showed 90%, 88% and 93% inhibition against 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>fumigatus</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>F</italic>. 
 <italic>oxysporum</italic>, respectively. The ranking order of extracts and fractions for antifungal potential was ME &gt; EAF &gt; CF &gt; AE.
