<p>For natural product extracts,products the amounts of total phenolic and flavonoid compounds are considered as significant parameters when evaluating the quality of the extract as well as its biological potential [

Crude extracts of herbs, cereals, fruits, vegetables and other plant materials rich in phenolics are being used increasingly in the food industry because they retard oxidative degradation of lipids, thereby improving the quality and nutritional value of food [
