<p>Antibacterial activity of the methanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> was determined via the agar-well diffusion method [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Petri plates were prepared by pouring 75 mL of MH agar and allowing it to solidify. Freshly prepared bacterial inoculum was spread evenly using a sterile cotton swab on the entire agar surface. A hole was then made with a sterile cork borer (6 mm) and 100 µL of each extract was poured into the wells. The Petri plates were then allowed to cool at room temperature for 1 h and incubated at 37°C for overnight. Controls were run in parallel whereby the solvent was used to fill the well. The plates were observed for zones of inhibition after 24 h and results were compared with those of the positive control containing streptomycin (30 µg/mL).
