<p>Separation of polyphenolic compounds was carried out using a ZORBAXZO ECLIPSE, XDB-C18, (5 μm; 4.6 × 150 mm) column (Agilent USA) with a UV-VIS Spectra-Focus detector. Mobile phase A was acetonitrile:methanol:water:acetic acid (5:10:85:1) and mobile phase B was acetonitrile:methanol:acetic acid (40:60:1). The injection volume was 30 μL and the flow rate was 0.8 mL/min. A concentration gradient profile of 0 to 50% B for 0–20 min, 50 to 100% for 20–25 min and 100% B for 40 min was followed. The system was washed after each run and reconditioned for 10 min before analysis of the next sample. Individual standard solutions of polyphenolic compounds and plant extract solutions were prepared at a concentration of 1.0 and 10 mg/mL, respectively. Samples were filtered through 0.45-μm membrane filters. Quantitative identification of the various

 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), which were detected at appropriate wavelengths (257, 279, 325 and 368 nm). Polyphenolic compounds were identified and quantified in the samples by comparing their retention times with those of standards used and standard calibration curves, respectively.
