<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> were collected in March, 2013 from Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad, Pakistan. The plant was identified by Prof. Dr. Mir Ajab Khan and was submitted to the National Herbarium, Quaid-i-Azam University Islamabad (voucher specimen 41515). The 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> leaves were washed thoroughly with distilled water and shade-dried for 5 d at room temperature (37ºC). The dried leaves were finely ground using an electric grinder and stored in air-tight containers for further use. The pulverized plant material (1 kg) was extracted twice by soaking with 2 L methanol for 48 h at room temperature. The separated extracts were then filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and the methanol filtrate condensed to dryness using a rotary evaporator at 40°C, yielding 16.3% methanol extract (ME) (i.e. the mass of the dried extract represented 16.3% of the mass of the dry leaf starting material). The dried extract was then stored at 4°C until further use. The methanol residue was further suspended for partitioning with chloroform, ethyl acetate and soluble residual aqueous fractions yielding CF (9.6%), EAF (8.5%) and AE (12.2%), respectively.
