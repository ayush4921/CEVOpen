<p>GC-MS analysis of crude organic extracts was performed on a PerkinElmer Clarus 600 GC System fitted with a Rtx-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness; maximum temperature, 350°C), coupled to a Perkin Elmer Clarus 600C MS. Ultra-high purity helium (99.99%) was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The injection, transfer line and ion source temperatures were all 290°C. The ionizing energy was 70 eV. Electron multiplier voltage was obtained from autotune. The oven temperature was programmed from 60°C (hold for 2 min) to 280°C at a rate of 3°C/min.</p>
