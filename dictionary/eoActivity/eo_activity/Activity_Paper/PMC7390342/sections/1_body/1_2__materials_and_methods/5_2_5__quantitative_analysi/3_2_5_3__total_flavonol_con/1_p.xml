 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] with some modifications. A calibration curve for quercetin in the range 200–800 µg/mL was prepared. Extract (1 mL) and standard (1 mL) were placed in separate test tubes to which 2% aluminum chloride (1 mL) and 5% sodium acetate (3 mL) were added and mixed. The mixture was then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min to obtain a clear solution. The absorbance was read at 440 nm and the results expressed as mg quercetin equivalent (QE) per gram of extract. The experiment was conducted in triplicate.
