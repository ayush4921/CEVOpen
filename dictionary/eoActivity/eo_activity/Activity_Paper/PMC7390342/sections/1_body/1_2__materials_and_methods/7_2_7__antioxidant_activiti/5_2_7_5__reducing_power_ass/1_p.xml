<p>Estimation of reducing power was based on reduction of Fe (III) to Fe (II) in the presence of the solvent fractions [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The formation of Fe (II) was monitored by measuring the change in absorbance of Perl’s Prussian blue at 700 nm. Various concentrations of the sample (2 mL) were mixed with 2 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 2 mL of potassium ferricyanide (10 mg/mL). The mixture was incubated at 50°C for 20 min followed by addition of 2 mL of trichloroacetic acid (100 mg/L). The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min to collect the upper layer of the solution. An aliquot (2 mL) from each of the mixtures was mixed with 2 mL of distilled water and 0.4 mL of 0.1% (w/v) fresh ferric chloride. After 10 min, the absorbance of methanol extracts and their different fractions at 50–250 µg/mL was measured at 700 nm. A higher absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated a greater reducing power.
