<p>The determination of MIC of all the extracts of 
 <italic>J</italic>. 
 <italic>mimosifolia</italic> was carried out via a microdilution method [
 <xref rid="pone.0236319.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] using nutrient broth. Plant extracts were dissolved in 10% DMSO and two-fold dilutions prepared with culture broth. Each test sample and growth control (containing broth and DMSO, without plant extract/antimicrobial compound was inoculated with 10 µL of bacterial suspension containing 5×10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. A 10-μL solution of resazurin (270 mg resazurin tablet dissolved in 40 mL of sterile water) was also added to each sample and incubated for 24 h at 37°C. Bacterial growth was detected by reading the absorbance at 500 nm and indicated by a color change from purple to pink or colorless (assessed visually). MIC was defined as the lowest leaf extract concentration at which the color changed or the highest dilution that completely inhibited the bacterial growth. Experiments were carried out in triplicate to test each dilution for each bacterial strain to determine MIC values.
