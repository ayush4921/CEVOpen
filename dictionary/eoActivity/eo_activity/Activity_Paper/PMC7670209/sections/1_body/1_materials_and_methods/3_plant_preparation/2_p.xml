<p id="p0040">One 
 <italic>Sceletium tortuosum</italic> mother plant was obtained from Verve Dynamics, Somerset West. An additional ten mother plants were propagated and cultivated from this plant. Once these ten plants were large enough, ± 600 2.5–3 cm stem cuttings were propagated from the mother plants to ensure a supply of more than 300 rooted cuttings, which was the number of plant material required for the experiment.
