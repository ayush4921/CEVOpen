<p id="p0145">The effect of soilless media and fertigation regime on mesembrine concentration in the shoot of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> was statistically significant at the value of p ≤ 0.001. At p ≤ 0.001, soilless medium SC yielded the highest concentration of mesembrine (4.19) respectively under fertigation regime 3 (FR3) while the least value (0.59) was recorded in SV medium under fertigation regime 4 (FR4). In general, shoots had an overall higher concentration of mesembrine concentration than roots while roots had an overall lower mesembrine concentration than shoots. All 20 treatments significantly differed from one another (
