<p id="p0125">The effect of soilless media and fertigation regime on mesembrenone area % in the shoot of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> was statistically significant at the value of p ≤ 0.001. At p ≤ 0.001, soilless medium SS yielded the highest mesembrenone area % under fertigation regime 1 (FR1) while the least value (2.02) was recorded in SC medium under fertigation regime 3 (FR3). In general, roots had an overall higher concentration of mesembrenone in terms of area % than shoots while shoots had an overall lower concentration of mesembrenone in terms of area % than roots (Figures
