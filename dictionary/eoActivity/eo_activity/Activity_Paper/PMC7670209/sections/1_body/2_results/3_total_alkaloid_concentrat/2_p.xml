<p id="p0105">The effect of soilless media and fertigation regime on total alkaloid concentrations in the shoot of 
 <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> was statistically significant at the value of p ≤ 0.001. At p ≤ 0.001, soilless media SP and SS yielded the highest concentrations of alkaloid respectively under fertigation regime 3 (FR3) while the least value (1.07 mg/mL) was recorded in SV medium under fertigation regime 4 (FR4). Generally, roots were found to have an overall lowest concentration of total alkaloids than shoots whereas an overall highest concentration of total alkaloids was recorded in the shoots (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Both soilless media SS and SP had equivalent and the highest influence on the total alkaloid concentration in the shoot under fertigation regime 3(FR3). This was followed by the soilless media SC while the least influence on the shoot was observed in SV media. Similarly, the root had the lowest alkaloid concentration in SV media under fertigation regime 4, followed by SC media under FR2; SS media under FR2 and FR3; then SP media under FR4 which recorded the highest alkaloid concentration in the root.
