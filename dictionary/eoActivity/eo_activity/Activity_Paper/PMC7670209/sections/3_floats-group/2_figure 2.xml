  <p>Comparing the results of 
   <italic>S. tortuosum</italic> root vs shoot total alkaloid concentration in response to 4 different soilless media and five fertigation regimes in hydroponics. Treatment SSFR3 was selected for the control. Mean values ± SE are shown in columns. The mean values with different letters are significantly different at P ≤ 0.001 (∗∗∗) as calculated by Fisher's Least Significant Difference. FR1 = fertigation regime 1; FR2 = fertigation regime 2; FR3 = fertigation regime 3; FR4 = fertigation regime 4; FR5 = fertigation regime 5.
