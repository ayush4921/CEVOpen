<p>A preparation of 80% ethanolic extract of the stem bark of 
 <italic>Nauclea pobeguinii</italic>, containing 5.6% of the beta-carboline alkaloid strictosamide as the presumed active agent, displayed highly promising activity against 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria in a Phase IIB clinical trial as a herbal medicine (Mesia et al., 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). A beta carboline alkaloid, 
 <bold>8</bold>, was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the bark of the same plant and showed moderate activity against the causative agent of sleeping sickness, 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, with a Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 12.5 μg/mL and low cytotoxicity against PNT2A cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;100 μg/mL (Igoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Two other alkaloids, compounds 
 <bold>9</bold> and 
 <bold>10</bold>, with similar moderate trypanocidal activity were obtained from the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Monodora myristica</italic>, showing MICs of 12.5 and 25 μg/mL, respectively, for 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> (Igoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).
