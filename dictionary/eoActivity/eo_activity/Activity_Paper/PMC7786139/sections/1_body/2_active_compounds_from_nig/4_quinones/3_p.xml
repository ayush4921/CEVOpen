 <italic>Cassia nigricans</italic> is a herbal plant used to treat various fevers in Nigeria. The methanol extract of the whole plant yielded an antiplasmodial compound, emodin 
 <bold>(57)</bold>, an anthraquinone with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 10.8 μg/mL in chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain K1 (Obodozie et al., 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In another study 
 <bold>57</bold> was isolated from a methanol stem bark extract of another plant from the same genus, 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic>, and confirmed to have strong activity against multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> K1 strain (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5 μg/mL) (Ajaiyeoba et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Such independent confirmation of the activity is obviously important but unfortunately rare, in part because such data are harder to publish.
