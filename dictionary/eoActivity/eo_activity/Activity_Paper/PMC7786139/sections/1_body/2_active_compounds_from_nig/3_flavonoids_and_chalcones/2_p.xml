<p>We have reported the isolation of two flavonols, 
 <bold>50</bold> and 
 <bold>51</bold>, from the combined hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of the roots of 
 <italic>Spondias mombim</italic> and the methanolic extract of the bark of 
 <italic>Alcornea cordifolia</italic>, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>50</bold> displayed poor activity against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 25 μg/mL) whereas 
 <bold>51</bold>, different only by a single hydroxy substituent on the 5′ position, showed quite remarkable activity against this parasite (EC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt;0.2 μg/mL). However, 
 <bold>51</bold> also displayed toxicity against PNT2A prostatic cells with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.5 μg/mL and would thus be too toxic for therapeutic use (Igoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Nonetheless, it might be worth exploring structural variations with the 5′-OH substitution in a SAR study.
