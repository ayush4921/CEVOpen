<p>Treatment of 
 <italic>Trypanosoma congolense</italic>-infected mice with the crude ethanol extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>Mitracarpus scaber</italic>, a popular medicinal plant with known antifungal and antimicrobial properties (Irobi and Daramola, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Ekpendu et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>), at 50 and 150 mg/Kg/day cleared parasitaemia within 6 and 2 days, respectively, with no relapse for about 2 months. Benz(g)isoquinoline 5,10 dione (Azaanthraquinone; 
 <bold>56</bold>) was isolated from the extract. It completely lysed 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> cells within 60 min at a concentration of 5 μM, and dose-dependently inhibited their motility and respiration (Nok, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Nok investigated the mechanism of action further and concluded that this 
 <italic>M. scaber</italic> quinone (
 <bold>56</bold>) interferes with the essential function of coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) in the trypanosomes, which carries electrons for aerobic respiration from mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to the Trypanosome Alternative Oxidase (TAO) (Ebiloma et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>). This is a rare example where the mechanism of the antiparasite action of a natural compound is well-understood. Considering that 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> spp. are even more susceptible to TAO inhibitors than 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> (Ebiloma et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>), due to differences in their mitochondrial pathways, it would be worth revisiting the wider trypanocidal activities of 
 <bold>56</bold> (for the structures of compounds 
 <bold>56</bold>–
 <bold>60</bold>, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).
