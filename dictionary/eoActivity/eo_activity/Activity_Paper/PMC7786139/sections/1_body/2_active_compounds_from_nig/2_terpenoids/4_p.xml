<p>The Indian-native ornamental plant 
 <italic>Polyalthia longifolia</italic>, commonly found in Nigeria is an important source of traditional remedies for malaria and fevers (Bankole et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The hexane extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>P. longifolia</italic> showed potent activity against 
 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic> in our lab, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM of 2.4 ± 0.1 μg/mL. Bioactivity-guided fractionation led to the isolation of a diterpenoid identified as clerodane (16-α-hyroxy-cleroda-3-13(-14)-Z-dien-15,16-olide; compound 
 <bold>33</bold>), which displayed an EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM of 0.38 ± 0.05 μg/mL against 
 <italic>T. b. brucei</italic>. Other isolated compounds from the fraction were polyalthialdioc acid 
 <bold>(34)</bold> and kolavenic acid 
 <bold>(35)</bold>, which also showed significant antitrypanosomal activity, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SEM values of 3.57 ± 0.16 and 12.3 ± 0.5 μg/mL, respectively. Interestingly, all the 3 compounds also showed activity against 
 <italic>T. congolense</italic> and 
 <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, presented no cross-resistance to diamidines and arsenicals, and were not toxic to Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells at up to 200 μg/mL (Ebiloma et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>33</bold> has also been previously described as an oral antileishmanial agent with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity (Misra et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). We further investigated the effect of 
 <bold>33</bold> and reported a multi-target mechanism of action for the compound on 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, including severe cell cycle defects, DNA fragmentation, ATP depletion, and a marked depolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Ebiloma et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2018b</xref>).
