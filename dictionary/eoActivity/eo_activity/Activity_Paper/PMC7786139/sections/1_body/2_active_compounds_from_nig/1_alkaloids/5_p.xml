<p>Imieje et al. (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) screened the crude methanolic extract and different fractions of 
 <italic>Enantia chlorantha</italic> (African Whitewood, family Annonaceae), which is used in Nigerian ethnomedicine for the treatment of wounds, ulcers, and fevers including malaria, for antiprotozoal activity and reported that the extract indeed displayed very high activity against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with very good IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against chloroquine-sensitive D6 (&lt;0.37 μg/mL) and chloroquine-resistant W2 (&lt;0.32 μg/mL) clones as well as against 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt;0.8 μg/mL), but only moderate activity against 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15.2 μg/mL). The butanol and ethanol fractions of the extract yielded three closely related isoquinoline alkaloids: jatrorrhizine (
 <bold>11</bold>), palmatine (
 <bold>12</bold>), and columbamine (
 <bold>13</bold>). The steroid β-sitosterol (
 <bold>14</bold>) was also obtained from the extracts. Compound 
 <bold>11</bold> displayed good but only moderately specific activity against chloroquine-sensitive 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clone D6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.2 μM), but activity against 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> was low (IC
 <sub>50</sub>s &gt;29.6 and 18.3 μM, respectively), and IC
 <sub>50</sub>s &gt;14.1 and &gt;29.6 to VERO and human acute monocytic leukemia (THP1) cells, respectively. Compounds 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold> showed essentially identical activity as 
 <bold>11</bold> against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> D6 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.90 and 2.16 μM, respectively, showing that the methylation of the isoquinoline hydroxy groups is not essential for activity, whereas 
 <bold>14</bold> displayed only moderate activity (Pf IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;11.5). Compounds 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> were also tested against 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ≥23.1 μM (Imieje et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
