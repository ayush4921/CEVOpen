<p>People living in resource-poor communities in Nigeria and elsewhere continue to depend largely on natural product-derived medicines (particularly those of plant origin) to combat many pathological conditions, notwithstanding the dearth of pharmacological elucidation of their mechanisms of action and of standard clinical trials. This is often due to personal beliefs, economic reasons, or difficulty in accessing pharmaceutical products. In contrast to combinatorial chemistry, natural products provide enormous structural diversity, creating the opportunity to discover novel lead compounds. It is estimated that about 75,000 species of flowering plants are known to exist on earth, out of which only about 10% have been investigated for possible therapeutic value against any condition. Out of this 10%, only 1â€“5% have been scientifically researched for any bioactivity (Amit Koparde et al.,
