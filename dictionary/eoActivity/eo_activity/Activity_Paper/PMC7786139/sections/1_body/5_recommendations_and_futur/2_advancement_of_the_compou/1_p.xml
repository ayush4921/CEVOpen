<p>The process of drug development takes 7–15 years of hard work, huge funding, and is comprised of four stages each having multiple steps: (1) the discovery stage, involving successful demonstration of the compound as being potent against the target parasites; (2) the pre-clinical development stage where the compounds are tried in various laboratory animals to understand their safety, pharmacology, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> potency, and possible mechanism of action; (3) the clinical development stage, which is comprised of five phases of clinical trials; and (4) the approval stage where regulatory bodies evaluate the accumulated data of stages 1–3 and take a decision to approve or reject their use as medicines for specific applications. Certainly, some of the 93 compounds highlighted fulfill the 
 <italic>prima facie</italic> criteria to move from stage 1 to stage 2, and considerations such as compound availability, ease of synthesis, selectivity, solubility, stability etc. would aid in prioritization. It is logical to explore a shortlist further and progress them through the DDP with the overall aim to get new approved medicine(s) for malaria and some NTDs, from the current collection of compounds, although further discovery efforts, coupled to innovative dereplication, remain important. To achieve this, and in order to enhance success within shorter time, it is recommendable that Nigerian scientists form interdisciplinary networks internally, with collaborators within as well as outside the continent, and with pharmaceutical companies and/or international non-profit organizations. One highly encouraging and very recent development is the partnership between the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), Institut Pasteur Korea (IPK) and Fundación MEDINA, funded by La Caixa Health Research [Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>]. This will allow the screening of the large natural compounds library of Fundación MEDINA against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> and 
 <italic>T. cruzi</italic> by IPK, using state-of-the art high-throughput imaging technologies. This development shows the added value of large compound libraries held and curated centrally, over the dispersed efforts of many small-scale efforts, when it comes to securing the needed funding and infrastructure. A national or, better, regional repository for medicinal plant species, extracts, and natural compounds should be established in Nigeria as a partner for international funders and consortia. While much excellent work has been done by the individual laboratories, results are not necessarily comparable between them, due to differences in test strains and procedures, among other factors. Nor are compounds produced this way, on a necessarily small scale and often sub-optimally stored, easily available for further experimentation. The proposed facility should be curated by a Society of Herbal Medicine, with State funding.
