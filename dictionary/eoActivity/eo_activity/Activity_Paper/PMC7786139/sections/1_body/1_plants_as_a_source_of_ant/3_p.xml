<p>For centuries, the bark of 
 <italic>Cinchona</italic> species was used by the natives living in the Amazon area for the treatment of malaria caused by 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Interestingly, as early as 1820, Pelletier and Caventou successfully isolated quinine, the bioactive principle, from the bark of 
 <italic>Cinchona officinalis</italic> (Dias et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Consequently, the curative agent for malaria in those early days was quinine. Subsequently, several synthetic derivatives including chloroquine, mefloquine, amodiaquine, and primaquine were developed. The long history of usage notwithstanding, i.e., first as extract preparations and later as pure compound, malaria chemotherapy is still to an extent dependent on quinine; this is especially true for the most lethal form, cerebral malaria. Interestingly, while resistance to the synthetic derivatives such as chloroquine developed rapidly, resistance to quinine itself is relatively rare (Achan et al.,
