<p>In addition to the challenge of the tedious process flow from the screening of medicinal plants to the isolation of new bioactive principle(s) with low yield, the subsequent determination of the exact mechanism of action of the isolated compound requires expertise, experience, the appropriate research environment (infrastructure and equipment) and substantial amounts of funding. But due to research and resource limitations, finding a robust and viable lead candidate for the drug discovery pipeline has become a challenging scientific task. Hence, the majority of the research efforts aimed at identifying drug leads end up at the level of crude extract testing stage, which is not very informative and fails to give a usable measure of activity as the concentration of the active molecule(s) is unknown. Moreover, the amount of active compound in the extract is likely to be different between preparations.</p>
