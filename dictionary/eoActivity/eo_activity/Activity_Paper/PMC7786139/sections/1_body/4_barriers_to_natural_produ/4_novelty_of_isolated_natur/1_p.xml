<p>The majority of compounds isolated from plants will have been previously reported, and such compounds lacking novelty are unlikely to be advanced into drug development and less likely to lead to academic publications. In fact, over 200,000 isolated natural compounds have so far been reported in the scientific literature using the traditional natural product extraction and purification methods (Walsh and Yang, 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This means that there is a high probability of identifying known rather than novel molecules using the standard bioassays guided fractionation and identification of lead compounds, thus often giving a poor return on investment.
