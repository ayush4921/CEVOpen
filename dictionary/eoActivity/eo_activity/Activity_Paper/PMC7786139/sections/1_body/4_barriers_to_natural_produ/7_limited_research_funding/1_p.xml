<p>As explained above, the processes involved in the isolation, purification, and chemical characterization of the bioactive agents are expensive and time-consuming. Together with potential worries about continuous access to sufficient quantities of the natural compound, this makes the pharmaceutical industries less interested in investing in such ventures. This lack of investment is further compounded by the problem of reduced funding of academic research institutions, which hinders the provision of modern state-of-the-art facilities including such that enable long-term storage and (high-throughput) screening of natural products-based compound libraries. Scale-up of the production of natural compounds with complex (stereo)-chemistry that elude viable commercial synthesis can be another major hurdle, especially for compounds from relatively rare and/or slow-growing plants, or where very low or variable concentrations of active compounds are found in the primary plant source.</p>
