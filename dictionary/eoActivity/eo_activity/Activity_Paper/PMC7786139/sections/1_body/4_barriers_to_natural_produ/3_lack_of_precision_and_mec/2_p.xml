<p>In addition, the therapeutic effect of natural remedies may be through immuno-modulation rather than a direct antimicrobial activity. Assaying for antimicrobial properties, a compound with immunomodulatory properties will not show bioactivity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> during the traditional bioassay-guided screening of the complex extract mixture and will be ruled out. This is a serious impediment to determining the exact active principle in a medicinal plant or its extract unless the primary screen is based on an infectious animal model. Furthermore, some natural compounds may exhibit a combined or synergistic effect in their mode of action. Hence, such compounds, when isolated in their pure form, may not appear to have promising activity in the bioassay screening protocol (Druilhe et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>; Williamson, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Wagner, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A prominent example is the case of the presently leading anti-malarial plant, 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>. Herbal teas prepared from the dried leaves of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> are found to be 6â€“18 folds more effective at killing the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites than the isolated active anti-malarial agent, artemisinin (Wan et al., 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Wright et al., 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These possible scenarios can frustrate efforts toward identifying the bioactive compound(s) from some plants/extracts that show initial promise.
