  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">The 
   <italic>Bergenia</italic> species are perennial herbs native to central Asia, and one of the most promising medicinal plants of the family Saxifragaceae which are popularly known as ‘Pashanbheda’. The aim of this study was to evaluate antioxidant and 
   <italic>α-</italic>amylase, 
   <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase, lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, and cholinesterases inhibition potential of 
   <italic>Bergenia pacumbis</italic> of Nepali origin collected from the Karnali region of Nepal.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">The sequential crude extracts were made in hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water. Antioxidant activities were analyzed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay. The 
   <italic>α-</italic>amylase, 
   <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase, lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition were analyzed by the 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA), p-Nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG), 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB), l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide (AAAPVN), acetylthiocholine, and butyrylcholine as a respective substrate. The major metabolites were identified by high performance liquid chromatography with electron spray ionization- quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) profiling.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">Our results revealed the great antioxidant ability of crude extract of 
   <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> in ethyl acetate extract against both DPPH (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 30.14 ± 0.14 μg/mL) and ABTS (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 17.38 ± 1.12 μg/mL). However, the crude methanol extract of 
   <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> showed the comparable enzymes inhibitions with standard drugs; 
   <italic>α-</italic>amylase (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 14.03 ± 0.04 μg/mL), 
   <italic>α-</italic>glucosidase (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 0.29 ± 0.00 μg/mL), lipase (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 67.26 ± 0.17 μg/mL), tyrosinase (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 58.25 ± 1.63 μg/mL), elastase (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 74.00 ± 3.03 μg/mL), acetylcholinesterase (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 31.52 ± 0.58 μg/mL), and butyrylcholinesterase (IC
   <sub>50</sub> = 11.69 ± 0.14 μg/mL). On the basis of HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS profiling of metabolites, we identified major compounds such as Bergenin, Catechin, Arbutin, Gallic acid, Protocatechuic acid, Syringic acid, Hyperoside, Afzelechin, Methyl gallate, Paashaanolactone, Astilbin, Quercetin, Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, Diosmetin, Phloretin, and Morin in methanol extract which has reported beneficial bioactivities.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Our study provides a plethora of scientific evidence that the crude extracts of 
   <italic>B. pacumbis</italic> from Nepalese origin in different extracting solvents have shown significant potential on inhibiting free radicals as well as enzymes involved in digestion, skin related problems, and neurological disorders compared with the commercially available drugs.
