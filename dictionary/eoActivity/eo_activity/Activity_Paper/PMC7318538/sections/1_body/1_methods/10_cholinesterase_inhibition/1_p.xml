<p id="Par52">Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition assays were performed accordingly with Samaradivakara et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] with some modifications. At first, 0.05 U/mL of AChE or 0.5 U/mL of BChE, and plant extract of different concentrations were mixed and incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. Then, 1 mM acetylthiocholine iodide or 1.5 mM of butyrylcholine iodide and 0.5 mM DNTB were added to the reaction mixture followed by an additional 10 min of incubation. The total reaction volume was maintained to 200 μL by the addition of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The absorbance was measured at λ = 412 nm in a 96-microplate reader. 1% DMSO and Galantamine were used as positive control and reference respectively. The percentage of cholinesterases inhibition was calculated as follows.
