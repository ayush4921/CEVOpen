<p>Inflammation is a primary protective reaction that is given to return the damaged tissue due to injurious stimuli. This response involves extravasation of neutrophils through the capillary network and then activation of macrophages, which generate different proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, interleukins, and interferons, which participate in the regulation of inflammatory reactions. There are not many studies that have evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> components. The study made by Silva et al. (2017) highlighted the anti-inflammatory activity of the aqueous extract and the polysaccharide fraction obtained from 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> in experimental models of acute inflammation. The doses used were 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally. They acted through mechanisms that involve modulating mediators, such as histamine, serotonin, PGE2, and bradykinin, and diminishing vascular permeability and neutrophil migration to the affected site. The aqueous extract and the polysaccharide fraction of 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), diminished both COX-2 and iNOS activity, and diminished oxidative stress. High doses of aqueous extract and fraction of polysaccharides obtained from 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> of 300 mg/kg did not result in gastric toxicity [
