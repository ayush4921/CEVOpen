<p>The in vivo study performed by Siveen and Kuttan (2011b) demonstrated the antitumor effect of thujone in the malignant ascites lymphoma model (Dalton). Thujone, a monoterpene naturally found in 
 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic>, has been shown to increase the number of leukocytes and bone marrow cells. This increased the proliferation of splenocytes and thymocytes, both in the presence and absence of specific mitogenes. Thujone stimulated cell mediated immune response and production of IL-2 and IFN-Î³ [

 <italic>T. occidentalis</italic> ethanolic extract has been shown to have anticancer properties on the malignant melanoma cell line A375. In the same study, thujone was shown to have an antiproliferative effect and the ability to induce apoptosis [
