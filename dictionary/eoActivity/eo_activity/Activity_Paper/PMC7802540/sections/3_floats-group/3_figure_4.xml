  <p>TLR2/4‐dependent activation of MAPK signaling. (a) RAW264.7 cells were treated with HMR (50 μg/ml) for the indicated times. (b) RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with C29 (100 μM) or TAK‐242 (5 μM) for 2 hr and then co‐treated with HMR (50 μg/ml) for 6 hr. Each protein level was investigated using Western blot analysis. Actin was used as a loading control. *
