<p>It is known that macrophages among immune cells contribute to maintaining resistance to external pathogens and homeostasis of the human body through innate and adaptive immune responses (Daliri, Choi, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Hirayama et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Activated macrophage secrete various immunostimulatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin‐1β (IL‐1β), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), interleukin‐12 (IL‐12), tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α), and monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1 (MCP‐1), which are known to perform innate immune responses by destroying external pathogens that have penetrated into the human body (Hirayama et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In addition, these immunostimulatory factors induce macrophage phagocytosis to engulf and remove external pathogens (Martinez &amp; Gordon, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Macrophages have the ability to present antigens to T cells and also function as effectors of cell‐mediated immunity (Daliri, Kim, et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Hirayama et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). In addition, various immunostimulatory factors produced by macrophages have been reported to activate T cells and B cells (Bordet et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Craxton et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Guerriero, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Lapaque et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). These reports show that macrophages can contribute to the adaptive immune response as well as the innate immune response. Therefore, it has been recognized that activation of macrophages related to innate immunity and adaptive immunity helps strengthen the body's immune system.
