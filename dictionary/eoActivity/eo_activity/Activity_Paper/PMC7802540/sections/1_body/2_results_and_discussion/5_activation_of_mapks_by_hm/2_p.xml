<p>In Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we confirmed that HMR depends on MAPKs to induce the production of immunomodulators in RAW264.7 cells. Thus, we investigated whether HMR activates MAPK signaling in RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, HMR induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 and JNK indicating the MAPK activation. And since TLR2 and TLR4 activate MAPK signaling, we investigated the effect of TLR2 and TLR4 on HMR‐mediated MAPK activation. As a result (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), inhibition of TLR2 by C29 and TLR4 by TAK‐242 reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK induced by HMR when compared to cells treated with HMR only. Based on these results, it is thought HMR may induce the activation of MAPK signaling pathway through TLR2 and TLR4.
