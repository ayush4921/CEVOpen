<p>Ginseng (
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> Meyer) has been regarded as one of the representative traditional herbal medicines related to immune enhancement worldwide (Kang &amp; Min, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). It has been reported that wild simulated ginseng, a type of ginseng, also increases phagocytosis and promotes the production of various immunomodulators in macrophages (Jung et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Thus, we compared the degree of macrophage activation of HMR with ginseng (G) and wild simulated ginseng (WSG) through the production of immunomodulators in RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, when compared to cells treated with WSG or G, the production of immunomodulator such as NO, iNOS, IL‐1β, IL‐6, and TNF‐a was highest in HMR‐treated RAW264.7 cells. In view of this result, HMR is a potential herbal resource that can replace ginseng in immunotherapy for the treatment of human diseases.
