<p>Macrophages, one of the immune cells with phagocytosis, are known to contribute to the innate and adaptive immune responses to increase the body's immunity (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Therefore, studies on natural products capable of activating macrophages are being actively conducted to rapidly respond to external pathogens before the adaptive immune response of the human body is activated. The mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells have been commonly used to evaluate immune‐enhancing activity through macrophage activation in vitro. Thus, we first analyzed the immunomodulatory factors such as NO, iNOS, IL‐1β, IL‐6, IL‐12, TNF‐α, and MCP‐1 secreted by RAW264.7 cells after HMR treatment to evaluate whether HMR activates macrophage. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, HMR promoted NO secretion in macrophages in a dose‐dependent manner. In addition, the expressions of immunomodulators such as iNOS, IL‐1β, IL‐6, IL‐12, TNF‐α, and MCP‐1 were increased by HMR treatment in RAW264.7 cells (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). It is well‐known that the innate immune response by macrophages is triggered by the phagocytosis against the external pathogens (Aderem &amp; Underhill, 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>). It is well‐known that these immunomodulators secreted by activated macrophages contribute to the elimination of external pathogens by increasing the phagocytosis of macrophages (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Thus, we analyzed the effect of HMR on the macrophage phagocytosis through Neutral Red staining assay. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, it was observed that the Neutral Red uptake of RAW264.7 cells was increased depending on the treatment concentration of HMR. It is thought that HMR activates the macrophage phagocytosis because increasing of Neutral Red uptake by macrophages indicates the activation of macrophage phagocytosis. However, because it is known that excessive secretion of immunomodulatory factors by macrophages acts as a chronic inflammatory factor or is cytotoxic to macrophages (Taylor et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>), we investigated whether HMR showed cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, there was no cytotoxicity against RAW264.7 cells at 25 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml concentrations of HMR. However, at a concentration of 100 μg/ml of HMR, it showed somewhat cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells, but the viability of RAW264.7 cells was more than 80%. Based on these results, it is thought that the immunomodulators induced by HMR in RAW264.7 cells may contribute to the enhancement of the immune system of human body. Lastly, we analyzed the production of immunomodulators of the HMR and HML since it is known to that HML also has various pharmacological activities. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn32020-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, when compared to HMR‐treated cells, NO production was not induced in HML‐treated cells, and the expression of immunomodulators such as NO, iNOS, IL‐1β, and TNF‐α was also weak in HML‐treated cells. In view of this result, it is judged that it may be better to use HMR rather that HML when developing functional agents for enhancing immune system using
