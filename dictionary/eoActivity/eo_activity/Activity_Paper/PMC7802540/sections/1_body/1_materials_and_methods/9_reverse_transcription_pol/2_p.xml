<p>After the sample treatment was completed, the RAW264.7 cells were washed three time with cold 1 × PBS. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using a RNeasy Mini Kit, and after quantitation of total RNA, cDNA was synthesized using a Verso cDNA Kit (Thermo Scientific) from 1 μg of total RNA. Then, the target genes were amplified using a PCR Master Mix Kit (Promega) and the primers. The sequences of the primers used in this study were as follows: iNOS: forward 5′‐ttgtgcatcgacctaggctggaa‐3′ and reverse 5′‐gacctttcgcattagcatggaagc‐3′, IL‐1β: forward 5′‐ggcaggcagtatcactcatt‐3′ and reverse 5′‐cccaaggccacaggtattt‐3′, IL‐6: forward 5′‐gaggataccactcccaacagacc‐3′ and reverse 5′‐aagtgcatcatcgttgttcataca‐3′, IL‐12: forward 5′‐aaccagacccgcccaagaac‐3′ and reverse 5′‐gatcctgagcttgcacgcaga‐3′, TNF‐α: forward 5ʹ‐tggaactggcagaagaggca‐3ʹ and reverse 5ʹ‐tgctcctccacttggtggtt‐3ʹ, MCP‐1: forward 5′‐ggaaaaatggatccacaccttgc‐3′ and reverse 5′‐tctcttcctccaccaccatgcag‐3′, GAPDH: forward 5′‐ggactgtggtcatgagcccttcca‐3′ and reverse 5′‐actcacggcaaattcaacggcac‐3′. The PCR results were visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis. The density of mRNA bands was calculated using the software UN‐SCAN‐IT gel version 5.1 (Silk Scientific Inc.).</p>
