<p>Cytotoxicity to RAW264.7 cells was verified using MTT assay. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were dispensed into 96‐well plates and cultured until 70%–80% confluence. Then, cells were treated with HMR and subsequently cultured for 24 hr. After HMR treatment, cells were added with 50 μl of MTT solution (1 mg/ml) for 4 hr. Then, the cell culture medium was removed and 100 μl of DMSO was treated elute the resulting crystals from RAW264.7 cells. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Human Cop., Xma‐3000PC).
