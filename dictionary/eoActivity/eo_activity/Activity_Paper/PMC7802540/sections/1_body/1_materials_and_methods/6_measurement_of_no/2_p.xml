<p>The effect of HMR or HML on NO production in RAW264.7 cells was evaluated by Griess assay. Briefly, RAW264.7 cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were dispensed into 12‐well plates and cultured until 70%–80% confluence. Then, cells were treated with HMR or HML for 24 hr. After HMR treatment, Griess solution was added to the cell culture medium in a 1:1 ratio, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then, the absorbance was measured at 540 nm using UV/Visible spectrophotometer (Human Cop., Xma‐3000PC).
