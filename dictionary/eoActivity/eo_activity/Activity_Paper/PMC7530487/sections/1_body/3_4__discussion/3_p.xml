<p>Increase of arsenic concentration is responsible for the increase of mortality rate as shown in the subacute and subchronic toxicity results (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The studies showed that chronic exposure to arsenic through well waters has led to peripheral vascular disease referred to as black foot disease [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic may lead to various cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemic heart diseases, and ventricular arrhythmias [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The ability of arsenic to stimulates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase present in the plasma membrane of vascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) causing increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxides and hydrogen peroxide has also been reported [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. ROS generation due to exposure to arsenic and nitric oxide (NO) made up peroxynitrite which is a strong oxidant that mediates inflammatory process such as cyclooxygenase-2 [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].
