<p>Cholinesterase or choline esterase belongs to the esterase family; these include set of enzymes that break acetylcholine to choline-based esters [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, the mechanisms of action of these enzymes are either of the two: speed up the hydrolysis of cholinergic neurotransmitters (acetylcholine) or metabolize acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid. These biochemical reactions are very vital to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its normal resting state after activation [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, acetylcholine at a motor enclave triggers muscle contraction, for the muscle to relax afterward cholinesterase has to act to neutralize acetylcholine rather than remaining locked in a tense state [
