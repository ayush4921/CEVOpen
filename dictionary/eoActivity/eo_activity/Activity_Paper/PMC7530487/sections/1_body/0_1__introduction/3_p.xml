<p>Javanese medaka fishes belong to the genus Oryzias, commonly found in fresh and salt water in Asia. The genus has about 20 species that are small in size (usually less than 4â€‰cm) and highly transparent [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They are mostly present in shallow nonmoving or slow moving stream near the shore or bank, often found in rice paddy, ponds, irrigation channels, and small creeks. Almost all species of this genus are surface swimmers with relatively large eyes at the sides and slightly flattened head that are easily recognized by looking down the swimming fish from above [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among this genus 
 <italic>O. latipes</italic> species has already been confirmed as one of the best experimental fish for several studies. The fish has been used as a unique model for molecular studies, genomic sequence, informatics study, and transgenic study [

 <italic>O. javanicus</italic> and 
 <italic>O. dancena</italic> that are among the popularly used models in environmental sciences research. They are commonly found in Southeast Asia due to their wide distribution in the region. They can easily be acclimatized and kept in both fresh and salt water, although the former prefers fishes that can withstand hyperosmotic environment and the latter prefers fishes that can withstand hypoosmotic environment [
