<p>Stock solution was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> crude seed extract in 1 mL of 100% DMSO (100 mg/mL). The use of DMSO was to solubilize the crude extract, since the extract is not absolutely soluble in aqua solvent. Preparation of substocks solution in microliter (
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was done by diluting the stock solution to the concentration of interest using distilled water. Working solution was prepared from substock solution using twofold serial dilution with distilled water at eight concentrations ranging from 7.81 to 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in a 96-well microplate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. DMSO (vehicle) was maintained at 0.1% in all concentration of extract.
