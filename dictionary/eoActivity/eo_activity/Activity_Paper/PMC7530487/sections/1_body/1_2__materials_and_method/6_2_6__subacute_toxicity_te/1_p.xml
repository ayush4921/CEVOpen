<p>Subacute toxicity test of 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> seed crude extract was carried out on adult Javanese medaka (
 <italic>Oryzias javanicus</italic>) (length of 1.9–2.7 cm, weight of 0.1–0.3 g, and age of 6 months). The experiment was conducted in 2 days using chlorine-free tap water as reported by the OECD guideline for testing chemicals. Javanese medaka of both sexes was randomly selected and exposed to a particular dose of crude extract in a 3-liter capacity rectangular glass aquarium that contained 5 fish each. Five different concentrations (62.5–1000 mg/L) were used and each concentration has three replicates alongside the control group. Continuous monitoring of mortality was carried out and dead fishes were confirmed after the operculum movement was no longer detected and inability of the fishes to respond when touched with a glass rod. Dead fishes were immediately removed from the tank. The exposed fishes were then transferred to new tanks containing chlorine-free tap water after 24 hours of exposure. Fishes were feed before the experiment. The behaviors of fishes were monitored regularly during the experiment by taking note of abnormal behavior or sign of death [

The experiments were conducted in compliance with the internationally accepted principles for laboratory animals use and care as well as ethical clearance by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), Universiti Putra Malaysia (ref. no. UPM/IACUC/AUP-R005/2016).
