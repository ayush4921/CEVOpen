<p>The result of 14-day chronic toxicity test of crude extract on adult J. medaka shows high mortality at concentration above 150 mg/L. All the fishes at 250 mg/L concentration died at day 12, those at 300 mg/L died at day 7, those at 350 mg/L died at day 4, and those at 400 mg/L died at day 3 of the experimental study (
