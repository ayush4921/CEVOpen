<p>We have reconstituted and tested plant-based whole formulations as described in historical documents. The recommended recipe details a specific ratio of 1:16:4 for the plant paste, water, and sesame oil, which we suitably recapitulated. In the traditional context in which they were used, the remedies, prepared as per the recommended formulation and concentrations, were applied to the surfaces of wounds. We have recapitulated this “dosage” by applying the whole remedy to the surface of the biofilm (eradication assays) or studied the growth of biofilms in this formulation (biofilm formation assays) (
