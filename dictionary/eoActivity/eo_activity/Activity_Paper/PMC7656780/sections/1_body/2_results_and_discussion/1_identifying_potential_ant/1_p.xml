<p>Originating in the Indian subcontinent, Ayurveda is a traditional system of medicine, with historical compendia of practices and preparations built over 2,000 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given the established association of biofilm infections with non-healing, chronic wounds (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bjarnsholt et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">DeLeon et al., 2014</xref>), we searched for traditional antimicrobial remedies with historical applications in the context of wounds. Across the foundational treatises, “
 <italic>Charaka Samhita</italic>” (compendium by 
 <italic>Charaka</italic>, 1st century AD (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">e-Samhita - National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage</xref>)) and “
 <italic>Sushruta Samhita</italic>” (compendium by 
 <italic>Sushruta</italic>, 4th century AD (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">e-Samhita - National Institute of Indian Medical Heritage</xref>)) the management of wounds (“
 <italic>Vrana</italic>”) and chronic, non-healing wounds (“
 <italic>Dushtavrana</italic>”), have received substantial attention, with evidence of treatment with plant-based remedies (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Parasuraman et al., 2014</xref>). In the compendium by 
 <italic>Sushruta</italic>, wounds are described to be of two types, “body” wounds (
 <italic>“Sharir Vran”</italic>), referring to wounds as a consequence of internal disease states, and external wounds (
 <italic>“Agantu Vran”</italic>) resulting from trauma, burns, and animal bites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Descriptions of ailments, and associated remedies, that translated (from Sanskrit) to “wounds” (“
 <italic>Vrana</italic>”), “wound healing” (“
 <italic>Vranaropana</italic>”), “ulcers,” and “non-healing ulcers” (“
 <italic>Dushtavrana</italic>”), were focused on, given their present-day association with biofilm infections (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Metcalf and Bowler, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Percival et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Abdullahi et al., 2016</xref>). We found evidence of non-healing wounds in the compendium of 
 <italic>Sushruta</italic>, translated as the “germination of maggots/worms due to flies on the wound can cause pain, swelling and bleeding” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). It is very likely that in this chronic state of tissue damage or necrosis, bacterial infections in the form of biofilms, will occur and prevail (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Bowler et al., 2001</xref>). The compendium also describes the principles of management of non-healing wounds (“
 <italic>Dushtavrana</italic>”) with the practice of washing the wound with a decoction of oil cooked with medicinal herbs, including “
 <italic>Surasa</italic>” or 
 <italic>“Tulsi</italic>” (Holy Basil) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). In the Ayurvedic Materia Medica (“
 <italic>Bhavaprakash Nighantu</italic>” (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">bhAvaprakAshanighaNTu</xref>)), the medical benefits of sesame oil are elucidated in detail, including its recommended use in medicinal oil formulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), and sesame oil is widely-used by Ayurvedic practitioners even today. Across compendia, we identified three medicinal plant-based formulations recommended for wound healing (“
 <italic>Vranaropana”)</italic>, 
 <italic>Kalanchoe pinnata</italic> (“
 <italic>Parnabeeja</italic>”), 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic> (Bermuda grass or “
 <italic>Durva</italic>”) and 
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> (Holy basil or “
 <italic>Tulsi</italic>”) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1F–H</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s7">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). All three medicinal plants have well known antimicrobial properties (
