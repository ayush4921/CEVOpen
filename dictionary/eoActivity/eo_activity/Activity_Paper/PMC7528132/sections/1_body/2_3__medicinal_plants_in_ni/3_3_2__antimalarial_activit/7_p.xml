<p>Research has shown that

 <italic>berghei</italic> (NK-65) in mice, and it was found that flavonoids, saponins, tannins, and carbohydrates are predominant in all parts of

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]; in addition, 8-demethylorosunol and orosunol were reported as two new 1-aryl-2, 3-naphthalide lignans from
