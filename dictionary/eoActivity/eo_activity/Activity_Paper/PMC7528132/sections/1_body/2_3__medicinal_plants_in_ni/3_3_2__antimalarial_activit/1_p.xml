<p>Malaria, a significant threat to global health, is responsible for the death of millions of people predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. The occurrence of multidrug-resistant malaria parasites has triggered efforts to develop combined formulations (such as artemether-lumefantrine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) and continuous research toward discovering better therapeutics. An

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] on the sensitivity pattern of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> to 
 <italic>Diospyros monbuttensis</italic> (“Egun eja”), 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> (“Ejirin”), and 
 <italic>Morinda lucida</italic> (“Oruwo”) recorded the lowest antiplasmodial activity with the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>lucida</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25 nM) while 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>monbuttensis</italic> recorded the highest activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.2 nM).
