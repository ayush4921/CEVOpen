<p>Both the ethyl acetate (22 ± 0.29 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) and butanol (21.01 ± 0.56 mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) fractions were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) higher compared to the aqueous residual fraction. Furthermore, the FRAP value of the organic fractions was greater as compared to the total extract. The butanol fraction of 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> was a more effective scavenger of DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> radical as opposed to the ethyl acetate and aqueous residual fractions (
