<p>The phenolic content varied significantly among the seven leaf extracts under study (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), with amounts ranging between 70.2 ± 4.72 mg and 385 ± 24.1 mg gallic acid equivalent/g. The total flavonoid levels ranged between 2.43 ± 0.06 mg and 12.9 ± 0.45 mg quercetin equivalent/g. Based on the spectrophotometric assay results, the estimated levels of phenolics and flavonoids were significantly the highest (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf extract as compared to the other investigated leaf extracts (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00303-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). While the proanthocyanidin content prevailed in the 
 <italic>E. sideroxyloides</italic> leaf, both the 
 <italic>S. lineata</italic> leaf and 
 <italic>T. bentzoë</italic> leaf had a remarkably negligible amount of proanthocyanidin detected by the butanol/HCl assay.
