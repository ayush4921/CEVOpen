<p>The nitric oxide radical scavenging activity was conducted in a 96-well plate. In total, 50 µL of aqueous extract (0 to 100 µg/mL) and 100 µL of 5 mM of sodium nitroprusside (in phosphate saline buffer, pH 7.4) was incubated at 25 °C for 150 min. After incubation, 125 µL of the reaction mixture was transferred to another 96-well plate, to which 100 µL of 0.33% sulfanilic acid in 20% glacial acetic acid was added. After 5 min, 100 µL of 0.1% of 
 <italic>N</italic>-1-napthyethylenediamine dihydrochloride was added and the pink coloration formed was read at 546 nm.
