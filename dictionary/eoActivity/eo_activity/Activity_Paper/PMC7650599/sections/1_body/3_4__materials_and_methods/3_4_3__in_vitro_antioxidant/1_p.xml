<p>The antioxidant potential of the extracts was investigated according to reported methods [

 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Extract vehicle and gallic acid (or otherwise stated) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The percentage activity of the extracts was calculated relative to the negative control. GraphPad Prism 6.01 software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used to plot the dose–response curves and to generate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values. All experiments were performed in triplicates in three independent assays. The results were expressed as mean ± SEM.
