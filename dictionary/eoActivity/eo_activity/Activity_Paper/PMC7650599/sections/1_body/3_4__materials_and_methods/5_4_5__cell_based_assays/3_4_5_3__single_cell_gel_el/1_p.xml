 <xref rid="B79-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, 30 µL of pre-treated cells were mixed with 70 µL of 1% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) low melting agarose (LMA) and 40 µL of the cell–LMA mixture was placed on frosted microscope slides pre-coated with 1.5% normal melting agarose. A coverslip was placed on top of the cell–LMA mix and allowed to solidify at 4 °C for 1 h in the dark. Following solidification, the coverslip was gently slid off and the slides were immersed in pre-chilled lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M EDTA, 10 mM Tris base, 1% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> Triton X-100 (added 30 min before use), pH 10, 4 °C) for 1 h in the dark. Following this period, the excess lysis solution was drained and the slides were submerged in electrophoresis buffer (0.2 M NaOH, 1 mM EDTA, pH 13, 4 °C) for 30 min in the dark, to allow the DNA to unwind.
