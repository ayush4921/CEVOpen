<p>The reaction mixture for the iron chelating activity contained 40 µL of plant extract (concentrations between 0 and 10 mg/mL), 10 µL of FeCl
 <sub>2</sub>⋅4H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.5 mM) and 150 µL of distilled deionized water. The mixture was incubated at ambient temperature for 5 min, before the addition of 10 µL of ferrozine (2.5 mM) and the absorbance was read at 562 nm.
