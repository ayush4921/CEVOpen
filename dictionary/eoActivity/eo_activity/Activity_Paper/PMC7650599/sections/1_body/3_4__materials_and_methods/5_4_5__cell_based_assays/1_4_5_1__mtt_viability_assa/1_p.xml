<p>The viability of the investigated cells treated with test samples was evaluated using the MTT cell viability assay as previously described [
 <xref rid="B75-pharmaceuticals-13-00303" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Following the overnight acclimatization of cells in 96-well plate, cells were treated with test samples for 48 h and assayed for different parameters. For the 96-well plate, the seeding densities for cancer cell lines and HOE cells were 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells and 2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well, respectively. All experiments were performed in triplicates (unless otherwise specified) in three independent assays. To compare the chemotherapeutic potential of the active extracts, the cytotoxicity of the extracts/purified compounds was evaluated against etoposide, a clinically used oncologic agent. The percentage cell viability relative to DMSO control (0.025% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>, final concentration) was calculated and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value determined using GraphPad Prism 6.01 software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
