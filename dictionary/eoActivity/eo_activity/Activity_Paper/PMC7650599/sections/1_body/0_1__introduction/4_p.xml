<p>The initiation and progression of cancer involve oxidative stress via DNA damage, and the increase of DNA mutations. Conventional chemo- and radiotherapy cause cancer cell death often through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but also unfortunately lead to severe side effects. It is highly desired to develop more effective therapies with less toxic effects [
