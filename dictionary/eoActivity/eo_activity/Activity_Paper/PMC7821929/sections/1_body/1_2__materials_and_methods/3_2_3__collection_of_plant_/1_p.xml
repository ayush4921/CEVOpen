<p>Bark of 
 <italic>A. salviifolium</italic> was collected from the plants near Mysore, India, and immediately transferred to liquid nitrogen and stored in −80 °C until further use. Two grams of bark tissue was powdered using a mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen. For extraction, 40 mL of degassed solution containing chloroform:methanol:water in the ratio of 1:2.5:1 (
