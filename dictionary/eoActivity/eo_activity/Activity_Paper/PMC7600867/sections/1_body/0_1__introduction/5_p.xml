<p>In addition, maintaining an elite line is problematic, because it is difficult to retain all of the superior properties of the parents during seed fruition. To compensate for these shortcomings, stem cutting nutrition methods are often used. However, it takes a long time to create the tuberous roots, and a cut seedling that is directly sown into the soil can easily be exposed to contaminants and damaged by infection. Contamination by viruses and other infectious agents reduces plant growth and decreases the quality of the tuberous roots, which leads to reduced herbal medicine production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop seedling cultivation techniques that can efficiently increase the quality of the tuberous roots and to establish a system for mass producing high-quality, uniform
