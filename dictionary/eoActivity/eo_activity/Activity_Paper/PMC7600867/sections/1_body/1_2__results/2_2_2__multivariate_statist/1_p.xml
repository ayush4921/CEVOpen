<p>If the 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> roots from CS plants, which were developed using tissue culture techniques under optimized conditions (hormones, etc.), are to be used as raw materials for the preparation of drugs, then the active materials in the tubers need to be identified so that the differences between the existing SS-derived plants in circulation and the CS-derived plants developed using the new cultivation method can be determined. The FT-NIR results verified the bioequivalence test findings. The FT-NIR analysis showed the same pattern for the peaks representing the two types of seedlings (SS and CS) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01280-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). The SS and CS samples were subjected to LC-MS analysis for bioequivalence validation. This allowed us to compare the chemical compositions between SS and CS samples, including the main component, TSG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01280-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). Each sample was extracted with 70% MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O using an ultrasonic cleaning bath. Then the chemical profile of the crude MeOH extract was tested using LC-MS. The LC-MS analysis revealed that the chemical profiles of the CS and SS extracts from 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> were almost identical (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01280-f004">Figure 4</xref>D), and one main compound, TSG, was detected in the LC-MS UV chromatogram at both 254 and 315 nm. The similar chemical profile patterns indicated that comparable amounts of active compounds were produced by the CS- and SS-derived plants. A calibration curve was plotted using standard TSG so that the TSG concentrations in the samples could be reliably determined.
