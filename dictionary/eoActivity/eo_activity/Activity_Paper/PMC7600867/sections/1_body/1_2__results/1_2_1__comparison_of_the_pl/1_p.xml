<p>The growth characteristics of the underground parts of the two 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> seedling types were investigated because the tuberous 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> root is used as a medicinal ingredient in Korean oriental medicine. The average fresh weight of all underground parts after 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> had been cultivated for 1 year was 327.9 ± 20.79 g for CSs and 243.5 ± 27.41 g for SSs. There was an 84.4 ± 34.40 g weight difference between the two types of 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> seedlings, and the total underground fresh weight was significantly higher for CS than for SS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01280-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The mean dry weights were 158.9 ± 13.0 g for CSs and 114.2 ± 14.62 g for SSs, which showed that the CS plants were heavier than the SS plants, although the difference was not significant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01280-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The mean fresh weights of the tubers alone were 291.1 ± 21.97 g for CSs and 167.0 ± 26.14 g for SSs. The CS tuber fresh and dry weights were significantly higher than the SS weights (
