<p>A range of five concentrations was used in triplicate to obtain a regression equation and to assess the response linearity (R
 <sup>2</sup>), limits of detection (LOD), and limits of quantification (LOQ). Linearity was evaluated by determining the R
 <sup>2</sup> value of the equation derived from the peaks for the serially diluted five concentrations. The results showed that the LOD and LOQ were acceptably low (

 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> types indicated that the quantitative levels of the TSG in the samples were 53.59 µg/mL for CS-derived plants and 50.75 µg/mL for SS-derived plants. The TSG levels were relatively higher in the CS-derived plants than in the SS-derived plants (
