<p>Furthermore, the administration of this monoterpene resulted in a suppression of the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (60.6% reduction in TNF-Î± mRNA levels) and MMP-9 of the colon matrix, as well as suppression of gene expressions and proteins induced by LPS, pro-inflammatory cytokines and c-Jun N-Terminal Kinases (JNKs, p54 and p46) belonging to the MAPK family, whose activation is related to inflammation and cell stress. Thus, perillaldehyde acts to improve intestinal inflammation via JNK-mediated cytokine regulation [
