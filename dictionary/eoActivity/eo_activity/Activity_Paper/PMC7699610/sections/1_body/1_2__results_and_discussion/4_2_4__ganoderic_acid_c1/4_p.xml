<p>In the study by Liu et al. (2015), ganoderic acid C1 (20 or 40 μg/mL) reduced the production of TNF-α by macrophages and blood mononuclear cells from individuals with CD. It decreased the production of IFN-γ and IL-17A in cell biopsies of inflamed colon. Additionally, it inhibited the production of TNF-α and other pro-inflammatory cytokines from mononuclear cells in the blood and inflamed colon mucosa of individuals with CD. These effects were attributed to negative NF-κB signaling. These results justify a clinical investigation for the treatment of CD [
