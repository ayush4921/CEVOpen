<p>Trivedi and Jena (2015) demonstrated that β-carotene treatment improved the severity of UC by modulating several molecular targets, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), IL-17, signal transducer and transcription activator 3, factor 2 related to nuclear erythroid 2, metalloproteinase-9 matrix and connective tissue growth factor. The NF-κB acts in the regulation of the inflammatory response, and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus influences the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The prevention of the nuclear translocation NF-κB can, therefore, act as a potential therapeutic target [

 <sub>h</sub>1 response as well as the expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules by epithelial and endothelial cells [
