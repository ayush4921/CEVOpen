<p>The association of EDA and (+)-borneol at doses of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg significantly reduced the disease activity index (DAI) with reduced body weight loss and colon length in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, EDA or (+)-borneol alone had moderate effects. Moreover, the immunofluorescence method revealed that the association of EDA and (+)-borneol at doses of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg drastically reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) and increased the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine associated with M2 macrophages (IL-10) when compared to EDA or (+)-borneol administered alone [
