<p>Furthermore, paeoniflorin improved oxidative stress by negatively regulating the NF-ÎºB pathway and by activating the nuclear factor 2 heme oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) signaling pathways in Caco-2 cells stimulated by LPS (Wu et al., 2019). The results suggest that paeoniflorin inhibits endothelial damage, has an anti-inflammatory effect, and can be a potential therapeutic agent against IBDs [
