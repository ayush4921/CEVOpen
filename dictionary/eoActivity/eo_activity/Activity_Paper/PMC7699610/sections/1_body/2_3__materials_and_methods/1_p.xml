<p>In this article, we reviewed studies published between January 2010 and April 2020 on terpenes active in IBDs. The research was carried out in databases such as Science Direct
 <sup>®</sup> and PubMed
 <sup>®</sup>, using keywords such as intestinal anti-inflammatory activity or ulcerative colitis or inflammatory bowel diseases and terpenes. The terpenes mentioned in this review were selected according to the pharmacological action demonstrated in specific experimental models to evaluate the intestinal anti-inflammatory activity in animal models or in in vitro studies or studies to elucidate their mechanism of action. We included studies conducted with isolated terpenes and excluded those in which terpenes were components from extracts or fractions to avoid the possible effect of interactions such as synergism or antagonism between compounds.
