<p>The mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity was measured using the MTT colorimetric assay. INS-1E cells were incubated for two days as described for cellular ATP levels assay. After 48 hr incubation with cytokine cocktail and bergenin, cells were observed under a contrast phase microscope before adding freshly prepared MTT solution. The medium was replaced with 200 μL of MTT, and the plates were incubated for 4 hr at 37°C. The dark blue formazan crystals were formed in the intact cells that were solubilized using 100 μL of DMSO. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm using SpectraMax 5M
