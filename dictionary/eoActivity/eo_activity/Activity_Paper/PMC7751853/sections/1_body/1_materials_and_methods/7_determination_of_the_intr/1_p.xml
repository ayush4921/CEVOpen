<p>The cellular ROS production was measured using fluorescent probe CM-H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA (Invitrogen, USA). INS-1E cells were seeded at 3 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in 96-well black fluorescence plates (Perkin Elmer, USA). After overnight incubation with 10 μM fluorescent probe CM-H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA, 150 μL of RPMI containing bergenin, and cytokine cocktail were added to each well for 48 hr. After incubation, fluorescence of the treated cells was measured (which corresponded to the intracellular ROS) using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (SpectraMax 5M
 <sup>e</sup>; Molecular Devices, USA) at excitation, and emission wavelengths of 485 and 530 nm, respectively.
