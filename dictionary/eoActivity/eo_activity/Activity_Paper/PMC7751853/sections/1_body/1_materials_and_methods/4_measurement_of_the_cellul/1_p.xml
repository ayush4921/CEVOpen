<p>For the measurement of cellular nitric oxide production, INS-1E cells were incubated for two days as described for cellular ATP levels assay. After treatment with cytokines and bergenin for 48 hr, 100 Î¼L modified Griess reagent (1:1 mixture of 1% sulfanilamide in 30% acetic acid and 0.1% 
 <italic>N</italic>-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in 60% acetic acid) was added to each well. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 540 nm using SpectraMax 5M
 <sup>e</sup> microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA).
