<p>The hypothesis of this study was that bergenin can protect beta cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis and can restore beta cell insulin secretory function. To demonstrate this, we employed cell-based assays and examined the effects of bergenin in two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with a cytokine cocktail (IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α). Using this strategy, we demonstrated that bergenin prevented cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis, and at the same time, restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Bergenin protected beta cells from the adverse effects of proinflammtory cytokines by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties.</p>
