Small molecules which can inhibit the cytokine-induced apoptosis could lead to new drug candidates that can be used in combination with existing therapeutic interventions against diabetes. The current study evaluated several effects of bergenin, an isocoumarin derivative, in beta cells in the presence of cytokines. These included (i) increase in beta cell viability (by measuring cellular ATP levels) (ii) suppression of beta cell apoptosis (by measuring caspase activity), (iii) improvement in beta cell function (by measuring glucose-stimulated insulin secretion), and (iv) improvement of beta cells mitochondrial physiological functions. The experiments were carried out using rat beta INS-1E cell line in the presence or absence of bergenin and a cocktail of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon- gamma) for 48 hr. Bergenin significantly inhibited beta cell apoptosis, as inferred from the reduction in the caspase-3 activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.29 &#x000b1; 2.45 &#x003bc;M), and concurrently increased cellular ATP Levels (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.97 &#x000b1; 0.47 &#x003bc;M). Bergenin also significantly enhanced insulin secretion (EC<sub>50</sub> = 6.73 &#x000b1; 2.15 &#x003bc;M) in INS-1E cells, presumably because of the decreased nitric oxide production (IC<sub>50</sub> = 6.82 &#x000b1; 2.83 &#x003bc;M). Bergenin restored mitochondrial membrane potential (EC<sub>50</sub> = 2.27 &#x000b1; 0.83 &#x003bc;M), decreased ROS production (IC<sub>50</sub> = 14.63 &#x000b1; 3.18 &#x003bc;M), and improved mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.39 &#x000b1; 0.62 &#x003bc;M). This study shows for the first time that bergenin protected beta cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis and restored insulin secretory function by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. To sum up, the above mentioned data highlight bergenin as a promising anti-apoptotic agent in the context of diabetes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by our Institute, Dr. Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research (PCMD), ICCBS, University of Karachi.

The plants of <italic>Begenia</italic> genus have traditionally been used for the treatment of diarrhea, cough, ulcer, vomiting, and kidney stones [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The extracts of <italic>Bergenia</italic> rhizomes have also been reported for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, and diuretic properties. Moreover, these extracts have also been topically applied to the wounds, eyesores, and boils [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Bergenin, a <italic>C</italic>-glucoside of 4-<italic>O</italic>-methylgallic acid, is naturally found in the rhizomes of <italic>Caesalpinia digyna</italic>, <italic>Mallotus japonicas</italic>, <italic>Mallotus philippinensis</italic>, <italic>Corylopsis spicata</italic>, <italic>Sacoglottis gabonensis</italic>, and <italic>Bergenial crassifolia</italic>. Other components obtained from <italic>Bergenia</italic> species include bergenan, &#x003b2;-sitosterol, polyphenols, and galloylarbutin. Bergenin, an isocoumarin derivative with five hydoxyl groups, is reported several important pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, hypolipidimic, antimalarial, hepatoprotective, antiarrhythmic, anti-HIV, and neuroprotective activities [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective activities of bergenin were reported to be mediated through its free radical scavenging property in both <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> models [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our previous study had shown anti-inflammatory properties of bergenin, where it inhibited the production of inflammatory mediators, such as NO, and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Diabetes mellitus has reached an epidemic proportion globally, with 463 million people currently suffering from this disease according to the International Diabetes Federation [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Diabetes patients exhibit persistent hyperglycemia due to the impairment of beta cell insulin secretory function, insulin action or both [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Pancreatic beta cells are reported to have low antioxidant potential, and are sensitive towards reactive oxygen (ROS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). This oxidative stress may ultimately lead to the impairment in beta cell insulin secretory function. In both type1, and type 2 diabetes, beta cells mass is significantly reduced due to apoptosis. The loss of beta cell identity is also reported to be one of the hallmarks of reduced functional beta cell mass [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. At early stages of diabetes, interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in beta cells that eventually results in hyperglycemic condition in the diabetic patients. As such, at the time of disease diagnosis, beta cell population is reported to be decreased by 70&#x02013;80% in type 1 diabetes, and about 50% in type 2 diabetes patients [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Proinflammatory cytokines play prominent roles in beta cell dysfunction, and death. Interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;,) interferon-&#x003b3; (INF-&#x003b3;), and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) have been employed in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to mimic the situations which induce pancreatic beta cell death. Moreover, these cytokines have been shown to stimulate JAK-STAT, and NF&#x003ba;B pathways, which later induce intrinsic apoptotic pathway in beta cells. Likewise, both TNF-&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; have also been reported to induce nitric oxide (NO) production, which causes the inhibition of electron transport chain, decrease in glucose oxidation rate leading to decrease in ATP generation, and insulin production [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therapeutic interventions currently available to treat diabetes are unable to cease the loss of functional beta cell mass. Therefore, strategies targeting beta cell apoptosis are urgently required. As such, small molecule compounds inhibiting cytokine-induced pancreatic beta cell death, could serve as new drug candidates that may be used in combination with existing therapeutics.</p><p>The hypothesis of this study was that bergenin can protect beta cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis and can restore beta cell insulin secretory function. To demonstrate this, we employed cell-based assays and examined the effects of bergenin in two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with a cytokine cocktail (IL-1&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and TNF-&#x003b1;). Using this strategy, we demonstrated that bergenin prevented cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis, and at the same time, restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Bergenin protected beta cells from the adverse effects of proinflammtory cytokines by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic properties.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>INS-1E is a derivative of INS-1 cells originally established from an x-ray induced insulinoma in rat [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Ribonucleotide adenosine triphosphates (rATPs) (Promega) were used for the standard curve. In this study, we prepared a cytokine cocktail (20 ng/mL IL-1&#x003b2;, 50 ng/mL, IFN-&#x003b3;, and 50 ng/mL TNF-&#x003b1;) to model the events leading to beta cell death as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0241349.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

In INS-1E cells, bergenin increased beta cell viability, suppressed cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis, and restored beta cell insulin secretory function. Bergenin protected beta cells through multiple mechanisms simultaneously. The anti-apoptotic effect of bergenin could be due the reduction in caspase-3 activity, NO and ROS production by potentially influencing NF-&#x003ba;B, MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways. Therefore, it is of great clinical value for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Due to the complexity of natural products and their mechanisms, the exact targets and mechanisms need to be further explored and verified in isolated pancreatic islets or in animal models of diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors acknowledge the gift of INS-1E cell line, generously provided by Paolo Meda, Department of Morphology, University of Geneva Medical School, Switzerland.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0241349.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Uniyal</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>KN</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jamwal</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lal</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>. <article-title>Traditional use of medicinal plants among the tribal communities of Chhota Bhangal</article-title>, <source>Western Himalaya.
