<p>Infection caused by MRSA is considered a major public health threat in many countries and MRSA remains the principal cause of hospital and community-acquired infections [

 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], such as bacteremia, pneumonia, and skin, soft tissue, surgical site, and urinary tract infections [

Indeed, most of the strains (40%) were recovered from SST followed by nasal, burn, SSI, and blood. Akanbi et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] showed that the majority of MRSA strains were isolated from blood, wound, and urine specimens. In addition, Ghebremedhin et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] demonstrated that MRSA was most found in surgical wound infections, succeeded by eye swabs, skin and soft tissue infections.
