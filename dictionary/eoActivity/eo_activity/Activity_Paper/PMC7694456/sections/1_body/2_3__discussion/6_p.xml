<p>Preformed biofilms are difficult to eradicate by conventional antibiotic therapy. However, in the present study, 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic>, 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EOs showed high biofilm eradication activities on 41.37% of the MRSA isolates. 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> EO had the strongest effect, with the percentage of eradication going up to 98.01%, and seven isolates were changed their biofilm phenotype. It seems that the monoterpenoid terpinen-4-ol has an excellent potential to eradicate mature biofilm than Î±-pinene and linalool. The activity of these oils on mature biofilms was lower than their capacity to inhibit the formation of biofilms. This can be explained by the fact that the major constituents in these oils have an effect on the biofilm formation process more than on mature biofilm. This is in agreement with the report of Cordeiro et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], showing that terpinen-4-ol is more efficient in inhibiting the formation of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms than in breaking or eliminating mature biofilms. Many EOs, such as tea tree [

 <xref rid="B46-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and cinnamon oil [
 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] have shown their effective ability to remove biofilm. Moreover, 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> EO has reduced the quantity of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm to 60.76% [
 <xref rid="B48-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In general, EOs diffuse through polysaccharide matrix of the preformed biofilm and destabilize it because of higher intrinsic antimicrobial activities [
