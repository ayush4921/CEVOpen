<p>The agar disc diffusion method was used to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the EOs [
 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceuticals-13-00369" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Briefly, an overnight cultures of MRSA cells grown at 37 °C were diluted to a density of 0.5 McFarland standards turbidity (DENSIMAT, Bio-merieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France) and were streaked onto Mueller–Hinton agar (MHA) plates using a sterile swab. A sterile filter disc (diameter 6 mm) was placed and then was impregnated by

 <italic>T. zygis</italic>, and 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> EOs (10 μL /disc). The plates were maintained at 4 °C for 2 h and then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the antibacterial activity was evaluated by determining the zone of growth inhibition throughout the discs.
