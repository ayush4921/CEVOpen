<p>EOs were tested for their potential to prevent biofilm formation by MRSA isolates. For the experiment, 100 µL of the EOs emulsified in TSB supplement with 2% glucose were put in the U-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate, including 100 μL of bacterial suspensions (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) in each well. The final concentrations of the EOs were equal to MIC, and the final volume was 200 μL per well. The analyzes were performed three times. After incubation of microplates at 37 °C for 24 h, the formed biofilm was measured by crystal violet as described previously [
