 <p>Methicillin-resistant 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a major human pathogen that poses a high risk to patients due to the development of biofilm. Biofilms, are complex biological systems difficult to treat by conventional antibiotic therapy, which contributes to &gt;80% of humans infections. In this report, we examined the antibacterial activity of 
  <italic>Origanum majorana</italic>, 
  <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>, and 
  <italic>Thymus zygis</italic> medicinal plant essential oils against MRSA clinical isolates using disc diffusion and MIC methods. Moreover, biofilm inhibition and eradication activities of oils were evaluated by crystal violet. Gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry analysis revealed variations between oils in terms of component numbers in addition to their percentages. Antibacterial activity testing showed a strong effect of these oils against MRSA isolates, and 
  <italic>T. zygis</italic> had the highest activity succeeded by 
  <italic>O. majorana</italic> and 
  <italic>R. officinalis</italic>. Investigated oils demonstrated high biofilm inhibition and eradication actions, with the percentage of inhibition ranging from 10.20 to 95.91%, and the percentage of eradication ranging from 12.65 to 98.01%. 
  <italic>O. majorana</italic> oil had the highest biofilm inhibition and eradication activities. Accordingly, oils revealed powerful antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against MRSA isolates and could be a good alternative for antibiotics substitution.
