<p>Jongberg et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-medicines-07-00058" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] study in their work the effects of phenolic extracts from green tea (
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) and maté (
 <italic>Ilex paraguariensis</italic>) on the oxidative stability of modified atmosphere pork chops. They showed that phenolic plant extracts could be added as antioxidants in meat to prevent lipid oxidation, but depending on the concentration applied, may affect proteins either through covalent interactions or by serving as a prooxidant. They studied the oxidative stability in chops cut from injection-enhanced loins containing three different levels of green tea or maté extract. They concluded that Maté is a good source of antioxidants for the protection of both lipids and proteins in brine-injected pork, though the dose must be carefully selected.
