<p>This Special Issue gives an overview of the current knowledge and recent trends in the use of medicinal plants as antimicrobials and antioxidants in foods, their potentials and challenges. It is critical to understand the effect of natural extracts and optimize their combinations for use in food preservation in order to better exploit their synergistic effects against both lipid oxidation and spoilage of pathogenic organisms. These considerations warrant the introduction of new species with high phenolic compound contents for beneficial applications by the food industry.</p>
