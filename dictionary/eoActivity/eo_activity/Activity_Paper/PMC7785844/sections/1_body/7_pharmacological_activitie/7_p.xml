<p id="p0175">Bioconstituents from the stem of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> were evaluated on mushroom tyrosinase and melanoma cells (A375.S2). Tyrosinase is an important enzyme that directly controls the production of melanin in the body system (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Hirobe, 2005</xref>). Previous evaluation indicated that two of the compounds {(+)-syringaresinol and (+)-epi-syringaresinol} found in 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> have inhibitory effects on human skin cancer cells and significant antioxidant activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Compounds like (+)-epi-syringaresinol, 4-acetonyl-3,5-dimethoxy-p-quinol, cis-p-Coumaric acid, trans-p-coumaric acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, vanillic acid and N-cis-feruloyl-tyramine inhibited mushroom tyrosinase activity. Tyrosinase inhibitors are employed medically to treat hyper-pigmentation and in cosmetic industry (
