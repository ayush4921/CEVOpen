 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Jeremiah et al. (2015)</xref> evaluated the anticonvulsant potential of 
 <italic>S. ducificum</italic> seed aqueous fraction in mice subjected to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-, strychnine- and Maximal Electroshock (MES)-induced seizures. PTZ is a noncompetitive antagonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor which binds to picrotoxin (PTX) site of the receptor. There was 33.33% defence against transience in PTZ- and strychnine-induced convulsion with significant reduction in the time of recovery from MES-induced seizure in animals pre-administered 
 <italic>S. ducificum</italic> seed. According to the findings, specific phytochemicals in 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> seed extract possess anticonvulsant activity and the inhibitory neurotransmission was due to mild affinity for PTX binding site of the GABAA receptor.
