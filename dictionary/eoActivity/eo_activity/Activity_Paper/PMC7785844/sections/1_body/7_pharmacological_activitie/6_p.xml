<p id="p0165">Fazilah et al. also evaluated the anti-diabetic properties of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> and its potential inclusion in functional yogurt (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fazilah et al., 2020</xref>). Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> pulp, seed and leaves in powder form were added to freshly prepared yogurts. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> antidiabetic analyses carried out showed potential inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes following the addition of the extracts. Furthermore, pulp extract demonstrated superior α-amylase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 9.66) and α-glucosidase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.08) inhibitory activities compared to the seed, leaf and the standard drug, acarbose. These results indicate the potential of the plant in the treatment of diabetic patients and validate the folkloric use of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> in the management of diabetes in Nigeria (
