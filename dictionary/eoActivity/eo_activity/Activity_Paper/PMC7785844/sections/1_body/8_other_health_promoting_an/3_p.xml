 <italic>In vitro</italic> antioxidant and radical scavenging activities of the methanol extracts of the flesh and seed of 
 <italic>S. dulcificum</italic> were evaluated and confirmed by a few studies (

Methods employed included ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethyl49 benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activities as well as ferric-reducing antioxidant power, FRAP assays among others. Also, the stabilization of lipid oxidation by the extract was analysed using fish oil emulsion model. It was discovered that the sample reduced oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid in fish oil. Therefore, 
 <italic>S.dulcificum</italic> plant could serve as an antioxidant-rich fruit capable of promoting health. The established antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>S.dulcificum</italic> plant part extracts may be due to flavonoids and phenols that have been isolated from fruits, leaves, and roots (
