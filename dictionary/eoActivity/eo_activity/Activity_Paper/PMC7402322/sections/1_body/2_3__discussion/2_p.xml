<p>Considering the results presented in this work, the traditional uses of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> in Nepal could be associated to the phytochemical composition of the secondary metabolites of COME. In particular, the presence of relatively high amounts of flavonoids and phenolic acids could explain both the anti-inflammatory properties of the leaves, here confirmed in vitro, as well as the anthelmintic and antibacterial activities, that have been already described for both the classes of compounds [

On the other hand, anti-inflammatory potential determined by in vitro anti-NF-κB/AP-1 assay used in this paper could not be obtained by in vivo tests or clinical trials, due to complex and unrevealed pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of plant extracts. Transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 are not only pro-inflammatory, but also contribute to other physiological processes. Hence, the inhibition of NF-κB/AP-1 signaling pathway could lead to undesired side effects [

However, if the anti-inflammatory effect of COME is proven in vivo and the particular mechanism of action is elucidated, there will be a therapeutic potential to treat a broad range of inflammatory diseases, at least as food supplement, because of the high popularity of complementary and alternative medicine among the general population [
