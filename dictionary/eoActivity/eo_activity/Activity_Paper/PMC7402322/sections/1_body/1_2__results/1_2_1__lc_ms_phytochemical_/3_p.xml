<p>The most representative derivative in COME was acteoside (27) (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-04897-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), also known as verbascoside, a phenylethanoid glycoside that has been previously described as a marker compound of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and as the possible co-responsible of numerous biological activities attributed to the plant [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In our extract, compound (27), together with its isomer isoacteoside (28), resulted also the most abundant constituent among those quantified in COME, with a cumulative amount of 24.71 mg/g (27 + 28). The two compounds could not be accurately quantified due to the partial superimposition of their chromatographic peaks, however, considering their peak areas, we could determine that (27) was more abundant than (28), with an amount ratio of 2:1. Another four derivatives sharing similar chemical structure were identified among the most abundant constituents of COME, namely β-oxoacteoside (29), martynoside (30), and β-methoxylverbascoside (31) (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-04897-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ijms-21-04897-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), which are here reported in 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> for the first time.
