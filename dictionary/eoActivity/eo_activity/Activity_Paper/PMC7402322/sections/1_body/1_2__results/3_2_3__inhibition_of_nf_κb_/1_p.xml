<p>To evaluate the anti-inflammatory potential of COME, its ability to attenuate the activity of pro-inflammatory transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 was measured (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-04897-f003">Figure 3</xref>). COME in the concentration of 2 µg/mL was able to significantly decrease the activity of NF-κB/AP-1 by the factor of 4.8 after LPS stimulation. On the other hand, the commercially available drug prednisone (1 µM) reduced their activity only by the factor of 1.2.
