 <xref rid="ijms-21-04897-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and among these, (20) was the most abundant flavonoid derivative in the extract, with an amount of 1.87 mg/g. Considering phenolic acids, the total amount in COME was 32.33 ± 0.51 mg/g DW, and again the result was in agreement with the 32.3 and 25.9 mg/g DW previously reported in methanol/chloroform and aqueous extracts of the same plant collected in Pakistan [
