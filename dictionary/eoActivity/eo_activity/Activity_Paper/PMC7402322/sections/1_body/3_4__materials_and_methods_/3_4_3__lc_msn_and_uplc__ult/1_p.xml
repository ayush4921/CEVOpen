<p>Polar constituents of COME were tentatively identified by an integrated LC-MS approach, comparing the fragmentation patterns with literature data and with standard compounds, when available. Further information was obtained searching for possible candidates in freely available MS databases by comparison of the accurate 
 <italic>m/z</italic> values and the calculated molecular formulas, obtained from LC-QTOF analysis. The dried extract was dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 5 mg/mL, and the solution was filtered through a 0.45 µm Millipore filter. A Varian 212 binary pump equipped with a Varian Prostar 430 autosampler and coupled to a Varian 500 Ion Trap mass detector (MS) was employed. The mass spectrometer was equipped with an Electrospray Ionization (ESI) ion source, operating in both negative [ESI(−)] and positive [ESI(+)] ion modes. Stationary and mobile phases, chromatographic conditions and MS parameters have been already reported in [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For quantification of flavonoids and phenolic acids, calibration curves of rutin and chlorogenic acid, respectively, were obtained using concentrations ranging from 10 to 120 mg/L. The calibration curves were 
 <italic>y</italic> = 13011
 <italic>x</italic> – 192439 (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.992) and 
 <italic>y</italic> = 523050
 <italic>x</italic> (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.990) for rutin in ESI(−) and ESI(+), respectively, and 
 <italic>y</italic> = 17133.7
 <italic>x</italic> + 18842 (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.997) for chlorogenic acid in ESI(−). Quantitative results were expressed as milligrams per grams of dry weight (DW).
