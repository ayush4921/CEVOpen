<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ChE inhibitory activities of different flavonoids derivatives (rutin, quercetin and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside) have been previously investigated. Docking experiments of quercetin showed a competitive inhibition mechanism against both enzymes (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2009</xref>). The principal active compound from 
 <italic>Cynara scolymus</italic> L., cynarine, was purified from 
 <italic>Onopordum illyricum</italic> L. and showed antioxidant, antiradical and inhibitory activities against AChE (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. The enzymatic results indicate that myristicin caused competitive and noncompetitive inhibition (
