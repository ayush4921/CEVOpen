<p>Docking results on 
 <italic>h</italic>BChE for the four flavonoids described above, behaved similarly than in 
 <italic>Tc</italic>AChE. The binding energies of kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-glucoside showed to be better (−8.92 and −8.36 kcal/mol respectively) compared to apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and kaempferol-7-rhamnoside (−5.93 and −3.38 kcal/mol), suggesting once again that the inhibitory activity over 
 <italic>h</italic>BChE lies predominantly in those derivatives which bear the sugar moieties at position 3- of the 4
 <italic>H</italic>-chromen-4-one core. The binding modes of compounds into the catalytic site of 
 <italic>h</italic>BChE were different this time related to results seen in 
 <italic>Tc</italic>AChE. Kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-glucoside are completely overlapped, as well as apigenin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and kaempferol-7-rhamnoside are arranged in the same manner with a slightly difference. This feature makes that the 4
 <italic>H</italic>-chromen-4-one moieties of the first two flavonoids to be in opposite positions related to the second ones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Binding energies for 
 <italic>h</italic>BChE turned out to be better than for 
 <italic>Tc</italic>AChE in docking experiments, what is partially divergent with our experimental inhibition assays, where the 
 <italic>A. copa</italic> infusion showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.92 ± 0.09 µg/ml for 
 <italic>Tc</italic>AChE and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 44.13 ± 0.10 µg/ml for 
 <italic>h</italic>BChE.
