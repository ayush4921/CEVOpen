<p>Deoxyribose degradation (HRS) assay was used to determine the ability of 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> oils to scavenge hydroxyl radical according to the previously reported method [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Equal volumes of several concentrations of essential oils or quercetin (used as a positive control) were mixed with working solution of 28 mM 2-deoxy-2-ribose (2-DR), 1.04 mM EDTA, 200 µM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>, and 1.0 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. After the incubation period (1 h at 37 °C) thiobarbituric acid (TBA) and 2.8% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (1:1 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) were added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 100 °C for 20 min. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm against a blank using S Jenway
 <sup>®</sup> 6800 UV/VIS spectrophotometer (Essex, UK). The percentage inhibition of HO
 <sup>•−</sup> generation was calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = [Ac − As/Ac] × 100,</disp-formula> where Ac: absorbance of control; As: absorbance of sample.
