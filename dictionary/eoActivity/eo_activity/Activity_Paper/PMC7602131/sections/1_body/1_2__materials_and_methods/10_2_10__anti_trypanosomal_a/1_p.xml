<p>Trypanocidal activity of EO was determined using resazurin dye as previously described [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. 
 <italic>Trypanosoma b. brucei</italic> TC221 (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were incubated in complete Baltz medium with several concentrations of EO and diminazene (positive control) for 24 h at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 37 °C. Following this, cells were incubated with resazurin (10 µL) for further 24 h. The absorbance at λ of 492 and 595 nm was measured by Tecan
 <sup>®</sup> plate reader and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated [
