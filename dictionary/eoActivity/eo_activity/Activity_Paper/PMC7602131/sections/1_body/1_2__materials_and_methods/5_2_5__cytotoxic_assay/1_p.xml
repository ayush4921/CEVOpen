<p>Cytotoxicity was determined in triplicates using MTT cell viability assay [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A total of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well of both cell lines CCL-81 (Vero) (ATCC 43255) and human HL-60 (human myeloid cells) (ATCC CCL-240) were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in complete DMEM media and in complete RPMI media, respectively. The EOs were dissolved in DMSO, the final concentration of DMSO was &lt;0.01% and the absorbance values of DMSO were subtracted from the sample absorbance. Several concentrations of EO (1 to 1000 μg/mL) and doxorubicin (positive control) were applied individually to the cells and incubated for further 24 h with the same conditions. The light absorption of formazan crystal that formed after incubation for 4 h with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) and solubilized by DMSO (200 µL) was measured at 570 nm using a Tecan
 <sup>®</sup> Safire II Reader (Männedorf, Switzerland). The percentage of cell viability of three independent experiments was calculated as follows: cell viability (%) = (OD of treated cells − OD of DMSO treated)/(OD of control cells − OD of DMSO treated) × 100%.
