<p>Recently, organic acids have been utilized to transform the major ginsenosides into minor ginsenosides and improve the biological activity of ginseng products. When white ginseng extract (WGE) was treated with 10% citric acid at 100 °C for 1 h, the concentrations of ginsenoside Rg3 were 10-fold greater than those of a non-treated sample, and the antitumor and antioxidant activities of the WGE increased [
