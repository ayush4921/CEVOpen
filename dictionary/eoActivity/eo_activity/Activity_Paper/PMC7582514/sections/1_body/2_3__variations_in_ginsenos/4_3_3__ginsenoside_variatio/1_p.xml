<p>Biological processing methods are commonly used to process ginseng products given the strongly selective reactions, mild reaction conditions, and reduction in undesirable by-products, simple reprocessing, and other benefits. Fermentation using microorganisms or enzymes plays an important role in biological processing of ginseng. Fermented products have been found to produce more pharmacological effects than unfermented products, likely due to the effects of microbial transformation, enzyme conversion, and glycosyltransferase activity to change the ginsenoside composition (
