<p>Recently, two new ginseng processing methods have been developed. One method is microwave heating, which is a simple, efficient, and time-saving way to process ginsengs. Malonyl ginsenosides are much less stable than the corresponding neutral ginsenosides during microwave treatment [

After microwave treatment, concentrations of ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, and Rb2, and Rd are reduced, whereas the concentrations of ginsenosides Rg3, Rk1, and Rg5 are increased. In addition, anticancer effects are enhanced by microwave processing; therefore, heat processing by microwave irradiation is considered a useful method to enhance the biological activities of ginseng by increasing the concentrations of minor ginsenosides [

Puffed ginseng can be more easily dehydrated because of its more aerated and porous structure. Puffed ginseng produced by a rotary gun puffing machine contained greater crude saponin concentrations than non-puffed samples [

Due to the puffing pressure, minor ginsenosides (Rg3, F2, Rk1, and Rg5) are increased but the concentrations of major ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rg1) are reduced, which indicates puffing treatment significantly influences the ginsenoside composition [
