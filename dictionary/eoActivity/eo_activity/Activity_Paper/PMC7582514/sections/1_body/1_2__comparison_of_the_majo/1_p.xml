<p>Most of the pharmacological and bioactive effects of ginseng are produced by various ginsenosides. Ginsenosides exhibit diverse biological activities, including anti-diabetic, anti-aging, anti-carcinogenic, anti-fatigue, anti-pyretic, and anti-stress activities, and are also known to promote DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis [
