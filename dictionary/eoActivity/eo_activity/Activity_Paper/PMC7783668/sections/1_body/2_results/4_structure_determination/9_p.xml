<p id="p0155">As closely related to 
 <bold>6</bold>, compound 
 <bold>7</bold> was obtained exhibiting similar chromatographic properties with tinny less polarity, as indicative for a further glycosidic flavonoid system. Based on (+) ESIMS, compound 
 <bold>7</bold> displayed three 
 <italic>quasi</italic> molecular ion peaks at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 449, 471 and 919 corresponding to [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup>, [M + Na]
 <sup>+</sup> and [2 M + Na]
 <sup>+</sup>, respectively. Accordingly, the corresponding molecular formula of 
 <bold>7</bold> was confirmed as C
 <sub>21</sub>H
 <sub>20</sub>O
 <sub>11</sub>, having same unsaturation degree of 
 <bold>6</bold> (12 DBE). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra revealed the presence of same pattern of ring-B in compound 
 <bold>6</bold>, meanwhile the O-glycoside C-3 in ring C of 
 <bold>6</bold> showed a singlet signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 6.0 along with a sole singlet proton in ring-A at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 6.48 (H-8). In the glucoside region, an oxygenated methine carbon was visible at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 73.6, instead of the O-glycosidic carbon (101.8) shown in compound 
 <bold>6</bold>, suggesting C-glycoside unit at C-6 in compound 
 <bold>7</bold> (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) according to HMBC experiment. Based on the long range correlations (HMBC) H-1′' (
 <italic>δ</italic> 4.57) of the glucoside unit exhibited a 
 <sup>3</sup>
 <italic>J</italic> cross sections with C-7 (δ: 163.7) and C-5 (δ:161.1), confirmed its attachment to C-6 of ring A. Consequently, compound 
 <bold>7</bold> was identified as isooreintin (homoorientin), which was isolated to herein to first time from 
 <italic>E. balsamifera, exhibiting</italic> a complete structural agreement with the previously isolated one from 
 <italic>Antidesma ghaesembilla</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Canh et al., 2015</xref>).
