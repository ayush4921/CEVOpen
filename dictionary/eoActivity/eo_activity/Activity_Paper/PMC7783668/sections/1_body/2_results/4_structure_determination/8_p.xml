<p id="p0150">As yellow solid of UV absorbance and visible yellow appearance during TLC, compound 
 <bold>6</bold> was afforded. Under long UV light (366 nm), the compound showed fluorescence colour, which turned deep yellow on exposing to flavonoid spraying reagent (Aluminium chloride), suggesting its flavonoid nature. The molecular weigh (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 464) and corresponding molecular formula (C
 <sub>21</sub>H
 <sub>20</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>) of compound 
 <bold>6</bold> were determined by (+)-ESIMS, bearing 12 DBE. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum exhibited two spins aromatic signals, the first of them was of 
 <italic>m</italic>-coupled AB spin system at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 6.35 and 6.14, (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.0 Hz, 1H) for H-6 and H-8 of ring-A, respectively. The second spin system is corresponding to 1,2,4-trisubstiuted aromatic residue, showing three proton signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.65 (dd, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.5, 2.2 Hz), 7.52 (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.2 Hz), 6.80 (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.5 Hz) being for H-6′, H-2′ and H-5′ of ring-B, respectively. In accordance, the quercetin aglycone skeleton was established. In the aliphatic region, a doublet signal (
 <italic>J</italic> = 7.6 Hz) of an anomeric proton was exhibited at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 5.34, indicating the presence of one sugar moiety with a corresponding anomeric carbon at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 101.8 according to HSQC experiment. According to the 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum, 15 carbon signals corresponding to quercetin aglycone were assigned. This was together with 6 oxygenated 
 <italic>sp</italic>
 <sup>3</sup> methine/methylene carbons being for the mentioned before sugar unit (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Based on the shown multiplicity and coupling constant of anomeric proton, the sugar moiety was assigned as 
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucose. Complete analysis of COSY, HSQC and HMBC experiments confirmed the structure of 
 <bold>6</bold> as quercetin 3-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucoside, which was isolated herein for first time from 
 <italic>E. balsamifera.</italic>
