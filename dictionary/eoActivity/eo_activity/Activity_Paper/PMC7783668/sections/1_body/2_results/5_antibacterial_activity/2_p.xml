<p id="p0160">The antibacterial activity of the total ethanolic extract, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fractions of 
 <italic>E. balsamifera</italic> against LM, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> Scott A; SA, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538), BC, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and EF, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>; SE; 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Enteritidis; PA; 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>; EC, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 8739); KP, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> have been assessed (Table, 3). The results revealed that the ethanolic extract is efficiently suppressing the growth of the tested pathogenic bacteria and had the maximum zone of inhibition against EC (25 ± 0.32 mm), whereas Chloramphenicol showed a maximum zone of inhibition against EC (26 ± 0.21 mm). The ethanolic extract exhibited inhibitory effect against eight of the pathogenic bacteria (LM, SA, BC, EF, SE, PA, EC and KP) at the concentration 30 μg/mL, while at 20 μg/mL was effective against five strains only (KP, PA, EC, BC, and SE). In the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fractions, just ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol had more valuable results (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) against the tested pathogenic bacteria than 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction at low concentration 10 or 20 μg/mL (with inhibition zone against SA (28 ± 0.15 and 29 ± 0.19 mm at 10 μg/mL compared to 11 ± 0.12 mm for the hexane fraction), respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was varied between the extract and fractions (see Table S33 in 
 <xref rid="s0135" ref-type="sec">Supplementary data</xref>). The MIC of ethanolic extract was 30 µg/ml against both of Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria, the MIC of hexane extract was between 20 and 30 µg/ml against all the tested strains. The MIC of ethyl acetate and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol were 10 to 20 µg/ml against all the tested strains where the lowest MIC was observed for 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fraction with the highest antibacterial activity.
