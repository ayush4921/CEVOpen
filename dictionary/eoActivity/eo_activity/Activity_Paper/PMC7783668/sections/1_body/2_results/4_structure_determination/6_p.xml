<p id="p0140">With higher polarity and closely related chromatographic and spectroscopic features to 4-O-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranosyl-2-hydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone (
 <bold>4</bold>), compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was obtained. According to the negative mode of ESIMS, a 
 <italic>pseudo</italic> molecular ion peak was exhibited at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> = 489 [M−H], revealing the presence of rhamnose as additional sugar moiety. In accordance, the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> showed the same aromatic pattern of 
 <bold>4</bold>, however, with additional sugar unit of α-configuration (
 <italic>J</italic> = 1.7 Hz) due to the presence of a doublet anomeric proton (H-1′') at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 4.71 and corresponding anomeric carbon C-1′' at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 101.7, reflecting the α-configuration nature of this sugar moiety having a doublet (
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.0 Hz) methyl signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.20 (H
 <sub>3</sub>-6′', δ
 <sub>C</sub>: 16.5).
