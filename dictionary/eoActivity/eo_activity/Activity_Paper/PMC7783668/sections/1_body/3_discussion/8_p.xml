<p id="p0205">Alternatively, the antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>7</bold>) was reported (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Except compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>, all compounds were active against the whole test bacterial strains (9 ~ 22 mm). Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was the most active one against 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (22 ± 0.13 mm). According to our MIC and MBC studies (
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), it has been investigated that compound 
 <bold>4</bold> showed the lowest MIC and MBC (1.15 and 2.05 mg/mL), indicating its highest antibacterial activity, while compound 
 <bold>7</bold> recorded the highest MIC and MBC (2.48 and 3.00 mg/mL), i.e. lowest activity, although Kumarasamy et al (
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Kumarasamy et al., 2004</xref>) reported no significant antimicrobial activity for the latter. Finally, compound 
 <bold>6</bold> showed a consistent activity with previously reported data (
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Kumarasamy et al., 2004</xref>).
