<p id="p0105">The Cytotoxicity of the plantâ€™s extract, fractions and pure compounds were evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against three human cancer cell lines: HCT116 [Colon cell line], HePG-2 [Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line], MCF7 [Human Caucasian breast adenocarcinoma], alongside normal cell line RPE1[normal retina cell line] by using MTT assay. Cell viability was assessed by the mitochondrial-dependent reduction of yellow MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) to purple formazan. The cultivation of the cell lines and the cytotoxicity assays were performed as described by (
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Mosmann, 1983</xref>). This cytotoxic activity test (In vitro bioassay on human tumor cell lines) was conducted and determined by the Bioassay-Cell Culture Laboratory, National Research Centre, El-Tahrir St., Dokki, Cairo 12622, Egypt.
