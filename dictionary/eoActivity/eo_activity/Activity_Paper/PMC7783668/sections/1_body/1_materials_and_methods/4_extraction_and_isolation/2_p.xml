<p id="p0025">Dry samples of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>E. balsamifera</italic> Aiton (3.0 kg) was placed in a closed glass container with 85% Ethanol (5.0 L) at room temperature for 72 h. Then the total ethanol extract was collected by filtration using Buchner funnel, and the extraction process was repeated three times. The total extract was concentrated by rotary evaporator at 45 °C to obtain the crude ethanol extract (289.4 g). The crude extract was suspended in water (1.0 L) followed by subsequent fractionation using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethyl acetate and saturated 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol (1.0 L for each solvent).
