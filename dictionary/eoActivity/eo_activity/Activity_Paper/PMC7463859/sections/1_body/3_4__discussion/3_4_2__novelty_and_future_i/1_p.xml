<p>The comparison of our study with the ethnomedicinal literature indicated that neighboring areas [

 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01001" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-01001" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], while the more distant areas had comparatively fewer similarities, due to cultural and traditional differencesâ€”thus, confirming our respective hypothesis. The comparative study between previously reported medicinal plants showed that six plant species, 
 <italic>Aconitum violaceum, Broussonetia papyrifera, Cedrus deodara, Celtis caucasica, Conandrium arnotaimum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pinus wallichiana</italic>, were not previously documented in this area for their medicinal values. The newly reported plants (and their uses) were 
 <italic>Aconitum violaceum</italic> (arthritis), 
 <italic>Broussonetia papyrifera</italic> (diarrhea), 
 <italic>Cedrus deodara</italic> (cooling and antipyretic), 
 <italic>Celtis caucasica</italic> (wound healing), 
 <italic>Conandrium arnotaimum</italic> (skin allergy), and 
 <italic>Pinus wallichiana</italic> (antipyretic). These plant species might provide leads for pharmacological activities and detection of bioactive compounds in search of new drugs. The study also highlighted nine species of antipyretic plants, such as 
 <italic>Ajuga bracteosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Cedrus deodara, Mentha spicata, Pinus roxburghii, Pinus wallichiana, Rhododendron arboretum, Solanum surattense, Sonchus asper</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> and nine plant species to treat arthritis, such as 
 <italic>Achyranthes aspera, Aconitum violaceum,</italic>
 <italic>Asparagus racemosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Buxus wallichiana</italic>
 <italic>, Cuscuta reflexa</italic>
 <italic>, Hedera helix,</italic>
 <italic>Justicia adhatoda, Rumex hastatus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Viola canescens.</italic> Such a large number of plant species for antipyretics and arthritis pain had not previously reported anywhere in Pakistan. Sadly, many ethnobotanical studies reveal either a dramatic or gradual loss of traditional knowledge and practices [
