It is clear that comprehensive information on (formal and informal) is important for establishing sound guidelines for medicinal plants production, use, commercialization and management [

The medicinal plants with maximum UV required protection for sustaining biodiversity in the investigation region. However, no program or project for the maintenance and conservation of flora and vegetation is functioning in the study area, urbanization, marble mining, overharvesting and grazing were detected as the main threats to therapeutic plant species.
