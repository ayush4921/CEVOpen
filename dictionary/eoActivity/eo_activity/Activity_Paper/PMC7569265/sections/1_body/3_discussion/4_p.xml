<p id="par0175">Acutely non-toxic compounds may be toxic on prolonged exposures due to its accumulation, effects on enzyme levels, and the disruption of physiological and biochemical homeostasis [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In sub-acute toxicity study, the concentrations of hemoglobin (HGB) and platelet distribution width (PDW) were reduced significantly during 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> extract administrations. Similarly, PDW and the platelet larger cell ratio (P-LCR) concentrations significantly declined for 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extract compared with the control. A previous study reported that 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extract did not cause significant change in hematological indices, but increased HCT concentrations at dose 1500 mg/kg b.w [
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Thus, reductions in the HGB, PDW and P-LCR concentrations might imply that the test extract interfered with the normal production of hemoglobin within RBCs. This context is supported by the fact that short-term exposure of erythrocytes to cytotoxic agents result in hemoglobin reductions [
