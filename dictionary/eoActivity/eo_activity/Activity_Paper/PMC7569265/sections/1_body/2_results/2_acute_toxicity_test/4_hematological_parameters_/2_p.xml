 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extracts significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced HGB concentrations(13.11 + 1.31 g/dl) and 14.10 + 2.52 g/dl, respectively, compared with control (18.23 + 1.00/g/dl). Clinically meaningful increment of RBC concentration was observed, although it did not reach statistical significance compared with the control (4.75 Ã— 10
