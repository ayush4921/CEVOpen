<p id="par0090">At the end of the experimental period, euthanasia was administered using Isoflurane (C
 <sub>3</sub>H
 <sub>2</sub>ClF
 <sub>5</sub>O, Forane) inhalant followed by gentle cervical dislocation. Euthanized rats were placed in a sealed glass chamber where high levels of anesthetic gas (3 %) were introduced, which depresses the central nervous system resulting in peaceful death. Blood samples were collected once unconsciousness has been achieved. About 1 mL blood samples were collected from each rat in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant tubes from the retro-orbital vein by a glass capillary tube puncture. Hematological examinations were carried out using Automated Hematology Analyzer (XT-1800i, Japan).
