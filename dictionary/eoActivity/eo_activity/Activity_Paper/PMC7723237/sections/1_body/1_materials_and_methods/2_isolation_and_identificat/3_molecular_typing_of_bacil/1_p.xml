<p>A single pure colony of the isolate was taken and streaked on a nutrient agar plate and incubated overnight at 37 °C until a good colony morphology and size were obtained. DNA extraction was carried out according to the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified as described by Lane,
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> using the universal primers 27F and 1492R. The PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 ºC for 5 min, then 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 ºC for 40 sec., annealing at 52 ºC for 30 sec., and extension at 72 ºC for 1 min., and final extension at 72 ºC for 7 min.
