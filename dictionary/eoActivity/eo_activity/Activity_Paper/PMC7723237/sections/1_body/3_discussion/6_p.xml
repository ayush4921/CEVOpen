<p>The results of antimicrobial activity of essential oils and spices powder using Well-diffusion assays showed that the black seeds essential oil had the strongest antibacterial activity (biggest inhibition zone), while the Cumin oil had the least antibacterial activity (smallest inhibition zone) among the essential oils present in this study. The results also showed that the Marjoram spices power has the strongest antibacterial activity among spices powder tested in this study, while Cumin spices powder had the least antibacterial activity among the spices powder tested in this study. Therefore, it is obvious that the cumin plant had the least antibacterial among plants present in this study. These results are in agreement with Ã–zcan et al, which reported that essential oils of some spices may be used as antimicrobial agents to prevent the spoilage of food products.
