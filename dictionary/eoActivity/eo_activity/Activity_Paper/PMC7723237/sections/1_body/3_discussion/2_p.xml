<p>Many studies stated that food analysis is a useful tool for identifying bacterial species including 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. which cause foodborne diseases.

 <xref rid="cit0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> Our results showed that 14 isolates were identified as 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. by cultural, biochemical, and serological characteristics. 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. was not recognized in fresh veal meat samples, 2 of 6 fresh chicken meat samples (33.34%), not recognized in fresh mutton meat, 3 of 12 beef luncheon (25.0%), not recognized in chicken luncheon, 5 of 12 ground beef (41.67%), only 1 of 6 basterma (16.67%), and 3 of 3 beef burger (100.0%). These results assure the fact that 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. are associated with food from animal sources either fresh or processed and not specifically with beef.
