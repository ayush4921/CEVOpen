<p>The disappearance of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. in samples treated with essential oils of black seeds, cloves, cumin, and cinnamon meanwhile increased the 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. count in a control sample, after 15 days of storage, indicates that the disappearance of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. in treated samples may be attributed to the antimicrobial activity of these essential oils. One of the most important findings of the current study was the reduced effectiveness of the major components of essential oil compared with whole oil mixtures. Many reports of the antibacterial activity of essential oil components have tested their efficacy against vegetative bacterial cells.
