<p>In light of our results, we found that the highest occurrence of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. is in beef burger samples, which may indicate that the prevalence of 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. is higher in processed meat than in fresh meet. According to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the two identified isolates are 
 <italic>Bacillus oceanisedimins</italic> and 
 <italic>Brevibacillus invocatus</italic>; thus to our knowledge, this is the first report isolating both 
 <italic>Bacillus oceanisedimins</italic> and 
 <italic>Brevibacillus invocatus</italic> from both fresh and processed meat samples, and more investigations are required to identify their roles in meat samples.
