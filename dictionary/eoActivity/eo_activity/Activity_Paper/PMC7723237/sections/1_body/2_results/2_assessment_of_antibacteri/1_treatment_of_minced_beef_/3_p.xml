 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. was counted in different minced samples contain essential oils of cumin, black seeds, cloves, cinnamon, and marjoram under levels of 0.25% and 0.50% and control sample during storage at 4±1°C up to 15 days. The results revealed that 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp. counts increased in the control sample; thus, its counts at zero time were (3.333 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/g) and reached to (3.439 log
 <sub>10</sub> CFU/g) at the end of storage periods. However, for the treated samples, after 12 days of the refrigerated storage, the microbial count reached zero except samples treated with marjoram oil 0.25%, it reached zero count after 15 days of storage. After 15 days of storage, the difference between the control group and the samples treated with 0.25% essential oil of cumin, black seeds, cloves and cinnamon was statistically significant (p = 0.0138, 0.0011, 0.0052 and 0.0088, respectively). Moreover, after 15 days of storage, the difference between the control group and all samples treated with 0.5% essential oil of cumin, black seeds, cloves, cinnamon and marjoram was statistically significant (p = 0.0010, 0.0001, 0.0013, 0.0037 and 0.0047, respectively). However, the difference was non-significant between the control group and the samples treated with 0.25 essential oil of marjoram (p = 0.1412) after 15 days of storage (
