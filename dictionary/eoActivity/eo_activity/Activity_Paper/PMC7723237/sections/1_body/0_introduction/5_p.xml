<p>Several molecular techniques that rely on DNA sequencing have been used to reveal the genetic relationship of bacillus strains.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) was used to screen for genetic relatedness. On the other hand, the application of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has been proven to be useful for the discrimination and epidemiological characterization of
