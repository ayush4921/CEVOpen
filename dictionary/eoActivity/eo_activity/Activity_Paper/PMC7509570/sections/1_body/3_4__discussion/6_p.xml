<p>This study showed a considerable reduction in the nitrite levels in rat peritoneal cells obtained after the oral treatment of the concoction. The nitrite levels of the concoction treated rat cells are comparable to that of prednisolone treated group which has shown higher inhibition of NO production. Nitric oxide produced by inducible NOS plays an important role in inflammation and in regulation of the immune system [

Oral administration with the concoction showed a specific effect on expression of iNOS, whereas it had no effect on the expression of either nNOS or eNOS genes, the constitutive forms of NOS, which are necessary for the normal cell functions. In contrast, the carrageenan-induced and water treated control group was positive for iNOS gene expression. The reference drug used as the positive control has also shown a significant inhibitory effect on iNOS gene expression as well as the constitutive forms of NOS. The presence of GAPDH gene expression which is a house keeping gene [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] in all three groups was indicative of normal cell functions despite the specific effect on iNOS gene expression. These findings confirm that the significantly reduced nitric oxide production in the concoction treated group was due to the specific inhibition of expression iNOS gene. It is also important to note that the concoction treatment has less or no inhibitory effects on the constitutive forms of NOS unlike the reference drug used as the positive control.
