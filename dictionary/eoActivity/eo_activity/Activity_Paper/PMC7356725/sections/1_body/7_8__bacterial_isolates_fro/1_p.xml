<p>The bacterial species isolated from different stingless bee products have also been investigated. In a study which isolated and phenotypically characterized 41 different bacterial species from SBH, SBP and beebread, Bacillus were the predominant species found [

 <italic>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus safensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus stratosphericus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B133-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. 
 <italic>B. amyloliquefaciens</italic> isolates showed the highest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [

 <xref rid="B134-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Half of the isolates identified displayed antimicrobial activity to Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, some inhibited both, and most antibacterial isolates were from the

 <xref rid="B132-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. This study outlines the benefits to the colony, and potential human therapeutic benefits, of stingless bees acquiring actinobacteria from the areas they pollinate.
