<p>Despite an improvement in harvesting practices and post-harvest management of SBH, stingless bee products display variability in chemical composition associated with botanical and geographical origin, bee species and climate. Therefore, a standard characterization worldwide for stingless bee products is not available. However, Malaysia has specifically developed the first SBH standard referred to as Malaysian standard (MS) 2683:2017 [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is used in local regulations according to several parameters including moisture content (&lt;35.0%), sucrose (&lt;7.5 g/100 g), sum of fructose and glucose (&lt;85.0 g/100 g), maltose (&lt;9.5 g/100 g), ash (&lt;1.0 g/100 g), hydroxymethylfurfural (&lt;30.0 mg/kg), pH (2.5–3.8) and identifying the plant phenolic content [

 <sup>3</sup> CFU/mL, whereas yeast, mold and coliforms must be less than 1 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> CFU/mL [
