<p>Many studies have explored the total phenolic content (TPC) and the total flavonoid content (TFC), calculated in mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g sample, and the characterization of the phenolic compounds have been performed by different methods, especially the high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) [

 <xref rid="B60-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. While the most common assays to detect the antioxidant activity were DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate)-free radical scavenging activity, ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radical cation scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) [

These three assays considered as relatively inexpensiveness spectrophotometric-based tests based on color quenching or gaining of synthetic organic radicals. The colors of DPPH (purple) and ABTS (blue–green) are reducible upon exposure to antioxidants, and this decrease is negatively correlated with the measured wavelength, which, thus, refers to the antioxidant capacity [

 <sup>3+</sup> TPTZ) is colorless and it is convertible to be ferrous (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>) with blue color upon electron donation from antioxidants [
