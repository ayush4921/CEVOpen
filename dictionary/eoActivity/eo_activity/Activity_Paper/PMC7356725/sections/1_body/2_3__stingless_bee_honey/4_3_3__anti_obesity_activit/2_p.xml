<p>In a study conducted on obese rats treated with SBH, a significant reduction was observed in body mass index (BMI), percentage of body weight gain, adiposity index, relative organ weight (ROW), liver enzymes, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), while the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was significantly increased [

SBH treatment showed a reduced number of adipocyte cells, while the hepatocytes found in the liver were less prone to rupturing when treated with SBH, suggesting that SBH improved the indicators associated with obesity reduction and reduced the health risks related to obesity [

In addition, some inflammatory markers, such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKK-β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and apoptosis marker caspase-9 showed a steady decrease following treatment with SBH, while anti-oxidative enzyme catalase was increased [

Together, these studies have shown that not only the antidiabetic properties of SBH as a protection agent against pancreas dysfunction, it also highlighted the potential anti-obesity activity of SBH, by maintaining the lipid profile in homeostasis and could even affect the morphological structures in the liver [
