<p>There is still a lack of comprehensive studies to evaluate the antioxidant potentials, quantum-chemical and molecular docking analysis of the major phenolic compounds present in each of stingless bee products. For example, a study by Fujishima et al. showed that both quercetin and gallic acid, from leaves and bark extracts of 
 <italic>Curatella americana</italic> Linn, are important inhibitors of XO enzyme through its interactions with specific amino acid residues at the activity site of XO [
 <xref rid="B144-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. This type of studies is essential to understand the antioxidant potential of each phenolic compound with mechanisms of action. Honey is the best known primary product of stingless bees in terms of purity and availability, whereas other stingless bee products are less common, therefore here we focus on SBH and its promising opportunities.
