<p>Additionally, information regarding the potential health benefits of SBH in medical databases is still scarce, as well as how stingless beesâ€™ gut microbiome diversity affects the honey that they produce. In recent years, studies have focused on the importance of symbiotic bacteria due to their prominent role in nutrient acquisition and immune responses [

 <xref rid="B155-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. These bacterial communities have been best characterized in worker bees [

 <xref rid="B158-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Despite maintaining colony homeostasis and fitness, the contribution of their microbial communities to the metabolites profiles and immunotherapeutic properties of their extracted honey is mainly unknown. Therefore, future studies should aim to bridge this gap by focusing on the gut microbiome diversity of stingless bee species using a metagenomics approach.
