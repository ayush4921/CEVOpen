<p>Interestingly, different potential properties of SBP have been examined together in studies conducted by Campos et al. [

 <xref rid="B105-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. They showed that SBP has antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungus, as well as antioxidant activity by suppressing oxidation-induced erythrocytes hemolysis and lipid degradation [

Another comparable study by Umthong et al. also showed the antimicrobial activities of SBP, against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungus, as well as antiproliferative cytotoxic activities resulting in an increase in cell death by necrosis in colon cancer cells [
