<p>Although SBP is not as commonly known for its antimicrobial properties as propolis from honey bees, Pino et al. have shown that the SBP from 
 <italic>Melipona beecheii</italic> have higher content of trans-verbenol, α-copaene, β-caryophyllene, β-bourbonene, α-pinene, spathulenol, β-pinene and caryophyllene oxide compared to propolis from 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, despite both being collected from one region (Yucatán, Mexico) with similar natural flora [
