<p>Cytotoxic activity, specifically necrosis, has been induced by SBP extracts in leukemic cell lines [
 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Apoptotic cytotoxicity has also been observed in different cancer cell lines (breast, colon, epithelial colorectal and melanoma) when treated with SBP extracts [
 <xref rid="B108-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Furthermore, a dichloromethane extract of SBP displayed cytotoxic effects on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines, resulting in reduced viability of these cells [
 <xref rid="B94-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Novel compounds, 27-hydroxyisomangiferolic acid and 23-hydroxyisomangiferolic acid B, in the SBP extract displayed the highest levels of cytotoxicity against pancreatic cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B95-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Further cytotoxic effects of SBP against canine osteosarcoma cells have been reported, with modulated cell morphologies and reduced viability of the cancer cells observed [
 <xref rid="B109-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Another study found out that the piperidinic alkaloids together with C-glycopyranoside flavonoids in SBP extract were associated with apoptosis in melanoma cells, as well as inhibition of migration and invasion of these cells [
 <xref rid="B90-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Further, SBP extracts demonstrated antiproliferative activity against cancer cell lines (colon, breast, hepatic and stomach), but did not affect normal cell lines (liver and fibroblasts) [

 <xref rid="B113-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In studies mimicking the angiogenic micro-environment related to tumor development, SBP extracts demonstrated a cytotoxic effect and anti-angiogenic activity on the vascular cells [
