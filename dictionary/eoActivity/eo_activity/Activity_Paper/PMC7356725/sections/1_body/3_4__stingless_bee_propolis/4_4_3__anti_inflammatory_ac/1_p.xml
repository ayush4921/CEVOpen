<p>Due to their anti-inflammatory properties, SBP extracts have been used in the treatment of a murine asthma model [

In this model, rats treated with SBP had reduced progression of allergic inflammation as shown by decreased total cell counts in the bronchoalveolar fluid, decreased peribronchovascular inflammation and inhibition of polymorphonuclear cells into the alveolar spaces [
