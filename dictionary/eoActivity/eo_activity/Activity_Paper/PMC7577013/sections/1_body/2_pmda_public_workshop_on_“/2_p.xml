<p>In the first session, Atsunori Kaibara, PhD, Eli Lilly Japan K.K., presented the impacts of ER analysis on approval review based on the results of a survey about review reports of new drugs that were approved from 2010 to 2019 in Japan. The survey indicated that ~ 80% of the NDAs in which the data on ER analysis were included were submitted by foreign‐affiliated company. The speaker concluded that M&amp;S utilizations in Japan are expected to be facilitated by the implementation of ER analysis guideline in preparation. Akiyuki Suzuki, MSc, Pfizer R&amp;D Japan G.K., presented a development project of Revatio for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension as an example of utilization of ER analysis in drug development targeting pediatric patients and intractable diseases. Yusuke Tanigawara, PhD, Keio University, introduced the latest draft document entitled “Guideline for drug exposure‐response analysis (draft)” being prepared at the AMED research group and major comments raised in response to the public consultation conducted by the MHLW from May to June 2019. One of the main comments to the latest draft document was that the limitation of data collection over a wide range of exposure in a single dose study that is conducted in the late‐stage of clinical development in some areas, such as oncology or rare diseases. The speaker replied that the importance of data collection depending on the purpose of ER analysis (e.g., an ER analysis to make an assessment of the safety of drug with the exposure data from a single dose study) will be described in the guideline.</p>
