<p>L-carvone at 0.05 and 0.1% concentrations did not cause mortality among 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. L-carvone at a 0.5% concentration resulted in a somewhat minor mortality of rice weevils from 0.9 to 18%. The highest mortality of 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> was caused by L-carvone at a 1% concentration. After 1 h of exposure, it amounted to 10%, and after subsequent hours it rose to more than 50%. After 24 h, it amounted to more than 80%, and after 48 h there was a 100% mortality (
