<p>We have investigated whether there are statistically significant differences in the repellent effect of different concentrations of essential caraway oil and L-carvone on 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. The dependent variable is the insect emigration rate. Since the distribution of data in particular groups separated according to the concentration of the examined substances significantly differed from the normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), the analysis of variance (ANOVA) Kruskall–Wallis rank test was applied followed by the post hoc test, in this case a multiple comparison test [
 <xref rid="B43-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The test probability level “
 <italic>p</italic>” and the significance level “α” were 0.05. The calculations were performed in the Statistica 13.3 program.
