<p>In another study, Nattudurai et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] obtained 100% repellence against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic> after 3 h, using a Y-tube glass olfactometer with essential oil isolated from leaves of 
 <italic>Toddalia asiatica</italic> at a concentration of 20 ÂµL. In their next experiment, Nattudurai et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] observed that the same concentration of diethyl ether fruit extract also exhibited a 100% repellent activity against 
 <italic>S. oryzae</italic>. An identical intensity of repellence (100%) against rice weevil was recorded by Ogendo et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-insects-11-00836" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] after a 24 h exposure to oil and eugenol from 
 <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> at concentrations of 0.15% and 0.2% (
 <italic>v/w</italic>).
