<p>It should be noted that plant-based products (including EOs) also have weaknesses, as well as some limitations in terms of their large-scale use and their commercialization. For instance, they a show poor stability (short environmental persistence) and lower efficacy than chemical insecticides, and they pose other technological problems. In addition, their toxicological and environmental assessments are expensive, and they must also comply with strict registration regulations [
