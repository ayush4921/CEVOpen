<p>Total flavonoids in 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> were quantified using the method of Arjamand et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Half a millilitre (0.5 mL) of 2% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> in ethanol was added to 0.5 mL (1 mg/mL) of the sample solution and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, after which the absorbance was measured at 420 nm. The extracted sample was evaluated at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, and the flavonoid content was calculated as quercetin (mg/g) equivalents using the following equation based on the calibration curve: 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 0.025
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.1335 (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9812), and expressed as mg of quercetin equivalent (QE/g).
