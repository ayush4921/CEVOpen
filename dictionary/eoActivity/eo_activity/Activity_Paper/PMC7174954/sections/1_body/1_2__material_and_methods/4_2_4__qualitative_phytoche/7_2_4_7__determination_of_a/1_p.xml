<p>Alkaloid contents were quantitatively determined according to Olajuyigbe and Afolayan [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Five grams of fresh rhizome samples was soaked in 200 mL of 10% acetic acid in ethanol. The mixture was covered and allowed to stand for 4 hours. The filtrate was concentrated in a water bath to a quarter of its original volume. Concentrated NH
 <sub>4</sub>(OH)
 <sub>2</sub> was added dropwise to the filtrate until precipitation was completed, and the whole solution was allowed to settle. The collected precipitates were washed with dilute ammonium hydroxide then filtered again. The residue collected was dried and weighed. The alkaloid content was determined using the formula
