<p>In this research, quantitative variability in the flavonoid, tannin, flavonol, and proanthocyanidin contents of the wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> may be related to differences in geographical locations, climatic conditions, soil type, and natural or anthropogenic disturbances. It was previously reported that the wild state of the plant is usually in a shady and moist habitat but the cultivated plant may be inconsistently shaded and other environmental conditions may not be adequately simulated unlike the ones in the wild; hence there may be phytochemical variations [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] as shown in the results of this research. According to Ashashri et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Tajalli et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the exposure of plants to harsh environmental conditions including insects and infections is known to enhance the productions of flavonols and flavonoids. These phytochemicals are for self-protection. Hence, significantly higher concentrations of flavonoids and flavonols were observed in wild 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic>. Lower concentrations of flavonols, flavonoids, tannins, and flavonoids in cultivated plants might be due to the plants being unable to produce desired bioactive compounds under controlled conditions. Similar results were also reported by Sefidkon et al. [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], who observed that cultivated plants produced lower levels of secondary metabolites due to monoculture cultivation conditions. Several studies have reported that majority of pharmacologically important compounds of plant origin are products of defense to protect plants against stress, insects, herbivores, and diseases [

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The presence of flavonoids in both wild and cultivated plants may show the ability of this plant to scavenge free radicals [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The higher content of proanthocyanidin observed in this study may validate the claim of medicinal plant users about antihypertensive properties of 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> which was also reported by Wintola and Afolayan [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].
