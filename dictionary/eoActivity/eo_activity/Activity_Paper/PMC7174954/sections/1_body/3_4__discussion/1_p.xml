<p>Phytochemical contents varied greatly among the three solvents in both wild and cultivated plants. This is an indication that the solvents have different extracting abilities for phytochemicals. It was observed that the phytochemical constituents in the wild plants were higher than those in the cultivated plants. The harsh seasonal variations may explain the differences in the concentration of bioactive compounds between the wild and cultivated
