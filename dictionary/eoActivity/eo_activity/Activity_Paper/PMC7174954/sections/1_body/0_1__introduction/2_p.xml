<p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) red data list criteria of South Africa, 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> is considered vulnerable and under conservation in protected areas [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is mostly harvested for medicinal purposes and is used as antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, anti-HIV, and diuretic agents [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is overexploited, as it is commonly harvested for commercial purposes and sold in traditional markets [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The collection and trading of the plant products provide additional income for the rural poor people but, however, may result in overexploitation which could lead to its extinction [
