<p>There were significant differences among compositions and antioxidant activities of studied extracts. The wild plants exhibited superior levels of phytochemical and antioxidant activities than cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic>. Even though cultivated plants of 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> showed lower levels of proanthocyanidin, total flavonols, total flavonoids, alkaloids, and tannin, this however showed that the potential of the plant has been used in an antioxidant agent as the IC
 <sub>50</sub> showed activity at the lowest concentrations tested. Therefore, this IC
 <sub>50</sub> gives an indication that cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> can be effectively used in traditional medicine rather than relying on the rhizome from the wild populations alone. Based on the presented results, the rareness of natural antioxidant medicinal plants due to the cost and unavailability of the wild plants could be overcome by using cultivated species. Domestication of these wild plants coupled with extensive qualitative profiling to validate consistency in phytochemical composition can reduce the pressure on the wild populations.
