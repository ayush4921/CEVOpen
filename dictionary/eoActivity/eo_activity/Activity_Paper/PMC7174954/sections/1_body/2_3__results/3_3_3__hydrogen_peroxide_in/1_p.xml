<p>The hydrogen peroxide radical inhibition activities of wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. There was a concentration-dependent increase in inhibition in the extracts assayed. The methanol extracts of both wild and cultivated plants showed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) at all concentrations. The methanol extract of the wild plants showed significantly higher mean (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) radical inhibition at all concentrations. There was also a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in radical inhibition by the acetone extracts of the cultivated and wild plant at all concentrations except at 0.5 mg/mL. Acetone extracts of the wild plants had significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) scavenging activity of 14.15, 31.04, and 34.51% at 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/mL, respectively, except at 0.2 mg/mL. The water extracts of the wild plants had significantly higher radical inhibition compared to water extracts of the cultivated plants.
