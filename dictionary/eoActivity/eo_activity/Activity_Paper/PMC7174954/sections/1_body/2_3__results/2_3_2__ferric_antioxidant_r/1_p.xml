<p>The reducing power of the wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> from the three solvent extracts and standard drugs is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The reducing power of the solvent extracts on ferric to ferrous gradually increased with increase in concentration. The reducing capacity of methanol extracts of wild and cultivated plants within a concentration showed no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in all concentrations tested. Acetone extracts of the wild plants had a significantly higher mean (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reducing power than acetone extracts of the cultivated plants. Significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reducing powers were also observed in water extracts of the wild plants at all concentrations assayed.
