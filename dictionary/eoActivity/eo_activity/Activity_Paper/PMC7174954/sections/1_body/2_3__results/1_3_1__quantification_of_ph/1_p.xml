<p>Phytochemical constituents of wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> revealed the presence of tannins, saponins, alkaloids, proathocyanidins, flavonoids, flavonols, and total phenolics (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The phytochemicals obtained from the plant extracts varied greatly among the three solvents, in both wild and cultivated plants. Wild and cultivated plants showed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in tannin content for both acetone and methanol extracts but not in water extracts. The methanol and acetone extracts of wild and cultivated plants showed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the alkaloid contents except in water extracts. Saponin contents in both wild and cultivated extracts of 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> showed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in all solvents. Methanol and water extracts of wild plants showed a significantly higher (

 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> extracts exhibited significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) total flavonols, flavonoids, and proanthocyanidin contents in all solvents compared to cultivated plants.
