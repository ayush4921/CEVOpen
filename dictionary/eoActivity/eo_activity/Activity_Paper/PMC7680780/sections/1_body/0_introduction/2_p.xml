<p id="p0010">Metallic nanoparticles, including gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AuNPs), have received much attention because of the catalytic, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties exhibited when compared to their respective bulk metallic state [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Physical and chemical methods have been employed for the synthesis of nanoparticles, but several associated limitations have led to the use of biological methods, including the use of microorganisms and plants/plant products. These limitations include time consumption during synthesis and the use of chemicals which might produce toxic nanoparticles, and are not eco-friendly [
