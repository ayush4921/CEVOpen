<p id="p0140">The free radicals released during various biological processes are involved in pathogenicity. The antioxidant activities of nanoparticles and CECR were carried out against DPPH radical. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>, the extract (CECR) and the nanoparticles exhibited good DPPH radical scavenging activity at all tested concentrations in a dose dependent manner, except for AECR-AuNPs that rarely exhibited DPPH radical scavenging activity at lower concentrations (20 and 40 μg/mL). At the highest tested concentration (100 μg/mL), the exhibition of DPPH radical scavenging activity was in the following order: Ascorbic acid (85.30%) &gt; CECR-AuNPs (78.69%) &gt; CECR (78.29%) &gt; CECR-AgNPs (72.81%) &gt; AECR-AgNPs (68.47%) &gt; AECR-AuNPs (66.87%) (
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Noted differences in the activities could be linked to the extraction method, indicating higher antioxidant potential with traditional extraction of the 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic> leaves. These phytochemicals also contributed to the stabilizing of the nanoparticles. Higher DPPH radical scavenging activity was reported in 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> synthesized silver chloride nanoparticles (Gu-AgClNPs) when compared to 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> synthesized gold nanoparticles (Gu-AuNPs) [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Contradictions noted compared with our study could be due to differences in phytochemicals present in both plants (
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic>).
