<p id="p0115">The TEM and SEM images (Figures 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) revealed the shape, size, and morphology features of the biological synthesized AuNPs and AgNPs. The size range was found to be 15–25 nm for AgNPs, and presented mostly spherical shapes and some hexagonal shapes. On the other hand, the size of AuNPs was ranging from 10 – 20 nm in diameter, and were mostly spherical in shape (
