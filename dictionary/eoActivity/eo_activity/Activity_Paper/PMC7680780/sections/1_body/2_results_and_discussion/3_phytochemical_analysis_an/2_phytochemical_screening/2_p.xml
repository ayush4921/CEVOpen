<p id="p0130">Phytochemicals have been reported to have a major impact in the biosynthesis of nanoparticles using medicinal plants. The total phenolics and flavonoids contents were estimated and compared. It was noted that CECR-AuNPs possessed significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher TPC and TFC when compared to AECR-AuNPs and the AgNPs (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), although, the CECR had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher TPC and TFC compared to CECR-AuNPs and other nanoparticles. These differences might be linked to the involvement of these phytochemicals in the reduction of gold or silver ions to the nanoparticles [
