<p id="p0055">The reaction mixture used in the synthesis of AgNPs was optimized by using five different volumes of AECR/CECR (0.1 g extract/mL) to aqueous solutions of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> (1 mM) at synthesis ratio 10:90, 20:80, 30:70, 40:60, 50:50, respectively. The addition was performed in a single step. This is because bio-reduction of metal ions usually occur readily in solution, resulting in stable nanoparticles [

 <sub>3</sub> (1 mM) was used, as increased volumes resulted in aggregation of the nanoparticles.
