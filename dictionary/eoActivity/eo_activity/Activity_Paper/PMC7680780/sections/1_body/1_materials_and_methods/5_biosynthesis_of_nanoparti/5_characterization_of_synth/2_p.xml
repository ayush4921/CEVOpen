<p id="p0070">The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Visible) spectroscopy of the AgNPs and AuNPs was performed using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, to assess the wavelength and stability of the nanoparticles. The sizes, shapes, and morphology of the synthesized AgNPs and AuNPs were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The presence of functional groups was detected by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy using dried pellets of these nanoparticles.</p>
