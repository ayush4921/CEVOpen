  <p>Chemometric analysis of honeys using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) scanned from 4000 to 400 cm
   <sup>−1</sup>. MH1: manuka honey containing methylglyoxal 400 mg/kg, ARJ: arjuna honey, GUG: guggul honey, JIA: jiaogulan honey and OLI: olive honey. The values indicate peaks of vibrational regions representing functional groups typical for natural honeys. The regions of 3700–3000 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> and 3000–2800 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> indicate O-H stretching of water molecules, and C-H stretching of sugars, respectively. A peak at 1624 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> in all honeys is assigned for the bending of H-O-H molecules. The 1540–1175 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> region indicated bending modes for C-O-H, C-C-H, and O-C-H groups. The 1175–940 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> fingerprint region was specific for stretching modes of C-O and C-C of carbohydrates, and bands in 900–750 cm
   <sup>−1</sup> indicated the stretching modes of C-O and C-C of saccharide molecules.
