<p>Color intensity of honeys was measured following Saxena, Gautam and Sharma [
 <xref rid="B30-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Honey solutions (50%,

 <italic>v</italic> in Milli-Q water) were filtered using 0.45 µm sterile Millex filters (Merk, Bayswater, VIC, Australia) to remove particles. Results were calculated as the difference of the 450 and 720 nm absorbance readings recorded from a Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).
