<p>Four healthy bee colonies provided by Berley Honey were kept separately in semi-control enclosures and each was fed with a medicinal nectar, which is a solution of sugars, amino acids and a medicinal plant extract (
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00151-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Briefly, sugar proportion was prepared following the sugar pattern of 
 <italic>melitophilus</italic> flowering plant species, which are beneficial for honeybees [

 <xref rid="B22-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A range of amino acids was prepared following the profile of amino acids identified in flower nectar of 
 <italic>Prunella vulgaris,</italic> which is a bee-friendly herb species [

 <xref rid="B24-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The inclusion of plant extract was adjusted to the beesâ€™ preference to the nectar. In addition, pollen granules A
 <sup>+</sup> premium grade (Western Australia) was given daily as a protein source to maintain bee colonies. Extracts of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> bark, 
 <italic>C. mukul</italic> stem and 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> leaves were obtained following methods described by Sultana et al. [

 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with some minor modifications. Olive retentate (Boundary Bend, VIC, Australia) was directly used to replace plant extracts in the preparation of nectar as it is a liquid that contains (mg/100 mL): total phenol content 90.5, hydroxytyrosol 15, sodium 1.9, total sugars &lt; 1.9, fat &lt; 0.2, protein 0.1.
