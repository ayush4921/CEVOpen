<p>Total flavonoid content was measured following the method described by Islam et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Two grams of honey was diluted into 10 mL methanol and filtered with a 0.45 µm sterile Millex filter (Merk, Bayswater, VIC, Australia). Then, 1 mL of the 20% honey solution (

The absorbance was recorded at 510 nm within 5 min using a Lambda 35 UV–vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Catechin standards ranging from 0 to 100 μg/mL were used to construct a calibration curve against a blank consisted of honey solution and methanol without AlCl
