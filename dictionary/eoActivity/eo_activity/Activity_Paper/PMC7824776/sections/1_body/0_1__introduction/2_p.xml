<p>Honey has attracted great attention as a natural sweetener that promotes health because it contains a high quantity of reducing sugars, a noticeable content of enzymes, proteins, vitamins and minerals and a wide range of phytochemicals. Due to the diversity of plant metabolites in floral nectars, chemical profiles and consequently, antioxidant activities of honeys are diverse [
