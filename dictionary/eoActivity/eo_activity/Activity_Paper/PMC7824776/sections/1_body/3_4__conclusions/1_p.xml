<p>The current study demonstrated that the quality of manuka and four newly developed honeys (arjuna, guggul, jiaogulan and olive), in terms of physicochemical properties, comply with the international quality regulations (EEC, 110/2001), excluding olive honey which contains a low monosaccharide content (49.2%). FTIR analysis of the honeys confirmed the presence of the functional groups which are typical for natural honeys. Arjuna and guggul honeys showed their highest phenolic content (73.4 and 108.2 mg GAE/100 g, respectively), correlating with their strongest RSA (up to 90.8% and 91.7%) and an outstanding AEAC (81.0 and 81.9 mg/100 g honey). Manuka honey also contains a high amount of phenolics as arjuna does (72.1 mg GAE/100 g) but its flavonoids are relatively low (3.9 mg CAE/100 g) and it elicited a moderate RSA (55.5%) and AOAC (49.6 mg/100 g). Olive honey demonstrated the highest quantity of flavonoids (24.0 mg CAE/100 g), a significant amount of phenolics (59.8 mg GAE/100 g), a considerable RAS (75.2%) and AOAC (67.1 mg/100 g). Jiaogulan honey exhibited the lowest antioxidant quantities and activities but it was the most cytotoxic of the tested honeys. Particularly, 5% and 10% of this honey reduced cell viability up to 93.5% and 92.0% after 72 h and 24 h, respectively.</p>
