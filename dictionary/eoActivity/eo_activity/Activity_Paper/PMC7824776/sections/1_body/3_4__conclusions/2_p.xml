<p>Only manuka and jiaogulan honeys activated 
 <italic>Nrf2</italic>, but all the tested honeys upregulated the downstream 
 <italic>NQO1</italic> gene expression and they showed a stronger effect on this gene at 2.0% concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Preliminary results for the protective effects of the tested honeys on cholesterol homeostasis were obtained. Manuka (1.0% and 2.0%), arjuna (2.0%) and guggul show a good agreement in terms of the reduced TC and the transcriptional level of the tested genes. Jaogulan and olive modulated the tested gene in the pattern that should lead to a TC reduction, but this reduction did not occur (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f005">Figure 5</xref>E,F). They possibly protected the cells from increased cholesterol accumulation that we recorded through stimulating the conversion of free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters, while they modulated the tested genes in the pattern of 
 <italic>AMPK-SREBP2</italic> pathway to reduce cellular free cholesterol content [
 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Although the tested honeys (except olive honey) activated 
 <italic>PPARÎ±</italic>, all of them did not reduce cellular triglyceride content in fatty acid-induced HepG2 cells. For the first time the current study provides evidence on the physicochemical quality, antioxidant properties and the protective effects of manuka and four newly developed honeys (arjuna, guggul, jiaogulan and olive) on cholesterol homeostasis at cellular and molecular levels, however, further investigations are needed to better understand their mode of action in lipogenesis.
