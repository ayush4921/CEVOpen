Color intensity of the medicinal honeys greatly varied, with the highest value noted for manuka honey (2201.1 mAU), whereas much lower values were recorded for the four new medicinal honeys (462.3, 722.7, 171.7 and 243.5 mAU for arjuna, guggul, jiaogulan and olive honey, respectively). The findings were in line with other observations, in which color intensity of natural honey ranges from 125.0 to 3400.0 mAU [
