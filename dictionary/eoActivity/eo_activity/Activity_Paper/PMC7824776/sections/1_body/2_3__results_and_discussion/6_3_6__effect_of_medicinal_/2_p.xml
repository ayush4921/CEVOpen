<p>The analogue (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>A) at 1.0% and 2.0% stimulated 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic> through the activation of 
 <italic>AMPKα.</italic> It also upregulated 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic> downstream genes, 
 <italic>HMGCR</italic> and 
 <italic>LDLR,</italic> at 1.0% but not at 2.0% (3.9- and 1.2-fold change relative to control, respectively). This finding is consistent with an increased TC content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f005">Figure 5</xref>A) and is in line with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], suggesting that 1.0% analogue stimulates the cholesterol synthesis in the fatty acid-induced HepG2 cells, likely through the 
 <italic>SCAP-SREBP2</italic> pathway by lowering free cholesterol in the cells and/or desensitizing SCAP to cholesterol [
 <xref rid="B64-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The 1% analogue also upregulates the 
 <italic>LXRα</italic> and 
 <italic>PPARα</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>A). The results are consistent with a recent study reporting either glucose alone (25 mM) or a mixture of glucose and fructose upregulated 
 <italic>LXRα</italic> in the presence of 1.0 mM fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B65-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. As 
 <italic>LXRs</italic> function in cholesterol absorption, transport, efflux, and excretion process, their upregulation improves reverse cholesterol transport and circulation of high-density-lipoprotein [
 <xref rid="B66-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Interestingly, 2% analogue did not show any effect on the transcript level of the target genes, although a significant increase in TC was recorded. It has been extensively known that 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic> works in a negative feedback mechanism, which means an increase in cellular cholesterols suppresses 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic> and downregulates its target genes [
 <xref rid="B67-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Thus, the elevation of 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic> mRNA abundance at 2.0% analogue could result from the activation of 
 <italic>AMPK</italic> but then the transcription of its downstream genes possibly was suppressed by the increased accumulation of TC (
