<p>Guggul honey (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>D) activated both 
 <italic>AMPK</italic> and 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic> and it showed a stronger effect on the 
 <italic>SREBP2</italic> gene at 2% concentration (2.2-fold change compared to control). This honey also induced 
 <italic>HCGMR</italic> against the effect of the analogue and increased 
 <italic>LDLR</italic> mRNA transcription at 1.0%, but not at 2.0% as expected. Instead, it upregulated 
 <italic>LXRα</italic> gene expression at 2.0% concentration. Previous investigations indicated that an activation of 
 <italic>LXRα</italic> leads to the upregulation of its direct targets and improves the transfer of cellular cholesterol to small high-density lipoproteins to prevent the formation of foam cells [

 <xref rid="B72-nutrients-13-00151" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Thus, guggul honey through the activation of 
 <italic>LXRα</italic> likely increased the transcriptional levels of transporter genes and proteins, leading to a TC reduction as observed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f005">Figure 5</xref>D. Based on the responsive trend of the genes, we hypothesize that clearer effects of guggul honey on the tested genes could be observed at a later terminating time of the experiment. However, further study should include transporter genes and protein analysis to better understand the effect of guggul honey on hypercholesterolemia.
