<p>All the tested samples upregulated NQO1 gene, but the analogue showed a lower level of transcription (&lt;1.5 fold) compared to the honeys (&gt;1.5 fold), suggesting an additional effect of non-sugar components of honeys on the gene. The four newly developed honeys demonstrated a stronger effect at 2.0% compared to 1.0% on the increase in
