<p>Radical scavenging activity (RSA) is extensively examined in biological samples using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), a stable nitrogen-centered radical. The RSA of the tested honey varied. Arjuna and guggul honeys showed the highest RSA (90.8% and 91.7%), followed by olive and manuka honeys (75.2% and 55.5%) and jiaogulan honey (21.7%). The RSA of arjuna and guggul are outstanding, while those for other tested honeys are comparable to Bangladesh and Indian natural honeys (33.6–97.5% and 44.0–71.0%, respectively) [
