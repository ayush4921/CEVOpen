<p>Ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant content (AEAC), calculated using the calibration curve of ascorbic acid standards (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.998), revealed the antioxidant potential of the medicinal honeys. The highest AEAC was for arjuna and guggul honeys (81.0 and 81.9 mg/100 g, respectively), followed by olive and manuka honeys (67.1 and 49.6 mg/100 g, respectively) and the lowest was found in jiaogulan honey (19.4 mg/100 g). Except jiaogulan honey, the tested honeys showed higher AEAC values compared to Burkina Fasan, India and Bangladesh honeys (10.20â€“37.87 mg AEAC/100 g) [
