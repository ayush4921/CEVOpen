<p>The tested honeys (excluding olive honey) at both 1.0% and 2.0% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) activated 
 <italic>AMPKÎ±</italic> but the expression levels of this gene varied, depending on honey type and concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00151-f006">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, all tested honeys at 1.0% induced 
 <italic>HMGCR</italic> gene expression to the level close to the control, indicating that the honeys modulated 
 <italic>HMGCR</italic> gene expression against the analogue (3.9-fold change compared to control).
