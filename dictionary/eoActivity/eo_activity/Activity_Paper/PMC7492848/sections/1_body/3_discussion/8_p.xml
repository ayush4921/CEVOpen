<p id="p0255">Carbopol 940 was used as gelling agent in the formulation based on its biodegradable, bioadhesive, biocompatible and non-irritant properties. The percentage of polymer used was optimized in preliminary studies and 1% carbopol concentration was selected to prepare the herbal formulations. Carbopol gels (1%) were formulated by incorporating 2% concentration of 
 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> and 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> individually and in predetermined combination. This was to evaluate and observe the activities of the extracts when combined and when used individually in the formulation as potential anti-inflammatory agents.
