 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> leaves showed that its highest phytochemical content was 37.1 mg/g steroids, while the least was 0.71 mg/g saponins. Methanol extract of 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> leaves gave 29.87 mg/g alkaloids as its highest phytochemical content while 0.71 mg/g saponins was its least content as presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Presence of bioactive compounds which include secondary metabolites such as saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids, phenols, tannins and glycosides have been attributed to the biological activities of plants employed in the treatments of diseases. Earlier report shows that pain relief have been attributed to the bioactive constituent of
