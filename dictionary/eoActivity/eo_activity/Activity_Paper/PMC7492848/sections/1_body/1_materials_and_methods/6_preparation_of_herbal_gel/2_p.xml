<p id="p0105">Methyl paraben (0.2 g) was weighed and added to heated water and stirred until it dissolved. The extract was weighed and dissolved in 15 mL of propylene glycol. The extract mix was poured into the dissolved methyl paraben. 1 g of carbopol was weighed, sieved, dispersed into the mixture, made up to 100 mL, and stirred continuously for 30 min using a stirrer. Triethanolamine was added to adjust the pH and stirred slowly until a clear and transparent gel was obtained. For each of the five formulations, 
 <italic>Chasmanthera dependens</italic> and 
 <italic>Chenopodium ambrosioides</italic> were combined at a ratio of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100, based on the composition presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The method was done according to 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Aslani et al. (2013)</xref> with slight variations to pH 6 using triethanolamine and stirred slowly until a clear and transparent gel was obtained.
