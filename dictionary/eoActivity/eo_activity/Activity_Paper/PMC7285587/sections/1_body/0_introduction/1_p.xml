<p id="Par5">One hundred twenty-four years after ethnobotany’s first definition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], Catalonia finds itself among the well-studied territories at the level of traditional knowledge on plant biodiversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Mountainous regions have been extensively sampled from the beginning of the practice of this science in our country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], drawing an almost complete ethnobotanical map of the Catalan part of the Pyrenean mountain range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Also profusely investigated is the coast and the two mountain ranges (littoral and prelittoral) that stretch along the coastline, from the area just north of Cap de Creus to Terres de l’Ebre in the south [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], basically constituting the Catalanidic territory from the physiographic point of view [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and plateaus and basins of central Catalonia, in the Auso-Segarric physiographic territory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Apart from a few areas in the Pyrenees and the Ebro delta and its neighbouring territories, Catalan ethnobotanical prospection presents a significant gap in the Western plains. This area has a continental Mediterranean climate, with high thermic contrasts between warm and cold periods, and significantly dry, with almost five arid or perarid months per year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The soil is generally calcareous and, not rarely, saline or gypseous [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These territories, roughly coincidental with the Sicoric physiographic territory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], are the only semiarid or arid lands in Catalonia, where some elements of steppe flora are present [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].
