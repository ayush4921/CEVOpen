<p id="Par32">The number of medicinal plants used per informant is 1.94, value comprised between those found in Alt Empordà and Montseny (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A much higher value was obtained for the Segarra district, an area close to the Garrigues. However, this difference must be interpreted with caution, because it may be a bias partially due to the number of the informants interviewed (29 compared to 101). Medicinal plants per habitant are 0.88 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>, a value similar to those recorded in Cerdanya or Ripollès (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Finally, medicinal plants per area are 0.17, a value near the one of Pallars, and lower than in other studied areas, like Montseny or Alt Empordà (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
