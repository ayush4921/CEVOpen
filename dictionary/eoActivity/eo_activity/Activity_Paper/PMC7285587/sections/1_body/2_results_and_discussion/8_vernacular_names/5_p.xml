<p id="Par62">Finally, we want to mention the interesting case of a certain number of plant names that have gender adjectives although they are not dioecious taxa. Some plants are named based on other taxa’s names with the addition of ‘mascle’ (male) or ‘femella’ (female), irrespective of their sexual condition. As already stated, ‘timó’ is the typical name for 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>; based on this, 
 <italic>Teucrium</italic> gr. 
 <italic>polium</italic> (belonging to the same family as 
 <italic>Thymus</italic>) and 
 <italic>Coris monspeliensis</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>monspeliensis</italic> (from another family) are termed ‘timó mascle’. 
 <italic>Santolina chamaecyparissus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>squarrosa</italic> is named ‘espernallac’ or ‘espernallac femella’, whereas 
 <italic>Artemisia-herba-alba</italic> is known as ‘espernallac mascle’; in this case, people commenting that the former species produces flowers and the latter does not (in fact, 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> capitula and flowers are much smaller and less visible than those of 
 <italic>Santolina</italic>).
