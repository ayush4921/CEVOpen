<p id="p0030">Bryophytes are non-vascular plants (
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Hallingback and Hodgetts, 2000</xref>) and they have a very simple structure compare to the higher plants. They occur in nearly every ecosystem on the Earth and are important especially in biogeochemical cycles (
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Vanderpoorten and Goffinet, 2009</xref>). Bryophytes are known to be a good source of metabolites, which have good biological activity (
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">Krzaczkowski et al., 2009</xref>). As a result of this, they are good candidates for novel active pharmaceutical compound researches (
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Asakawa, 2000</xref>). There are several studies in the literature presenting the anti-infective potential of bryophytes against viruses, microfungi and bacteria, and antitumor activity against some cancer cells. In addition to those, they were successfully used as inhibitors of some enzymes important in metabolic pathways causing diseases and some other properties such as anti-platelet, antioxidant were also presented (
