<p id="p0120">Biofilms have been reported by several researchers that they involve in several types of infections mostly related with some permenant indwelling devices such as heart valves, joint prostheses and catheters, but also found to cause endocarditis, dental plaque formation, middle-ear infections and urinary tract infections (
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Parsek and Singh, 2003</xref>). As a reason of this, scientists are trying to determine compounds those would inhibit the formation of biofilms. There are no studys in the literature either about the antibiofilm activity of 
 <italic>BC</italic> or detailed studies regarding the antibiofilm activity of mosses. Thus, it is not possible to compare our results with any other bryophyte sample. Biofilm formation capacities of tested strains and biofilm inhibition percentages of the extract against these three test strains were highest found 3% and 5% antibiofilm activity for 50 µL.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 100 µL.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the extract respectively against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>. It is known that biofilms are also form on biotic surfaces such as human skin (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Karatan and Watnick, 2009</xref>) and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> is one of the microorganisms, which are responsible for biofilm formation on skin. All microorganisms used in this study have capability of causing formation of biofilms on human skin (

 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Sudjana et al., 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Onbasli et al., 2019</xref>). The biofilm inhibition percentages of the extracts were found to be very low, when compared to other plant extracts, such as 
 <italic>Boswellia papyrifera</italic> oils, which presented 71% to 99% inhibition against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> with concentrations between 217 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 6.8 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Schillaci et al., 2008</xref>). But the results regarding 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract are very promising, since increasing concentration would possibly increase the biofilm inhibition percentages against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>.
