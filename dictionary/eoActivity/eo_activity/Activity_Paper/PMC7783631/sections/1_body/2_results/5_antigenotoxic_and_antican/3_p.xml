<p id="p0110">Three different cell lines, MCF-12A (human breast epithelial cells), SKBR 3 (human breast cancer cells) and HeLa (human cervix cancer cells), with two different concentrations (500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were used in the study. Cytotoxicity test results in terms of cell viability (%) are given in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. According to 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> survival rate for a mammalian cell, human breast epithelial cells (MCF-12A) was 100% and 82% after incubation with 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <italic>BC</italic> extracts respectively. But for human breast cancer cells (SKBR 3) the survival rate was decreased to 69% and 40% after incubation with 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <italic>BC</italic> extracts respectively. These rates were much lower in human cervix cancer cells (HeLa) such as 67% and 24% after incubation with 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <italic>BC</italic> extracts respectively. Furthermore, cytotoxicity results given in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> presented that the extract of 500 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> is also safe, since the cytotoxicity rate of this extract was 0% on MCF-12A cells. Instead, as it was stated in 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> the extract of 1000 µg.mL
 <sup>−1</sup> caused only 0.05% of DNA damage and the cytotoxicity rate of this concentration was 18 ± 5% on MCF-12A cells (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). According to the results it can be concluded that 
 <italic>BC</italic> extract presented notable anticancer activity against SKBR 3 and HeLa cells, while having relatively very low cytotoxic activity against MCF-12A cells.
