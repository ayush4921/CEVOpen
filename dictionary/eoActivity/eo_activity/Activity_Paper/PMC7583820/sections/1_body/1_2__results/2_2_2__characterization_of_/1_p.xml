<p>In order to determine the composition of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> acetonic extract, a high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry analysis was performed using a Q-Exactiveâ„¢ Plus mass spectrometer (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04482-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The identification of polyphenols was based on their exact mass, their elemental composition, and their fragmentation behavior (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04482">Figure S2</xref>), in comparison with standards and databases. The high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry analysis revealed the presence of 19 compounds, including phenolic acids and flavonoids in 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> acetonic extracts (
