<p>The total flavonoid content was determined using the aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) colorimetric assay adapted from Zhishen et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. For this measurement, 100 μL of sample was mixed in a 96-well microplate with 6 μL of 5% aqueous sodium nitrite (NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>) solution. After 5 min, 6 μL of 10% aqueous AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> were added and the mixture was vortexed. Then, after 1 min incubation, 40 μL of 1 M NaOH was added. The absorbance was read at 510 nm (FLUOstar Optima, BMG Labtech). A calibration curve between 6.25 and 300 µM was prepared using a standard solution of quercetin. The total flavonoid contents were expressed as the mg quercetin equivalent (QE) per 100 g of dried plant powder.
