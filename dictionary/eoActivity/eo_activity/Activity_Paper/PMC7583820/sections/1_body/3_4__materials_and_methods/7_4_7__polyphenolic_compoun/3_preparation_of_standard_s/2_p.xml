<p>The calibration curves were built by plotting the peak area of the analytes against the corresponding analytes concentrations with linear regression using standard samples at nine concentrations. The calibration curves of each polyphenol had a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99. The method accuracy was estimated by calculating the percent deviation observed in the analysis of QC samples and expressed by relative error. The intraday precision was estimated by analyzing QC samples at three concentration levels (25, 250, 4000 ng/mL) of the seven analytes within 24 h (n = 8). The inter-day accuracy was estimated by the repeated analysis of QC samples (n = 8).</p>
