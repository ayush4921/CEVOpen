<p>Polyphenols extracted from 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> acetone-evaporated or aqueous extracts were identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, coupled with diode array detection and HESI-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q-Exactive™ Plus, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Briefly, 10 µL of the sample was injected using an UHPLC system equipped with a Thermo Fisher Ultimate 3000 series WPS-3000 RS autosampler and then separated on a PFP column (2.6 μm, 100 mm × 2.1 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The column was eluted with a gradient mixture of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) at the flow rate of 0.450 mL/min, with 5% B at 0.00 to 0.1 min, 35% B at 0.1 to 7.1 min, 95% B at 7.2 to 7.9 min, and 5% B at 8.0 to 10 min. The column temperature was held at 30 °C and the detection wavelengths were set to 280 and 310 nm, allowing the identification of phenolic acids and flavonoids, respectively.
