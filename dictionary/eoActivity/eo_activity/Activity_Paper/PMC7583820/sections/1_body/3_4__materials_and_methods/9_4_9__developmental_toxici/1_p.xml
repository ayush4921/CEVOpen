<p>The day before the start of the toxicity test assay, breeding males and females (optimal ratio 2:1) were placed in the same tank but were physically separated. The next day, 1 h after light onset, fish couples were allowed to spawn for 1 h. The eggs were collected, rinsed with fish water system, randomly mixed, and quickly distributed in the different concentrations of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> aqueous and acetone-evaporated extracts prepared with E3 medium. The treatment was performed between 1 and 3 h post fertilization (dpf) for embryos and between 3 and 5 dpf for larvae. The quality of the spawn (&gt;70% of fertilization) was checked for fitting with the OECD recommendations (guidelines 236: Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity (FET) Test) [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The fertilized eggs were selected using a stereomicroscope and dispatched in a 24-well plate as follows: in each well, five fertilized eggs were placed in 2 mL of the respective concentrations of either 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> aqueous extract (40, 30, 22.5, 16.9, 12.7, 9.5, 7.2, and 2.3 g/L) or 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> acetone-evaporated extract (16.9, 12.7, 9.5,7.2, 5.4, 4, 3, 2.3, 1.7, and 1.3 g/L) diluted in E3 medium. The concentration range was chosen on the basis of traditional use, which consists of infusion of 1â€“4 g of dried leaves in 1 L of boiled water for 10 min. Because 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> has been registered at the French pharmacopeia, this concentration was supposed to be non-toxic in adults. Thus, the lowest doses tested were 2.3 and 1.3 g/L for aqueous and acetone-evaporated extract, respectively.
