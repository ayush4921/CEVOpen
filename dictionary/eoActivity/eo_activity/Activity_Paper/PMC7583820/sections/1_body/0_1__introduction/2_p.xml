<p>Since 2012, 22 medicinal plants have been registered at the French pharmacopeia [

 <italic>Antirhea borbonica</italic> (
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic>) leaves are peculiarly interesting, as they are widely used in traditional medicine for treating, among other things, diabetes, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, hemorrhage, rheumatism, and also kidney stones [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Most of these interesting presumptive effects have been attributed to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> leaves. Based on these beneficial effects, it has been previously reported that polyphenol-rich extracts from 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> exhibited strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, in vitro, on preadipocytes, cerebral endothelial cells, and red blood cells [

 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], as well as, in vivo, in a mouse stroke model [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Importantly, these antioxidant and anti-inflammatory biological effects were associated with the capacity of polyphenols to regulate key molecular targets, such as ROS-producing and detoxifying enzymes and the redox-sensitive transcriptional factor Nrf2, and improve vasoactive markers in these in vitro and in vivo pathological models [
