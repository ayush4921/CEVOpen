<p>Because 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> seems to display therapeutic effects correlated to its polyphenol content, a thorough investigation was required to determine its precise phenolic profile composition and its subsequent potential toxicity. To the best of our knowledge, although registered in French pharmacopeia and despite the various therapeutic effects suggested in a number of in vitro studies (see above), no developmental toxicity study has been reported for any of these 22 medicinal plants.
