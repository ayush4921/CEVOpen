<p>In this study, we identified new major polyphenols such as quercetine-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, protocatechuic acid, and coumaric acids isomers, which have to be taken into account regarding the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effect of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic>. We report for the first time the potential embryonic and larval toxicity at high concentrations of both acetonic and aqueous extracts from the medicinal plant 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> by using the zebrafish embryo model. The present work will be useful to supplement current data on medicinal plants registered at the French pharmacopeia and more generally can be considered as a “proof of concept study” for the further analysis of medicinal plants.
