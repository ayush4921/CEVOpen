 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> polyphenols display neuroprotective effects, preventing the elevation of the brain pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-6) level and exerting its antioxidant property by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [

 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> aqueous extract was evidenced in a diet-induced overweight model in zebrafish displaying oxidative stress and bloodâ€“brain barrier leakage [
