<p>In this work, to the best of our knowledge, we performed for the first time an in-depth characterization of the polyphenol content of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> aqueous and acetonic extracts, demonstrating the presence of new molecules never described before for that plant. Furthermore, although used in humans, the safety profile of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> is largely unknown and no toxicological studies have been carried out so far. We consequently provided data concerning the toxicity of the 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> aqueous and acetonic extracts on relevant in vivo physiological models using zebrafish embryos and larvae.
