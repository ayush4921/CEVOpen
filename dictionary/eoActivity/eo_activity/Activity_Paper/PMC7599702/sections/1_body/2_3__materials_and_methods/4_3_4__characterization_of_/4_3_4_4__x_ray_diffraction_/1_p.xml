<p>XRD analysis of Ag-NPs was performed using Shimadzu Scientific Instruments (SSI), Kyoto, Japan. X-ray Diffraction patterns of silver nanoparticles were obtained with the XRD-6000 series, including stress analysis, residual austenite quantitation, crystallite size/lattice strain, crystallinity calculations, materials analysis via overlaid X-ray diffraction patterns with the Shimadzu apparatus using a nickel-filter, and Cu-Ka targets. The estimated particles size by XRD analysis was performed with Scherrer’s formula as follows:
 <disp-formula>D = 0.94λ/β cos 
  <italic>θ</italic> (β was estimated by Origin 2017 software)
 </disp-formula> where D is the mean particle size, 0.94 is the Scherrer’s constant, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the half of the maximum intensity, and 
 <italic>θ</italic> is the Bragg’s angle.
