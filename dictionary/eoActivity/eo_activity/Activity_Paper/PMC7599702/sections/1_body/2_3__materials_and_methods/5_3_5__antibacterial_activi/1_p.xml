<p>The antibacterial activity of the biologically manufactured Ag-NPs was evaluated against five pathogens, including; Gram-positive strains (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> ATCC 6633) and Gram-negative strains (
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> ATCC 9022, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 8739, and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> ATCC 14028). The selected bacterial strains were cultured on nutrient agar media for 24 h at 37 °C. Bacterial suspensions of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL were separately prepared in sterile saline solution (0.85% v/v), seeded into Muller Hinton agar media, and poured aseptically into sterilized petri plates. Three wells (0.8 cm diameter) were cut in the solidified seeded media, and each well was filled with 100 µL of Ag-NPs (Ag-NPs suspended in distilled water). After loading with Ag-NPs, Muller Hinton plates are set in the refrigerator for 1 h. and after that, incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The potentially clear zones around the wells were measured (mm) and recorded. Ag-NPs were prepared in different concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, and 75.0 ppm), and assessed individually to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against each tested organism [
