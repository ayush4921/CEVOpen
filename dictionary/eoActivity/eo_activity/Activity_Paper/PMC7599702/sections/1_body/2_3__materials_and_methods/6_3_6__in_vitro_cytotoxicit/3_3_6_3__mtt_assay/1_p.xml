<p>The potential cytotoxicity of the biogenic Ag-NPs was evaluated using an MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] assay using normal Vero cells and human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2). Briefly, the cells were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well and treated with double fold dilution (1000–0.48 ppm) of the biosynthesized Ag-NPs and incubated for 48 h. at 37 °C. MTT (5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> in phosphate-buffered saline) was then added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 1–5 h, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Then purple formazan crystals were formed, which were further dissolved by adding DMSO (10%). The plates were agitated using a plate shaker for 30 min in dark conditions. Ultimately, the color intensity of samples was measured at 560 nm using a multi well ELISA plate reader [
