<p>The spread of microbial infections in health care, such as hospitals, is a severe problem that threatens human health. Textiles are considered one of the main factors responsible for the spread of infections between patients and others. Therefore, it is necessary to develop medical textiles that have the ability to reduce the spread of microbial infection by introducing resistance to the medical textiles of pathogenic bacteria. Nanoparticles provide effective tools to accomplish this hypothesis through incorporation into textiles during manufactures [
