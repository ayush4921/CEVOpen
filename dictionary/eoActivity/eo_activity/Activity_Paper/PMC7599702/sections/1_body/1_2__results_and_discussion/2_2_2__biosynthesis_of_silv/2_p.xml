<p>In the current study, the actinomycetal mediated synthesis of nanoparticles was optimized by adding 1 mM pure AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> solution to the washed cell-free extract, incubated for 24 h, at 35 °C (pH = 9). The extracellular synthesis of nanomaterials was inferred by the color of the liquid shifting from colorless to yellowish-brown (

 <sup>+</sup> to Ag
 <sup>0</sup> could be attributed to an electron released as a result of reducing NO
 <sub>3</sub> to NO
 <sub>2</sub> by metabolites involved in the biomass filtrate [
