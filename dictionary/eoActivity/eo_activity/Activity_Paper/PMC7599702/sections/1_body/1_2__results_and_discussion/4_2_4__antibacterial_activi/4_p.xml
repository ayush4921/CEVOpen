<p>Bio-silver nanoparticles derived from actinobacteria previously demonstrated considerable potential as antibacterials [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00641" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The antibacterial efficacy of Ag-NPs could be attributed to the binding of silver with the bacterial cell wall through electrostatic attraction between the positive charge of Ag-NPs and the negative charge of the cell wall. This electrostatic attractions destroys the selective permeability via the reacting of Ag-NPs with sulfur and phosphorylated proteins located in the bacterial cell wall causing partial dissolution of the cell membrane [

 <sup>+</sup>, which causes enhancement of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that destroys the enzymes involved in cellular respiration and are ultimately responsible for cell death [
