<p>This interaction decreases adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) synthesis and damages cellular protein functioning; enzymes, such as protein kinases, prohibit cell repair [

From an industrial overview, NPs are effective in treating cotton fabrics with a concentration that affects the cancerous cell and stays safe to a normal cell, in addition to their activity against human pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, the current study suggests that the biosynthesized Ag-NPs concentration of 100 ppm is appropriate for cotton fabric treatment as a safe dose.
