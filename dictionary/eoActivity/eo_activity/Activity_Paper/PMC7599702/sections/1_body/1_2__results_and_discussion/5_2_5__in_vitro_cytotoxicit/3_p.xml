<p>Our investigations revealed that cloned cells treated with nanoparticles lost their ability to adhere, as demonstrated by a partial or complete collapse of the mono layer integrity along with floating, shrinking, and the cells becoming spherical and granular. Comparable morphological changes were recorded by treating the normal Wi 38 and the cancerous Caco-2 cell lines with biologically created selenium nanoparticles, where the cells lost their shape and monolayer integrity in addition to shrinking, rounding, or cell granulation [

 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated from the curve (

 <sub>50</sub> for normal Vero cells (158 ± 9.53 ppm) was much greater than the corresponding value for cancer Caco-2 cells (4.66 ± 0.21 ppm).
