<p>The antibacterial potential of nano-finished fabrics against selected bacterial pathogens was evaluated using inhibition zones. Our results demonstrated that the raw cotton samples did not have any antibacterial activity either before or after washing. In contrast, although nanoparticles were present in a small concentration, their uniform distribution across the surface of the finished fabrics imparted a broad-spectrum activity. Ag-fabrics displayed the maximum inhibition zone against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (2.63 ± 0.15 mm), while a lesser inhibition zone was recorded against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (1.23 ± 0.05 mm). The functionalized fabrics exhibited a considerable activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, registering the inhibition zones of 1.62 ± 0.15 and 1.91 ± 0.07 mm, respectively.
