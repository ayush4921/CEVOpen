<p>The results of our study showed the efficacy of bio silver nanoparticles at low concentrations of 25 ppm; thus, these NPs could be used as a broad-spectrum nano bactericidal agent. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and the corresponding inhibition zones of the biosynthesized Ag-NPs against pathogenic bacteria are specified and listed in
