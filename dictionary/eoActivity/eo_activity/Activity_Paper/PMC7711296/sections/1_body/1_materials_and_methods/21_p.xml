<p>The percentage inhibition (I%) was calculated in the following way: I%= [Absorbance of control-(Absorbance of sample-Absorbance of blank)]/Absorbance of control√ó100. The concentration of the plant extract that scavenge 50% of the total DPPH radical (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value) was calculated from the graph plotting inhibition percentage against the extract concentrations.
