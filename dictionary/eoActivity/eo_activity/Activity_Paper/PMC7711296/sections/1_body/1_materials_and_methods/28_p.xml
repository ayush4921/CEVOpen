<p>Antibacterial potential of methanol extracts was determined by agar disc diffusion method (Lehmann, 1999
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr"> ▶</xref>). The dried plant extracts were dissolved in DMSO to a final concentration of 200 mg/ml. Bacterial strains were sub cultured from original culture stored at -80ºC and grown on Mueller-Hinton Broth at 37°C for 24 hr. To obtain a lawn culture, 100 µl of the bacterial suspension containing 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml of bacteria was spread on Mueller Hinton agar. The 6 mm disc impregnated with extract solution (200 mg/ml), DMSO (as negative control) and ciproﬂoxacin (25 mg/ml, as positive control) were placed on the lawn cultures. After 24 hr incubation at 37ºC, antibacterial activity was measured as the diameter of the inhibition zone produced by the extract around the disc.
