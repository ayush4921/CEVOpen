<p>Different cancer cell lines including MCF-7, HT29, SH-SY5Y, NCCIT and A549 were treated with different concentration of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. austro-iranicum, A. serotinum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chlorostegium</italic> for 48 h and cytotoxic activity was evaluated using MTT assay. HUVEC human umbilical vein endothelial cell line was selected to examine the toxic effect of the extracts on normal cells. Briefly, 5×10
 <sup>3 </sup>cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates for overnight incubation and treated with increasing concentrations of the extracts (10 to 1250 μg/ml) for 48 hr. The cells were then incubated with medium containing MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml for 3 hr. After this period, media was removed and 100 µl DMSO was added to each well to dissolve formazan crystals and finally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (BioTek-ELx800, USA) at 490 nm was used to measure optical densities (ODs). Mean absorbance for each concentration was divided to the mean absorbance of its controls (control samples were incubated with an equivalent amount of DMSO as the solvent of plant extracts) to calculate percentage of cell viability. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of each extract were calculated using Prism 6.0 (Graph Pad Software, Inc., San Diego, California, USA).
