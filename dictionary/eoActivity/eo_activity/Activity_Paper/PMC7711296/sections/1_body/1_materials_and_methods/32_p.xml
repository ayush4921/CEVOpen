<p>MBC value is defined as the lowest concentration of extract, at which no growth was observed. MBC was measured after MIC determination. It is determined by sub culturing broth dilutions that inhibit growth of a bacterial organism (i.e., those at or above the MIC). The broth dilutions are streaked onto agar and incubated for 24 hr at 37
 <sup>o</sup>C.
