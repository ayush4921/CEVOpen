<p>Apoptosis induction in NCCIT cells after 48 hr treatment with methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. serotinum </italic>was monitored by ﬂow cytometry using annexin V-PE/7-AAD kit. Marker for early apoptosis is translocation of phosphatidylserine to the exterior surfaces of the plasma membrane which can be detected by annexin V-PE binding. Late apoptotic or necrotic cells are permeable for 7-AAD, and DNA stains with this reagent. After treatment with 700 μg/mL 
 <italic>A. serotinum</italic> extract for 48 hr, the early apoptotic rate was 36% and late apoptotic rate was 5% (
