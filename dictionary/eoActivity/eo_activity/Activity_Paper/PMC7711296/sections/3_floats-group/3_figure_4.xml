  <p>The effect of 
   <italic>A. serotinum</italic> methanol extract on cell cycle progression in NCCIT cells. Untreated cells (a) and cell incubated for 48 hr in the presence of 
   <italic>A. serotinum</italic> extract (b) were harvested by trypsinization, fixed, and stained with propidium iodide to determine the profile of the cell cycle by flow cytometry. Results are expressed as mean±SD of 3 independent experiments. *p&lt;0.05 shows significant differences as compared to the control as tested by the Student’s t-test. Each DNA histogram represents one of the three independent experiments
