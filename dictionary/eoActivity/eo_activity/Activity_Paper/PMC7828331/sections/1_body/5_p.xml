<p>Another group of natural products with desired bioactive properties is that of nonribosomal peptides. This group notably includes desotamides, which are newly discovered antibacterial compounds. Fazal et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] provided a concise review of this peptide family of antibiotics, particularly focusing on their biosynthesis. Antibacterial peptides can also be found in marine organisms such as ascidians [
 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Many ascidian-derived molecules, including polysulfides, meroterpenes, amino alcohols, alkaloids and furanones, besides peptides, display antibacterial activities. The presence and biological activities of more than 100 ascidian-derived secondary metabolites were systematically reviewed by Casertano et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], providing lead candidates for drug discovery programs. In addition to ascidians, marine bacteria are also a rich source of novel natural products. Santos et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] gave an overview of marine bacterial products, particularly those with antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer properties [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The authors also discussed screening methodologies for the detection of bioactive marine bacteria, and they suggested strategies for avoiding the re-isolation and re-characterization of known bioactive compounds.
