<p>Many drug discovery campaigns have been launched to explore potent bioactive molecules from plants and microorganisms. Tran et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] successfully isolated two prenylated acetophenones from the fruit of the Australian endemic plant 
 <italic>Acronychia crassipetala.</italic> Their structures were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, as well as 1D (H-NMR and C-NMR) and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (COSY, HSQC, HMBC and NOESY). The research group revealed that one compound is new while the other shows increased inhibition against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> compared to the antibiotic chloramphenicol [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Using similar mass spectrometry and NMR techniques, Primahana et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] elucidated five unprecedented β-carboline derivatives from a rare actinobacterium. One of these isolated molecules displayed moderate antifungal activity, and the other exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against a human lung carcinoma cell line [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Similarly, Anoumedem et al. [
 <xref rid="B5-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] revealed the structures of two new tetracyclic polyketides that were isolated from an endophytic fungus. This study further extends the range of compounds that are produced by the genus 
 <italic>Simplicillium.</italic> Fyhrquist et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], who also followed the bioactivity-guided fractionation approach, used water and solvents (methanol, butanol and chloroform) to extract several phenolic and polyphenolic compounds from three species of the 
 <italic>Combretum</italic> genus in a search for anti-mycobacterial activity. Active extracts were analyzed by ultrahigh-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/QTOF–MS) and GC–MS. The presence of ellagitannins, gallotannins, ellagic acid derivatives, stilbenoids (particularly dihydrostilbenoids), and many other phenolic compounds was revealed, providing more inputs for pharmaceutical library collections.
