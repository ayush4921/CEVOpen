 <italic>P. aureuginosa</italic> CP043328.1 was sensitive to meropenem, imipenem and gentamycin (Table

 <italic>P. aureuginosa</italic> CP043328.1. Moreover, these antibiotics can be used if there is an outbreak due to 
 <italic>P. aureuginosa</italic> CP043328.1. Ethyl acetate solvent was used for extraction of the secondary metabolites and the yield was 0.6 g/500 ml. Ethyl acetate is the good solvent for extraction of active metabolites from bacterial endophytes as it has medium polarity (dissolve both polar and non- polar active compounds) [
