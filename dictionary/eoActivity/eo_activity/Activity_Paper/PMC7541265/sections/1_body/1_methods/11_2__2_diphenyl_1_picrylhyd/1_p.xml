<p id="Par46">The DPPH free radical scavenging activity of the extract was investigated in a sterile 96-well plate. The DPPH (0.02 mg/mL) was mixed (1:1 v/v) with the extract at different concentrations. The mixtures were made to stand at room temperature (25 °C) for 30 min in darkness and the absorbance was read at 517 nm by using microplate reader. The extract without DPPH was used as the blank while ascorbic acid (AA) and butylated hydroxyl anisole (BHA) served as the positive controls. The percent inhibition of DPPH radical was measured by the using the formula: %DPPH scavenging activity = [Ao – A1 / Ao] × 100 where, A1 and Ao equal the absorbance at 517 nm of the control and the test, respectively. The median inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the extract against DPPH was calculated graphically [
