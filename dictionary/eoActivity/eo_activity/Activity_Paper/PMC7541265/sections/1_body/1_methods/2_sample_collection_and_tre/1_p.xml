<p id="Par32">Healthy fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Anredera cordifolia</italic> were collected on the 2nd of July 2019 from KwaDlangezwa area in the city of Umhlathuze, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa (28 °45 ′S31 °54 ′E). The voucher specimen for 
 <italic>A. cordifolia</italic> species, voucher number CIX1, was prepared and deposited in the University of Zululand Herbarium [ZULU], which is available mainly to researchers. The leaves were washed thoroughly under running tap water and air dried. The surfaces of the leaves were disinfected by dipping them in 75% ethanol for 5 min, followed by dipping in sodium hypochlorite (2% w/v NaOCl) for 4 min [

The excess water was dried under laminar airflow chamber. To confirm the disinfection process, aliquots of the sterile water used in the final rinse were plated onto nutrient agar (NA). The plates were then incubated at 28 °C for 5 days and observed for any microbial growth [
