<p id="Par42">The secondary metabolites from Isolate 1 were obtained by inoculating 200 μl of bacterial suspension into 500 ml of NB. The culture was incubated at 28 °C for 5 days on a rotating shaker at 130 rpm. The broth culture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and the pellet discarded. The supernatant was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate (500 ml) and then left overnight at 4 °C. The solvent phase containing the extracted secondary metabolites was separated using separating funnel. The extract was evaporated using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C with 90 rpm to yield the crude metabolites. The residue was re-dissolved in methanol. The concentrated crude extract was then stored at 4 °C for further studies [
