<p>In discovering antimalarials from plants, the extract is ideally expected to prevent reduction in PCV, body weight, and body temperature due to the development of parasitemia [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Though a significant prevention of body weight loss was exhibited by crude extract, the mean value of the body weight showed reduction in treatment groups on D
 <sub>4</sub> as compared to D
 <sub>0</sub>. This could be ascribed to the inability of the extract to completely eradicate the parasite load [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PCV was monitored to assess the ability of the plant in ablating malaria-induced hemolysis. The lowest dose exhibited the least protection against hemolysis compared to the other two upper doses. This could be perhaps because of the abundant phytoconstituents concentrated in the upper doses.
