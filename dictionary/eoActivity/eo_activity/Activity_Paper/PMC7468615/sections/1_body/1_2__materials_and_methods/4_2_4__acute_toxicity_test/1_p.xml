<p>To determine the safety of the plant extract, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development number 425 guideline [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] was used to evaluate the oral acute toxicity profile. In this test, after weighing a single overnight-fasted mouse, 2000 mg/kg of the crude extract was provided to the mouse using oral gavage at once. Then after, food was withheld for 2 hours but not water. The mouse was then observed continuously for the first 30 min and intermittently for 4 h, over a period of 24 h. As neither death nor any signs of acute toxicity were seen, similar dosage of the extract was provided to another four female mice. Then, the mice were followed for 2 weeks to see if changes that are signs of acute toxicity occur.
