<p>The weight and rectal temperature of each mouse were recorded just before treatment and after treatment on D
 <sub>4</sub>. The mean percentage changes were then calculated and analyzed for each group [

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the same way, packed cell volume (PCV) was measured before inoculation and after treatment. The blood was collected from the tail of each mouse in heparinized microhematocrit capillary tubes to determine PCV. The capillary tubes were filled to 3/4
 <sup>th</sup> of their height with blood and sealed with sealing clay at their dry end. The tubes were then placed on a microhematocrit centrifuge (Centurion Scientific, UK) with the sealed end facing the periphery and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 5 minutes [
