<p>The method described by Peter et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was utilized to carry out the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> schizontocidal activity of the extract against early chloroquine-sensitive 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection. On the first day (D
 <sub>0</sub>), an apparently healthy mouse in each group was coded and inoculated with 0.2 ml of blood containing about 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup>
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>berghei</italic>-infected RBCs. Then, three hours after infection (D
 <sub>0</sub>), each animal in each group was weighed and orally provided with the corresponding dosage of the extract and the controls using oral gavage for four consecutive days (D
 <sub>0</sub>-D
 <sub>3</sub>). At the beginning of D
 <sub>0</sub> and/or at the end of the 4
 <sup>th</sup> day (D
 <sub>4</sub>), the parameters detailed below were determined and the mice were monitored daily for 30 days to evaluate their survival time [
