<p>All the chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. The organic solvents such as methanol, hexane, and ethyl acetate were of spectral grade and were used as such without further purification. Anhydrous methanol was obtained by fractional distillation and stored over type 4A° molecular sieves. Some of the solvents were purchased from local manufacturers and some from S.D. Fine Chem. Ltd., Mumbai, India. All the chemicals used in the synthesis were obtained from standard commercial sources. TLC chromatography was carried out on Merck grade precoated TLC silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> plates (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and the spots were visualized under a UV lamp. 4′-trifluoromethylacetophenone and 4′-trifluoromethoxyacetophenone were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific-Alfa Aesar (Powai, Mumbai, India). Aldehydes were procured from Avra synthesis Pvt. Ltd. (Hyderabad, India). The melting points were determined in open capillaries, using a digital melting point apparatus (EZmelt, Stanford Research Systems) (expressed in °C) and are uncorrected. FT-IR spectra were scanned using Bruker OPUS 8.0 (BRUKER biospin International AG., Zug) and the 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of the compound were recorded on a Bruker 400 Avance NMR spectrophotometer using Tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard (values are expressed in 
 <italic>δ</italic> ppm). Mass spectra were recorded on SHIMADZU Lab Solution (ESI-MS) spectrometer at Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, Hyderabad, India (refer to the
