<p>The most potent compounds 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> out of the 20 compounds were tested in vitro for their cytotoxic activity on L02 (human normal liver cell line) by employing MTT assay according to Mosmann’s method as described in our previous paper [
 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceuticals-13-00375" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The MTT assay is based on the reduction of the soluble MTT (0.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, 100 µL) into a blue–purple formazan product, mainly by mitochondrial reductase activity inside living cells (Mosmann T et al., 1983). The cells used in cytotoxicity assay were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C and humidified at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Briefly, cells were placed on 96-well plates at 100 µL total volume with a density of 1–2.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per mL and were allowed to adhere for 24 h before treatment with tested drugs in DMSO solution (10
 <sup>−5</sup>, 10
 <sup>−6</sup>, 10
 <sup>−7</sup> mol L
 <sup>−1</sup> final concentration). Triplicate wells were treated with media and agents. Cell viability was assayed after 96 h of continuous drug exposure with a tetrazolium compound. The supernatant medium was removed, and 150 µL of DMSO solution was added to each well. The plates were gently agitated using mechanical plate mixer until the color reaction was uniform and OD570 was determined using micro plate reader. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was defined as the concentration that reduced the absorbance of the untreated wells by 50% of the vehicle in the MTT assay. Assays were performed in triplicate on three independent experiments. The results showed good reproducibility between replicate wells with standard errors below 10%.
