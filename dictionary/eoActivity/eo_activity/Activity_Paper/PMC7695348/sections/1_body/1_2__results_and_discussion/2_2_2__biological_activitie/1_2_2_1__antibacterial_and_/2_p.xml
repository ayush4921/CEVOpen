<p>The compounds exhibited varying degrees of activity (

 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00375-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), i.e., some compounds were more active than the standard drugs, whereas some were moderately active and others were less active. When the results between the two series of compounds were compared, a greater number of the compounds belonging to series-B comprising of the -OCF
 <sub>3</sub> group exhibited more activity than the series-A compounds bearing -CF
 <sub>3</sub>. However, against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, five compounds belonging to series-A showed superior activity than series-B compounds. Out of the six microbial strains used in our study, the Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> were more vulnerable to both the series of chalcones than the Gram-positive bacterial species and fungal isolates. With few exceptions, the activity against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal strains is either intermediate or less.
