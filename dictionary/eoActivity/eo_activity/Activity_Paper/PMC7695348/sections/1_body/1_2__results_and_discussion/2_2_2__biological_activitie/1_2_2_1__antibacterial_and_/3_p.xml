<p>Among all the compounds, 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> containing an unsubstituted heteroaromatic 3-indolyl moiety showed more activity than the standard drugs against the tested bacterial and fungal species. This illustrates that the presence of a bicyclic heteroaromatic scaffold is a major contributing factor for the activity of chalcones bearing -CF
 <sub>3</sub> and -OCF
 <sub>3</sub> groups. Against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> showed a zone of inhibition (ZOI) of 25 and 26 mm, respectively. The activity of 
 <bold>B3</bold> (ZOI = 29 mm) was more than benzyl penicillin (ZOI = 27 mm) against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> but the activity of 
 <bold>A3</bold> (ZOI = 26 mm) was less than the standard. 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> also exhibited more activity than benzyl penicillin against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ZOI = 20 and 22 mm) and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> with a ZOI of 23 and 21 mm, respectively. 
 <bold>A3</bold> and 
 <bold>B3</bold> showed a ZOI of 20 and 22 mm against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and a ZOI of 25 and 26 mm, respectively, against 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>. These ZOI values were more compared to the ZOI values obtained with standard fluconazole (19.05 and 24.41 mm).
