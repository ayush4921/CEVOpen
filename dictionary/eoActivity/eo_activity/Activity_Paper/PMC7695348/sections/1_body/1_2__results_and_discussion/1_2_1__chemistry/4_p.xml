<p>The FT-IR spectrum of 
 <bold>B3</bold> illustrated diagnostic intense carbonyl (C=O) and strong vinyl (CH=CH) absorption bands of chalcone linkage at wave numbers 1651 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1595 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Additionally, the other absorption bands are seen at 3681 (-NH in indole), 1206 (-OCF
 <sub>3</sub>), and 1248 (C-O-C). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum showed characteristic doublet signals at 7.53 ppm and 8.05 ppm with the coupling constant value (
 <italic>J</italic>) around 16 Hz. The larger coupling constant value represents the trans geometry of the chalcones. The other peaks seen are three singlets corresponding to the indole amine proton at chemical shift 8.78 and two multiplets around 7.38–8.02 and 7.05–7.66 corresponding to nine aromatic protons. The 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of compound 
 <bold>B3</bold> showed three peaks corresponding to the three carbons of the propenone moiety at 189.97, 125.33, and 137.37, respectively. The peaks of other carbon atoms are seen at the following chemical shift values: 130.23 (C-1′), 130.71 (C-2′ and 6′), 121.88 (C-3′ and 5′), 139.61 (C-4′), 121.88 (C-4,′), 112.08 (C-1″), 123.63 (C-2″), 137.35 (C-4″), 114.41 (C-5″), 120.47 (C-6″), 122.69 (C-7″), 117.81 (C-8″), 123.63 (C-9″). The mass spectrum of 
 <bold>B3</bold> recorded in positive mode showed [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> peak at m/z 332.20. In the 
 <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectrum, 
 <bold>A3</bold> showed signal at 63.27 ppm corresponding to -CF
 <sub>3.</sub> The 
 <sup>19</sup>F-NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>B3</bold> showed signal at 58.64 ppm corresponding to -OCF
 <sub>3.</sub> Based on the above spectral data, the compound 
 <bold>B3</bold> was confirmed as (
 <italic>E</italic>)-3-(1″H-indol-3″-yl)-1-[4′-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]prop-2-en-1-one (
