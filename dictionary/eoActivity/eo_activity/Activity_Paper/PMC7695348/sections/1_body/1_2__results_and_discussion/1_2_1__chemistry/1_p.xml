<p>The two series of chalcones were afforded by the Claisen–Schmidt condensation reaction of substituted aryl and unsubstituted heteroaryl aldehydes with two different types of ketones, i.e., 4′-trifluoromethyl acetophenone (series-A) and 4′-trifluoromethoxy acetophenone (series-B). The reaction time utilized for the formation of series-A chalcones was around 6–12 h, whereas for series-B chalcones, it was 12–15 h, and the yield of series-A chalcones was more than the latter. This may be due to the high electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl substituent over the trifluoromethoxy group. The compounds were in yellow to orange color which may be due to the extensive conjugation of chalcone core and the additional electronic effects of the substituents on the ring-A and B.</p>
