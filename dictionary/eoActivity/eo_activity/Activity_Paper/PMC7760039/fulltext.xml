Maize is a common crop produced in smallholder farming and it is cultivated from seeds that has been stored and re-used for years. Spoilage of stored grains is a major challenge, which leads to yield loss and poor seed quality. The objectives of this study were to evaluate in vivo antifungal activity of selected plant extracts against <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens on maize seeds, and to evaluate their phytotoxicity on seed germination and seedling growth. Fresh leaves collected from eight medicinal plants were dried and selectively extracted with water, ethyl acetate or acetone. The dried extracts were evaluated for antifungal activity against <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens (<italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, <italic>F. subglutinans</italic>, <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, <italic>F. semitectum</italic>, <italic>F. chlamydosporum</italic>, <italic>F. solani</italic>, <italic>F. equisite</italic> and <italic>F. graminearum</italic>) inoculated on maize seeds. <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> acetone extract showed strong antifungal activity (97% inhibition) against <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> while combined acetone extracts from <italic>Combretum erythrophyllum</italic> and <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic> exhibited 96%, 67% and 56% inhibition against <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and <italic>F. solani</italic>, respectively. With the exception of <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic> ethyl acetate, none of the extracts significantly inhibited seed germination when compared to untreated seeds.

Introduction</title><p>Maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) is the most important grain crop and dietary staple food in the world [<xref rid="B1-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It has the potential to alleviate poverty and plays a key role in food security and economic wellbeing particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In most developing countries, maize is consumed primarily as a porridge and sometimes as freshly boiled or roasted grains. It is also consumed in processed form, such as snacks and cereals. Naturally, it is a source of carbohydrate, fat, fiber, vitamins, macro- and micronutrient elements [<xref rid="B3-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In addition to its utilization as feed for livestock and poultry, maize is an excellent source of raw material for many industrial products, such as starch, oil, organic liquids and alcoholic beverages [<xref rid="B4-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Maize is cultivated in over 48 African countries, with more than 208 million people in sub-Saharan Africa depending on it as a source of food and income [<xref rid="B6-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In South Africa, both commercial and smallholder-farming systems are responsible for the production of maize, although this production is dominated by commercial farming. In addition to the availability of cultivated land, commercial farmers rely on irrigation systems, fertilization, pesticides, improved maize cultivars or hybrids and modern machineries to optimize production. In contrast, maize production in smallholder farming is labour-intensive and almost fully rain-fed. Smallholder farmers depend on indigenous knowledge and traditional rudimentary methods to control crop diseases both in the field and during storage.</p><p>The smallholder farming system is faced with challenges, including climate change, crop diseases, spoilage of grains during storage and poor seed germination [<xref rid="B7-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These challenges, among others, may result in drastic yield loss and an increase in food insecurity and food prices. Nevertheless, smallholder farming remains an important source of food and income generation, particularly in poor rural communities [<xref rid="B8-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Successful maize production in smallholder farming is dependent on locally sourced seeds. After harvest, the seeds are stored, exchanged or sold to other community members for consumption or for cultivation during the next planting season. This household-based seed system approach is self-sustainable [<xref rid="B12-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it is threatened by microbial infections that often occur during cultivation, transportation and post-harvest storage [<xref rid="B14-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Microbial infections can reduce yield, nutritional value of the seeds and negatively affect seed germination [<xref rid="B15-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p><italic>Fusarium</italic> species including <italic>F. verticillioides</italic>, <italic>F. subglutinans</italic> and <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> are among spoilage pathogens associated with yield loss in maize production [<xref rid="B16-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Another major concern is health complications associated with consumption of grains contaminated with mycotoxins produced by these species [<xref rid="B18-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Mycotoxins may cause fungal keratitis, kidney disorders, oesophageal and liver cancer [<xref rid="B20-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The use of conventional synthetic fungicides as a strategy to control fungi during storage may not be ideal in smallholder farming. These chemicals are largely inaccessible and unaffordable to smallholder farmers. Smallholder farming is practiced in resource-poor communities, where stored grains may be consumed during the storage period. Therefore, seeds or grains treated with synthetic fungicides may cause complications or food poisoning. There is a need to develop relatively cheap and sustainable strategies that can be used to control or reduce grain spoilage, particularly during storage in poor rural communities.</p><p>The use of botanicals as an alternative source of bio-pesticides in crop protection has gained momentum because plants are biodegradable and readily available [<xref rid="B25-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Medicinal plant species synthesize different secondary metabolites that perform important biological functions and defend plants against microbes and insects [<xref rid="B28-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Plants have been traditionally used for many years to treat different ailments in both human and domesticated animals, and they are considered to be relatively safe and environmental-friendly [<xref rid="B27-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B31-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Despite the importance of maize in smallholder farming systems and the need for alternative forms of crop protection to traditional pesticides, little research has been carried out on bio-pesticides. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo antifungal activity of extracts obtained from the leaves of eight selected medicinal plants against different maize seed <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens. Extract selection was based on previous in vitro study against the same pathogens [<xref rid="B33-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the in vivo antifungal activity of individual and combined plant extracts against <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens. Moreover, we conducted the phytotoxicity evaluation of the extracts on maize seed germination and plant growth. We found that, in spite of the polarity of the extraction solvents and the tested pathogens, individual extracts obtained from plant species, such as <italic>W. somnifera</italic>, <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic>, <italic>Q. acutissima</italic>, <italic>M. azedarach</italic> and <italic>C. molle</italic> showed remarkable in vivo antifungal activity with values ranging from 68% to 98% inhibition.</p><p>These plant species are widely distributed in many African countries and are readily available. As an example, <italic>M. azedarach</italic> and <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> are often planted as shade or ornamental trees in many human settlements [<xref rid="B35-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, utilization of such plants as bio-pesticides can be achieved at relatively no cost. Management of <italic>Fusarium</italic> species is an important agricultural practice to ensure minimum yield loss during post-harvest storage. Many <italic>Fusarium</italic> species are common causes of maize ear rot diseases and can lead into serious yield reduction in maize farming [<xref rid="B16-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B36-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B37-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. They have been frequently isolated in maize production areas both at the field and during post-harvest storage [<xref rid="B39-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. If not controlled, fungal pathogens including <italic>Fusarium</italic> species can cause about 50%&#x02013;80% damage on maize grains during storage [<xref rid="B39-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, several <italic>Fusarium</italic> species produce mycotoxins that contaminate grains and render them unsuitable for human consumption [<xref rid="B18-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B43-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The previous study had shown that combining extracts from different plant species improved antifungal potency in vitro through synergistic and additive interactions, as compared to their individual application [<xref rid="B34-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the current study, a combined application of <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract also showed improved antifungal activity against <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, which was 15 and 7 times stronger when compared to the individual application of <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> and <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic>, respectively. This combined extract also showed improved activity against <italic>F. solani</italic> and <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>. Nonetheless, a combined ethyl acetate extract from the same plant species (<italic>Q. acutissima</italic> and <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic>) demonstrated reduced activity against <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> whereas an improved activity was demonstrated against <italic>F. solani</italic>. The combined acetone extract of <italic>N. glauca</italic> and <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> exhibited an improved antifungal activity against <italic>F. chlamydosporum</italic>. An improvement in the antifungal activity of combined extracts may be due to an increased concentration of antifungal compounds at the inhibition sites on the pathogen. It may also be due to the formation of different chemical constituents with different modes of action. However, not all combined extracts demonstrated an improved activity.</p><p>The medicinal plant extracts investigated in the current study did not have a pronounced negative effect on maize seed germination. In smallholder farming, surplus maize seeds and other grains are used for planting and can be recycled for years or generations [<xref rid="B5-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B14-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential that plant-based products are not only effective in controlling post-harvest storage pathogens, but they must also not affect seed germination negatively. In a different study, effective botanical insecticide products such as NeemPro<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and NeemAzal<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Trifolio-M GmbH Company, Lahnau, Germany) were reported to have shown no negative effect on maize seed germination [<xref rid="B44-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, the current study revealed that a combination of <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract showed no toxicity on maize seedling growth. This combination had no significant effect on all seedling growth variables (plant height, number of leaves, chlorophyll content, dry shoot mass, stem diameter and dry root mass) when compared to the negative control. To some extent, this combined extract exhibited in vivo antifungal activity against <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> inoculated on maize seedlings, evident by lower disease percentage area on seedlings inoculated and treated with this combined extract.</p><p>Notably, solvent polarity plays an important role in the antifungal activity of medicinal plant extracts. For example, the leaf ethyl acetate extract of <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> was effective (&#x02265;50% inhibition) in inhibiting the growth of <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and <italic>F. solani</italic>. In contrast, acetone extract from <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> was not active against both <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and <italic>F. solani</italic>. Similarly, the leaf acetone extract of <italic>M. azedarach</italic> was very effective in inhibiting the growth of <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, while its ethyl acetate extract was ineffective against the same pathogen. The difference in the antifungal activity of acetone and ethyl acetate extracts from the same plant species was also observed with <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> against <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, <italic>F. subglutinans</italic>, <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> and <italic>F. solani</italic>. Acetone is slightly more polar than ethyl acetate [<xref rid="B46-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Slight variation in solvent parameter may determine the amount and type of antifungal compounds or metabolites extracted. Medicinal plants contain a wide variety of secondary metabolites including tannins, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenols, saponins and other chemical constituents [<xref rid="B47-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="B48-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The polarity of the constituent metabolites differs significantly and has influence on their solubility during extraction and thereafter the antifungal activity of the extracts.</p><p>Thus, similar to the individual extracts, the activity of the combined extracts also depends on the polarity of extraction solvents and is pathogen-specific. A combination from <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract showed improved antifungal activity against <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, <italic>F. solani</italic> and <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>. Nonetheless, a combined ethyl acetate extract from the same plant species (<italic>Q. acutissima</italic> and <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic>) demonstrated reduced activity against <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> and <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, whereas an improved activity was demonstrated against <italic>F. solani</italic>. Apart from polarities of extraction solvents, the difference in cellular structure and defence mechanisms of the pathogens may also influence antifungal efficacy of medicinal plant extracts. It was observed that acetone extract of <italic>M. azedarach</italic> was very effective in inhibiting the growth of <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, but ineffective against <italic>F. subglutinans</italic>, <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> and <italic>F. solani</italic>. A similar trend was also observed with individual application of ethyl acetate extracts from <italic>S. mauritianum</italic> and <italic>M. azedarach</italic> against both <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and <italic>F. proliferatum</italic>. <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic> showed large variation in its antifungal activity against different <italic>Fusarium</italic> species (<italic>F. proliferatum</italic>, <italic>F. verticilloides</italic>, <italic>F. chlamydosporum</italic>, <italic>F. solani</italic>, <italic>F. equisite</italic> and <italic>F. graminearum</italic>). Generally, the antifungal activity of the extract appears to depend on both the polarity of extracting solvents and the pathogens.</p><p>In vivo antifungal evaluation of individual plant extracts such as <italic>N. glauca</italic>, <italic>L. camara</italic> and <italic>S. mauritianum</italic> did not produce good activity as compared to the results reported in the in vitro study [<xref rid="B33-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In other words, these plant extracts showed in vitro antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of less than 0.1 mg/mL but were ineffective when evaluated in the in vivo study, even at 2.5 mg/mL concentration. This indicates the need to follow up any promising in vitro results with in vivo studies for validation.</p><p>The antifungal activity of plants demonstrated in the current study could be due to the presence of different chemical constituents in their leaves. As an example, mollic acid glucoside isolated from acetone leaf extract of <italic>C. molle</italic> was found to be a major terpenoid contributing to the antifungal activity of this plant [<xref rid="B50-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although water and ethyl acetate extracts were used in our study, this terpenoid and other chemicals, such as &#x003b1;-arabinoside and punicalagin, known to be present in <italic>C. molle</italic>, might have contributed to the activity demonstrated by this plant [<xref rid="B51-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. <italic>Combretum erythrophyllum</italic>, which also showed very good activity, is known to contain antimicrobial compounds such as apigenin, rhamnazin, genkwanin and 5-hydroxy-7,4&#x02032;- dimethoxyflavane [<xref rid="B52-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Hydroxyl-3-methoxcinnamaldehyde, vanillin, scopoletin and pinoresinol isolated from different parts of <italic>M. azedarach</italic> showed good activity against different pathogens including some <italic>Fusarium</italic> species [<xref rid="B53-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="B54-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The activity of <italic>W. somnifera</italic> water extract against <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> could be due to withaferin A and withanolide D present in the leaves of this shrub [<xref rid="B55-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="B56-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, efforts are underway to isolate and characterize some actual compounds responsible for the antifungal activity demonstrated by plant extracts in the present study. The extracts with activity greater than 50% inhibition showed potential to control stored maize seed <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens. This study demonstrated the ability of botanicals for disease control without any phytotoxicty. Nevertheless, further research is required to establish the phytochemical composition of the extracts, their toxicity against human and livestock, as well as their stability during seed storage, if this method is to be adopted by smallholder farmers.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-09-01668"><title>4.
