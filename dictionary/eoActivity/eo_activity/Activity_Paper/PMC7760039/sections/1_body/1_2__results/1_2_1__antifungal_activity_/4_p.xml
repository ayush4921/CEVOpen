<p>The combination of 
 <italic>Solanum mauritianum</italic> and 
 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> ethyl acetate extracts appeared to be antagonistic as the antifungal activity observed against 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> was much less when compared to the individual application of 
 <italic>S. mauritianum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The same plant extract combination exhibited a synergistic antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The antifungal activity exhibited by 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> was equivalent to what was recorded for the positive control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The combination of 
 <italic>Lantana camara</italic> and 
 <italic>Combretum molle</italic> ethyl acetate extract did not improve the antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. semitectum</italic> when compared to individual application of 
 <italic>C. molle</italic> ethyl acetate, which showed a very strong antifungal activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f006">Figure 6</xref>).
