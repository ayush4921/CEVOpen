<p>On the other hand, a combination of 
 <italic>Nicotiana glauca</italic> and 
 <italic>Quercus acutissima</italic> acetone extracts showed synergistic, very strong antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. chlamydosporum</italic>. This activity was significantly higher compared to that of the positive control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Similarly, the combination of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extracts exhibited an improved antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. equisite</italic> when compared to the antifungal activity of individual extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01668-f008">Figure 8</xref>). The antifungal activity of combined acetone extracts from 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> against 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> was 3.5 times weaker compared to the individual application of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> acetone extract against the same pathogen (
