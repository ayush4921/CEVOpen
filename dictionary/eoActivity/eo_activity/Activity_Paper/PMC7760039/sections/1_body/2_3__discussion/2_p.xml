<p>These plant species are widely distributed in many African countries and are readily available. As an example, 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> and 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> are often planted as shade or ornamental trees in many human settlements [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, utilization of such plants as bio-pesticides can be achieved at relatively no cost. Management of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species is an important agricultural practice to ensure minimum yield loss during post-harvest storage. Many 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species are common causes of maize ear rot diseases and can lead into serious yield reduction in maize farming [

 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species can cause about 50%â€“80% damage on maize grains during storage [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, several 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species produce mycotoxins that contaminate grains and render them unsuitable for human consumption [
