<p>The antifungal activity of plants demonstrated in the current study could be due to the presence of different chemical constituents in their leaves. As an example, mollic acid glucoside isolated from acetone leaf extract of 
 <italic>C. molle</italic> was found to be a major terpenoid contributing to the antifungal activity of this plant [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although water and ethyl acetate extracts were used in our study, this terpenoid and other chemicals, such as α-arabinoside and punicalagin, known to be present in 
 <italic>C. molle</italic>, might have contributed to the activity demonstrated by this plant [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. 
 <italic>Combretum erythrophyllum</italic>, which also showed very good activity, is known to contain antimicrobial compounds such as apigenin, rhamnazin, genkwanin and 5-hydroxy-7,4′- dimethoxyflavane [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Hydroxyl-3-methoxcinnamaldehyde, vanillin, scopoletin and pinoresinol isolated from different parts of 
 <italic>M. azedarach</italic> showed good activity against different pathogens including some 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> species [

 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The activity of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> water extract against 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> could be due to withaferin A and withanolide D present in the leaves of this shrub [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, efforts are underway to isolate and characterize some actual compounds responsible for the antifungal activity demonstrated by plant extracts in the present study. The extracts with activity greater than 50% inhibition showed potential to control stored maize seed 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> pathogens. This study demonstrated the ability of botanicals for disease control without any phytotoxicty. Nevertheless, further research is required to establish the phytochemical composition of the extracts, their toxicity against human and livestock, as well as their stability during seed storage, if this method is to be adopted by smallholder farmers.
