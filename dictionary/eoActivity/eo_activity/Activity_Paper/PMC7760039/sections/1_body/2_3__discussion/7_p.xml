<p>In vivo antifungal evaluation of individual plant extracts such as 
 <italic>N. glauca</italic>, 
 <italic>L. camara</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mauritianum</italic> did not produce good activity as compared to the results reported in the in vitro study [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In other words, these plant extracts showed in vitro antifungal activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of less than 0.1 mg/mL but were ineffective when evaluated in the in vivo study, even at 2.5 mg/mL concentration. This indicates the need to follow up any promising in vitro results with in vivo studies for validation.
