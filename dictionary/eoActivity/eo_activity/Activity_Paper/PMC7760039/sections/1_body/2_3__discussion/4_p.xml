<p>The medicinal plant extracts investigated in the current study did not have a pronounced negative effect on maize seed germination. In smallholder farming, surplus maize seeds and other grains are used for planting and can be recycled for years or generations [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential that plant-based products are not only effective in controlling post-harvest storage pathogens, but they must also not affect seed germination negatively. In a different study, effective botanical insecticide products such as NeemPro
 <sup>®</sup> and NeemAzal
 <sup>®</sup> (Trifolio-M GmbH Company, Lahnau, Germany) were reported to have shown no negative effect on maize seed germination [

 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01668" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, the current study revealed that a combination of 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract showed no toxicity on maize seedling growth. This combination had no significant effect on all seedling growth variables (plant height, number of leaves, chlorophyll content, dry shoot mass, stem diameter and dry root mass) when compared to the negative control. To some extent, this combined extract exhibited in vivo antifungal activity against 
 <italic>F. verticilloides</italic> inoculated on maize seedlings, evident by lower disease percentage area on seedlings inoculated and treated with this combined extract.
