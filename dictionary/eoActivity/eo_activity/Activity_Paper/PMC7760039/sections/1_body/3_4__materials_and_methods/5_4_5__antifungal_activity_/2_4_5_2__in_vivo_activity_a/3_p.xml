<p>Plant growth parameters (number of leaves, chlorophyll content, stem diameter and plant height) were recorded 20 days after planting and thereafter, were recorded every week. The number of leaves were counted and plant height was measured with tape from soil level to the terminal of the developing leaf. Chlorophyll content was measured from three mature leaves per plant using chlorophyll meter (Minolta, Spad-502, Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan) and stem diameter was measured with electronic digital vernier caliper (Calibre MILIM, Digital, Linberts).</p>
