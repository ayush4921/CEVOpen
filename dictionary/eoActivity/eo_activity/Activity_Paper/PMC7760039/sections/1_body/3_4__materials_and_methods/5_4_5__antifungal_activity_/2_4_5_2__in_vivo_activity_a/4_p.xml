<p>After 90 days of planting, the plants were harvested and placed in brown paper bags. A pathogenicity test was also conducted during harvesting period. The crop was cut above soil surface and visually examined for discolouration. Discolouration/disease severity was rated and recorded based on the following scale: 0 = no discolouration, 1 = trace to 25% diseased area, 2 = 25% to 50% diseased area, 3 = 50% to 80% diseased area and 4 = 100% diseased area [

At the end of the experiment, data recorded from 20 days after planting to harvesting period were averaged and analysed statistically.
