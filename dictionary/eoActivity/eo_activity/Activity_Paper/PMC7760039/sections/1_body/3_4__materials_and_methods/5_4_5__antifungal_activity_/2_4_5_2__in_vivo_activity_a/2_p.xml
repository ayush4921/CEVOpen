<p>The experiment was conducted at the Agricultural Research Council, Roodeplaat Campus, Pretoria, South Africa (latitude 17°49′ S, longitude 31°04′ E), during November/December 2019 and was kept under greenhouse conditions (27.5 ± 2.5 °C and 90.0 ± 5% relative humidity). Four days after planting, 200 mL of combined 
 <italic>C. erythrophyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. acutissima</italic> acetone extract was applied to each of the treatment pots and subsequently every seventh day, while water was added to negative control pots. Commercial fungicide (Efekto-Virikop
 <sup>®</sup>) at 2.5 mg/mL was also applied to positive control pots at the same interval as plant extract. All the pots were irrigated every second day.
