<p>Medicinal plant extracts that showed antifungal activity (≥50% inhibition) were evaluated for potential phytotoxicity on maize seed germination. The seeds were soaked overnight in a plant extract at a pre-determined concentration (2.5 mg/mL) and air-dried in a bio-safety cabinet for an hour. Water was used as a control treatment. Twenty seeds were placed per petri dish lined with a moistened double layer filter paper. Each treatment was replicated five times. The experiment was set up in an incubator at constant 25 °C and alternating cycle of 12 h light and 12 h darkness. The filter papers were kept wet throughout the experimental period. The number of germinated seeds was recorded 14 days after sowing. The experiment was repeated twice with five replicates per treatment. Percentage seed germination was calculated using the following equation:
