<p>After 21 days of treatment with THCs, the canker sore lesions were significantly reduced in all the patients. Before treatment, a majority of 26 patients had a single lesion with a size ranging between 1 and 4â€‰mm, while 5 had more than one lesion in the same size range. After 14 days of treatment, the number of subjects with multiple lesions decreased slightly from 5 (16%) to 4 (12.9%). Out of the 31 subjects enrolled, one subject dropped out after 14 days and the remaining 30 subjects completed the study. At the end of the study, all the 30 (100%) patients with both the single and multiple lesions were completely healed. Further, the photographic evaluation confirmed the clinical observations on the significant reduction of canker sore lesions (
