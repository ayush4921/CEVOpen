<p>Previous reports showed that many wound healing herbs are rich in phenolic and flavonoid contents which play important roles in wound healing activity [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These compound effects on the wound healing process might be due to antioxidant, anti-inflammation, antimicrobial, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation stimulation activity [

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, our results showed that CCLE contains phenolic and flavonoid compounds. Previous studies also indicated that phenolic and flavonoid compounds are present in 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> leaves [

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Adedayo et al. (2015) found that HCl-methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> leaves contains many compounds belong to phenolic and flavonoid class, including gallic acid, catechin, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ellagic acid, rutin, and quercetin [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Among these compounds, gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, and rutin have been demonstrated to have wound healing activity [

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. These compounds might be relative to wound healing activity of 
 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> leaves.
