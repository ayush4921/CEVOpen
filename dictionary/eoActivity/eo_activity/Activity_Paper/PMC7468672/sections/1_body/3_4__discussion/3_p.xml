<p>In addition, CCLE treatment increased the fibroblast density at wound sites. TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 mRNA also was found to increase in granulation tissue of the CCLE-treated group. TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 is involved in many important effects on the wound healing process [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The activities of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 include fibroblast proliferation induction [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], motivating fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblast [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and enhancement of collagen synthesis, deposition, and maturation [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Some wound healing agents have been reported to induce TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 expression along with fibroblast proliferation in an animal model [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The increase of the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 gene may explain the increase of fibroblasts and the wound healing effect of CCLE.
