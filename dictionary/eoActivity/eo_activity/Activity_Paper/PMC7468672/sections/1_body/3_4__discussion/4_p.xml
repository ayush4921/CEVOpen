<p>Our data indicated that CCLE treatment increased neovascularization in the wounds 7 days after surgery. Moreover, CCLE treatment also increased the VEGF mRNA expression at wound sites. An increase in angiogenesis supports the wound healing process, and delayed or inhibition in angiogenesis impairs wound healing [

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. VEGF is a principal mediator of wound angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It has functions not only to promote angiogenesis at several stages during the healing process but also to maintain vessel integrity. VEGF also stimulates the endothelial cell proliferation and increases vascular permeability [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The angiogenesis stimulation has been reported in several wound healing remedies and plants; some of them have been reported to induce the expression of VEGF [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Since VEGF plays an important role in stimulation of angiogenesis [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], these results may suggest an explanation for angiogenesis stimulation activity of CCLE during the wound healing process.
