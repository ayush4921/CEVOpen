<p>In the wound healing process, the inflammatory phase happens immediately after injury and reduces gradually; the proliferation phase starts at late of the inflammatory phase, together with an increase of fibroblasts [

In our study, histopathological analysis of the 7-day-old wounds in the CCLE-treated groups showed a decrease in the inflammatory cell density, along with an increase in the fibroblast density and the blood vessel number, compared to that of the control group. Besides, better reepithelialization was also observed in the CCLE-treated wounds (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(f)</xref> indicated that CCLE-treated wounds had less inflammatory cells and more fibroblasts and blood vessels than the nontreatment wounds (
