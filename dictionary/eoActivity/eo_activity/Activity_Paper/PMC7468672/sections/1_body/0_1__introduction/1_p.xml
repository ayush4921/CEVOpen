<p>Wound healing is a complex process that often is divided into 3 overlap phases: inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The inflammatory phase starts immediately after injury, together with hemostasis. In this phase, leukocytes are recruited to the wound site to remove alien substances and dead tissue and prevent infection [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Fibroblasts and keratinocyte proliferation and migration play a key role in the proliferation phase. Fibroblasts are predominant cells at the wound site in this phase, responsible for new matrix and collagen production [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The remodeling phase occurs in several months to years, involving change in components of the extracellular matrix at the wound site and restoration of about 80% of tensile strength normal skin [
