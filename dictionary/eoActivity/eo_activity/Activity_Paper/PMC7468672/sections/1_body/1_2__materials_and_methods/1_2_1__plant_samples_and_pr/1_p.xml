 <italic>C. crepidioides</italic> (voucher specimen number PHH0004878) were collected from Bidoup Nui Ba National Park, Lam Dong, Vietnam. The sample was washed by clean water and dried in an oven at 40°C. The dried sample was homogenized to fine powder for further extraction. The dried powder was soaked in ethanol 70% for 48 h (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The solvent is preferred for preparing the extract for bioactivity evaluation purposes because of its low toxicity to cells and animals. The liquid phase then was filtered and dried by a rotary vacuum evaporator until constant weight to obtaine CCLE. The extract was kept at -20°C for later experiments.
