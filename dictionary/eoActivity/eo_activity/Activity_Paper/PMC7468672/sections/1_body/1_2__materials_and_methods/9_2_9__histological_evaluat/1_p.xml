<p>After 7 days, the granulation tissues from the 7-day wounds were taken and fixed in formalin solution (10% formalin in phosphate-buffered saline) overnight. The tissue then was dehydrated, cleared, embedded in paraffin by a tissue processing machine, and stained with haematoxylin-eosin (HE). The staining images were taken by a light microscope (BX53, Olympus). Images were analyzed for inflammatory cells, fibroblasts, and blood vessel density using the software ImageJ 1.50b.</p>
