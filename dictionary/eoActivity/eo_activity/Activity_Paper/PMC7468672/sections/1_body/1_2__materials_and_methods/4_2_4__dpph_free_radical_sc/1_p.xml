<p>Antioxidant activity of CCLE was investigated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical-scavenging capacity. DPPH 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M solution and CCLE were prepared in ethanol 70%; 2 mL of DPPH solution was mixed with 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L samples at a concentration of 200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in a glass tube. The mixture was vortexed and then incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at room temperature. The mixture of 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L ethanol 70% with 2 mL DPPH 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M was used as blank. Absorbance at wavelength 517 nm was measured by spectrophotometer UV-Vis V730. Gallic acid solutions at a concentration of 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL were used as the positive control. The scavenging capacity of CCLE is calculated by the following formula:
