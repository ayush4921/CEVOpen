<p>Toxicity of CCLE on cell RAW 264.7 viability was estimated by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-
 <italic>y</italic>l)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Briefly, cells were seeded with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin (Sigma) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS in 96-well plates at a density of 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. After 24 hours, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium supplemented with LPS 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL; CCLE was dissolved in DMSO 10% in the range of 2 times dilution concentration (from 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL to 15.625 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and added to the medium (final concentration of DMSO was 0.1%). After 48 hours of incubation, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L MTT was added to each well, followed by incubation for 3 hours; then, the supernatant was removed and formazan was dissolved with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L isopropanol-HCl; the measured optical density at wavelength is 550 nm. Cell viability was calculated by the following formula:
