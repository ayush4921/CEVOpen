<p>Total phenolic content (TPC) in CCLE was evaluated using a Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay described by Do et al., with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The sample was dissolved in 70% ethanol solution; 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the sample was added to 800 
 <italic>μ</italic>L Folin-Ciocalteu solution (10-fold diluted) in a glass tube, then added 800 
 <italic>μ</italic>L Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (7.5%) and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>L distilled water, mixed thoroughly, and left standing for 30 minutes at room temperature in dark condition. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 760 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer V-7200 model (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). TPC was expressed as milligram gallic acid equivalent per gram of CCLE (mg GAE/gE).
