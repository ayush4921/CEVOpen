<p>Cinnamon powder is one of the most famous spices made from the inner bark of cinnamon trees. The most common species are 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> (Chinese cinnamon) and 
 <italic>C. verum</italic> (true cinnamon). These two species contain 85.3 and 90.5 percent of the cinnamaldehyde (CA) [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. CA is a major bioactive of bark extract of cinnamon that is responsible for the odor and flavor of cinnamon [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This component was isolated from cinnamon for the first time by Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Eugène-Melchior Péligot in 1834 and then synthesized in the laboratory by the Italian chemist, Luigi Chiozza in 1854 [

 <italic>trans</italic>-cinnamaldehyde (TCA), 2′-hydroxycinnamaldehyde (HCA), 2-methoxycinnamaldehyde (MCA), and 2-hydroxycinnamic (o-Coumaric acid) (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. CA derivatives are structurally identified by the presence of cinnamoyl moiety [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In their structures, the presence of highly reactive 
 <italic>α</italic>,
 <italic>α</italic>-unsaturated carbonyl pharmacophore (Michael acceptor) can react with some enzymes and/or receptors as electrophiles and subsequently generate different therapeutically relevant pharmacological functions [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Natural CA and its derivatives have been extensively investigated and comprehensively reviewed with a wide range of effects, such as anticancer, antidiabetic, antifungal, and antibacterial [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Besides, natural CA and its derivates have been used for neurological purposes because they have anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidative stress, and antiapoptotic properties (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For example, CA exhibits a protective influence against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. CA considerably attenuated cell survival, inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), alleviated mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced the production of cytochrome c, and decreased the activities of caspase-3 [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. CA also significantly enhanced Bcl-2 (as an antiapoptotic marker) while reducing Bax (as a proapoptotic marker) expression [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, TCA as a main natural CA derivative significantly decreased LPS-induced neuronal death through the inhibition of neuroinflammation by blocking the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B) signaling pathway in vitro condition [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the same way, HCA is another CA derivative that can inhibit neuroinflammatory signaling pathways such as NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-38 MAPK) by targeting low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, natural CA and its derivatives may be used as a therapeutic agent against neuroinflammation for improving neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms of natural CA and its derivatives on neuroinflammation should be studied more than that it has. To this end, the aim of this study was to review the current status of the neuroprotective and antineuroinflammatory properties of natural CA and its derivatives and discuss their potentials as therapeutic agents in neurodegenerative diseases.
