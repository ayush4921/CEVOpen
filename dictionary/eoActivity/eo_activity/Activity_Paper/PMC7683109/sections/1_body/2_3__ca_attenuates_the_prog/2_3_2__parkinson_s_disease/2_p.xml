<p>Studies have been demonstrated that cinnamon has anti-inflammatory effects as well as some neuroprotective properties [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Treatment with cinnamon prevented the development of PD-like symptoms and pathology in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP-) treated mice [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The major compound in cinnamon is CA, which is metabolized into sodium benzoate (NaB) in the liver. NaB can cross the blood–brain barrier and increase the production of neurotrophic factors in the brain. It has been reported that NaB metabolized from cinnamon can inhibit the loss of Parkin and DJ-1 (protein deglycase), regulate neurotransmitter levels, and improve motor functions in mice with PD [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Parkin and DJ-1 are necessary proteins for supporting the survival of dopaminergic neurons while significantly decrease in the brain of PD patients [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Consequently, sodium benzoate (NaB) metabolized from cinnamon modifies the pathology of PD through the production of neurotrophic factors and inhibition of neuroinflammation [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. NaB produces brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 
 <italic>via</italic> the activation of protein kinase A and cAMP response element-binding pathway [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. On the other hand, NaB suppresses the activation of p21
 <sup>ras</sup>, a small G protein, and consequently decreases the activation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B. Following the inhibition of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B activation, iNOS expression and NO production are reduced, which ultimately inhibits the neuroinflammation in PD [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Furthermore, the inhibition of LPS-induced production of NO and expression of iNOS, COX-2, and IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> is the molecular mechanism behind TCA-mediated neuroprotective effects [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. CA also exerted antioxidant activity by decreasing ROS production in 6-hydroxydopamine-induced cytotoxicity (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Recently, it has been shown that CA could block dysregulated autophagy in MPTP as a PD model [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In general, it seems that CA has a neuroprotective effect in PD models and might be a promising therapeutic target for PD.
