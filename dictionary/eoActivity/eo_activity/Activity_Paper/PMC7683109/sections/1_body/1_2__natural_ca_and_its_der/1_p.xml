<p>Neuroinflammation is an intrinsic brain response that involves neurons and glial cells within the central nervous system. The neuroinflammation signaling pathways are the subject of extensive experimental and clinical studies [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway is a main proinflammatory cytokine mediator that is activated by toll-like receptors (TLRs) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The TLRs are the most prominent family of pattern recognition receptors that are a part of the innate immune response [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Stimulation of TLRs by insult factors leads to severe inflammatory responses by releasing proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1
 <italic>β</italic> (IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. TLR4 is a membrane receptor of TLRs which have two adaptor proteins including myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88-) dependent pathway and MyD88-independent pathway (TRIF-dependent pathway) [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Activation of TLR4 recruits MyD88 and activates NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B that consequently expresses proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Considerable data have shown that the TLR4/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, attenuating the TLR4/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway can be considered as a therapeutic strategy for treating brain diseases [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. With this in mind, it has been revealed that CA inhibited TLR4/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling and NLRP3 (caspase-1-containing multiprotein complex) inflammasome and subsequently controlled the release of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and IL-18 during the inflammatory processes [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Furthermore, CA suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation via inhibiting the cathepsin B and P2X7R ((P2 receptors) protein expression [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In this case, TCA improves depressive-like behaviors in a chronic mild stress model by inhibiting the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Also, CA not only inhibits TLR4/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling but also attenuates the increased levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2), and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) in a cerebral ischemic model that ultimately decreased leukocyte infiltration into the ischemic brain areas (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. CA also suppressed cytokine secretion from lipopolysaccharide (LPS-) activated macrophages [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, CA inhibited apoptosis and ROS generation by inhibiting NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B activity in the DRG neurons treated by high glucose as an in vitro neuropathy model [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
