<p>In this work, we have systematically assessed the ability of ML to distinguish between promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds from biological screening assays explicitly taking test frequencies and positive, as well as negative assay readouts, into account. Diagnostic ML models based upon chemical structure were consistently able to distinguish between MT- and corresponding ST-CPDs, providing evidence for the presence of differentiating structural features, and a strong positive influence of NN relationships on prediction accuracy was detected. MT-CPDs were often more similar to each other than to corresponding ST-CPDs, and the same applied to ST-CPDs, albeit to a lesser extent. These relationships supported the predictions. The results reported herein were encouraging from two points of view. First, predictive performance and equivalent trends were consistently observed under different calculation conditions and for compounds from biochemical assays and more heterogeneous mixed assays. Second, the observed trends essentially paralleled earlier findings from complementary studies on compounds from medicinal chemistry sources. Thus, taken together, these investigations assign a high level of confidence to the conceptual framework of promiscuity analysis reported herein. Our predictions demonstrated that MT-CPDs from screening sources, which were not further optimized for known activities, could generally be predicted with reasonable to high accuracy, hence providing a basis for practical applications in chemical biology and drug discovery.</p>
