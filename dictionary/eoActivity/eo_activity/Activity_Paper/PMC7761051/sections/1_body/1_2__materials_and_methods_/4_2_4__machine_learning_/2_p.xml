<p>RF is a supervised ML algorithm generating an ensemble of independently derived decision trees using bootstrapping for random training data selection. The majority vote of all decision trees determines the predicted class label for test compounds. The scikit-learn RF implementation was used with default hyper-parameter settings (version 0.23.2), except for the number of decision trees (“n_estimators”: 10, 100, 250, 500) and the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (“min_samples_split”: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10), which were optimized during training.</p>
