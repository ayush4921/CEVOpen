<p>Close structural relationships between screening compounds were detected by applying a molecular fragmentation-based algorithm for the systematic extraction of analog series from compound datasets [
 <xref rid="B43-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Using this approach, the proportion of compounds forming analog relationships with one or more others was determined as a measure of structural diversity.
