<p>Given the dual role of multi-target activity for polypharmacology-driven drug discovery, on the one hand, and chemical biology, on the other, one would like to better understand molecular characteristics that distinguish non-promiscuous and promiscuous compounds. However, rationalizing multi-target activity at the molecular level of detail is still in its early stages. While molecular property analysis has indicated that high hydrophobicity or the presence of positively-charged groups are often implicated in undesired target engagement and ensuing side effects [

 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] our current knowledge of structural characteristics that might be responsible for well-defined multi-target activity is limited. Insights into the molecular origins of promiscuity would also aid in the design of small molecules with pre-defined multi-target activities [

Designing such ligands is not only of high interest for polypharmacology, but also relevant for the concomitant use of chemical probes with defined dual-target activity and corresponding single-target activity, which enables the detection of synergistic functional effects. Dual-target ligand design frequently attempts combining pharmacophore elements from separate sets of compounds with known activity against two targets [
