<p>Promiscuity analysis substantially benefits from computational support. For example, ligand-based computational approaches have been used to predict new targets of known active compounds [

 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-10-01605" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These approaches infer compound-target relationships from a calculated similarity of known ligands. The identification of new targets for pharmaceutically relevant compounds originally thought to be specific renders these compounds potential candidates for polypharmacology and often also explains undesired side effects observed for clinical compounds. Computational target identification methods are also applied for repurposing existing therapeutic agents [
