<p>For compounds from the medicinal chemistry and patent literature, experimental test frequencies are generally unknown. For promiscuity analysis, this causes a potential bias in cases where assay frequencies of related compounds significantly differ. For example, if a given compound was tested only against a few targets but a structural analog against many different ones, the latter compound would more likely to display multi-target activity than the former for statistical reasons. Hence, the availability of test frequency information lends further credence to compound promiscuity assessment and predictions. This information can be obtained for compounds from biological screening campaigns, which has been a major motivation for our current investigation. Herein, we present newly designed high-confidence compound sets for promiscuity analysis extracted from biological screening data and report diagnostic ML studies under varying conditions to distinguish between multi-target and corresponding single-target compounds.</p>
