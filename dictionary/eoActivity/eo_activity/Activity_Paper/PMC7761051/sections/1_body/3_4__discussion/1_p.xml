<p>If test frequencies of compounds are unknown, which is typically the case for compounds reported in the medicinal chemistry literature, promiscuity analysis generally includes a factor of uncertainty, due to data sparseness. Accordingly, PD values might be under-estimated and calculated differences in promiscuity remain uncertain. As long as the ultimate goal of chemogenomics efforts is not reached (i.e., testing “all” compounds against “all” targets), data incompleteness will continue to play a critical role in the assessment of target specificity vs. multi-target activity, which is of equal relevance for chemical biology and drug discovery. By focusing promiscuity analysis on large volumes of screening data, the data incompleteness issue can be addressed by taking test frequencies and negative assay results directly into account, as demonstrated herein. Compared to exploring multi-target activities in the very large space of currently more than 10,000 targets for which medicinal chemistry has identified active compounds, focusing the analysis on screening data also comes at a price. Target space defined by screening campaigns is typically smaller and, in addition, there are uncertainties associated with activity measurements, due to screening assay noise. Hence, from this point of view, promiscuity analysis of compounds from medicinal chemistry and screening sources are complementary in nature. </p>
