<p>To examine the potential influence of the PD threshold for defining MT-CPDs, the analysis was then repeated for datasets resulting from PD ≥ 3. The same trends were observed but prediction accuracy was slightly lower than for the PD ≥ 5 datasets, consistent with the assumption that increasingly promiscuous MT-CPDs should be easier to distinguish from ST-CPDs. Results obtained for the PD ≥ 3 datasets are provided as
