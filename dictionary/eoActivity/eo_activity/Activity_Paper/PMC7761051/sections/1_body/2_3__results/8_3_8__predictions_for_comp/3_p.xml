<p>In light of the findings discussed above, we further extended diagnostic ML analysis to compounds from mixed assays applying the PD â‰¥ 5 threshold. These assays included different formats such as biochemical and cell-based assays, which increased assay heterogeneity and, thus, decreased the confidence level of target annotations compared to biochemical assays. On the other hand, dataset size and target coverage by mixed assays further increased compared to the biochemical assay subset. </p>
