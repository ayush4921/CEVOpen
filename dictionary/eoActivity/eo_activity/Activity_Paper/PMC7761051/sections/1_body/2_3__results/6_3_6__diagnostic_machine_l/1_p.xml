<p>Diagnostic ML models were built on the basis of chemical structure to systematically distinguish between MT- and ST-CPDs under different conditions, as detailed above. The principal idea behind diagnostic ML was to determine prediction accuracy as an indicator of the presence of structural features that systematically differentiate between promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds. If such features or patterns do not exist, ML models based upon chemical structure could not possibly be predictive. Thus, diagnostic ML did not aim to optimize model performance but associate observed prediction accuracy with varying calculation conditions to determine the presence or absence of features that might differentiate between promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds. Given our system setup, removal of NNs from datasets systematically reduced close structural relationships and therefore served as an important control.</p>
