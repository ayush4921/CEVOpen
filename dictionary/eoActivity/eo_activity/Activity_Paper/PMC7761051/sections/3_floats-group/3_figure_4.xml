 <caption>
  <p>Target networks for multi-target compounds. In (
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>b</bold>), networks are shown for MT-CPDs from biochemical and mixed assays, respectively. Each node represents an individual target that is scaled in size according to the number of its MT-CPDs. Nodes are connected by edges if the corresponding targets share at least 50 MT-CPDs. Since a target may have multiple functional annotations, all panels display the same target network colored according to the absence (gray) or presence of a given protein function (orange, DNA binding; blue, ester hydrolase; red, peptidase; green, phosphorous group transferase; yellow, transcription regulator; pink, unclassified).
