 <p>Predicting compounds with single- and multi-target activity and exploring origins of compound specificity and promiscuity is of high interest for chemical biology and drug discovery. We present a large-scale analysis of compound promiscuity including two major components. First, high-confidence datasets of compounds with multi- and corresponding single-target activity were extracted from biological screening data. Positive and negative assay results were taken into account and data completeness was ensured. Second, these datasets were investigated using diagnostic machine learning to systematically distinguish between compounds with multi- and single-target activity. Models built on the basis of chemical structure consistently produced meaningful predictions. These findings provided evidence for the presence of structural features differentiating promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds. Machine learning under varying conditions using modified datasets revealed a strong influence of nearest neighbor relationship on the predictions. Many multi-target compounds were found to be more similar to other multi-target compounds than single-target compounds and vice versa, which resulted in consistently accurate predictions. The results of our study confirm the presence of structural relationships that differentiate promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds.</p>
