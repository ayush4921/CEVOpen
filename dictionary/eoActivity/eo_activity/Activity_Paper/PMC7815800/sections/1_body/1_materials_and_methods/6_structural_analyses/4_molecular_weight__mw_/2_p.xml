<p id="p0070">High-performance size-exclusion chromatography was used for determining molecular weight (M
 <sub>w</sub>) of P3a and SP3a provided with a refractive index detector (RID) and Shodex SB-804 HQ column (300 × 8.0 mm, Showa Denko Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The temperature of the column was maintained at 45 °C. The mobile phase is ultra-pure water, the injection volume is 10 μL, and the constant flow rate is 0.9 mL/min. By plotting the logarithm of the molecular weight against the retention value (RT) of the standard, a standard curve was established using dextran of different molecular weights, and the molecular weight was estimated based on this.
