<p id="p0030">Hot water extraction (HWE) and alcohol precipitation is the most popular and convenient method and has been widely used in laboratories and industry (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2014</xref>). It has the advantages of simple operation, low equipment requirements and cost-effective. The plasma wall of the cell is separated with hot water, and the contents of vacuole are dissolved by diffusion into an external solvent. It dissolves the non-digestible fiber, which can be removed from the extract when water is removed. The 
 <italic>Pleurotus eous</italic> (100 g) was ground into a powder and soaked in 90% petroleum ether overnight to remove the lipid substances. Filter and extract three times with hot water (1:25 (w/v), 100 °C, 3 h). The liquid part was reduced to one-tenth of the actual volume using a rotary evaporator and to the resultant liquid, ethyl alcohol (five times) was added, vigorously stirred and stored at 4 °C. Centrifuge at 8000 rpm (20 min), collect the precipitate, re-dissolve in deionized water, then use Sevags reagent (chloroform: 
 <italic>n</italic>-butyl alcohol = 4:1, v/v) for deproteinization treatment (

 <italic>Pleurotus eous</italic> crude polysaccharide (PECP). The whole process was performed in three different time intervals to check the consistency and observed almost the same.
