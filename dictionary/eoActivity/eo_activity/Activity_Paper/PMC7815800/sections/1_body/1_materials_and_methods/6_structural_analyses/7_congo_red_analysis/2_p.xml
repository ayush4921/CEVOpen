<p id="p0085">The triple-helix properties of polysaccharides are found by the Congo red method (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rout et al., 2008</xref>) by the redshift of the Congo red–polysaccharide complex. By observing the maximum absorption wavelength (λ
 <sub>max</sub>) of Congo-red polysaccharides at various concentration of sodium hydroxide, a transition from a triple-helix structure to a single-stranded conformation was observed. The sample (6 mg/2 mL) dissolved in distilled water was reacted with Congo red (2.0 mL, 100 μM) in a gradient of sodium hydroxide solution (0.1–0.5 M). At each sodium hydroxide concentration, the absorbance was measured. Distilled water served as the control.
