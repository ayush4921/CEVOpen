<p id="p0185">In the determination of reducing power, antioxidants will cause Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to be reduced to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, which will change the solution from green to blue according to the reducing power of the sample, which may be an indicator of its possible antioxidant behaviour (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira et al., 2007</xref>). This method is commonly utilized to estimate the ability of antioxidants to contribute electrons. Reducing power is an important indicator of antioxidant activity. 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>C portrays the reducing power of P3a, SP3a and Vc. The reducing capacity increases with the increasing concentration, displaying a dose-effective relationship. The absorbance of P3a at 5 mg/mL is 0.991, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> is 2.43 mg/mL, and at the same concentration, the absorbance of SP3a is 1.091 and the EC
 <sub>50</sub> is 1.87 mg/mL. The reducing power of SP3a is significantly greater than that of P3a (p &lt; 0.05), but the absorbance of natural and modified derivatives is lower than Vc (1.213, 1.0 mg/mL). The results of reducing ability of P3a and SP3a indicate that sulfonic acid groups associated with the reducing ketones of polysaccharides can function as electron contributors and respond to free radicals and change them into further steady compounds. The reducing properties are typically related to the existence of reducing ketones, which have been presented to exert antioxidant effects by donating hydrogen atoms to destroy free radical chains (

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017b</xref>). Compared to TLH-3, the reducing power of sulfated 
 <italic>T. lobayense</italic> polysaccharide (STLH-3) has been improved, which supports our research that the sulfated polysaccharide has higher reducing power than the natural polysaccharides (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The absorbance of sulphated mycelial polysaccharide of 
 <italic>Catathelasma ventricosum</italic> (sm CVP-1S
 <sub>10</sub>) is only 0.75, which is lower than SP3a (0.825) in this study. Besides, SP3a showed a reducing ability of 0.325 at 1 mg/mL, which was lower than the reducing ability of sulphated 
 <italic>Artemisia sphaerocephala</italic> polysaccharide (SASP-5) (0.114 at 1 mg/mL). By comparing other sulfated polysaccharides, SP3a has substantial advantages in terms of reducing capacity.
