<p id="p0190">In the determination of three antioxidants, SP3a showed significant antioxidant activity, and the results revealed that the action of sulfated derivatives was enhanced due to sulfate group (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>), which indicates that the sulfate group is the importance of the antioxidant activity. Also, the content uronic acid is considered to be an important indicator reflecting the antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides. Generally, polysaccharides have free radical scavenging activity due to their ability to donate electrons or hydrogen. The uronic acid groups present in polysaccharides can interact with hydrogen atoms on the anomeric carbon atoms. Therefore, the higher the uronic acid, the stronger the antioxidant activity. The lower the molecular weight, the higher the antioxidant activity of polysaccharides. In this study, the SP3a has the highest uronic acid content and the lowest Mw, which is consistent with previous reports (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). It can be inferred that the antioxidant activity of polysaccharides is influenced by a combination of multiple factors, such as uronic acid content, sulfate content, molecular weight, monosaccharide composition, structure or conformation. Therefore, the sulfation modification of polysaccharides may be an effective method to obtain new antioxidants.
