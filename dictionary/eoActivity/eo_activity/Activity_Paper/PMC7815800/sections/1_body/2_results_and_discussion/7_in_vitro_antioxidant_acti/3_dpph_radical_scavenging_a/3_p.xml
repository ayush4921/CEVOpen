<p id="p0175">The ability of P3a and SP3a to scavenge DPPH free radicals is represented in 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>A. As the concentration of the sample increases, the removal effect increases. At 1–5 mg/mL, the scavenging capacity of P3a and SP3a on DPPH free radicals increased from 6.14 to 61.60% and 30.66–78.58%, respectively, and SP3a was the most effective. The EC50 of P3a and SP3a were 4.16 and 2.81 mg/mL, respectively, but lower than Vc (0.03 mg/mL). At each concentration, the clearance activity between P3a and SP3a varies significantly. The highest scavenging activity of SP3a (1 mg/mL) was 30.66%, which was five folds higher than P3a (6.14% of 1 mg/mL). In this study, SP3a showed 30.66% DPPH clearance activity, while sulfated

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) which is consistent with this study and proves the significance of the sulfate group in antioxidant capacity. DPPH free radicals are converted into stable DPPH-H molecules through hydrogen donation by antioxidants (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2008</xref>). Higher the sulfate group substitution, the stronger will be the scavenging ability. The SO3H group promotes the capture of electrons by DPPH, thereby enhancing the antioxidant capacity of polysaccharides. Compared with P3a, SP3a has a strong proton donor ability by activating the anomeric carbon atoms and can be used as a free radical inhibitor or scavenger. The reason for higher DPPH scavenging activity of SP3a compared to P3a may be the difference in the mass percentage of monosaccharides and their side-chain bonds. Secondly, polysaccharides with lower M
 <sub>w</sub> may have better water solubility, which can make contact between active sites and free radicals easier (
