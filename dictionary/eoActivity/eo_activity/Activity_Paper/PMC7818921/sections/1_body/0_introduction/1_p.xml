<p id="Par26">Triazole is an N-bridged aromatic heterocyclic compound that received a considerable attention in recent years due to their biological activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The name “triazole” was first use by Bladin in 1855 for describing the carbon–nitrogen ring system C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>3</sub>N
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is a white to pale yellow crystalline solid with a weak, characteristic odour, soluble in water and alcohol, melts at 120 °C and boils at 260 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Triazole exists in two isomeric forms such as 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,3-triazole [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The SAR studies of triazole derivative reveals that substitution on positions 3, 4 and 5 of triazole ring can be varied but the greatest changed in physicochemical properties and biological profile is exerted by the groups attached to the nitrogen atom at the 4th position [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It favours the hydrogen bonding and is also stable for metabolic degradation, which could be favorable in increasing solubility as well as in binding bimolecular targets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Novel triazole drugs discovered and developed by applying bioisosteric replacement technique with extending biological activities also captured a special attention in medicinal chemistry [
