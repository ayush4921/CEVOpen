 <bold>T</bold>

 </sub>) were evaluated for their free radical scavenging activity with ascorbic acid as standard compound. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated for each compound as well as ascorbic acid as standard and summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> and shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The scavenging effect increased with the increasing concentrations of sample compounds. DPPH is relatively stable nitrogen centered free radical that easily accepts an electron or hydrogen radical to become a stable diamagnetic molecule. DPPH radicals react with suitable reducing agents as a result of which the electrons become paired off forming the corresponding hydrazine. The solution therefore loses colour stoichometrically depending on the number of electrons taken up. Fifty millilitres of various concentrations (25, 50, 70 and 100 µg/ml) of the compounds dissolved in methanol was added to 5 ml of a 0.004% methanolic solution of DPPH. The sample solutions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in dark place and after then absorbance was recorded against the blank solution at 517 nm. The relative percent of DPPH scavenging activity was calculated according to the following equation:
