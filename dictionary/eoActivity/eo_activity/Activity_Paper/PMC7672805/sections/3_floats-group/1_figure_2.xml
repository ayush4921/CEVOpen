  <p>MTT assay was performed after J774.1 murine macrophages were treated for 24 h with PEL (10 µg/ml) + LAT (1 µg/ml) and PEL 10 µg/ml + LAT 1 µg/ml + LPS 0.1 µg/ml. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. No statistically significant differences were determined according to one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison post-test.</p>
