  <p>Treatment of 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> (0.5 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml) culture with LAT (1 µg/ml) (
   <bold>A</bold>) and PEL+LAT (
   <bold>B</bold>). The black line represents the control of the bacteria growth without antibiotic. The blue line represents bacteria growth with penicillin/streptomycin as antibiotic, and the red line represents the bacteria growth with LAT alone (A) or in combination with PEL (B). The bacteria growth was analyzed from 0 up to 20 h. Data are represented as mean ± SEM range (
   <italic>n</italic>=9). Statistically significant differences were determined by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison post-test.
