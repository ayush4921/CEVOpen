<p>Indeed, another important characteristic of PEL+LAT combination is the antioxidant activity, which could be of potential relevance in oxidative stress-based pathologies, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In particular, we observed that PEL+LAT exerted a potentiated antioxidant activity on LPS-treated macrophages. Indeed, although the reduction of ROS (DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells) and of nitrite by the single PEL or LAT, the combination PELIRGOSTIM was able to reduce the levels of ROS in a 2-fold manner in the presence of LPS, as well as to reduce nitrite in a 4-fold manner. This effect is of great clinical relevance especially in pathologies, during which the oxidative stress plays a pivotal role. Therefore, the identification of beneficial nutraceuticals, as in the case of PEL and LAT, could be important to prevent the establishment of an oxidative status that leads cells to damage ensuing an inflammatory pattern that can be at the basis of the pathology.
