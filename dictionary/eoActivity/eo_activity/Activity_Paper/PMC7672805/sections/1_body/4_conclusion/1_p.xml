<p>In conclusion, although the limitation of an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study, these data suggest that the combination PEL+LAT (PELIRGOSTIM) can reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidants and bacteria growth, most likely preventing leukocyte chemiotaxis with a reduced inflammatory pattern. Therefore, our data pave the way for an innovative therapeutic approach for inflammation-, oxidative stress- and microbial-related disorders.
