<p>The administration of LAT (1 Âµg/ml) significantly reduced the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> starting from 6 h post treatment compared with the control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, red line versus black line). This effect was comparable to the activity of the mixture penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, blue line versus red line). However, LAT showed higher antimicrobial activity in terms of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth compared with Pen/Strep mixture at 20 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, red line versus blue line). The combination of PEL+LAT showed an earlier activity (5 h) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) than LAT alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) in that the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was reduced at 5 h compared with 6 h when LAT was added alone.
