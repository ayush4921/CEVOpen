<p>To evaluate the antioxidant properties of the combination of PEL and LAT, J774.1 macrophagic cells were treated for 45 min with PEL (10 μg/ml) or LAT (1 μg/ml) or their combination in the presence or not of LPS (1 µg/ml). The administration of the sole LAT or PEL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, black dots) did not alter the percentage of DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells. Instead, the administration of LAT+PEL on LPS-treated macrophages significantly reduced the percentage of DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, red dots). The percentage of DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells after PEL+LAT addition on LPS-treated macrophages was two-fold decreased compared with the single PEL or LAT. Indeed, the percentage of DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells after PEL+LAT+LPS were 3.28 ± 1% DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells versus LPS that was 6.35 ± 1.6% DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A,B). The sole PEL+LPS registered 6 ± 1.75% DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells and LAT+LPS 4.28 ± 1.5% DCHF
 <sup>+</sup> cells, implying that the combination was able to exert an additive antioxidant activity.
