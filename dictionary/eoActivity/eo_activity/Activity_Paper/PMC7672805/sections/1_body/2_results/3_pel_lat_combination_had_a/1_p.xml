<p>It is already known that PEL and LAT have antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the main goal of the present study was to understand whether the combination of both could prove as antimicrobial drug. Therefore, we used Gram positive bacterium, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (0.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml), and Gram negative bacterium, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (0.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/ml) cultures that were treated with LAT at the MIC of 1 μg/ml or PEL at the MIC of 10 μg/ml. Bacterial growth was evaluated 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 20 h after treatment.
