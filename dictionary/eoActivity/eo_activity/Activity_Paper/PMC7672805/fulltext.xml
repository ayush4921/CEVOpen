Because the main advantage of natural products consists in administering them in combination rather than as single compound, we aimed to understand whether the combination of PEL and LAT, herein PELIRGOSTIM, could still prove beneficial or additive/synergistic activities during inflammatory conditions. To pursue this goal, we used macrophagic cells (J774.1) and treated them with PEL and LAT in a concentration-dependent manner. We found that PELIRGOSTIM was able to reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrite, effects that were correlated to the release of lower levels of IL-1&#x003b2; after LPS treatment. In addition, the combination of PEL and LAT showed bacteriostatic activities against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> which had limited growth starting from 5 hours up to 20 hours.

The common name, <italic>umckaloabo</italic>, represents the Zulu word describing &#x000b4;severe cough&#x02019;. Indeed, its extracts are successfully employed in modern phytotherapy in Europe to cure infectious diseases of the respiratory tract [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Inspired by the healing of his tuberculosis, Charles Henry Stevens introduced this phytomedical drug to England in 1897 [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and since then, the use of this plant has increased more and more interest because of its beneficial properties. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated the usefulness of PEL in the treatment of several disorders due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and its antiproliferative effect [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In our very recent paper, we demonstrated that PEL together with other natural products can exert antimicrobial activities [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. So far, many studies have been conducted on the combination of PEL with other compounds, in order to identify new synergistic or enhanced pharmacological effects. In the present study, we have investigated the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of Pelargonium sidoides DC (PEL) combined with lactoferrin (LAT), a multifunctional protein that participates to numerous physiological functions.</p><p>LAT is a nonhemic iron-binding glycoprotein of the transferrin family [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is present in many biological fluids and tissues, particularly in neutrophil granules [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is involved in iron transportation, immune responses, organ morphogenesis and promotes wound healing and bone growth [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has also been described as beneficial to prevent cancer [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and to exert beneficial cardiovascular properties such as lipid reduction, antihypertensive and antithrombotic effects [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, its iron chelating ability underlies its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, based on the literature, the main goal of the present study was to evaluate whether PEL and LAT combination could be beneficial. We found that this novel combination, PEL+LAT, herein PELIRGOSTIM, had anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, and that could be an alternative therapeutic strategy to the actual antimicrobial therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample preparation</title><p>Pelargonium sidoides DC (PEL; Cod: LIP00538), LAT and their combination (patented as PELIRGOSTIM&#x000ae; with number 102018000002457) were obtained from Shedir Pharma s.r.l. as dried powder, reconstituted with bi-distilled water at the stock concentration of 10 mg/ml.

Similarly to what reported in literature, we found that PEL and LAT used alone were able to reduce LPS-induced proinflammatory IL-1&#x003b2;, as well as reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrite and bacteria growth. More importantly, the combination of PEL with LAT showed an additive pharmacological activity in terms of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; is widely described as a proinflammatory cytokine, released after LPS stimulation [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our data demonstrate that the combination of PEL+LAT significantly reduced the levels of IL-1&#x003b2; after LPS stimulation. This effect could prompt PELIRGOSTIM as an innovative and hitherto unknown combination, able to attenuate inflammation-related pathways. IL-1&#x003b2; is a critical regulator of the inflammatory response that, according to the activation of the inflammasome complex, its release can promote leukocyte migration with ensuing tissue damage, can promote T-cell survival, can contribute to the polarization of Th1, Th2 and Th17 differentiation. In addition, IL-1&#x003b2; induces IL-6 and/or TNF-&#x003b1; release, participating to the recruitment of other immune cells which phenotype can be endeavored according to the microenvironment [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, our data have the limitation to prove the sole activity of the combination PEL+LAT to reduce IL-1&#x003b2; release, but future studies will be performed by using <italic>in vivo</italic> models to prove its anti-inflammatory activity. Nevertheless, we believe that the capability of PEL+LAT to reduce the release of IL-1&#x003b2; from LPS-treated macrophages, associated with the reduced oxidant activity, can be of beneficial in inflammatory-based disorders.</p><p>Indeed, another important characteristic of PEL+LAT combination is the antioxidant activity, which could be of potential relevance in oxidative stress-based pathologies, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In particular, we observed that PEL+LAT exerted a potentiated antioxidant activity on LPS-treated macrophages. Indeed, although the reduction of ROS (DCHF<sup>+</sup> cells) and of nitrite by the single PEL or LAT, the combination PELIRGOSTIM was able to reduce the levels of ROS in a 2-fold manner in the presence of LPS, as well as to reduce nitrite in a 4-fold manner. This effect is of great clinical relevance especially in pathologies, during which the oxidative stress plays a pivotal role. Therefore, the identification of beneficial nutraceuticals, as in the case of PEL and LAT, could be important to prevent the establishment of an oxidative status that leads cells to damage ensuing an inflammatory pattern that can be at the basis of the pathology.</p><p>Another important issue that deserves to be highlighted in this manuscript is that the combination of PEL and LAT exerted higher antimicrobial activity than LAT alone, well-known to be important during breast feeding [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. PEL+LAT were able to statistically reduce <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> growth, effect that was longer than that observed for penicillin/streptomycin. The administration of the single compounds still reduced bacteria growth; however, this effect was observed at 6 h rather than at 5 h. Moreover, this effect was not due to antioxidant activity of the single compounds as already reported [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, the sole compounds were not able to exert antioxidant activities, rather, they showed bacteriostatic activity although at later time points. It has already been reported that LAT has strong antimicrobial activities against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria as well as fungi, yeasts, viruses and protozoa [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The antimicrobial activity of LAT is generally associated to two mechanisms: the first is based on iron absorption in the site of infection, leading to the deprivation of nutrients to microbes; the second one is the direct contact of LAT with pathogens which interferes with microbial physiology [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the latter case, the presence of positive amino acids in LAT chemical structure allows it to interact with negatively charged molecules on some bacterial, viral, fungal and parasite surfaces, causing cell lysis [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, we already proved that PEL alone can exert antimicrobial activities [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Here, the combination of PEL and LAT led to an additive bacteriostatic activity, especially in the case of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. In addition, due to the recent emergency and spread of multidrug resistant pathogens, the combination of PEL and LAT could prove of innovative potentiality for the actual antimicrobial therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, although the limitation of an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, these data suggest that the combination PEL+LAT (PELIRGOSTIM) can reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines, oxidants and bacteria growth, most likely preventing leukocyte chemiotaxis with a reduced inflammatory pattern. Therefore, our data pave the way for an innovative therapeutic approach for inflammation-, oxidative stress- and microbial-related disorders.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="sec6" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing Interests</title><p>M.T., A.P. and R.S. disclose to be founders of ImmunePharma srl.
