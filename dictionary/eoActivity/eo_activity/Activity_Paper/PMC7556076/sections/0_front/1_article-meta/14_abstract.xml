 <p>The leaf latex of 
  <italic>Aloe pulcherrima</italic> has been used as remedy for diabetes mellitus. This was carried out to determine 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> antidiabetic activities of the leaf latex of 
  <italic>Aloe pulcherrim</italic>a. 
  <italic>Methods</italic>. Sucrase and maltase inhibitory activity of the leaf latex of 
  <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> was determined in glucose oxidase assay, and 
  <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory activity was determined in dinitrosalicylic acid assay. Normoglycemic, glucose-loaded, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were treated orally to determine blood glucose lowering activity of the latex. Effect of the latex on serum lipid level and body weight was measured in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Additionally, DPPH assay was used to determine free radical scavenging capacity of the latex. 
  <italic>Results</italic>. Antioxidant activity of the latex was concentration dependent; the strongest inhibition was measured at 800 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (80.57%). The leaf latex of 
  <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> inhibited sucrase (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 2.92 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), maltase (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 11.81 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and 
  <italic>α</italic>-amylase (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 14.92 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) enzymes. All doses of the leaf latex induced hypoglycemic effect after 4 h in normal mice, and low dose of the latex did not show significant effect after 6 h. Glucose reduction of the leaf latex of 
  <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> was significant (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in oral glucose-loaded mice compared to the vehicle control. Blood glucose level of diabetic mice was significantly (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) reduced on week one and weak two in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model. Glucose reduction increased with increasing the doses of the leaf latex of 
  <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> on week one (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 (200 mg/kg), 
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 (400 mg/kg), and 
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (600 mg/kg)). Administration of the leaf latex of 
  <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> for two weeks significantly (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) improved diabetic dyslipidemia and body weight of diabetic mice. 
  <italic>Conclusion</italic>. The study confirmed that the leaf latex of the plant showed a significant antidiabetic activity justifying the traditional uses of the plant.
