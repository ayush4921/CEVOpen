<p>After 3 days of streptozotocin administration, normal and diabetic mice were randomly assigned to different groups and then BGL and body weight of the mice were measured. Then, mice were treated with the vehicle, standard drug, and the latex daily for two weeks. On weeks one and two, BGL and body weight of 16-hour fasted mice were recorded [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. On day 15, overnight fasted mice were sacrificed using high-dose pentobarbitone (150 mg/kg, i.p.) and then blood samples were collected from each mouse in a sterile tube. Blood samples were allowed to coagulate for two hours at room temperature, then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for ten minutes. Then, serum samples were prepared by decanting the supernatant into test tubes to determine the level of TC, TG, and HDL-C.
