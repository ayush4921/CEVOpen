<p>The 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory assay of the leaf latex of 
 <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> was determined as mentioned in the literature studies with few modifications [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Ten 
 <italic>μ</italic>l latex solution (15.6–500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was incubated in 75 
 <italic>μ</italic>l porcine pancreatic 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase (3 units/ml) in 165 
 <italic>μ</italic>l phosphate buffers (pH 6.9, 0.1 M) at 37°C for 15 minutes. A volume of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l starch solution (1 g/L) in buffer was added to the reaction mixture and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The reaction was ceased by adding 250 ml dinitrosalicylic acid (1%) and boiled in water bath for ten minute at 100°C. Then, 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>l potassium sodium tartrate (40%) was added into the mixtures. Acarbose was served as a positive control, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined. The mixtures were kept on cold water bath at room temperature, and the absorbance was read at 540 nm by using by a UV spectrometer:
