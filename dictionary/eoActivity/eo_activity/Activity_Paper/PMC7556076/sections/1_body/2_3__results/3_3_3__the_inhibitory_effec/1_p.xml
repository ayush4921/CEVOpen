<p>Enzyme inhibition assay showed that the latex possessed an inhibitory effect on sucrase, maltase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase enzymes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Even though all enzymes were inhibited by the latex, greater inhibition was shown on sucrase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.92 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) than maltase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.81 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 14.92 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) enzymes. The finding of the study showed that sucrase, maltase, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition capacity of the latex was concentration dependent. Percentage inhibition of the latex was significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared to vehicle control.
