<p>In a review paper by P. F. Uzor, the structures, activities, and toxicities of alkaloids which were isolated recently (2013 to 2019) from medicinal plants and reported to exhibit antiplasmodial activity were presented. Several classes of alkaloids, including terpenoidal, indole, bisindole, quinolone, and isoquinoline alkaloids, were identified with a promising antimalarial activity. It is hoped that the outcome of the review work will spur further research into the structural modification and/or development of the interesting compounds as novel antimalarial drugs.</p>
