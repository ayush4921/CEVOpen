 <italic>Dillenia indica</italic> (family Dilleniaecae) is commonly known as elephant apple. The pulp of the fruit is applied on the scalp to cure dandruff and hair loss, and the sepal has been used to treat stomach disorders since ancient times [

 <italic>D. indica</italic> possesses various medicinal properties, such as anticancer [

 <xref rid="B13-antioxidants-09-01099" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and antidiabetic and its associated complications, such as hyperlipidemia [
 <xref rid="B14-antioxidants-09-01099" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], diabetic nephropathy, and neuropathy. However, little information is available on the chemical composition of 
 <italic>D. indica</italic> bark (DIB). Therefore, this study aimed to provide further information on the chemical composition of the ethyl acetate fraction of DIB (DIBEt) through the determination of total phenolic and total flavonoid contents and in-vitro antioxidant capacity. The bioactive components of DIBEt were screened using PSI-MS. Furthermore, the focus was on the regulatory role of DIBEt on the expression of antioxidant enzymes in RAW 264.7 cells and the underlying mechanisms.
