<p>DIB was collected from Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh, in August 2018 and taxonomically identified by the National Herbarium of Bangladesh (voucher specimen no. 49403) and retained in the laboratory for future reference. Dried and coarsely powdered barks (100 g) were extracted by shaking with ethanol at 60 Â°C for 12 h (three times) and dried in a rotary vacuum evaporator. The ethanolic extract (DIBE; 18.21 g) was suspended in 200 mL deionized water and partitioned sequentially with n-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate using separating funnels in a stepwise manner. After vacuum filtration, the solutions were concentrated in a rotary vacuum evaporator. The n-hexane fraction (DIBH; 1.70 g), chloroform extract (DIBC; 2.44 g), ethyl acetate fraction (DIBEt; 8.55 g), and aqueous fraction (DIBW; 5.18 g) were dissolved in deionized water at 30 mg/mL concentration.</p>
