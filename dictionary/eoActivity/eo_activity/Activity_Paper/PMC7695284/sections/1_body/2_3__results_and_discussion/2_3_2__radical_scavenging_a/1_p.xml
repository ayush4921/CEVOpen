<p>Various molecular mechanisms and/or the synergism between them may cause the attribution of antioxidant activity of the secondary metabolites present in plants. Thus, the evaluation of the antioxidant activity of plant extracts should be performed via several methods. DPPH, ABTS, superoxide and hydroxyl radical-scavenging assays, and FRAP, CUPRAC, and ORAC assays were performed to assess the antioxidant potential of various organic and aqueous DIB extracts. All organic and aqueous DIB extracts significantly scavenged DPPH and ABTS radicals in a dose-dependent manner (

 <sub>50</sub>, 5.82 ± 0.18 µg/mL) &gt; DIBC (IC

 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-09-01099" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Compared to previous studies, this study revealed that DIB is more powerful to scavenge DPPH radicals. The superoxide and hydroxyl radical-scavenging abilities of DIB extracts were evaluated by the PMS-NADH superoxide-generating system and Fenton reaction in a dose-dependent manner, respectively (
