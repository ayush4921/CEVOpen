<p>Among all extracts, DIBEt has the highest antioxidant potential triggered to evaluate the potential of DIBEt to scavenge oxidative stress-induced cellular ROS generation with cellular toxicity. t-BHP, a short-chain analog of lipid peroxide, is widely accepted as a model substance to induce oxidative stress in cells and tissues and evaluate the molecular mechanisms of cellular alterations caused by oxidative stress [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01099-f004">Figure 4</xref>B demonstrates that DIBEt has an immense potential to attenuate oxidative stress-induced cellular ROS generation in a concentration-dependent manner with that of gallic acid (30 μg/mL) without showing cellular toxicity. Excessive ROS formation triggers oxidative stress, leading to cell death. Detailed research has revealed that antioxidants mitigated the deleterious effects of ROS and retard many effects that cause cellular death [
