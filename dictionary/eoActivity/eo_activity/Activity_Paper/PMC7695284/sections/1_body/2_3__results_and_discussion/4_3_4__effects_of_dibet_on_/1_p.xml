<p>The first-line antioxidant defense system, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione, critically maintains cellular redox homeostasis [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01099-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D, the mRNA expression and protein levels of the first-line antioxidant enzymes SOD1, catalase, and GPx-1 and the phase II enzyme HO-1 were extremely extenuated in t-BHP-treated cells, respectively, but DIBEt treatment dose-dependently reversed this trend. Naringenin also enhanced the mRNA expression and protein levels of first-line antioxidant enzymes in the t-BHP model. These data suggest that increased mRNA and protein levels of antioxidant enzymes by DIBEt plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis and protects against oxidative stress-induced cell death.
