<p>Studies revealed that phenolic compounds, such as phenol and flavonoids, have strong redox properties capable of quenching singlet and triplet oxygen, adsorbing and neutralizing free radicals, and/or decomposing peroxides, resulting in superior antioxidant potential [

 <italic>ρ</italic> = −0.939, −0.918, and −0.853, respectively) and moderate correlation for superoxide radical-scavenging activity (

 <italic>ρ</italic>-value (−1) stands for a perfect positive correlation, as a correlation between polyphenol and free radical-scavenging abilities was found using IC
 <sub>50</sub>. The data were also supported by previous studies describing that the antioxidant activity is highly influenced by the presence of total phenol content, and has a linear correlation between phenolic content and antioxidant activity, but the total flavonoid content provided a mixed function [
