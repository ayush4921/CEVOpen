 <bold>Correlations between FRAP, TEAC, TPC, and TFC values:</bold> Correlation analyses were performed to identify the strength of relationships between FRAP, TEAC, TPC, and TFC values (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A strong correlation between FRAP and TEAC (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9340) indicated that the herbs possessed the ability to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and to scavenge ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>. In addition, the FRAP and TEAC values were both found to correlate with the TPC values (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9600 for FRAP and TPC; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9013 for TEAC and TPC), implying that the phenolic components contributed to the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-reducing and ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>-scavenging activities[
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, a correlation between the TPC and TFC values (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8829) suggested that flavonoids may be the major phenolic compounds but were not the only ones. Correlations were also found between FRAP/TEAC and TFC (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9139 for FRAP and TFC; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8729 for TEAC and TFC). In summary, the antioxidants in the tested medicinal herbs were able to both reduce oxidants (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) and scavenge free radicals (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>), which was largely dependent on their TPC.
