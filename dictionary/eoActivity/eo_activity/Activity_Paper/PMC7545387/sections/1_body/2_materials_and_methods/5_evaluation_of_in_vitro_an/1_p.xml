<p>The ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay was performed to assess the antioxidant activity (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-reducing capability) of the tested herbs using a slightly modified version of a published method[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In short, FRAP reagent was freshly prepared and kept in a water bath at 37 °C until use with the following three solutions (10:1:1, v/v/v): (1) Sodium acetate buffer (300 mmol/L, pH 3.6); (2) TPTZ solution (10 mmol/L, solvent: 40 mmol/L HCl); and (3) Ferric chloride solution (20 mmol/L). Then, the mixture of the water extract of each sample (100 μL) and FRAP reagents (3 mL) were incubated at room temperature for 4 min. The absorbance of each mixture at 593 nm was recorded. The results were expressed in the form of μmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g DW, with reference to ferrous sulfate as the standard.
