<p>The MS analysis was performed by using an Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (ITMS; Thermo Scientific, United States) equipped with an ESI under the following conditions: ESI source temperature, 320 °C; source voltages, 4.0 kV for positive mode and 3.5 kV for negative mode; capillary voltages, 24.0 V for positive polarity, and -12.0 V for negative polarity; desolvation gas, nitrogen; full scan mass range, 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 50–1500. Tandem mass spectrometry analyses were performed using nitrogen as the collision gas with a collision energy of 35 eV. The MS/MS spectrum was obtained to the tenth most intense ion from ITMS.
