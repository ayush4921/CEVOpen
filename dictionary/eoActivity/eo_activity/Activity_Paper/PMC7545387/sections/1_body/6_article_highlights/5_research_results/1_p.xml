<p>The results revealed that all tested herbs attenuated CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced oxidative liver injury; each resulted in significant decreases in levels of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and triacylglycerols. In addition, most herbs restored hepatic superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, glutathione levels, and reduced malondialdehyde levels. 
 <italic>Sanguisorba officinalis</italic> (
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>) L., 
 <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> Franch., and 
 <italic>Pueraria lobata</italic> (Willd.) Ohwi root were the three most effective herbs, and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L. exhibited the strongest hepatoprotective effect. Nine active components were identified in 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic>, and gallic acid and (+)-catechin were quantified (7.86 ± 0.45 mg/g and 8.19 ± 0.57 mg/g dried weight, respectively). Furthermore, the tested herbs displayed a range of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities proportional to their phenolic content; the strongest activities were also found for 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> L.
