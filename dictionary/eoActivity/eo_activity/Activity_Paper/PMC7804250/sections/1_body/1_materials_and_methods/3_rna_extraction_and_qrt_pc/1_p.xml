<p id="Par7">Control and treated (elicitors and wounding) seedling tissues (100 mg) were collected at the different time points (0 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h) for RNA extraction. All tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen, and total RNA was extracted with an RNA extraction kit (TaKaRa, MiniBEST Plant Genomic DNA, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We used PrimeScript™RT Master Mix (TaKaRa, China) to synthesize cDNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers used for gene expression by qPCR are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) using an ABI 7300 and SYBR Premix (Roche, Switzerland) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 18S gene was applied as the housekeeping gene in all applications. The relative gene expression was calculated by the formula 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>.
