<p id="Par5">Sixty-day-old lines of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> were maintained in hormone-free solid medium. All the cultures were under a 16/8 h (light/dark) cycle (4500 to 9000 lx) until used for transformation, and these tissues were used for all experiments. MJ (≥ 98%) and SA (≥ 99%) were purchased from Sigma (USA). They were filter sterilized using 0.22 μM membrane filters (Millipore, USA) and diluted in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide). For wounding treatment, 60-day-old 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> seedlings were wounded in the leaves of the seedlings using sterile needles and placed in Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium. For the combined treatment, seedlings were first wounded and then placed in MS containing 100 μM MJ or 100 μM SA. The samples of the control group were also placed in MS medium without any treatments. All the samples were grown at 25 °C under a 16 h photoperiod. For gene expression and metabolic profile studies, samples treated as described above were harvested at different time points. Finally, all samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 70 °C for future experiments. All the samples were collected at 0 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h to test the optimum incubation time required for the treatment to evoke the maximum response. Samples were collected in triplicate each time.
