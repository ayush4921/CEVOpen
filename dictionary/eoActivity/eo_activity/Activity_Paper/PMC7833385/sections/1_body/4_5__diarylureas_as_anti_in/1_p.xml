<p>The inhibition of Δ5-desaturase by small molecules may attenuate inflammatory responses, potentially creating next-generation anti-inflammatory agents. Diarylurea CP-214339 (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-10-00092-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) acts as inhibitor of a Δ5-desaturase in rodents (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.13 µM), thus decreasing arachidonic acid synthesis [

 <xref rid="B79-antibiotics-10-00092" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Several diarylureas, in which one aryl moiety is represented by a substituted dihydropyrazole, were studied for their anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. In vitro anti-inflammatory activity was tested against the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) by TNF-α and IL-6 inhibition assay. Compounds 
 <bold>32–34</bold> exhibited anti-inflammatory activity, showing TNF-α (85%, 58% and 61%, respectively) and IL-6 (93%, 75% and 80%, respectively) inhibitory activity as compared to the standard dexamethasone but at a higher concentration (10 µM). They showed low or no antimicrobial activity [

 <sup>+</sup> ATPase (proton pump) and anti-inflammatory activity. Diarylurea 
 <bold>35</bold> behaved as an antiulcer, exhibiting higher activity against proton pump than omeprazole (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 18.4 µg/mL versus 38.2 µg/mL), while compound 
 <bold>36</bold> displayed higher anti-inflammatory activity than indomethacin (IC
