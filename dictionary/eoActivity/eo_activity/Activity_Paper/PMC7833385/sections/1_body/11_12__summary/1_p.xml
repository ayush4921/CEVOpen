<p>This paper reviews the current status and the recent studies of biologically important diarylurea derivatives. The diarylurea moiety may be considered a privileged structure in medicinal chemistry. Besides the widely known antitumor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and others, several diarylureas have been studied for a variety of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet action. The intention of this review is to highlight the profusion of recent biological data that exists around the diarylurea class of compounds, focusing especially on their antimicrobial, antiviral and all the other activities that could be useful for the treatment or prevention of new COVID-19 pandemics, for which there is any evidence of effective treatments. Promising strategies to combat SARS-CoV-2 include the discovery of therapeutic targets, drugs and vaccines/monoclonal antibodies and, considering the emergency and urgency, approved repurposed drugs, which could be important and useful for the therapeutic management of the disease. To date the main therapies used to treat this disease are antiviral drugs, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics, bronchospasmolitics, beta-blockers, steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and so on). As most of the early-detected bacterial pneumonia can be safely and effectively treated with antibiotics, the broad-spectrum antibiotics are widely used, as well, in COVID-19 patients. Drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine, ritonavir, tocilizumab, corticosteroids have been repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19, although their clinical effectiveness has not yet been confirmed. Unfortunately, the use of chloroquine and derivatives such as hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with other drugs, resulted in cardiac toxicity. Taking into account that COVID-19 is a multi-organ dysfunction, which causes comorbidities or complications and triggers an unregulated systemic inflammatory response, new molecules with multi-target and multi-properties action are need. Recently, new kinases inhibitors have been reported for their implications in modulating the inflammatory response, which is, as well, one of the major issue during the COVID-19. The different biological activities herein described for diarylureas, namely antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant, may be very effective in hampering the different steps of SARS-COV-2 diffusion and progression, influencing positively the above mentioned comorbidities. Moreover, the already known anti-bacterial properties make them promising molecules for repositioning diarylureas as antimicrobial agents and interesting scaffolds for the development of multitarget COVID-19 treatments.</p>
