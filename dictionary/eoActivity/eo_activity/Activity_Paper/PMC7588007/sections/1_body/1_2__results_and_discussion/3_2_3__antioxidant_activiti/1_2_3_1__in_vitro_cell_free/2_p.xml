<p>Comparatively, extracts from commercial Thai basil leaves presented a 71.4% RSA for DPPH assay, as well as 914.2 and 387.7 ÂµM TEAC for ABTS and FRAP assays, respectively. Based on these in vitro cell-free assays, the measured antioxidant capacity of the extract from commercial Thai basil leaves was within the range of those determined for callus extracts (
