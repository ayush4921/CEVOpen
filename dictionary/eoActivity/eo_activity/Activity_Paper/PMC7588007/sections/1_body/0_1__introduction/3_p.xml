 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, the most promising results obtained with 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> in vitro cultures, for high biomass production and high yields of phytochemicals, have been achieved using thidiazuron (TDZ) as a growth regulator. However, TDZ is no longer considered safe in Europe, and therefore its use is excluded for nutraceutical applications, which is the intended application (Status under Reg. (EC) No 1107/2009 (repealing Directive 91/414/EEC)). Here, other growth regulator combinations were analyzed and, most notably, phytochemical production and antioxidant activity were compared to commercial leaf extracts. The current study aimed at establishing a proficient protocol for Thai basil in vitro cultures that are effective in producing continuously high biomass and accumulating high levels of antioxidants under the treatment of various plant growth regulators (PGRs), either alone or in combination. Culture extracts were further analyzed for total phenolic production, HPLC quantification of chicoric acid, rosmarinic acid, and caffeic acid, as well as antioxidant capacity using both in vitro cell-free (DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays) and cellular assays. These values were compared with those obtained from commercial leaves for extraction. In the light of these results, the nutraceutical potential of the established Thai basil in vitro cultures is discussed. Our findings clearly illustrate the great significance of the optimized biological system, which also has a wide capacity for continuous biomass production, thus demonstrating its high potential for future nutraceutical applications.
