<p>Plant specialized metabolites of pharmacological significance may be difficult to extract in high, sustainable and continuous quantities from field-grown plant material, but in vitro cultures have been identified as a possible biological system for the production of these metabolites [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In vitro culture techniques provide consistent production schemes for metabolites that are free from environmental limitations and ensure increased biomass and a high concentration of compounds compared to natural production systems [

In addition, in the case of basil varieties or cultivars which can be differentiated on the basis of color, aromatic composition and growth habitat, sometimes harvested from nature, thus complicating its botanical identity, the in vitro system presents a major advantage for the certification of plant authentication [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04859" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Various reports are available in the literature on the in vitro production of bioactive metabolites from the callus culture of medicinally important plants. For example, Smith [
