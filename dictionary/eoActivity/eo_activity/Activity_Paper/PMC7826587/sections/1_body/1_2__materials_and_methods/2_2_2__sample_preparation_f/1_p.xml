<p>For direct qualitative analysis, 100 mg of lyophilized plant material was extracted with 5 mL of MeOH: H
 <sub>2</sub>O (8:2

 <sub>2</sub>O prior to preliminary purification and concentration using solid phase extraction (SPE). SPE was performed using an Oasis Max 1cc Vac Cartridge, 500 mg Sorbent per Cartridge, 30 µm Particle Size (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) conditioned with MeOH (4 mL) and H
 <sub>2</sub>O (4 mL). The sample was loaded and cartridges washed with 5 mL water in 0.1% FA. The phenolic compounds were eluted with 5 mL of 80% MeOH in 0.1% FA. Samples were re-evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 25% of MeOH to obtain 1 mg dry weight/mL baseline plant material concentration.
