<p>Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) estimation of metabolite contents was carried out on a Thermo Ultimate 3000 RS (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) chromatographic system coupled to a Bruker Compact (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer, consisting of a binary pump, sample manager, column manager, and the PDA/diode array detector. Separations were performed on a Kinetex C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.6 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), with mobile phase A consisting of 0.1% (

 <italic>v</italic>) FA in acetonitrile. The samples (2 μL) were injected, and a linear gradient from 15% to 70% phase B in phase A was used for 27 min to separate all main compounds. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min, and the column was held at 30 °C. Mass spectra were acquired in positive-ion mode over a mass range from

 <italic>z</italic> 100 to 1500 with 5 Hz frequency. Ultrapure nitrogen was used as drying and nebulizer gas and argon was used as collision gas. The collision energy was set automatically from 15 to 75 eV, depending on the 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> of the fragmented ion. Operating parameters of the ESI ion source were as follows: capillary voltage 3 kV, dry gas flow 6 L/min, dry gas temperature 200 °C, nebulizer pressure 0.7 bar, collision radio frequency 700.0 V, transfer time 100.0 μs, and pre pulse storage 7.0 μs. Acquired data were calibrated internally with sodium formate introduced to the ion source at the beginning and end of each separation via a 20 μL loop. Processing of spectra was performed with Bruker DataAnalysis 4.3 software. UV DAD data were collected at 190–450 nm, and chromatograms acquired at UV 280 nm were smoothed by use of the Savitzky−Golay algorithm (window width 5 points, one iteration). Then, the detected peaks at retention time and the corresponding MS/MS were integrated. All determinations were done in triplicate (biological replication meaning a different extract 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3); each biological replication was measured at least twice as a technical replication.
