<p>In a related study, low-copy nuclear markers (PPR-AT3G09060, GBSSI) were used to further assess relationships of 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> and related genera within Salviinae [
 <xref rid="B14-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Based upon these results, previous phylogenetic findings, taxonomic, morphological, and practical considerations, the authors concluded that the botanical community would be better served by keeping the genus 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> as traditionally circumscribed, but with the inclusion of 15 species in the five small embedded genera: 
 <italic>Perovskia</italic>, 
 <italic>Dorystaechas</italic>, 
 <italic>Meriandra</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosmarinus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Zhumeria</italic>. Subsequently, to implement this approach and unify all genera within 
 <italic>Salvia</italic>, the authors provided an updated nomenclatural revision, according to which former 
 <italic>Perovskia abrotanoides</italic> is now circumscribed as 
 <italic>Salvia abrotanoides</italic> (Kar.) Sytsma and former 
 <italic>Perovskia atriplicifolia</italic> as 
 <italic>Salvia yangii</italic> B.T. Drew.
