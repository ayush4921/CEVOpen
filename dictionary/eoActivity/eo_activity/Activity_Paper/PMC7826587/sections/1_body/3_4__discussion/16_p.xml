<p>In the present form, our molecular analysis may suggest that 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> are very closely related but regarded as two separate species. To make this conclusion fully justified, multiple accessions of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> would have to be included into the analysis. Unfortunately, at present, we do not have access to other taxonomically undoubtful accessions of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides;</italic> thus, we decided to rely on what is available. Despite a suggested close genetic relationship, 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> and 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> possess distinct phytochemical profiles including qualitative differences within the non-volatile chemicals, which make them a potentially useful model for further analysis. Interestingly, the LC-MS profiles of aerial parts are apparently more similar, and none of the major compounds stand out as distinct, but the PCA processing revealed an obvious separation between the species. Hence, presence or absence of the minor compounds or their varied proportions is also important with such examples as the abovementioned sugiol/trilobinol pair. In contrast, the roots of both species are phytochemically distinct at first sight, and chemometric analysis has verified this fact. Isograndifoliol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f002">Figure 2</xref>, peak 27), a hydroxylated norditerpenoid present only in 
 <italic>S. yangii,</italic> is a rarely detected compound that has a high pharmacological potential [
 <xref rid="B66-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and its presence in a relatively high amount points out 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> as an especially valuable medicinal plant. Sugiol, even if a minor compound only, also has significant pharmacological potential, reviewed recently by Bajpai et al. 2020 [
 <xref rid="B83-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], that can, for example, attenuate STAT3-dependent proliferation and unlocks apoptosis pathways in cancer cells and can block virus entry to cells. Whether or not this compound can contribute to the overall activity of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> leaf as a drug has not been explored so far. On the other hand, carnosic acid quinone, a phytochemical marker of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> leaves, was reported as a highly potent factor in antioxidant reactions in 
 <italic>S. rosmarinus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. officinalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B84-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].
