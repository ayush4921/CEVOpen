<p>Amongst ten compounds found in methanolic extracts of air-dried aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we detected rosmarinic acid and hesperidin, both present in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>. Interestingly, in our study, hesperidin was also found to be present in the roots of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>. Two new tertracyclic diterpens, abrotandiol and abrotanone, found by Khaliq et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] were absent in our extracts. The dihydroxy-methoxymethylflavone, however, found in our leaf isolates, might be the same compound as cismaritin found by Khaliq et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Confirming that would require additional NMR analysis.
