<p>In leaves, the first two principal components (PCs) explained 47.3% and 17.1% of the variation in the spectral data, respectively. On the right side of the score plots (green dots) a strong cluster of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> samples formed, while on the left side (blue dots) 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> samples were well separated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f003">Figure 3</xref>a). According to the loadings plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f003">Figure 3</xref>b) these two groups were significantly positively correlated with particular compounds detected in leaves. The PC loadings analyses confirmed that the content of sugiol (38) in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> leaves and of carnosic acid quinone (31) in leaves of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> were mostly responsible for their chemical differentiation and revealed a clear separation of samples derived from these two species.
