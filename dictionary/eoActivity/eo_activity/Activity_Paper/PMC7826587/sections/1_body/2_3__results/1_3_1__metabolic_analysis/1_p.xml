<p>Using UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis, thirty-eight different compounds were found in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> leaves, while leaves of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> comprised thirty-six metabolites extracted with methanol (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The analysis showed the presence of 14 different phenylpropanoids (3–6, 8–11,14,15,17,18, 21, 27) in leaves of both 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>, including rosmarinic acid (11), considered as one of the chemotaxonomic markers in the Nepetoideae subfamily [
 <xref rid="B22-cells-10-00112" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In total, 13 diterpenoids were detected in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> leaves (20, 22, 23, 28–30, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 41) while leaves of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> contained 15 different diterpenoids, out of which carnosic acid quinone (31), isorosmanol (33), and trilobinol (39) were found in 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> and not in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic>. On the other hand, rosmaridiphenol (35) and sugiol (38) were detected exclusively in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> leaves. Among all detected diterpenoids, carnosol (30) turned out to be the most abundant in the leaves of both species as it yielded the highest peak (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Both species were found to contain a phenantrene, methoxy-8,11,13-abietatrien-20,11-olide (36), in their leaves. Interestingly, three metabolites identified as triterpenoids (24–26) were detected exclusively in leaves of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic>. Seven compounds found in leaves of both species were not determined (1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 16, 19).
