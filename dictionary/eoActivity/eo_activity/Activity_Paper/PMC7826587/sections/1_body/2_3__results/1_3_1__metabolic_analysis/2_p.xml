<p>UHPLC-QTOF-MS analysis of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> roots revealed the presence of thirty-five different compounds, while in roots of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides,</italic> only twenty-six metabolites were detected (
 <xref rid="cells-10-00112-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In roots of 
 <italic>S. yangii,</italic> six phenylpropanoids were found (1, 3, 5, 9–11), out of which three, namely, methoxytaxifolin (1), 2-
 <italic>O</italic>-p-coumaroyltartronic acid (3), and melitric acid B (10), were found only in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and not in 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>. Roots of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> contained four phenylpropanoids, one of which was found exclusively in this species: a flavonoid glucoside–hesperidin (7). Rosmarinic acid (9) and salviaflaside (5), a rosmarinic acid 3′ glucoside, were detected in both species as well as the 8-methylchromen-4-one (12), a phenolic compound belonging to benzopyrans, and salvianolic acid L (6), belonging to phenylnaphthalenes. Chrysoeriol 7-rutinoside (8), which belongs to fatty alcohols/aliphatic alcohols, was detected exclusively in the roots of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>. The most abundant group of non-volatile metabolites in roots was diterpenoids, represented by 18 compounds in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> and by 13 metabolites in 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic>. Twelve diterpenoids (14, 15, 17–21, 31, 34, 35, 37, 38) were common to both species, including the most abundant, cryptotanshinone (31). Six diterpenoids were unique in the metabolite profile of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> roots, namely: didehydrotanshinone IIa (25), acetyloxycryptotanshinone (26), isograndifoliol (27), grandifoliol (28), didehydroacetyloxycryptotanshinone (30), and ketoisogrndifoliol (32). An undetermined cryptotanshinone derivative (29) was found exclusively in 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> roots. Nine compounds were not determined in methanolic extracts of roots (2, 4, 13, 16, 22, 23, 24, 33, 36) out of which three were detected only in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> (2, 24, 36).
