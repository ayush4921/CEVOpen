<p>In roots, the first principal component explained 65.3% of the variation in the spectral data and the second, 10.2%. Samples of 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic>, represented by blue dots, were closely grouped on the right side of the plot, while on the left side (green dots), 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> samples occurred (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). The loadings plot revealed that these two groups were significantly positively correlated with particular compounds found in roots (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00112-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). According to the PC loadings, the contents of isograndifoliol (27), acetyloxycryptotanshinone (26), ketoisograndofoliol (32), oxocryptotanshinone (20) and grandifoliol (28) in 
 <italic>S. yangii</italic> roots and the presence of cryptotanshinone derivative (29), chrysoeriol 7-rutinoside (8), and hesperidin (7) in the roots of 
 <italic>S. abrotanoides</italic> were mostly responsible for their chemical differentiation and allowed distinguishing the root samples from the two analyzed 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species.
