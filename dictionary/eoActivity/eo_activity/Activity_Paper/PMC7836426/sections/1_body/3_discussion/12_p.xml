<p id="para0046">The antimicrobial activity of alkaloids has been extensively reviewed [
 <xref rid="bib0092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Recently, Özçelik et al., 
 <xref rid="bib0094" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref> published another comprehensive review on this subject. The review considered many alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids with antimicrobial activity and reported that bioactive alkaloids could be found within acridone-, aporphine-, benzophenanthridine-, bisbenzylisoquinoline-, indole-, isoquinoline-, piperidine-, protoberberine-, quinoline-, terpenoid- and steroid-type alkaloids. Flavonoid derivatives have also been reported to possess antiviral activity against a wide range of viruses such as HSV, HIV, Coxsackie B virus, coronavirus, cytomegalovirus, poliomyelitis virus, rhinovirus, rotavirus, poliovirus, sindbis virus, and rabies virus [

 <xref rid="bib0096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Phenolic compounds, polyphenols, steroids, terpenoids, other active phytochemicals, and their derivatives are common plant secondary metabolites that contain aromatic rings with 1 or several hydroxyl groups. For a wide range of viruses, several studies confirmed the abovementioned activity of several phenolic antiviral compounds such as curcumin, luteolin-7glucoside, epicatechin gallate, catechin, demethoxycurcumin, bavachinin, apigenin-7 glucoside, silvestrol, hypericin, psoralidin, mycophenolate mofetil, corylifol, and tomentin [

 <xref rid="bib0097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. According to Wink 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>, polyphenols are capable of binding easily with the lipoproteins of the virus envelope, which can prevent the viral invasion in host cells.
