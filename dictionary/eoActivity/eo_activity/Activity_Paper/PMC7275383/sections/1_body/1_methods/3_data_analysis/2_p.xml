<p id="Par27">The free listing of birds was analyzed using a cognitive salience index, the Sutrop index, which combines the frequency and the order of mention of a bird [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The index was calculated from the following formula: 
 <italic>S</italic> = 
 <italic>F</italic> / (
 <italic>N</italic>mP); where 
 <italic>F</italic> is the frequency of mention of each bird, 
 <italic>N</italic> is the total number of respondents, and mP the average position of mention of bird [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Calculations were performed with the Flares program (Free list analysis under R environment using Shiny).
