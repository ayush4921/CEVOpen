 <italic>Columbina inca</italic>, 
 <italic>Columbina passerina</italic> (Linnaeus, 1758) and 
 <italic>Zenaida asiatica</italic>) were mentioned as the most common birds for consumption (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), in addition to a species of woodpecker (
 <italic>Melanerpes hypopolius</italic> (Wagler, 1829)), which was mentioned less frequently, due to the difficulty of catching it.
