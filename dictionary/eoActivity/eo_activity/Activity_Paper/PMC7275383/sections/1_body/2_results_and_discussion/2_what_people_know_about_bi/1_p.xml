<p id="Par39">Local people of Zapotitlán Salinas continually interact with birds of their locality; in homegardens, in the squares and streets of the town, as well as in the cultivated and fallow agricultural areas, and in the secondary and primary forest areas. According to the daily life and productive activities that each villager performs, these interactions may differ in diversity, and the groups of birds that are more commonly used and managed. From these interactions, the local people of Zapotitlán interviewed recognized 62 morphospecies occurring in their territory, which belong to 26 families and 11 orders. The difference with respect the general inventory generated during the research can be explained because for local people several species of the same order or genus are not differentiated. Most birds have a local name, which may be related to bird characteristics like color and shape of the feathers, their song, movement, feeding habits, specific behaviors (during foraging or courtship, for example) among other ecological habits [

 <italic>Pyrocephalus rubinus</italic> (Boddaert, 1783), which is known as “rayito,” or “San Gabrielito.” Contrarily, several species of the same genus have the same name, such as 
 <italic>Catherpes mexicanus</italic> (Swainson, 1829), 
 <italic>Troglodytes aedon</italic> Vieillot, 1809, and 
 <italic>Thryomanes bewickii</italic> (Audubon, 1827), which are all called “saltapared.” People also recognize some species as varieties, such as orioles, three types of which are identified: “common oriole” (
 <italic>Icterus wagleri</italic> P. L. Sclater, 1857), “yellow oriole” (
 <italic>Icterus pustulatus</italic> (Wagler, 1829)), and “fine or Spanish oriole” (
 <italic>Icterus cucullatus</italic> Swainson, 1827) (see Additional file
