The perceived shortage is the main explanation that people give to the decrease in crops in recent years, a situation that has led to a gradual abandonment of agriculture activities in Zapotitlán Salinas.

Since the decree of the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve, in 1998, the capture and sale of ornamental birds was prohibited; given these norms, the change in bird capture activities was gradual and has been reflected in the decrease in the sale of ornamental birds outside of Zapotitlán Salinas. Therefore, the people have noticed the increase of some species; in addition, the decrease of others is perceived, which the villagers relate to the decrease of some species of fruit trees in the homegardens and in the food availability in the forests and hills</p>
