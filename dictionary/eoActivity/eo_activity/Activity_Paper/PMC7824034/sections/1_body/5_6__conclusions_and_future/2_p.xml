<p>Speedy identification of effective therapeutic measures against dengue and SARS-CoV has become a major challenge globally. Considering the fact that the development of new vaccines and synthetic drugs is highly time-consuming, it is therefore imperative to repurpose the alternative treatment or medications to suit the present situation. Alternative therapy from natural products seems to be capable of providing a valuable source for the swift discovery of antiviral drugs. The major challenge in the development of antiviral drugs that target specific viral proteins is the ability of the viruses to undergo rapid mutation during replication. Therefore, several aspects must be considered when evaluating the anti-dengue and anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties of medicinal herbs and pure compounds in terms of preparations, solvents, and techniques used for extraction. Many potent medicinal herbs reported here used polar solvents, which have been reported to aid in the attainment of the highest level of antiviral activity.</p>
