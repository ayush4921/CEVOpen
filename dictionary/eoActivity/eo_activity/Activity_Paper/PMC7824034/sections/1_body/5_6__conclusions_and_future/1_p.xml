<p>This review summarizes and updates various medicinal plants that are traditionally used to treat dengue and SARS-CoV-related infections, together with their pharmacological investigations against these viruses, using crude extracts or isolated/identified bioactive compounds. Many medicinal plants and pure compounds have shown promising activities even at clinical trials. However, many of the plants that are used traditionally for the infections are yet to be explored on their antiviral potentials. Extensive study is therefore needed to evaluate the potentials of these plants and their phytochemicals from in vitro to in vivo testing and then clinical studies.</p>
