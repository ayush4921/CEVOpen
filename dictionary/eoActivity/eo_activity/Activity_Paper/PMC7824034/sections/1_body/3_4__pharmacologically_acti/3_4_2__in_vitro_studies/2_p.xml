 <xref rid="B83-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Various medicinal plants investigated in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies against DENV infection are shown in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00042-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Generally, many medicinal plants extracted mostly with polar solvents such as water, methanol, and ethanol exhibit significant antiviral activity. We could therefore infer that these solvents are capable of extracting the antiviral compounds from any medicinal plants. Mechanistic antiviral studies of the plant extracts are still lacking. More studies need to be conducted to explore this aspect to combat DENV infection.
