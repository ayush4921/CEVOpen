<p>It was important to determine the particle size and charge of the synthesized AgNPs in aqueous solution prior to assessing their antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity. Particle size, surface charge, morphology, and particle composition are the major factors that determine the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> toxicity of AgNPs (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bhanumathi et al., 2017</xref>). A dynamic light scattering spectroscopy (DLS) analysis was conducted to measure particle size and charge in an aqueous solution. This technique allows for the rapid determination of particle size distribution and surface charge of nanoparticles in solution (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). Results of the DLS analysis revealed that the average particle sizes of the AgNPs synthesized from the three plant extracts were 62.72, 93.23, and 74.56 nm for 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> (SA-AgNPs), 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic> (GL-AgNPs), and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> (BR-AgNPs), respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A–C</xref>). Particle sizes &lt;100 nm have greater potential in biomedical applications, as the type of interaction that occurs between nanoparticles and cells is highly dependent on the size of the nanoparticle. Surface charge is another crucial aspect of nanoparticles that affects their ability to associate with or complex with macromolecules present on the surface or inside cells. Thus, the charge or Zeta potential of the AgNPs synthesized using the three different plant extracts was assessed to determine their potential to interact with biological macromolecules. Results indicated a charge of -19.9, -24.6, and -21.3 mV for the AgNPs synthesized using extracts of 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2A–C</xref>). Several studies have been previously reported on the particle size and charge of AgNPs that support our results (
