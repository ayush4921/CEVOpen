<p>Similar results were observed in the case of the synergistic antibiofilm activity where as-synthesized AgNPs were more potentially active than the results found when the respective plant extracts was added in different concentrations. The reduced activity with the addition of plant extracts reveals the presence of microbial growth promoting factors in the natural plant extracts, as well as little antagonistic activity. Hence, the phyto-synthesized AgNPs are more promising than the synergistic application for controlling biofilm formations. Against all the three bacteria (
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>), the respective AgNPs are more effective than the addition of respective plant extracts. The pure plant extracts were least active compared to the respective synthesized AgNPs. The lowest potential inhibition by the plant extracts reflects the presence of biofilm promoting entities. In the current study, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was least inhibited by the SA-extracts (14%) which implies the extracts were supporting the biofilm formations. In other extracts, like GL-extracts and BR-extracts, the inhibition rate was 29.06 and 35.23%, respectively. In the case of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, the inhibition was &gt;95% in the ratio of 3(AgNPs: plant extracts) whereas &lt;45% inhibition was observed in a 1:3 (AgNPs:plant extracts) ratio, which clearly showed least role of pure plant extracts in eradicating biofilm formation. The antibiofilm activity of AgNPs against 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> was studied extensively and reported the potentiality of AgNPs (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Martinez-Gutierrez et al., 2013</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Rolim et al. (2019)</xref> reported the antibiofilm activity of AgNPs against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> which supports our current results. However, the plant extract also has some potential of antimicrobial activity; these contain some microbial growth factors which help in growing, rather than inhibiting, the microbes. Hence, the AgNPs synthesized by the plant extracts were more promising than the sole plant extract and combination of plant extracts. The upcoming application of nanoparticles is highly promising as the uncontrolled spread of microbial contaminations is now a great threat worldwide.
