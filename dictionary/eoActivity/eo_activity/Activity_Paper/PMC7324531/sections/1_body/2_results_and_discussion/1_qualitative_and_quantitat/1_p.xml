<p>The qualitative and quantitative phytochemical examinations of the aqueous leaf extracts are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The qualitative phytochemical analysis revealed the existence of alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, phenolic, proteins, and saponins in all three plants (
 <italic>S. anacardium, G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>) but resin, steroids, and sterols were not detected. Glycoside was present only in 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> extract, whereas sugar was found in 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic>. The phytochemical study of the leaf extract of these three plants showed that flavonoids, tannins, phenolic compounds, proteins, and saponins were present in the extract, which may be the principal chemical constituents responsible for the synthesis of AgNPs. 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Shankar et al. (2003)</xref> reported the possible role of terpenoids from 
 <italic>Geranium</italic> leaf in the synthesis of nano-sized Ag particles. Polyols such as terpenoids, flavones, and polysaccharides in the 
 <italic>C. camphora</italic> leaf were reported to be the main cause of the bio-reduction of silver and chloroaurate ions (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). The quantitative phytochemical results supported the possibility of a greater potential for antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The plant extract possesses huge potential for providing natural chemicals for the reduction of complex metals to derive respective nanoparticles for diverse important applications.
