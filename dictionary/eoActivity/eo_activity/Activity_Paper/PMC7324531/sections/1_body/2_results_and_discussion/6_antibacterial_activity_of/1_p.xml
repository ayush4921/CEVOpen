<p>The bactericidal activity of AgNPs synthesized using the three different plant extracts was determined against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and revealed a dose-dependent relationship. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> illustrates the toxic activity of the plant synthesized AgNPs &lt;100 nm at different concentrations (10–100 μg/ml) against the Gram-positive bacterium, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and the Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Results indicate that the plant synthesized AgNPs can inhibit bacterial growth 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, relative to the growth of non-treated bacteria or the negative control. These data further indicate that the inhibition of bacterial growth increases with increasing concentrations of the AgNPs. Each species of bacteria was inhibited in their growth at their respective MIC value. The MIC values of the AgNPs synthesized from the three different plant extracts were calculated for each bacterial species. AgNPs exhibited excellent MIC (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values against the different species irrespective of the source plant that was used in their synthesis. The MICs (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of AgNPs synthesized using the leaf extract of 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic> was 43.94 ± 0.2μg/ml, 68.6 ± 0.5μg/ml, and 44.02 ± 0.3μg/ml against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. Concentrations of 70 μg/ml (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>), 100 μg/ml (
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>), and 80 μg/ml (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) resulted in &gt;99% inhibition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). Similar results were observed with AgNPs synthesized with 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> plant extract. The MICs (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of these AgNPs were 33.77 ± 0.2 μg/ml,12.9 ± 0.2 μg/ml, and 23.49 ± 0.2 μg/ml for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> derived AgNPs exhibited &gt; 99% inhibition at concentrations of 60 μg/ml (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>), 40 μg/ml (
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>), and 50 μg/ml (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6B</xref>). AgNPs synthesized using 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> plant extract also exhibited strong antibacterial activity against the test pathogens exhibiting MICs of 64.13 ± 0.3 μg/ml (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>), 12.90 ± 0.2 μg/ml (
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>), and 43.94 ± 0.2 μg/ml (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>). AgNPs synthesized with 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> plant extract exhibited &gt;99% inhibition at 90, 50, and 70 μg/ml, against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6C</xref>). A comparison of the obtained inhibitory activity indicated that AgNPs synthesized using 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic> plant extract were more active against the Gram-positive bacterium (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) while the AgNPs synthesized using 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> or 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> plant extracts exhibited stronger antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Although, AgNPs derived from plant extracts of all three plant species inhibited both Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria. AgNPs derived from 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> plant extract had the strongest antibacterial activity and was active against both types of bacteria. Therefore, we suggest that 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> plant extracts have the potential to be commercially used to synthesize AgNPs &lt; 100 nm. Apart from the antibacterial activity of the derived AgNPs, 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic> is also an important medicinal plant, containing alkaloids and polyphenols with high medicinal value, which further strengthens its value in the production of bioactive nanoparticles. The individual plant extracts were also separately analyzed for bactericidal activity to compare their activity with the activity of AgNPs synthesized from their respective plant extracts. Results indicated that all of the plant-extract-derived AgNPs have greater antibacterial activity then the use of their respective plant extracts alone, further confirming the values of using plant-derived AgNPs as antibiotic compounds against human bacterial pathogens.
