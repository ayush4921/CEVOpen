<p>Silver has been recognized as an anti-infection agent since ancient times. Extensive research has been conducted on silver ions and silver conjugated salts as potential antimicrobial and anti-biofilm agents. Although silver has been used as a therapeutic agent, silver ions exhibit a level of toxicity and have low efficacy due to their inactivation caused by easily complexing with other molecules and their precipitation with other interfering salts (
