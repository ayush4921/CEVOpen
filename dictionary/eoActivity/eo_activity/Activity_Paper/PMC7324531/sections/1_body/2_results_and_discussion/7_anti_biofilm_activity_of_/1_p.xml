<p>Silver nanoparticles have also been assayed for anti-biofilm activity against biofilm-forming bacteria. In the present study, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-biofilm activity of AgNPs was evaluated in a dose-dependent manner against the biofilm- forming bacteria 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> The individual species of bacteria were grown in 96-well microtiter plates for 24 h and then treatments of 10–100 μg/ml of the individually synthesized AgNPs were added to each well. Results of the assay revealed that the biosynthesized AgNPs inhibited biofilm formation by the bacterial species, relative to the negative control used in the experiment (

 <sub>50</sub> and all AgNPs, irrespective of which extract was used in their synthesis, exhibited an excellent MIC value against bio-film formation.
