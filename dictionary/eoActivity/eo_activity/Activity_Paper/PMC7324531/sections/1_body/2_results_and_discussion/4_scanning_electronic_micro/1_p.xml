<p>Scanning Electronic Microscope (SEM) is an invaluable tool for obtaining structural information about nanoparticles and was therefore used to characterize the size and morphology of the AgNPs synthesized in the present study. Results obtained from the analysis of SEM micrographs of the synthesized AgNPs indicated that the synthesized nanoparticles were distinct, uniform in shape, spherical, and well-separated. The average size of the particles ranged between 52 and 96 nm (
