<p>Potential antioxidant activity of leaf extracts of 
 <italic>S. anacardium, G. lanceolarium, and B. retusa</italic> was determined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazil (DPPH) assay with required modifications (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">McDonald et al., 2001</xref>). Various concentrations, such as 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/ml extracts, were taken for the study of DPPH scavenging activities. The results were expressed as percentage (%) radical scavenging activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was calculated and results were presented IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. The equivalent concentrations of ascorbic acid were taken as a positive control.
