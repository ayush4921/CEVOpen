<p>Comprehensive studies of antimicrobial resistance have revealed that bacterial infections that resist antibiotics are not due to free bacteria but rather to bacteria existing within a biofilm (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Biofilm-forming bacteria are resistant to conventional antimicrobials due to: (1) the inability of the antimicrobial to penetrate the biofilm, (2) evolution complex drug resistance properties, and (3) biofilm mediated inactivation or modification of antimicrobial enzymes (

Fortunately, nanoparticle-based antimicrobials have been developed and marketed to eradicate both planktonic and biofilm-forming antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Continuous research is being conducted to develop eco-friendly nanotechnologies utilizing natural phytochemicals to produce metal nanoparticle-based antimicrobials for the control of biofilm-forming pathogens.
