<p>The easiest and most convenient approach for the rapid synthesis of AgNPs, which has been used for decades, is by a chemical synthesis process. The chemical approach to AgNP synthesis, however, involves the use of several toxic reagents. As several metal nanoparticles, such as gold, platinum, and silver, are frequently used in ointments, creams, cosmetics, etc., that interface with human skin, methods of nanoparticle synthesis that have low toxicity and are eco-friendly need to be explored and developed (

Plantsâ€™ biomolecules are natural and typically exhibit low toxicity to living cells which makes the use of plant metabolites in the synthesis of AgNPs favorable (
