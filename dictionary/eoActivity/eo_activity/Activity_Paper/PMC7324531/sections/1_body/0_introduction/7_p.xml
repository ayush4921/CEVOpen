<p>In this regard, the objective of the current study was to explore the use of ethno-medicinally important plants, 
 <italic>S. anacardium</italic>, 
 <italic>G. lanceolarium</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Panda et al., 2016</xref>), for the synthesis of AgNPs utilizing secondary metabolites present in leaf extracts. The formation of AgNPs were monitored by microscopy and spectroscopy to evaluate the synthesis process, and the phytoconstituents most likely responsible for the synthesis of the AgNPs compounds were characterized using different qualitative tests. The phyto-mediated synthesized AgNPs were also screened for antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against the human pathogens, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Gram â€“ve), and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (Gram +ve) in order to assess their potential use in antimicrobial therapy.
