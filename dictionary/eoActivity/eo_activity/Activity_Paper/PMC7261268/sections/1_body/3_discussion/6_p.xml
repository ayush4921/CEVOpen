<p id="Par22">The biological functions of the naturally occurring HLF3s/HLF3l and HLF4a/HLF4b remain obscure. Whatever their real targets may be (if there are any at all), both genes have very likely evolved from a common ancestor that encoded a hirudin-like thrombin inhibitor. The general potency of hirudin-like factors to act as thrombin inhibitors like hirudin is obvious: HLF1, HLF2, HLF3, and HLF4 can quite easily be transformed from non-inhibitors into inhibitors by exchanging certain domains. The molecular techniques that we have applied to construct hybrids (e.g., gene synthesis or introduction of point mutations) may easily be mirrored by natural processes. Gene re-arrangement by recombination (Roberstson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1982</xref>) and exon shuffling (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) are only two of various potential mechanisms that are present in the genetic toolbox of every organism. The multiplicity of hirudins and hirudin-like factors in both European and Asian medicinal leeches may hence serve as excellent examples to illustrate and evaluate the mechanisms and outcomes of gene and genome evolution processes in general.
