<p id="Par19">But even with the “more suitable” N-terminus of HLF1V (IVYGP), neither HLF3l-G nor HLF4c displayed any anti-thrombin activity (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thrombin inhibition was only achieved with constructs containing the central globular domain of HLF1 instead of those of HLF3 and HLF4, giving rise to the hybrid factors HLF-Hyb3b/HLF-Hyb3c and HLF-Hyb4b/HLF-Hyb4c, respectively (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These observations strongly confirm the hypothesis (formulated based on the analysis of HLF1/HLF2-hybrids; Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>) that not only the N- and C-termini but also the central globular domains of hirudins and hirudin-like factors are of crucial importance for the ability of the respective molecules to inhibit thrombin.
