<p id="Par18">Both HLF3 and HLF4 may occur in two different splice variants each, namely HLF3l/HLF3s and HLF4a/HLF4b. None of these factors displayed a significant thrombin-inhibitory potency when tested in the thrombin-time assay. The low, but detectable thrombin inhibition by HLF4a cannot be satisfactorily explained at the moment and might be an artifact due to the fact that it was impossible to purify the factor by the standard procedure, but only following a different protocol (e.g., including resolubilization of inclusion bodies under denaturating conditions followed by a refolding step). The hirudin-like factors HLF1D (Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>) and HLF-Hyb4d (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) displayed no inhibitory activity on thrombin despite “suitable” central globular domains and C-terminal tails. The lack of inhibitory activities in both cases is hence most likely caused by the N-terminal five amino acid residues IDYEP. The same residues are present in HLF4a as well and should therefore consequently prevent its anti-thrombin activity.
