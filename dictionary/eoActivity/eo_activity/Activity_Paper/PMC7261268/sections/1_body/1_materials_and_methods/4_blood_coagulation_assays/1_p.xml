<p id="Par10">To verify the biological activity of purified HLFs, we performed the thrombin time test (TT; reference range 16.8–21.4 s) using a BFT II analyzer (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany). All steps followed the instructions outlined by the manufacturer. For the coagulation tests, all protein samples were diluted with dialysis buffer to reach final concentrations in the reaction assays of 3.2 μmol/l or 0.32 μmol/l, respectively. The desired amount of substrate was directly transferred into the cuvette immediately before the plasma was added. Dade® Ci-Trol® 1 (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) was used as standardized human plasma. The incubation of reaction mixtures was carried out at 37.4 °C. Measurements that lasted up to 300 s were stopped and declared as a complete inhibition of clot formation.</p>
