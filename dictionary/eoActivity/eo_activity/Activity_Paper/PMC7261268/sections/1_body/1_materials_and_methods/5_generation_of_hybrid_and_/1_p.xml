<p id="Par11">The hybrid variants of HLF3 and HLF4 were generated using the gene synthesis service of Synbio Technologies (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). All other HLF variants were generated by PCR using appropriate primers to incorporate alterations in the nucleotide sequences that lead to the desired alterations in the amino acid sequences. Table
