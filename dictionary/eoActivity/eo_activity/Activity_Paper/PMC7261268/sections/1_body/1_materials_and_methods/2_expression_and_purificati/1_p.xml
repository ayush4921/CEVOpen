<p id="Par7">The procedure to clone cDNAs encoding HLFs and hirudins, to express and purify the respective proteins, was previously described in detail (Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). Briefly, we applied a system developed by Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). The pQE30Xa vector encodes a factor Xa protease recognition site between the His-tag coding region on the 5′ side and the multiple cloning site on the 3′ side. Factor Xa protease treatment cleaves off the His-tag and results in a recombinant protein that is free of any vector-derived amino acids at the N-terminus.
