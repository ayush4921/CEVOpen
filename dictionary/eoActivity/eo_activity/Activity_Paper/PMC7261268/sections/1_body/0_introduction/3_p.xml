<p id="Par4">HLF3 and HLF4 were identified in specimens of European medicinal leeches. HLF3 occurs in two different splice variants (short form: HLF3s or long form: HLF3l), whereas for HLF4, two different splice variants (HLF4a and HLF4b) could be predicted but only mRNA for HLF4a has been found yet (Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>). In both cases, the different splice events occur at the junction between the third exon and the fourth exon and hence do not affect the N-termini or the central globular domains but change the amino acid composition and the lengths of the C-terminal tails. HLF3s and HLF3l predominantly differ in the length of the C-terminal tail and hence the molecular masses (4.17 kDa vs. 6.06 kDa), but the isoelectric points (pI values) are almost identical (9.38 vs. 9.27). The N-terminal five amino acid residues (IVFKP) and the central globular domain of HLF3 are almost identical to the one of HLF2. In contrast, HLF4a and HLF4b differ both in length and composition of the C-terminal tail and hence the pI values (8.30 vs. 4.46), but only slightly in molecular masses (5.30 kDa vs. 5.80 kDa). Interestingly, HLF3l and HLF4b comprise acidic C-terminal tails, a characteristic structural feature of hirudins (Dodt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1984</xref>; Scacheri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1993</xref>). The N-terminal five amino acid residues of HLF4 (IDYEP) are identical to HLF1D, a natural HLF1 variant without thrombin-inhibitory activity. The central globular domain of HLF4 is similar in size to HLF2 and HLF3 (length of 30 amino acid residues) but is slightly more acidic (pI value of 6.10).
