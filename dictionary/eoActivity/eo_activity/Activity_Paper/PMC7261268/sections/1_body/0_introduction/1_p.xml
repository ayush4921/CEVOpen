<p id="Par2">The saliva of hematophagous leeches comprises a complex mixture of bioactive molecules (Ascenzi et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>; Hildebrandt and Lemke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>). To date, merely a handful of these factors are functionally characterized and only the thrombin-inhibitor hirudin found its way from bench to bedside (Becker and Cannon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1994</xref>; Greinacher and Warkentin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>). The hirudin-like factors (HLFs) represent a recently described subclass of compounds derived from the salivary glands of medicinal leeches of the genera 
 <italic>Hirudo</italic> and 
 <italic>Hirudinaria</italic> (Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>; Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>). HLFs comprise structural features that are characteristic for hirudins (e.g., six cysteine residues within a central globular domain and a common gene structure composed of four exons and three introns) but may considerably differ in biochemical properties like molecular weight (MW) and isoelectric point (pI value). In previous works, we have described the purification and functional characterization of HLF1 (originating from 
 <italic>Hirudo medicinalis</italic>) (Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>) and HLF5, 6, and 8 (originating from 
 <italic>Hirudinaria manillensis</italic>) (Lukas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>), respectively. While HLF1 and HLF6 did not exhibit any measurable anti-coagulatory activities, both HLF5 and HLF8 did.
