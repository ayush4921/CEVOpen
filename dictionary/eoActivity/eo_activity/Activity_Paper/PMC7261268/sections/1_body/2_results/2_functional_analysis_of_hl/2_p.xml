<p id="Par14">As already outlined above, the N-termini and central globular domains of HLF2 and HLF3 are almost identical (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). According to previous investigations, the presence of the central globular domain of HLF2 renders HLF hybrids unable to inhibit thrombin (Müller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). We hence constructed three different hybrids of the highly active thrombin inhibitor HLF1V and HLF3l: HLF-Hyb3a (N- and C-termini of HLF1V fused to the central globular domain of HLF3), HLF-Hyb3b (N- and C-termini of HLF3l fused to the central globular domain of HLF1V), and HLF-Hyb3c (N-terminus and central globular domain of HLF1V fused to the C-terminal tail of HLF3l) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Again, all three hybrids were expressed, purified, and functionally tested. Whereas HLF-Hyb3a displayed no anti-thrombin activity, HLF-Hyb3b and HLF-Hyb3c clearly did, at least when tested at the high concentration of 3.2 μmol/l (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Hence, integration of the central globular domain of HLF1V converted the previously inactive HLF3l to a thrombin inhibitor. Interestingly, the inhibitory potency of HLF-Hyb3b (containing the N-terminus of HLF3) was much higher compared to HLF-Hyb3c (containing the N-terminus of HLF1V).
