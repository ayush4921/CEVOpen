<p id="Par13">The cDNAs of HLF3l and HLF3s are splice variants of the same gene and encode putative proteins with identical N-termini and central globular domains, but different C-terminal tails. Interestingly, the N-termini (IVFKP) are different from both the hirudin variant HV1 (VVYTD) and the hirudin-like factor HLF1V (IVYGP) (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We constructed variants of both HLF3l and HLF3s and replaced the basic amino acid residue lysine at position 4 with a glycine residue as in HLF1V (HLF3l-G and HLF3s-G) or the proline residue at position 5 with an aspartic acid residue as in HV1 (HLF3l-D and HLF3s-D) (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All six variants of HLF3 were expressed, purified, and functionally tested as described in “
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>.” However, none of the variants exhibited anti-thrombin activity at final concentrations of 3.2 μmol/l (or 1.9 μmol/l for HLF3s) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; data not shown for the HLF3s-variants).
