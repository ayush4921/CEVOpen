<p id="para0045">Vitamin A is an essential fat-soluble vitamin which has a major involvement in regulating vision, growth and maturity as well as protection of the mucosal and epithelium integrity of the human body (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). It has a crucial participation in elevating the immunomodulatory responses and dogmatic functions in humoral as well as cellular responses. The Vitamin A supplements given to the infants with measles and rabies showed impending improvement (2.1 times) in antibiotic response in association with the vaccinations (

 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Aglipay et al. (2017)</xref>, revealed that supplementation with high dose of vitamin D (2000 IU/day) in contrast to a standard dose (400 IU/day) had no significant effect on the viral infection in the upper respiratory track, however the one third of the population was found to have vitamin D levels less than 30 ng/ml. Similarly, another study suggests vitamin D supplementation with influenza vaccine resulted in enhancement in the levels of TGF-β in the plasma which further indicated that vitamin D directs the lymphocytes polarization towards the tolerogenic immune response (

 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">Abu-Mouch et al., 2011</xref>) and HCV genotype 2-3 (
 <xref rid="bib0167" ref-type="bibr">Nimer and Mouch, 2012</xref>). Another report which suggests antiviral capability of Vitamin D was elucidated by 
 <xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al. (2020)</xref>. It was further affirmed that Vitamin D was potent in reducing the hazards associated with viral pandemics. The high dose of Vitamin D reduced the hazard of several chronic ailments such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancers and respiratory tract infection. Grant and co-workers, additional revealed that vitamin D lowers the risk to respiratory tract infection by sustaining tight junction, decline in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and killing the envelope of virus via induction of defensins and cathelicidin. Consequently, the risk of cytokine storm is lowered which prevents pneumonia.
