<p id="para0055">Due to the ongoing disaster of COVID-19, there is a pressing need for the discovery of alternative remedial measures. There is a wide scope of herbal medicines that have been used since traditional times. They have been considered as potent clinical agents against wide array of viral diseases due to their anti-viral properties. These natural products of Ayurveda are being tested for treating COVID-19. Basically, these formulations are comprised of huge number of phytochemicals such as terpenoids, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, polyphenols, saponins, polysaccharides, proteins, lipids and peptides that possess myriad of functions against viral invasion, penetration, replication, expression, assembly and release. Moreover, medicinal plants and their natural ingredients proved to be the most promising alternatives to prevent or cure the infection and spread of this disease since its outbreak. However, they are still being tested under

In the present review, we have elaborated the potential role of herbal formulations to treat COVID-19 through summarising the ongoing trials of plants and their products against this deadly virus. Although, the investigations for evaluation of different plant genera as anti SARS-CoV-2 agents, are insufficient. But research is in the pipeline to untangle their potential positive aspect and we expect these studies to be conducted in a more elaborated manner in future. Yet, many scientists are still engaged in these studies to develop a suitable antidode for this virus. The future possibilities upholds the fact that by combining these studies with effective technology and testing we can demonstrate their role in blocking the life-cycle of this virus, protein denaturation of receptor proteins and role of certain proteases enzymes could be studied.
