<p id="para0031">Chymotrypsin a bioactive compound with activity similar to protease is an approved target in novel designing of inhibitors of coronavirus. TCS, India conducted a recent survey on 31 molecules out of a total of 1600000 molecules identified which act as efficient protease inhibitors against COVID-19. One such imperative bioactive dipeptite is Aurantiamide, a plant derivative extracted from
