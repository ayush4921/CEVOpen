<p id="para0025">The triterpenes are composed of 6 isoprene units and with squalene as a prototype and are diversely occurrence in plant species (
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Petr et al., 2006</xref>). They play a vital role in modulation of cellular metabolism, specifically the biosynthesis of sterols and have a significant level of antiviral activity (
 <xref rid="bib0137" ref-type="bibr">Malinowska et al., 2013</xref>). Various triterpenes have been reported to have effect against HSV1 and HSV2 these include dammaradienol, dammarenediol-II, dammarenolic acid, hydroxyhopanone, hydroxydammarenone-I, shoreic acid, ursonic acid, hydroxyoleanonic lactone and eichlerianic acid (

This RNA strand acts as an RNA messenger, when it transmits into a cell it stimulates the synthesis of two polyproteins which are further composed of a novel replication and transmission complexes that regulate the synthesis of RNA, structural proteins and enhance the activity of protease enzyme. Here protease enzyme has a significant participation in fragmentation of the polyprotein (

 <xref rid="bib0096" ref-type="bibr">John et al., 2015</xref>). Apart from designing and chemical synthesizing of protease inhibitor, one of the most recent therapeutic strategies to cure viral infection is to identify the inhibitors of these enzymes in natural products and compounds. Amongst these, terpenoids have a specific significance due to fact of diverse availability in plants and microorganism and low inhibitory concentration i.e. IC50. The terpenoids are the chief secondary metabolites present in more than 36,000 species accounted so far (
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">Augustin et al., 2011</xref>). These secondary metabolites have multifaceted therapeutic application viz. anti-cancerous (

 <xref rid="bib0168" ref-type="bibr">Nosrati and Behbahani, 2015</xref>), antioxidant (del Cerman et al., 1995) and antibacterial (
