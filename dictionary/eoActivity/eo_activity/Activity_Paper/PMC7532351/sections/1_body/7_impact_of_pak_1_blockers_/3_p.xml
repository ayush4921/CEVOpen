<p id="para0052">Inevitably, the conventional and recently accepted product propolis, obtained from bees have been known since ancient times. It is formerly obtained from honey-bee extract via honey-bees feeding the buds of poplar and willow trees, thereby, mixing their saliva into it to form hexagonal bee-hives in order to protect their larval species against many pathogenic organisms. This product synthesised is called as propolis and is regarded as herbal medicine with anti-viral properties. In contemporary world, propolis is identified in possessing anti-cancer characteristics due to the presence of an ingredient CAPE (Caffeic Acid Phenyl Ester) involved in down-regulation of RAC for PAK1 inhibition respectively (

For instance, the anti-cancer element in Brazilian propolis is Artepillin C (ARC), while in sub-tropical regions of Taiwan and Okinawa, polyphenols namely, Nymphaeols act as direct inhibitors of PAK1 (

Ever since, has been elucidated that, PAK1 tends to cause cancers, viral diseases like HIV, Hepatitis, pappiloma, influenza, ebola, SARS and corona virus along with immune system suppression of hosts, henceforth, propolis would be quintessential in blocking COVID/coronavirus curbed fibrosis in respiratory tract and boosting the immunity of an individual (

Regardless of this pre-formed formulation in the market, it could not be used against COVID-19 eruption, due to paucity of its stock in market place. Moreover, the available stocks are being predominantly used for treating patients with deadly cancers and prolonged treatment of genetic brain disorder, NF tumers (Neuro Fibromatosis Type 1, 2) (

Nonetheless, this feature could be surmounted by triggering the cell membrane permeability via conversion their esters into 1, 2, 3-triazolyl esters that are thousand times more powerful than ARC or caffeine esters (

Further, it also owns similarity with other anti-PAK1 actions like anti-cancer, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immuno-boosters etc. Therefore, it is pertinent to mention here that melatonin, a commonly available sleeping pill could be utilized against coronaviral infections. Currently, many investigations are being carried out to high-light the significance of melatonin as another therapeutic resort or COVID-19 adjuvant (

Furthermore, glucocorticoid hormone 'ciclesonide' is another choice to cure different inflammatory disorders and it has been widely commercialised under the brand name of Alvesco. It has been officially approved since 1990 and been widely associated with treating adults as well as children. The molecular mechanism forming the basis for anti-inflammatory action is based on the potential of PAK1-blockers that lays the foundation for its pathway. Majorly, it works according to two basic reasons, firstly, inflammation is not possible without PAK1 and PAK1-null mutant in mice depicted no inflammation (
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2009</xref>). Secondly, ciclesonide inhibited PAK-1 regulated proliferation of lung cancer in A541 cell lines as well as in immuno-deficient mice (
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, this hormone was clinically reported to block PAK1 replication and pathogenesis (lung fibrosis) caused by COVID-19 respectively (
