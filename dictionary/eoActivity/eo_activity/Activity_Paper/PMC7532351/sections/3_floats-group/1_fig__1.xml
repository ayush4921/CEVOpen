  <p>Schematic Presentation of COVID-19 Binding to Host Cells, Invasion, Replication, Assemblage, Release and Infection Along with the Associated Host and Viral Factors. Fig. illustrates the origin of coronavirus from bats; the viral structure comprises of spike proteins that enable attachment and virus is enveloped in nature for protection as well as facilitation of viral entry; the viral particles bind onto ACE2 receptors of host cells; clathrin is associated with coating membranes for endocytosis from the plasma membrane; viral particles are invaded and fused followed by replication; assembly and release of viral particles occurs to initiate the infection process
