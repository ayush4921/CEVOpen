<p>Our hypothesis was confirmed, as the plant extracts indeed possess anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic properties (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00959-f004">Figure 4</xref>). We also identified selected phytochemicals behind these properties: anti-diabetic properties were associated with kaempferol, linalool, citronellal, and humulene (
