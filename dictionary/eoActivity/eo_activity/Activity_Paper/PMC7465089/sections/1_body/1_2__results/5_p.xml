<p>It is well acknowledged that diabetes mellitus (DM) pathogenesis is linked to oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Although many phytochemicals from 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> have anti-oxidant properties (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00959-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), to the best of our knowledge, no research on its anti-diabetic properties has been performed so far. Thus, we investigated the anti-diabetic activity of bulbs and leaves of 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic>. For this purpose, we treated adipocytes with an ethanolic extract from 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> bulbs and leaves, while the glucose uptake of the adipocytes was estimated after these treatments, as previously. 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> extracts increased glucose uptake in 3T3-L1A cells better than insulin. Importantly, the anti-diabetic activity of leaf extracts was higher than those from bulb extracts and of insulin, which was used as a positive control (

 <italic>L. candidum</italic> were tested in this experiment. As seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00959-f003">Figure 3</xref>, kaempferol, linalool, citronellal, and humulene significantly increased glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
