<p>Ethanolic extracts were prepared from leaves and bulbs of 
 <italic>L. candidum</italic> as described previously [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Plant tissues were homogenized, incubated at room temperature for 48 h in ethanol, centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was evaporated by lyophilization. The pellet was dissolved in a minimal amount of 95% ethanol (0.5 mL) and diluted with water to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL.
