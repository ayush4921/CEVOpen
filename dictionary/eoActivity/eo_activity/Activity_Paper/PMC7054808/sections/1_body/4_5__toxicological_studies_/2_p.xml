<p>Different doses (1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 mg/kg body weight) of ethanolic leaf extract do not display any behavioural, biochemical, haematological, and histopathological variations in the tested Swiss albino mice and control after 15 days of oral administration [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Hydroethanolic leaf extract increased the body weight, blood level, liver homogenates, and serum index after proper monitoring of the administered rats every 48 h for 26 days. Haematological parameters assessed displayed dose-dependent response, however, no significant variation was observed in liver histopathology [

 <italic>S. alata</italic> leaf extract significantly reduces alkaline phosphate, uric acid, globulin, liver and kidney body weight ratio, urea, phosphate ions, bilirubin, potassium ions, serum concentrations of albumin, creatinine, gamma glutamyl transferase, alanine transaminases, and aspartate in the liver and kidney of pregnant rats after periodic observation for 18 days. This led to variation in serum enzymes, excretory, and secretory functions of liver and kidney of the test organisms [
