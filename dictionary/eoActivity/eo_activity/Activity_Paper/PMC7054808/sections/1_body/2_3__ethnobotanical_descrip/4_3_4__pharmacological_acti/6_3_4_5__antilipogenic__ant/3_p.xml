<p>The antidiabetic potency of acarbose, n-butanol, and ethyl acetate fractions of methanolic 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> leaf extract was assessed via inhibitory carbohydrate digestion mechanism. The antidiabetic drug (acarbose) significantly inhibits 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase with inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 107.31 ± 12.31 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml). n-Butanol and ethyl acetate fractions displayed inhibitory activities of IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 25.80 ± 2.01 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml and IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 2.95 ± 0.47 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml, respectively, due to kaempferol 3-O-gentiobioside analysed by HPLC and Combiflash chromatography [

 <italic>α</italic>-Amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory potential of acetone, hexane, and ethyl acetate leaf extracts of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> was assessed via Lineweaver–Burk plot. Acetone extract significantly inhibited 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.41 mg/mL), while hexane displayed strong inhibition against 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.85 mg/mL). n-Hexane substantially reduces (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) postprandial blood glucose in sucrose-induced rats after 2 h of treatment [
