<p>The antibacterial potentials of medicinal herbs are appraised using zone of inhibition (ZOI) or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antibacterial potential of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> was assessed against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), extended spectrum beta-lactamase, and carbapenemase-resistant. Enterobacteriaceae was isolated from infectious patients, via Mueller–Hinton broth via the microdilution technique. The extract showed significant activities at 512 mg/ml due to the flavonoids, quinones, tannins, sterols, alkaloids, and saponins analysed [

 <italic>S. alata</italic> leaves collected from an Indian aboriginal tribe, displayed significant ZOI of 21 to 27 mm against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, obtained from infected patients, when subjected to ASTs via Kirbye Bauer's disc diffusion assay (KBDD) [
