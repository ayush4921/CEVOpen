<p>Based on this review, further studies on 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> have become evident. Most studies focused on lipid-soluble and volatile components; however, appraisals on metabolites prepared in hydrophilic medium are deficient. Most phytochemical studies of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic> focused on leaves, stems, and flowers, though study on seeds and roots are lacking. Many therapeutic appraisals have been investigated in cell and animal experiments; still, there remain important tasks. These include secondary metabolites dictating the pharmacological activities are not well stated; relatively, few studies analytically appraised the mechanisms of action of secondary metabolites; systemic toxicological studies remain ambiguous. The phytochemical appraisals revealed there is a variation in some metabolites investigated due to geographical and climatic factors. This gives room for qualitative approach to authenticate the metabolites in this plant. The plant secondary metabolites contributed to the pronounced wound healing and antibacterial and antifungal activities [

 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Industrially, the plant is a key ingredient in detergents (foaming and surface active agents), molluscicides and pesticides. Summarily, comprehensive ethnobiological and pharmacological activities of 
 <italic>S. alata</italic>, limitations, and future prospects were explored which could present novel research directions.
