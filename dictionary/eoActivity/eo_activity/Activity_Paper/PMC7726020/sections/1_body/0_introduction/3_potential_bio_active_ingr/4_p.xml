<p>In addition, jujube was reported to contain numerous minerals, e.g., iron and vitamin. About 0.48 mg iron and 69 mg vitamin C per 100 g of fresh fruit were reported (

 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">USDA, 2012</xref>). Thus, the daily intake of jujube could increase our dietary iron and vitamin, as to prevent anemia due to deficiency of iron or vitamin C. Moreover, cAMP was found to have high abundance in jujube, and surprisingly this content was much higher than other horticultural fruits (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Hanabusa et al., 1981</xref>). It is well accepted that increasing cAMP level can stimulate protein kinase A and, subsequently, which phosphorylates CREB (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Chi and Zhang, 2009</xref>). Thus, it is supposed that the cAMP in the jujube may account for its role on HIF (hypoxia inducible factor)-dependent EPO induction.
