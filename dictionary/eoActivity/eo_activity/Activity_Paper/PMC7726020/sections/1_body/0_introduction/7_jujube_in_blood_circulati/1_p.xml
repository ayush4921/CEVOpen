<p>Blood is circulating within the blood vessels, and the effects of jujube in blood circulation are summarized here. The pre-incubation of jujube extract (30, 100, and 300 mg/ml) for 5 min at 37°C in platelet-rich plasma was reported to suppress collagen (2 mg/ml)-, thrombin (0.4 U/ml)-, and arachidonic acid (100 mM)-induced aggregation of platelets (

In animal model, angiotensin II was intravenously injected into rats to induce acute hypertension, which characterized by cardiovascular parameters, i.e., notably elevated systolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure, as well as the decline of heart rate (HR) compared with control group. Co-treatment with ethyl acetate fraction (150 and 300 mg/kg), or aqueous fraction (150 and 300 mg/kg), of jujube extract restored the cardiovascular parameters (

 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Mohebbati et al. (2018)</xref> reported protective effect of jujube extract on hypertensive rats. The rats were treated with hydroalcoholic extracts of jujube at various concentrations (from 100 to 400 mg/kg) for four weeks, and then L-NAME (10 mg/kg) was injected intravenously into rats to induce hypertension. The results showed that jujube extract attenuated blood pressure and mean arterial pressure in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats (

Betulinic acid, found in Zizyphi Spinosi Semen and jujube, possessed combined properties of inducing endothelial nitric oxide synthase and decreasing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. In human endothelial cells treated with betulinic acid, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide production were robustly increased (
