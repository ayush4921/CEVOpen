 <p id="Par1">This study aims to provide a simple framework to identify wild food plants with potential for popularization based on local knowledge and perception. To this end, we also characterized the distribution of this knowledge in the socio-ecological system. We developed the study in the rural settlement Dom Hélder Câmara in northeastern Brazil. The species with the greatest potential for popularization considering the attributes accessed from local knowledge and perception were 
  <italic>Psidium guineense</italic> Sw., 
  <italic>Genipa americana</italic> L., 
  <italic>Xanthosoma sagittifolium</italic> (L.) Schott and 
  <italic>Dioscorea trifida</italic> L.f. However, the high variation in local knowledge on wild food plants suggests that species that are not frequently cited can also be promising. The absence of age or gender-related knowledge patterns indicates that studies for prospecting wild food plants in similar socioecological contexts need to reach the population as a whole, rather than focusing on a specific group.
