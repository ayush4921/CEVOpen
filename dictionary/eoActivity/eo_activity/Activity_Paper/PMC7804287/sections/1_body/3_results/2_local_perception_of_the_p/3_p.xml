<p id="Par40">The plants that obtained the highest averages for commercial potential were 
 <italic>D. trifida</italic> and 
 <italic>Genipa americana</italic> L., while the lowest average was attributed to an unidentified plant from the Myrtaceae family, known locally as 
 <italic>goiabinha</italic>. Many of the wild food plants (especially the seven species with the highest score for commercial potential) are already commercialized by the interviewees in agroecological street markets in the capital. However, in most cases, plants are only offered on demand, that is, when the customer orders the product, usually in the previous week.
