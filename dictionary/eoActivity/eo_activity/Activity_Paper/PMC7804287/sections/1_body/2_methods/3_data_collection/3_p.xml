<p id="Par22">After the interviewees completed their lists, they indicated the part(s) of the plant(s) that are used as food. We used a five-point Likert scale so that participants could assign scores for each plant according to the following parameters: intensity of consumption, commercial potential, taste, nutritional potential, medicinal potential, absence of adverse effects, temporal availability of the plant’s part used as food, spatial availability of the plant’s part used as food, ease of collection and ease of propagation. To assist the interviewees, we used common terms when referring to the attributes and each point (from one to five) corresponded to a pre-established qualification (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We chose to debug the evaluations by attribute, instead of simply asking about the species with the greatest potential in general, because this detail would allow a targeted prospecting (for example, in the search for functional foods it would be relevant to obtain specific information about the perceived medicinal potential).
