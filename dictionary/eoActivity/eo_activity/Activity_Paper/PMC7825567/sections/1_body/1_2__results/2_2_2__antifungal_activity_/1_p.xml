<p>We next determined the growth inhibitory effect of α-Cyperone against 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> using the Bioscreen-C growth monitor where the fungal growth rate was recorded at 30 min intervals. At least two different concentrations were used. Control (dimethyl sulfoxide, [DMSO] solvent only) wells were also included in parallel. Results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00051-f002">Figure 2</xref>a suggests that α-Cyperone inhibited the 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> completely at a 125 µg/mL concentration. The reduced inhibitory concentration may probably be due to the growth conditions involving mild shaking (10 s) of the plates in the Bioscreen-C instrument before registering the absorbance every 30 min. To determine if α-Cyperone is fungicidal or fungistatic, an aliquot of 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> and 
 <italic>Crypt. neoformans</italic> cells from the MIC determination wells were serially diluted, and spot tested on agar medium. The results indicate that α-Cyperone was fungicidal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00051-f002">Figure 2</xref>b) for both fungi. There were no growth of fungi from α-Cyperone treated cells on yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) agar.
