<p>Unlike 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> sp forms a capsule, a major virulence factor of this fungal meningitis pathogen. To visualize capsules better and to evaluate the effect of α-Cyperone without inhibiting the fungal growth, we used a low dose of α-Cyperone in capsule-inducing growth conditions. After India Ink exclusion staining, capsules were visualized under a microscope, and images were recorded. Results from this experiment revealed a significant reduction in capsule size in α-Cyperone treated samples (
