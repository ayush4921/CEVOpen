<p>Antifungal synergy was tested on 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> using the checkerboard titration method. Fluconazole and α-Cyperone were diluted at different concentrations in buffered RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 50 mM glucose. Fluconazole concentrations between 0.24 µg/mL to 62.5 µg/mL, and α-Cyperone concentrations from 7.8 µg/mL to 500 µg/mL were used. Two-fold serial dilutions of fluconazole were performed going left to right on a 96-well plate with two-fold dilutions of α-Cyperone being performed going from the top to the bottom of the plate. The far-right column was used as an α-Cyperone control, while the bottom row was used as a fluconazole control. The control columns were then compared to the MIC of the two compounds being used together in order to calculate the FICI as described [
