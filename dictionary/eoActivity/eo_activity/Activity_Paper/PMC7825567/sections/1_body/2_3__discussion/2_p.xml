<p>In this study, we report the EO α-Cyperone as an antifungal agent that inhibits the growth of various human fungal pathogens, albeit at a higher MIC. α-Cyperone is a major component in the 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> plant rhizome [

 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-10-00051" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Rhizomes are underground vegetative propagules that confront against various microbes/pathogens around them constantly in the soil and hence they are expected to contain several antimicrobial compounds. This plant rhizome (or tuber) contains hundreds of phytochemicals including several types of EO. While α-Cyperone is the major component and showed strong antifungal activity against human fungal pathogens, it did not show antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, at least under the conditions or doses tested in this study (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-10-00051-f005">Figure 5</xref>). It is possible that the concentration used in the disc may not be sufficient to inhibit the bacterial growth. In general, the combination of different antimicrobial compounds exerts a stronger effect than their individual components. Some of the earlier studies conducted with total or crude extracts from 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> showed antibacterial or antifungal activities ([
