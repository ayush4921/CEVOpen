<p id="Par39">It is easy to see from the name of indigo naturalis that this plant originated in India. The earliest literature records that indigo naturalis is abundant in Caoguo (now located in Afghanistan) and Turan (now located in Kazakhstan). Persians use indigo to dye their hair, and Chinese women use it to paint their eyebrows. In 
 <italic>Natural History</italic>, Pliny mentions that indigo naturalis from the East was used by ancient Romans as paint, applied around the eyes as a cosmetic, or used as medicine, to promote wound healing. Since the Tang Dynasty, indigo naturalis has been used as a drug with remarkable therapeutic effects on fever, hemoptysis, convulsions in children, oral ulcers and sore throat. The earliest medical records in China appeared in the 
 <italic>Theory of Medicinal Properties</italic> (Tang Dynasty, 627 A.D.). Later, it was included in many other famous medicinal books, including 
 <italic>Kaibao Materia Medica</italic> (Song Dynasty, 973 A.D.), 
 <italic>Materia Medica Yanyi</italic> (Song Dynasty, 1116 A.D.), and 
 <italic>Compendium of Materia Medica</italic> (Ming Dynasty, 1590 A.D.). Indigo naturalis is indicated for various kinds of bleeding syndromes, such as hemoptysis and epistaxis, and its powder can be dipped with sterilized cotton and stuffed into the nasal cavity to stop bleeding. Indigo naturalis also can be used to cure oral diseases, such as a swollen, sore throat, ulcers, swelling, pain, and rottenness of mouth and tongue. In 
 <italic>Supplements to Commentarieson the Synopsis of the Golden Chamber</italic>, it is used in a powder that is blown into the infected region. In addition to its use as a topical drug, indigo naturalis has been used in the past to treat convulsions and epilepsy in children. To increase its clinical effect, indigo naturalis is usually used in combination with other Chinese herbs, such as Gypsum Fibrosum, Bezoar, Snakegourd Seed and Radix Bupleuri.
