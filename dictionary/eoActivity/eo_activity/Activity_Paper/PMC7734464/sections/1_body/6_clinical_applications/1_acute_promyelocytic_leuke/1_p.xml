<p id="Par49">APL is a common malignant disease in the blood system and characterized by abnormal coagulation function and acute promyelocytosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. All trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic therapies are the most widely used therapies for APL, which has serious adverse reactions, high toxicity and relapse rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Indigo naturalis alone has no effect on APL, but indirubin in indigo naturalis could enhance the inhibition of arsenic disulfide in realgar on the proliferation and apoptosis of diffuse large celllymphoma cells and promote the transport of arsenic disulfide to APL cells, thus enhancing the degradation and treatment effect of PML-RAR α mediated by arsenic disulfide and accelerating the apoptosis of NB4 cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Clinical studies showed that the relapse rate of APL was 12.90% and the total mortality rate was 6.45% by alternately using chemotherapy and realgar-indigo naturalis formula (RIF), mainly consist in realgar and indigo naturalis. Compared with ATRA therapy, there was no significant difference in blood parameters [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. It should be noted that patients with RIF may have adverse reactions such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and rash, but there are no serious adverse reactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In non-high-risk APL clinical trial, the results showed that oral RIF plus ATRA has the same efficacy as intravenous arsenic trioxide plus ATRA and can replace the latter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The adverse reactions of the two therapies were compared. It was found that liver aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase concentration increased in 9% patients with RIF plus ATRA and 6% patients with arsenic trioxide plus ATRA, and grade 2–3 infection occurred in 14% patients with RIF plus ATRA and 23% patients with arsenic trioxide plus ATRA. In the arsenic trioxide-ATRA group, there are two patients died during induction therapy. In children with APL, the 5-year event-free survival of RIF group is 100%, as well as intravenous arsenic trioxide after an average follow-up of 3 years. The adverse reactions were mild, but the hospitalization time of RIF was significantly lower than that of intravenous arsenic trioxide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The above studies show that indigo naturalis is a potential adjuvant drug for treating APL.
