<p id="Par25">Indigo naturalis is a dried powder or paste processed from the stems and leaves of 
 <italic>Baphicacanthus cusia</italic> (Nees) Bremek. (family Acanthaceae), 
 <italic>Polygonum tinctorium</italic> Ait. (family Polygonaceae) and 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> Fort. Initially, indigo naturalis was used as a primitive dye in ancient India and then introduced into China through Persia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In recent years, indigo naturalis has also been found to be used in the treatment of cancer, especially indirubin and tryptanthrin have obvious inhibitory effects on various cancers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The discovery of these bioactivities provided positive support for the clinical applications of indigo naturalis. In this manuscript, we reviewed the manufacturing process, chemical composition, traditional applications, pharmacological mechanisms and clinical applications of indigo naturalis, which can provide comprehensive and detailed references to related researchers and contribute to the further development and clinical applications of indigo naturalis.
