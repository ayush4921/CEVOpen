<p id="Par46">Malignant tumor has become one of the major diseases threatening human beings. It is urgent to find drugs with high selectivity, small side effects and strong curative effect. Among numerous pharmacological actions of indigo naturalis, the antitumor effect is of great interest. Indirubin is of importance in the antitumor effects of indigo naturalis. In recent years, indirubin in indigo naturalis has attracted more and more attention in the field of anti-tumor. It has significant antiproliferative activity and is a powerful apoptosis inducer for a variety of tumor cells, such as cervical cancer, liver cancer and lymphoma cell lines [

 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> and realgar, was used to treat human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The complete remission rate of APL patients with Realgar-indigo naturalis was 96.7–98%, and the 5-year overall survival rate was 86.88% [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] observed the effects of tetrasulfide (A) in realgar, indirubin (I) in indigo naturalis and tanshinone IIA (T) in 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> in vivo and in vitro. They found that compared with single component or dual drug combination, ATI can increase the ubiquitination/degradation of promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor 
 <italic>α</italic> (RAR
 <italic>α</italic>) oncoprotein, enhance the reprogramming of myeloid differentiation regulators, and enhance G

 <sub>0</sub> block in APL cells by striking multiple targets. In addition, ATI enhanced the level of Aquaglycoporin 9, promoted the transport of a to APL cells, and then promoted the degradation and therapeutic effect of PML-RARα mediated by A. In the cell viability and induce apoptosis test of 2 human ovarian cancer cell lines, indirubin can inhibit cell activity and induce apoptosis with dose dependence by downregulating the phosphorylation of STAT3 (tyr705), and significantly suppressing the expression of cyclin D1 and c-myc downstream of STAT3 [

 <italic>κ</italic>B activation in a dose and time-dependence. It can also inhibit the expression of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B regulated genes, including anti apoptotic genes (iap1, iap2, Bcl-2, BCL XL and TRAF1), proliferation genes (cyclin D1 and c-myc), and invasive genes (COX-2 and MMP-9), thus playing anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activities [
