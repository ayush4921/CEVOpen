<p id="Par48">Indirubin in indigo naturalis can inhibit wnt/β-Catenin signal transduction by restoring the expression of wif-1, inhibit the expression of TGase1 and down-regulate CDK1 to inhibit the proliferation of keratinocytes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Tryptophan, another active component of indigo naturalis, has been proved to have the ability to inhibit keratinocytes, which is stronger than indigo and indirubin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Tryptophan can also inhibit the activity of apelin promoter, and inhibit the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells by causing G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase arrest, inhibiting Akt and FAK pathway, thus achieving anti angiogenesis effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Other studies found that indigo naturalis could repair intestinal mucosa. It can increase the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and occludin protein, and promote the repair of intestinal mucosa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Except for promoting intestinal mucosal repairing and ulcer healing, indigo naturalis also can inhibit the gene expression of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 and reduce the damage of colonic mucosa by inhibiting Smads signaling pathway and activating MAPK signal pathway [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Intestinal microflora is a hot spot in the treatment of ulcerative colitis in recent years. Indigo naturalis was found that it could reduce the relative abundance of harmful bacteria in the colon, increase the relative abundance of probiotics, and maintain the intestinal microbial homeostasis [
