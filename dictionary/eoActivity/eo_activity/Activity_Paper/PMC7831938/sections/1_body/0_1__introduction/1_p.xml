<p>Diabetes refers to a category of disorders that affect the way our body uses glucose in the blood. It threatens millions of people and has a remarkably high prevalence [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Oxidative stress occurring during the diabetic state results from the auto-oxidation of glucose and the production of free radicals and the lack of antioxidants in the body, leading to the development of inflammations, apoptosis, and multiple health problems [

Throughout the years, chemical and synthetic antidiabetic medications have been developed to help repair certain forms of dysfunctions that control the diabetic condition and avoid complications (hypoglycemia, hypertension, and many others) [
