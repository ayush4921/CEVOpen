<p>New studies are now devoted to medicinal plants and natural compounds that may have positive effects on diabetes [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus the use of medicinal plant-derived compounds has a multi-effect on glycemic and lipid profiles, oxidative stress, and inflammation may improve the management of diabetes multiple complications [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Medicinal plants have been traditionally used as alternative remedies, playing a major role in new pharmaceutical drugs production with a safe and effective profile [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They have gained high attention lately with increased studies and research confirming their therapeutic proprieties [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Researchers over the years have approved the antidiabetic potential of medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Thymus satureioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], 
 <italic>Ammodaucus leucothricus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and many others this potential when it deeply studied was attributed mostly to the molecule family of flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Among the medicinal plant with current interest appears coriander (
 <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> L.; Umbelliferae), known locally as “Kassbour,” is widely distributed and mainly cultivated for the seeds [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Coriander seed is a common spice that has enormous documented traditional medicinal use as a treatment of diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, kidney and heart problems [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and also for fighting worms, rheumatism, and joint pain [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Coriander whole seeds (more than 20% oil and many different components) were being studied for their hypolipidemic effect [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], its role in decreasing serum glucose and increased insulin release [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the oil part was studied for its radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As the most explored part of the seeds were its oils rich on linalool, geranyl acetate, p-cymene, camphor and caryophyllene which have many uses in food, cosmetic and also health industries [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This work’s main focus is highlight and reveal the hidden health benefit of the polar part of the coriander seeds usually been discarded by determining it active molecules (via LC-MS/MS) and their antidiabetic, antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant proprieties.
