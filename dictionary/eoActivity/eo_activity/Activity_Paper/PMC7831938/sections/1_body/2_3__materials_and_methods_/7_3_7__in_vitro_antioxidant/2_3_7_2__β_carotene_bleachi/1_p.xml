<p>The 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene bleaching assay was performed according to the Prieto protocol [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In a vial, a solution containing 1 mL of a mixture of β-carotene and chloroform (1 mg/5 mL) was added to 100 μL of tween and 0.01 mL of linoleic acid. Evaporation of chloroform occurred after heating the mixture at 45 °C for 5 min. Then, 25 mL of oxygenated water (H2O2) was added to the residue. Next, 100 μL of each sample was diluted in methanol and added to 2.5 mL of the prepared mixture, then incubated in a water bath at 50 °C for 2 h. Optical density was measured at 470 nm. The blank contained the mixture solution without the β-carotene, and BHT was used as standard. The antioxidant activity was measured following this formula (Equation (2)):
