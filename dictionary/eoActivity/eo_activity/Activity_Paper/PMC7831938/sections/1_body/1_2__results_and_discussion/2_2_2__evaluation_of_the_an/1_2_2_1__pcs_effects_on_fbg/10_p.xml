<p>Dyslipidemia is associated with hyperglycemia, and both increase the prevalence of cardiovascular complications [

The characteristic features of diabetic dyslipidemia, as noticed in the diabetic control mice, are a high plasma level of triglyceride and LDL against low HDL concentration. The lipoprotein lipase enzyme, which hydrolyzes triglycerides, is activated by insulin. Its deficiency in the case of diabetes causes inactivation of this enzyme, resulting in hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia [

As remarked, the alterations in serum lipid profile were attenuated after four weeks of administration of PCS to diabetic mice making the extract beneficial in improving lipid metabolism and by so preventing some diabetes complications.
