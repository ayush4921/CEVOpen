<p>Those results clearly show the anti-inflammatory activity of PCS. This experiment is a standard experiment model to study acute inflammation, using carrageenan an approved chemical used to stimulate the release of inflammatory mediators. According to Vinegar et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], carrageenan induces a biphasic response during edema formation. The first phase’s characterization is the release of, serotonin, kinins, and histamine in approximately the first hour after the injection. In contrast, the second phase is characterized by prostaglandins’ release in the next 2 to 3 h which are the main culprit responsible for acute inflammation [
