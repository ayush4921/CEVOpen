<p>To the best of our knowledge, no reviews in the literature provide comprehensive insights into the medicinal uses and importance of 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> plants. Although there is some work done about limited species that showed the very promising potential of the studied plants nevertheless, many other species of the genus remain untouched. Therefore, this review presented an effort to summarize all the up-to-date published data about the genus and provided comprehensive and condensed references dealing with all the required data about botanic characterization, distribution, traditional uses, primary and secondary metabolites, and pharmacological activities of the undiscovered genus 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic>. This review might shed light on the unseen genus that might attract researchers in drug discovery to find new compounds with promising biological potential.
