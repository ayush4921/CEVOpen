 <italic>L. inebrians</italic> is commonly known as Inebriating Mint, Intoxicating Mint, Turkistan Mint, or Intoxicating Hare’s Lip. The name 
 <italic>L. inebrians</italic> is derived from the Greek words “lagos” and “cheilos”, literally meaning “hare” and “lip/cheek” and “inebrians”, meaning intoxicating, thus translating to “intoxicating hare’s lip” (Wikipedia). A decoction of herb and roots of
