<p>The antioxidant activity of methanol extracts of seven 
 <italic>Lagochihis</italic> species was evaluated using a metal chelating (MC), phosphomolybdenum (PPBD), ferric reducing power (FRAP), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), 2,2â€™-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays. In these assays, we reported the antioxidant activities as Trolox equivalents, whereas ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used for metal chelating assay [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Regarding quenching of DPPH radical activity, the observed abilities decreased in the order: 
 <italic>L. inebrans</italic> (collected from Djizzakh)&gt;
 <italic>L. vvedenskyi</italic>&gt;
 <italic>L. olgae</italic>&gt;
 <italic>L. setulosus</italic>&gt;
 <italic>L. proskorjakovii</italic>&gt;
 <italic>L. gypsaceus</italic>&gt;
 <italic>L. acutilobus</italic>&gt;
 <italic>L. inebrans</italic> (collected from the Surkhandarya region). Similar to DPPH, the best cupric (CUPRAC) and ferric reducing power (FRAP) ability were determined by 
 <italic>L. inebrans</italic> (from Djjzzakh), followed by 
 <italic>L. vvedenskyi</italic>. The antioxidant activity is probably due to the polyphenols present. The highest amount of total phenolic compounds was found in 
 <italic>L. inebrans</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>L. vvedenskyi</italic> and 
 <italic>L. proskorjakovii,</italic> and we observed a strong correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant (DPPH, CUPRAC, and FRAP) properties of the tested extracts. In the PPBD assay, 
 <italic>L. proskorjakovii</italic> exhibited the strongest ability with 2.00 mmolTE/g, while 
 <italic>L. inebrians</italic> (from Surkhandarya) was the weakest. In the ferrozine assay, the MC ability of 
 <italic>L. acutilobus</italic> was the best, followed by 
 <italic>L. olgae</italic> and 
 <italic>L. setulosus</italic>. We also evaluated the antioxidant potential of 3 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> essential oils mentioned above in vitro assays [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. 
 <italic>L. inebrians</italic> oil exhibited the best antioxidant effect in these assays. For example, 
 <italic>L. inebrians</italic> had about a 16-fold higher activity than that of 
 <italic>L. setulosus</italic> in DPPH assay. Similarly, 
 <italic>L. inebrians</italic> exhibited a significant reducing power effect with 2093.33 mgTE/g in FRAP assay. The second highest antioxidant value was noted in 
 <italic>L. setulosus,</italic> except for the MC assay. The observed activity for 
 <italic>L. inebrians</italic> may be explained with its chemical profiles. The main components (
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate, eugenol, and verbenol) have already been reported as strong antioxidant compounds, and they could be considered as the main contributors to the observed activity [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. On the other hand, only very rare work could be traced regarding the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant activity of the plants belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic>. Only three species were examined by Jiao et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] for their effect on inducible nitric oxide synthase, malondialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase. In this study, both aqueous and alcohol extracts of 
 <italic>L. lanatonodus</italic> were able to inhibit the enzymes at 200 and 400 mg/kg doses similar to aspirin (positive control).
