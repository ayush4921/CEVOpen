<p>The determination reduction were based on the amount of Fe
 <sub>4</sub>(Fe[CN]
 <sub>6</sub>) produced as an indicator. The antioxidant can reduce potassium ferricyanide, and the ferrous ions were used to produce Prussian-blue. Fe
 <sub>4</sub> (Fe [CN]
 <sub>6</sub>) has maximum absorption peak at 700 nm. A greater absorbance value indicates that a sample has stronger reducing power. Iron ion reducing ability was measured using kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.
