<p>UHPLC-HRMS/MS has proved to be an important and powerful tool for identification of compounds. Q Exactive mass spectrometer is particularly suitable for screening compounds of non-target or target, it can also achieve a wide range of qualitative and quantitative applications. It can be widely used in compounds identification. The resolution was up to 140,000 FWHM, which can eliminate the interference of isobaric and isomeric compounds and improve the reliability of results when analyzing samples in complex matrices. For example, fenugreek is a famous medicinal plant used to treat diabetes, the flavonoids and metabolomics of fenugreek were analyzed by UHPLC-HRMS/MS [
