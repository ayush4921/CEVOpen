<p>Preliminary experiments showed that extraction time, ethanol concentration, material-to-liquid ratio, and extraction temperature had a significant impact on the extraction yield. Improving the extraction yield was important to analyze TFSR. Therefore, the Boxâ€“Behnken design provided by Design Expert 11 (Stat Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used. In this study, the independent variables were extraction time, ethanol concentration, material-to-liquid ratio and extraction temperature. The dependent variable (Y) was the extraction yield of TFSR. The optimal extraction process conditions for TFSR extraction were explored. The whole design consisted of 29 experiments, including 24 analysis factors and 5 central experiments [
