<p>The flavonoids of EAF fraction were further enriched by polyamide resin and eluted with a water–ethanol system. The fractions of A, B, C and D were obtained by elution sequentially with the different concentrations (0%, 30%, 70% and 95%) of ethanol. Fraction B had the highest flavonoids contents as 363.30 ± 2.71 (mg RTE/g DW), which was shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00403-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Thus, fraction B was selected to identify the chemical components by UHPLC-HRMS/MS.
