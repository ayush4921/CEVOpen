<p>The mass spectrums of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>â€“
 <bold>7</bold> were exhibited in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00403-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> showed a [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 465.10309. This precursor ion generated fragment ions at

 <italic>z</italic> 303.04898 (C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>11</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> [M]
 <sup>+</sup>), 137.02316 (C

 <sub>3</sub> [M]
 <sup>+</sup>) and 97.02580 (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> [M]
 <sup>+</sup>). Their formation process was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00403-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Fragment at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 137 was formed by the breakage of the precursor ion at position A and the losses of C

 <sub>15</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>. 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 303.04898 was formed by the shedding of glucoside in the precursor ion. In the MS2 spectrum, the [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> ion eliminated 301 Da (C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>9</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>), 36 Da (2H
 <sub>2</sub>O), and 30 Da (CH
 <sub>2</sub>O) to produce 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 97.02580. Therefore, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was identified as isoquercetin. According to the chromatographic conditions in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-molecules-26-00403">Appendix A</xref>, the existence of isoquercetin was further confirmed. In the chromatogram, the peaks of component B and standard sample appeared at RT = 6.09 and 6.10, and the error of peak time at 0.01 min was reasonable. In the mass spectrum, 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 303, 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 81 were fragments of standard sample, these fragments also were found in mass spectrum of fraction B. The presence of isoquercetin in fraction B was confirmed by mass spectrum and chromatogram. Details were given in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00403">supplementary material</xref> (
