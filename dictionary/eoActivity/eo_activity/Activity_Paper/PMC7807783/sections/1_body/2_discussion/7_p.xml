<p>Based on the results of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antidiabetic properties of the methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root, a study was designed to evaluate the same 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a diabetic mice model. In this study, a high-fat diet was fed with a small single dose of streptozotocin to induce type-2 diabetes in C57BL/6 mice. A high-fat diet for 11 weeks induces insulin resistance and a small dose of streptozotocin decreases the plasma insulin levels and, in turn, increases blood glucose, providing a diabetic model to study the efficacy of herbs. The T2D mice showed a significant increase in fasting blood glucose and decreased plasma insulin levels which indicates that the mice were diabetic and developed insulin resistance. The decrease in the plasma insulin despite a high-fat diet maybe because of the fact that in a diabetic condition, the prolonged insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinaemia sends negative signals to the pancreatic Î²-cell to stop insulin production as there are increased levels of plasma insulin. A similar mechanism is mimicked in this animal model where a high-fat diet for 11 weeks induces insulin resistance and a small dose of STZ injection decreases the insulin level immediately but maintains the insulin resistance to develop a type-2 diabetic model. These results are in agreement with earlier results.

 </sup> However, the diabetic mice treated with metformin and the methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root showed the above parameters similar to those of control mice, indicating the amelioration or management of the diabetic condition.
