<p>Several studies have reported that the health-promoting properties of medicinal herbs are due to the presence of different bioactives.

 </sup> Hence, the identification and characterization of bioactives or phytoconstituents of herbs have become a major topic of various studies. In this investigation, the root of 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> was subjected to different solvent extractions in the order of increasing polarity and it was found that the methanolic extract could extract the highest amount of total polyphenols compared to other solvents. Indeed, studies have shown that polar solvents could extract the maximum amount of polyphenols.

 </sup> Further, the flavonoids were also found to be highest in the methanolic extract. In addition to the estimation of total polyphenols from different solvent extracts, the different polyphenols present were also determined in this study. The different solvent extracts were subjected to HPLC analysis, and it was found that methanolic, chloroform, and ethanol and aqueous extracts were rich in coumaric acid, gallic acid, and syringic acid, respectively. In addition, researchers are reporting alternate natural sources of polyphenols with high bioavailability;

 </sup> indeed, the results of our study showed that the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root is also an alternate source for polyphenols.
