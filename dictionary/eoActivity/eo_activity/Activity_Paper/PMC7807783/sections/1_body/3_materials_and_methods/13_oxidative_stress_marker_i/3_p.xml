<p>The ROS generation was measured by incubating the reaction aliquot consisting of 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer, the sample, and DCF-DA for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The reaction was read with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm. The values are expressed as μmol DCF formed/min/mg protein.</p>
