<p>The activity of catalase was determined. Briefly, to the 1 mL reaction mixture, 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), the enzyme sample, and 8.8 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> were added. The reaction was monitored at 240 nm for 3 min, and the change in absorbance was recorded for every 30 s. The activity of catalase was expressed as nmol/min/mg protein.
