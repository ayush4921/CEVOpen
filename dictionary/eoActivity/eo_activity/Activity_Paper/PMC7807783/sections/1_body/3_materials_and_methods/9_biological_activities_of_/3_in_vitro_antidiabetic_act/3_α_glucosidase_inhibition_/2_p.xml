<p>The methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root was tested for its inhibitory activity against rat intestinal α-glucosidase using 4-nitrophenyl-α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside as a substrate according to the method reported by Hemalatha et al.

 </sup> The reaction mixture containing 0.6 mL of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 0.25 mL of 3 mM 4-nitrophenyl-α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, and 0.1 mL of the sample at various concentrations was prepared and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. About 0.25 mL of the α-glucosidase solution (0.15 U/mL) was added to initiate the reaction; it was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. Then, 0.25 mL of 0.67 M sodium carbonate solution was added to terminate the reaction. The absorbance was recorded at 405 nm. Acarbose was used as a positive control. The percentage of α-glucosidase inhibition was calculated by the following formula:

 </disp-formula>Based on the percentage of inhibition of the enzyme activity, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the methanolic extract was calculated, and the inhibitory effect of the extract was compared with that of the standard.
