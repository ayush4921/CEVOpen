 </sup> Various studies reported medicinal properties of different parts of the plant 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic>. For instance, tea from the leaves is used against chronic fever and as an anthelminthic,

 </sup> A comparative study among the different parts of the herb as reported by Uma Devi et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 </sup> revealed that the flower and leaf extract has a potent antidiabetic property by reducing the serum glucose level and increasing plasma insulin levels. These biological properties of the herb 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> may be because of the presence of bioactives. Hence, understanding the phytochemical constituents of the herb or its parts provides the knowledge of its biological properties. However, there are no studies on the quantification of different bioactives in the root of 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> and its potential antidiabetic properties. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the presence of different phytochemical constituents in the root of 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> both qualitatively and quantitatively and also to determine its biological properties such as antioxidant and antidiabetic activities in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models.
