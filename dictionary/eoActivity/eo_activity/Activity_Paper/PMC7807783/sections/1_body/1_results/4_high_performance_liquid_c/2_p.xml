<p>To know the different phenolic acids in the different solvent extracts of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root, the retention times of the extracts in the chromatogram were compared with those of the accurate standards. The results of HPLC analysis of different extracts are represented in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="other">Table

 </xref>. The chloroform extract showed peaks for epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, and gallic acid. The ethanolic extract showed peaks similar to those of epicatechin, gallic acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, whereas the methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root showed peaks matching with those of epicatechin, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, and coumaric acid standards. Further, in the aqueous extract, epicatechin, ferulic acid, and coumaric acid were absent and chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, tannic acid, resveratrol, caffeic acid, and protocatechuic acid were present (

 </xref>). The highest amounts of gallic acid, syringic acid, and coumaric acid were found in chloroform, ethanol, and aqueous and methanolic extracts, respectively.
