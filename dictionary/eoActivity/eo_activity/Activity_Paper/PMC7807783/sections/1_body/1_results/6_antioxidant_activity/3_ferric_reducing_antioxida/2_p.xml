<p>In this study, the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> showed the highest ferric reducing antioxidant power, followed by ethanol, chloroform, and aqueous extracts as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref>, and the inhibitory concentrations were found to be close to those of standards. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of methanolic, ethanol, chloroform, and aqueous extracts were 47.13 ± 0.37, 52.44 ± 0.46, 67.59 ± 0.75, and 95.68 ± 1.50 μg/mL, respectively, indicating that the methanol extract has more antioxidant potency than the other extracts of the root studied.
