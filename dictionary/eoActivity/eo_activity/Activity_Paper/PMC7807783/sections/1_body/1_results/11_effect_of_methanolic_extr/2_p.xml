<p>There was a significantly higher level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in both the plasma and muscles in the diabetic rats compared to those of control mice (

 </xref>). However, the treatment of diabetic mice with metformin could effectively lower the ROS and NO levels to the levels of controls and the methanolic extract of the

 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root extract reduced the ROS and NO levels and showed similarity with the control mice.
