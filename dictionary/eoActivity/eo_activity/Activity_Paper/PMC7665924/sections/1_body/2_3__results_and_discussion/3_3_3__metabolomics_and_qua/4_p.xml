<p>The contents of each compound varied considerably in different 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> samples. THSG 
 <bold>(1)</bold> contents in natural samples ranged from 26,211 to 55,010 mg/kg, which were 4 to 108-fold higher than in CMS samples. THSG contents also varied widely among CMS groups as categorized above. CMS group 2 contained the highest contents of THSG among four CMS groups at more than 9,000 mg/kg, followed by CMS group 3 at about 5,000 mg/kg, whereas THSG contents of the sample CMS_01 to CMS_07 (CMS groups 1 and 4) varied at low levels, from 507 to 3,285 mg/kg. Previous studies also reported that THSG contents may range from 8,000 to 60,000 mg/kg of natural 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic>, and at sharply lower levels in commercial samples [

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Contents of the compound, 6-hydroxymusizin 8-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-D-apiofuranosyl-(1⟶6)-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside 
 <bold>(5)</bold>, in natural samples were dramatically higher than other CMS samples, while CMS group 2 showed the highest content of the compound among four CMS groups. Considerably, very low or no contents of physcionin 
 <bold>(2),</bold> emodin 8-glucoside 
 <bold>(3)</bold>, pleuropyrone A 
 <bold>(6)</bold>, and torachrysone 8-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside 
 <bold>(7)</bold> were determined in samples of CMS group 1 and 4, while natural samples showed the highest contents of these metabolites, which were at least 3-fold higher than the values of CMS groups 2 and 3. Interestingly, emodin 
 <bold>(4)</bold> was found at the highest level in the sample CMS_06 (CMS group 1), followed by natural samples, CMS group 2, and CMS group 3, respectively, while detected at low contents in CMS group 4. This compound might be useful as a marker that led to the clear separation of the sample CMS_06 to the other analytes on the PCA score plot. A study on processing 
 <italic>F. multiﬂora</italic> illustrated that the emodin content may increase 20–30% after steaming with or without black beans for a long time [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, CMS_06 might be processed in a related condition which sharply increased the synthesis of emodin.
