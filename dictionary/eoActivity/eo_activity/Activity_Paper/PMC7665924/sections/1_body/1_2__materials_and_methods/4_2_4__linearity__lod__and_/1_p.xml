<p>Linearity was evaluated in this concentration range three separate times. The calibration curve obtained had to have a correlation coefficient (R2) at least 0.999 for every analyte. The limit of detection (LOD) was the lowest concentration of the standard compound possibly identified. Meanwhile, the limit of quantitation (LOQ) illustrated the lowest concentration of analyte possibly quantified. LOD and LOQ were obtained using the calibration curve, based on the standard deviation (SD) of the response and the slope of the calibration curve, according to the equations as follows:
