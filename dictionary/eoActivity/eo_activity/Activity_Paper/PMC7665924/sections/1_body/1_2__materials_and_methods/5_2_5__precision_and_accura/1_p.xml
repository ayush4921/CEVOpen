<p>The intraday of variation was evaluated by analyzing the response of six replicates of the low, medium, and high concentrations of quality control samples at 25, 125, and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, on the same day, whereas the interday variation was evaluated with those quality control samples injected into the HPLC over three consecutive days. The precision of the measurement was assessed by the coefficient of variation (CV%), which was calculated by the ratio of standard deviations of replicates to the mean concentrations. The accuracy was calculated from the recovery of the standard spiking into a sample that had known the contents of the compounds. The mixture was extracted and analyzed using the method mentioned above. Six replicates were performed for the test.
