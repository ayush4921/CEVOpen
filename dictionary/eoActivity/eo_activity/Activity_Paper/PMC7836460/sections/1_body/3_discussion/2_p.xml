 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] but also include new ANN technique. The ANNs have received greater attention in various applications because of its sensitivity, accuracy, non-destruction, and rapidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Mesgaran et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported that ANN was most accurate method in predicting copper elements in the mineral areas compared to various methods such as fractal, principal components analysis, factor analysis. Similarly, Irmak et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] investigated the prediction of soybean yield in varied temporal, soil and landscape situations using back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model and Tušek et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] estimated total polyphenols content from chamomile, dandelion, marigold, and yarrow by using kinetic models. Out study demonstrated that the MLP model (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.87 provided more suitable prediction of hypericin content in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> by utilizing the ecological condition of site, such as land form, soil characteristics and plant phenological stages in comparison to other models RBF (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.8) and SVM (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.54). We recorded minimum differences between observed and predicted values of hypericin in case of MLP. Since MLP is an environmental decision support system tool, it could be used to forecast the amount of hypericin in 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> in different habitats. Our findings suggest that using mathematical models such as MLP for predicting the amount of hypericin in 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> species could reduce time and cost required analytical methods. Savić et al. [

In another research, lettuce yield was calculated in the condition of water shortage by using the ANN technique and vegetation indices and revealed that ANNs best predicted lettuce yield with R
 <sup>2</sup> values of 0.86, 0.75, and 0.92 for 100, 66, and 33% water treatments, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, we compared three models MLP, RBF and SVM in our research and found that MLP was the most accurate model among them. These models have been recently compared in aesthetic quality prediction [
