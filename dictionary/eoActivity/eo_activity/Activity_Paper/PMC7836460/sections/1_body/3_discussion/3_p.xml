<p id="Par48">The results of sensitivity analysis revealed that, phenological stages, hill aspects, total N, altitude and organic C appeared the most fundamental factors significantly impacting hypericin content. Our observations regarding genotype, growing conditions, and developmental stage impacting hypericin content are in agreement with previous research [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The content of hypericin is varied based on different habitats and the stage of plant development also reported by Saddique et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previous research suggested that compounds in the 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> vary with climate and soil conditions which are consistent with our findings. Our results illustrated that there was a positive correlation between total N, organic carbon and the amount of hypericin. We observed that, as the total N and organic carbon increase in the soil, the hypericin increased accordingly. Yesaghi [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] confirmed that optimal conditions for the growth of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> depend on carbon and N-rich soil studying at three habitats in Golestan province, Iran. Moreover, our study indicated that the amount of hypericin improved from 1.65 to more than 1.75 mg/g (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>) by increasing altitude from 1000 to 4000 m above sea level which is in agreement with previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It is proposed that the combination of higher light intensity, UV-B irradiation and shortage of air temperature at the highest altitude could be a rational reason for increase in the hypericin content [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In terms of hill aspect, the highest content of hypericin was obtained from 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> gathered in the western hills (1.8 mg/g). This result is similar to the study carried out by Zobayed et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. We studied the content of hypericin is influenced by ecological conditions such as altitude, soil factors and hill aspect which is in agreement to previous studies [
