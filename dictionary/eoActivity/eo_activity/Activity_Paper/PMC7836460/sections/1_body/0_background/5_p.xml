<p id="Par8">In this research, we aimed to predict the concentration of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> in a range of ecological and phenological conditions comparing artificial neural network modeling techniques such as MLP, RBF and SVM. This study will report the most accurate model predicting hypericin concentration as impacted by ecological and phenological factors. Finally, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) tool as an environmental decision support system will be designed for ecologists to predict the amount of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>.
