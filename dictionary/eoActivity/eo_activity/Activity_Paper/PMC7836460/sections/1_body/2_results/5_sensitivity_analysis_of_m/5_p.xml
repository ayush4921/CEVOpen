<p id="Par45">We also designed a new Graphical User Interface (GUI) for experts to use the MLP model in order to predict the content of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> species. Indeed, the prediction of hypericin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> under new ecological conditions of the site and the phonological stage is gaining popularity among users. GUI as an EDSS tool will be run on new data just by pushing the "Hypericin Content Prediction" button in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> that illustrates the results of hypericin content prediction in 10 new samples based on the ecological conditions of the site and phenological stage.
