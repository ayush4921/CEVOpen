<p id="Par13">Plant extraction was performed as described by Ramezani et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] with some modifications. In order to remove chlorophylls and unwanted nonpolar constituent, the ground aerial parts of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> (100 g) were placed in a 1000 mL volumetric flask and made up to volume with chloroform (Merck, Germany). The mixture was placed on a stirrer at room temperature overnight. Then the chloroform fraction was filtered off through Whatman filter paper and the supernatant containing chlorophyll and unwanted compounds was discarded. This procedure was repeated three times until colorless supernatant was obtained. The residual chloroform was evaporated using nitrogen gas at 40 °C. Then the dried residue was dissolved in 1 L of acetone and the solution was sonicated for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath (Elma S30H, Germany) before allowing it to stir overnight. This procedure was repeated for 4 consecutive days and the acetone extracts were combined and evaporated on a rotary evaporator and dried weight was recorded. Finally, the residue was reconstituted in methanol (Merck, Germany) at the concentration of 10 mg/mL and the sample was filtered through a 0.45 µm PFTE filter (Gelman Sciences) prior to HPLC analysis.
