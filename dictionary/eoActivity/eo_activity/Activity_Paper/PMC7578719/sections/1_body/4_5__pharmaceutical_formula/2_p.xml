<p>The next study also developed the formulation of 
 <italic>emulsifiable concentrate</italic> (EC) from the aerial part extract of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. using a nontoxic solvent and emulsifying agent. This study was focused on the evaluation of such formulations as an antimicrobial agent. A diverse solvent has been used to extract the materials, including dichloromethane, methanol, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. The identified compounds in the extract elucidated using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) showing bioactivities. The developed EC was found more active than its crude extract against bacteria and fungus [
