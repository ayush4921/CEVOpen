<p>A study supported the previous study by exhibiting a significant analgesic activity of water extract from the whole part of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. using the tail flick method [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The phytochemicals of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. essential oils employing precocene I (4), precocene II (5), and 6-vinyl-7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl chromene (VMDC) (6) (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are a member of chromene compounds, responsible for its analgesic bioactivity [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, the alkaloid and flavonoid in the oil can block the pain perception [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], whereas other secondary metabolites such as tannin, saponin, and terpenoid also have been reported having pharmacological activity [
