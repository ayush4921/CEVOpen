<p>The ethanolic extract of leaves and flowers from 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. demonstrated antioxidant activities against DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl) to scavenge the free radicals. Those antioxidant activities are due to the presence of phytochemicals such as flavonoids and phenol [

 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. stems depending on the phenolic components [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The result shows that the leaves of the ethanolic extract have antioxidant activity which is higher than its water extract. This extract has a strong natural antioxidant effect against the free radical and also used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction induced by oxidative stress [
