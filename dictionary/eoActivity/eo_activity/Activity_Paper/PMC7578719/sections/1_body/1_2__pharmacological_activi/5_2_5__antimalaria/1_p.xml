<p>A study shows that the water extract of 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> L. has a potency to increase the antimalaria activity of chloroquine and artesunate in the plasmodial induced-rats [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The phytochemical responsible for the antimalarial activities are alkaloid, glycoside, flavonoid, saponin, tannin, and resin. In this study, the leaves extract as well as its fraction show a significant antimalarial activity toward parasite plasmodium as confirmed by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model in mice [
