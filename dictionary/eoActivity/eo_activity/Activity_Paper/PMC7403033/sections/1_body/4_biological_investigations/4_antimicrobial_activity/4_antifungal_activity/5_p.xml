 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al. (2017)</xref> demonstrated that the association of the aqueous or ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Rhaphiodon echinus</italic> with the antifungal drug nystatin causes an antagonic effect in the drug activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis.</italic> Indeed, this combination (using aqueous extract) provoked a reduction in the MIC of nystatin against 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic>. Besides, the essential oil of the same species was also capable to modulate the activity of fluconazole reducing the MIC value of the drug against 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic> and
