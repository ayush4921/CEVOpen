<p id="p0370">The influence of seasonality on the chemical composition of the essential oil from leaves of 
 <italic>Hyptis dilatata</italic> was assessed by 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Almeida et al. (2018)</xref>. The samples were tested against gram positive (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>) and gram negative bacteria (
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and 
 <italic>Citrobacter freundii</italic>). The authors reported that the essential oil from leaves collected in dry period, had more potential to inhibit the growth of

 <sub>50</sub> = 112.8 μg/mL and leaves collected in the rainy season, generated an oil more effective against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 78.8 μg/mL). Nevertheless, there was no difference in the components of the essential oils, only quantitatively, explaining the slightly differences in activities. The samples presented better results on gram positive bacteria strains, which could be explained by their simpler structures in comparison to the gram negative ones.
