<p id="p0560">Approximately 14% of snake species worldwide are considered venomous, among them 
 <italic>Bothrops atrox</italic> which is the species responsible for the most part of accidents in the Northern region of Brazil. The hemorrhagic, phospholipase A2 and proteolytic activities of 
 <italic>Bothrops</italic> venoms have been associated with the pathogenesis of the lesions. In this context, crushed leaves and inflorescences, as well as infusions of 
 <italic>Marsypianthes</italic>
 <italic>chamaedrys</italic> were tested against the venom of this snake species. The results demonstrated that infusion of inflorescences presents better results in the inhibition of phospholipase A2 than the antivenom. Besides, all samples present high anticoagulant activity in the presence of the 
 <italic>Bothrops atrox</italic> venom. Moreover, crushed leaves and inflorescences demonstrated inhibition of inflammatory effects after the venom injection in mice (

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al. (2003)</xref> demonstrated the inhibitory effects (IC
 <sub>50</sub> around 10 mg/mL) of aqueous extract of the same species on the coagulation induced by several snake venoms (
 <italic>Bothrops insularis, Bothrops neuwedii, Bothrops jararaca, Bothrops alternatus</italic>). These results show the relevance of the popular knowledge since this species is widely used in the state of Amazonas (Northern Brazil) orally or as a poultice in the site of snakebites in order to relief the effects of the venom (
