 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Costa et al. (2017)</xref> evaluated the capacity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts from 
 <italic>Rhaphiodon echinus</italic> (Nees &amp; Mart.) Schauer. to enhance the effects of some antimicrobials against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The results demonstrated that both extracts were able to improve the MIC of gentamicin and amikacin in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strains. On the other hand, only the aqueous extract was effective in increasing the activity of imipenem and gentamicin against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. No effects were observed on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. In addition, the essential oil of the same plant also was capable of modulate the activity of antibacterial drugs such as gentamicin, amikacin, imipenem and ciprofloxacin. In fact, the presence of the oil increased the MIC of the amikacin against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, suggesting an antagonic effect. On the other hand, it seems to have a synergic effect of the oil with gentamicin, amikacin and ciprofloxacin in 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strains (
