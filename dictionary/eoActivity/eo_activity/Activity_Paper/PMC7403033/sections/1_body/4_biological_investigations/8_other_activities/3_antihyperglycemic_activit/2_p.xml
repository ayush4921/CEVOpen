<p id="p0540">A hydroethanolic extract (50%) from 
 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis suaveolens</italic>) was assessed trough the streptozotocin model in order to verify its antihyperglycemic activity. A significant reduction in the rat blood glucose was observed in diabetic animals treated with the extract. This finding could be attributed to the stimulating effects on glucose utilization and antioxidant enzymes (

 <italic>Condea verticillata</italic> (syn.
