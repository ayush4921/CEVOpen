<p id="p0490">There are some reports showing the use of

 <xref rid="bib122" ref-type="bibr">Hajdu and Hohmann, 2012</xref>). Therefore, the effect of the essential oil from this species, constituted principally by the monoterpenes

 <bold>238</bold>), 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>250</bold>) and 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (
 <bold>241</bold>), was evaluated using antinociceptive tests (formalin and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels agonists). The authors found that the essential oil presents antinociceptive effect at 300 and 1000 mg/kg on formalin-induced pain behavior model, presenting 50% and 72% of inhibition during the first phase (ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 292 mg/kg), and 85% and 100% during de second phase (ED
 <sub>50</sub> = 205 mg/kg), respectively. Temperature of the hind paw was also reduced by samples treatment in a dose-dependent manner (
