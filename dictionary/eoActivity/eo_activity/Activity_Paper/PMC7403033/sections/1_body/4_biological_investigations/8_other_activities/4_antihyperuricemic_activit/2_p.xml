 <italic>Mesosphaerum suaveolens (syn. Hyptis suaveolens),</italic> the antihyperuricemic effect of compounds isolated from its seeds was evaluated by xanthine oxidase inhibitory bioassay. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value comparable with the conventional drug allopurinol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 28.4 ± 1.1 mM) demonstrated that sodium 4,5-dicaffeoylquinate (

 <sub>50</sub> 69.4 ± 1.1 mM) and methyl 3,5-dicaffeoylquinate (
 <bold>233</bold>) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 92.1 ± 1.2 mM) could be potential compounds to be used in the treatment of hyperuricemia disease. Besides, the position of caffeoyl substitution could affect the inhibitory activity since 4,5 substitution have a higher effect than 3,5 (
