<p id="p0450">The activity of a species from Hyptidinae against the protozoan parasite 
 <italic>Ichthyophthirius multifiliis</italic> has also been reported. This protozoa affects the economically important fish 
 <italic>Rhamdia quelen (</italic>silver catfish), the most raised native species in South America (
 <xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">Gomes et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, the essential oil from the leaves of 
 <italic>Cantinoa mutabilis</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Hyptis mutabilis</italic>), as well as its major component, globulol (
 <bold>287</bold>) were tested against this parasite. The results of this research evidenced that both, essential oil and the isolated compound increased the survival of the infected fish (
