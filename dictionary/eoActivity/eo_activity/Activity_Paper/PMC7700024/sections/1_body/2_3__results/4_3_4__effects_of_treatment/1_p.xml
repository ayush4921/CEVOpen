<p>The vaginal epithelium of the SHAM group exhibited three layers arranged, from the basal membrane to the lumen, as follows: stratum germinativum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum. Following ovariectomy, the vaginal epithelium was reduced to a single layer, the stratum germinativum. Following treatment with estradiol valerate, the vaginal epithelium was similar to that of the SHAM control, with the only difference that this epithelium was smaller than that of the aforementioned control. The coadministration of estradiol valerate with tamoxifen or with the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves moderated the effect of estradiol valerate as it reduced the thickness of the vaginal epithelium (
