<p>In summary, the present study showed that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves displayed antiproliferative activity as it inhibited the hypertrophy of uterine epithelial cells and the proliferation of vaginal epithelial cells, both events induced by estradiol valerate. This antiproliferative effect of the aforementioned extract may be mediated through the inhibition of tissue steroidogenesis as it decreased tissue levels of estradiol. These findings suggest that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves could be a promising alternative for the treatment of estrogen-dependent proliferative diseases.
