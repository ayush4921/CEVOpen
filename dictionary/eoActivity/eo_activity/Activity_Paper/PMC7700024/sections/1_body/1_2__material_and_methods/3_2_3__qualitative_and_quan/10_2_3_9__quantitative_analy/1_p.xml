<p>Total phenolic content in the extract was determined by the modified Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The reaction mixture consisted of 200 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of extract, 200 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of 2N Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, and 400 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of 20% sodium carbonate solution. The mixture was stirred and incubated in a water bath at 40°C for 20 minutes. The experiment was carried out in triplicate. The absorbance was read at 760 nm. Total phenolic content was expressed as milligram gallic acid equivalent/gram extract (mgGAE/gE) using the equation obtained from a calibration curve of gallic acid (
 <italic>y</italic> = 1877.9
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.1142; 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9989).
