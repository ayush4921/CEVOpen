<p>Cell proliferation is the major precursor of cancer [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], such as estrogen-dependent cancers. These cancers are the most prevalent hormone-related cancers (50â€“80%) [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], whose genesis is stimulated by estrogens. These hormones are known to stimulate cell proliferation in estrogen-responsive targets such as the uterus and the vagina [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, novel molecules are continuously being identified and developed from medicinal plants for better management of diseases in general and proliferative diseases in particular. These molecules in general are capable of inhibiting cell proliferation induced by estrogens [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. To contribute to the quest for safer antiestrogenic and antiproliferative molecules, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiestrogenic properties of the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. edulis</italic> leaves were investigated.
