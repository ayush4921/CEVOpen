<p id="par0095">To optimize the formation of biofilm by MRSA, small glass pieces of dimension 5 mm × 5 mm were used as an abiotic surface for the attachment. The required time duration for the formation of biofilm was optimized by transferring the inoculated culture into a 24-well glass plate and incubated at 37 °C. The formation of biofilm was monitored and observed through a light microscope at different time intervals such as 24, 36, and 48 h [
