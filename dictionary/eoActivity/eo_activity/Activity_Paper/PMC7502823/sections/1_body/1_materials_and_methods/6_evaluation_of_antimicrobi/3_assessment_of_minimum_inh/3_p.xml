<p id="par0090">For the determination of Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), 50 μL from each test tube that showed no visible growth was re-inoculated on Mueller Hinton (MH) agar plates. Then the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. MBC is defined as the lowest concentration of extracts showing no bacterial growth in the MH agar plates.</p>
