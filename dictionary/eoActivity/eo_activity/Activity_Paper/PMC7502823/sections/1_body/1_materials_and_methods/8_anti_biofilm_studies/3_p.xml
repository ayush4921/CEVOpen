<p id="par0105">Luria Bertani (LB) medium was used, which was inoculated with MRSA culture. Inoculated culture (2 mL) whose OD value is above 0.3 was added into the 24 well plates containing a glass piece in each well. Then, 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL of the extracts were added to each well and incubated at 37 Â°C for about 48 h with positive control and negative control. The culture without the extract served as positive control and LB without culture served as the negative control. After incubation, the contents in wells were removed and the glass pieces were washed twice with sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS). The biofilm of the bacterial cells that adhered to the glass pieces was stained by using 1% crystal violet and incubated for 30 min. After 30 min incubation, plates were washed with sterile distilled water to remove the excess stain. The glass pieces were then viewed under a light microscope at 40 X magnification. The results were interpreted by comparing the extracts with positive and negative control. After analysis, the dye bound with the cells was solubilized in 95 % ethanol for 15 min. The de-stained solution from each glass piece was measured at absorbance 595 nm, taking the de-stained solution of negative control glass piece as blank. The results were interpreted in such a way that more number of cells absorb more amount of dye, which in turn gives a high optical density value.</p>
