<p id="par0045">Considering the antimicrobial properties of these plants, we have attempted to investigate the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm potential of these plant extracts against the MRSA. Therefore, our study is aimed to investigate new compounds for defeating the microbial drug resistance, especially in biofilm structures, and to evaluate their anti-biofilm potential. The results of this investigation may provide newer leads for the successful treatment of MRSA biofilm infections.</p>
