<p id="par0170">The mechanism of flavonoids for its anti-biofilm activity is based on damaging the synthesis, secretion, signal transmission, antagonistic activity, and inhibition of receptor binding which leads to the shutdown of quorum sensing [

Also, the mechanism of terpenoids for its anti-biofilm activity is based on altering the cell membrane fatty acid composition, which causes the hydrophobicity of cells leads to biofilm eradication. Additionally, synergistic and antagonistic effects of other phytoconstituents may also have apparent anti-biofilm activity. The qualitative anti-biofilm effect of the extracts and controls through light microscopic study images are shown in
