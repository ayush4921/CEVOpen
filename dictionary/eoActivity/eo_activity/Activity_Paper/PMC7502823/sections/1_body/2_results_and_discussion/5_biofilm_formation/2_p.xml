<p id="par0155">The period for the formation of biofilm was assessed through a light microscope at different time intervals such as 24, 36, and 48 h. Different stages in the formation of biofilm are attachment, aggregation, and mat formation, at different time intervals from 24 h to 48 h. In this study, at 24 h of incubation, the planktonic cells get attached to the abiotic surface (glass piece). At 36 h the planktonic cells start to aggregate and at 48 h of incubation, the complete biofilm was formed. The observed results revealed that the ability of the bacterial to form biofilms was influenced by the increased time duration of the incubation period. The light microscopic images for the formation of biofilm at different time intervals are shown in
