<p>Pure SGs (100 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) were spiked on the final plant extracts and the percentage of recovery was measured from two individual extractions and three analytical HPLC runs of each extract. The confirmation of SGs was done using a fraction collector system (AFC-3000 UltiMate Fraction Collector; Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as well as by using a thin-layer chromatography system. The contents of SGs, i.e., Reb A and ST were determined on the basis of their molar absorption at 210 nm in which Reb A was also utilized for calibration purpose. The standard SGs were purchased from ChromaDex
 <sup>®</sup> (Irvine, CA, USA).
