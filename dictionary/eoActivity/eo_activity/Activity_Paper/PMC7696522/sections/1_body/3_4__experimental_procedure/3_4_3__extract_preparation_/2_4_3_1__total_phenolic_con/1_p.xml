<p>In leaf extracts of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic>, total phenol content (TPC) was determined by performing the method of Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. An aliquot of 20 µL (4 mg/mL) of DMSO stock solution of each sample was added in the respective well of 96 well plate. Then, 90 µL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent was added in it and the plate was kept for 5 min. Later, 90 µL of sodium carbonate was added to the reaction mixture of all samples that were run in triplicate. The absorbance of samples was obtained at 630 nm using microplate reader. The standard used was gallic acid and the results were expressed as µg gallic acid equivalent per mg (µg GAE/mg).
