 <sup>®</sup> ODS-3 (GL Sciences Inc. Tokyo, Japan) with 150 × 4.6 mm in length and 5 μm particle size that was kept warm at 40 °C in a column oven system (TCC-3000SD Dionex, Watertown, MA, USA), and a dual wavelength absorbance detector operating at 210 and 350 nm (MWD-3100 Dionex UV-VIS Detector, Watertown, MA, USA). Finally, isocratic flow was performed using acetonitrile and 1% (
