<p>Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was determined by the method of Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. An aliquot of 100 μL from stock solution of each sample (4 mg/mL in DMSO) was added to 96-well plate and 900 µL of reagent solutions containing 4 mM ammonium molybdate, 0.6 M sulfuric acid, and 28 mM sodium phosphate were mixed in it. The solution was incubated at 95 °C for 90 min and then cooled at room temperature. The absorbance of all samples run in triplicate was measured at 695 nm using microplate reader. Ascorbic acid was used as standard and the results were expressed as µg ascorbic acid equivalent per mg (µg AA/mg).
