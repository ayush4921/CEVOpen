<p>The tools of molecular biology such as transcriptomic and metabolic technologies have been employed for the determination of stress associated genes and elucidation of signalling pathways. It has been speculated that the transcription factors responsible for regulation of gene expression of biosynthesis of secondary metabolites get activated in response to PEG 6000-associated drought stress [

Hence, tolerance produced by tolerance-associated molecules is implicated on cellular level that regulates different steps of signal transduction system. Despite recent advancement, extensive research is needed in this domain to elucidate the effects of drought stress on the secondary metabolitesâ€™ formation and growth dynamics of the
