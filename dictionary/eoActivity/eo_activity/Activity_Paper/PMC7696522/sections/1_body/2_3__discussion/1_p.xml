<p>The current study outlines that differences in physiological characteristics, bioactive SGs content, and nonenzymatic antioxidant activities occur under the different concentrations of PEG 6000 stress; 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 4%. A significant increment of all these parameters has been observed from 0.5 to 4% of PEG 6000 concentration. Few previous reports have enlightened the enhancement of growth and antioxidants after exposure of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> to PEG 6000 while others disagree on the growth and secondary metabolites increase and ultimately susceptibility to water deficiency in the environment [

 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Hajihashemi and Ehsanpour [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] documented an increase in antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> under rising levels of PEG 6000 concentration, i.e., 0, 2, 4, 6%. Moreover, Hajihashemi and Sofo [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported reduction in plant growth but elevated levels of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants in this sweet herb under 5, 10, and 15% of PEG 6000 concentration. Hajihashemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also elucidated enhancement of antioxidant activities in the callus of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> treated with PEG 6000 (0 and 4%) along with different growth regulators. Additionally, Gorzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] documented improved seedling growth and uprising antioxidant capacity upon exposure to PEG 6000 stress. These reports coincide with our study and prove the drought tolerance in 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic> on increasing PEG 6000 levels. On the contrary, Badran et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported negative response of PEG 6000 stress on the ST production and positive response on shooting of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic>. The plant shoots were exposed to different levels of PEG 6000, i.e., 0, 10, 20, 30 g/L in their study and the ultimate result of exposure was marked decrease of stevioside with rising PEG 6000 concentration. The more recent studies by Bogado and Nakayama [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Pradhan et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that PEG 6000 induced a negative effect on the in vitro growth, whereas Hajihashemi and Geuns [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01552" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] demonstrated negative influence of PEG 6000 on SGs of 
 <italic>S. rebaudiana</italic>. The later exposed 
 <italic>Stevia</italic> to 5, 10, and 15% PEG 6000 stress under greenhouse conditions and obtained results that are contradictory to our findings.
