<p>The shoots obtained from 4-week-old nodal explants cultivated in different MS growth medium treatments were observed. These treatments involved 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0% of PEG 6000 stress. 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01552-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that the maximum percentage of shooting (~92.4%) of nodal explants was revealed by the treatment containing 4% of PEG 6000 stress. Similarly, the maximum mean length of shoots (5.1 cm), mean number of nodes (5.3), mean number of leaves (17.9), and fresh weight (FW) of shoots (0.52 g) were found under the treatment supplemented with PEG stress of 4% concentration. It was followed by the results obtained from treatments containing 2, 1, and 0.5% of PEG 6000 concentration, respectively. The minimum percentage of shooting (~82.5%), mean shoots length (4.1 cm), mean number of nodes (4.4), mean number of leaves (13.1), and fresh weight (FW) of shoots (0.16 g) were shown by the MS medium lacking PEG 6000, i.e., the control treatment.
