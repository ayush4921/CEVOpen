<p>The correct integrant colony was grown in 20 ml of BMGY medium at 30°C, 220 rpm for 24 h. The yeast cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,500×

 <sub>600</sub> of 1.0. The expression of rFIP-mco was induced by adding 100% methanol to a final concentration of 0.5% every 12 h for 72 h. The secreted rFIP-mco was collected and purified 
 <italic>via</italic> His-affinity Ni-NTA chromatography (Qiagen, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols, and was dialyzed third times against PBS in the total period of 18 h. The total rFIP-mco protein mass was detected using BCA kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China), whereas the protein mass of the purified rFIP-mco was adjusted with extinction coefficient predicted according to the amino acid sequence (
