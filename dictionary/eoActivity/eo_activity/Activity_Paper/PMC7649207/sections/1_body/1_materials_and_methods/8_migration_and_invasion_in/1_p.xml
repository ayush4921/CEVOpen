<p>Cell migration was assessed using wound healing assay. The cells were grown until 80-90% confluent in 6-well plates, at which time a 10-ml sterile pipette tip was used to create a scratch wound in the cell monolayer. Media containing 2% FBS was then added to the cells for 24 h, after which a phase-contrast microscope (OLYMPUS CKX53) was used to image cells. To assess cell invasion, 8 μm pore size inserts were used for invasion assay with the upper surface of the membrane being coated using Matrigel (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) based on provided directions. The protein rFIP-mco was added into A549 and HepG2 cells at the concentration of 0, 5, 15, and 30 μg/ml, respectively. After coating, 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were added to the upper chamber for 24 h at 37°C, and then those cells that had not invaded were removed using a cotton swab. Methanol was used to fix invasive cells at the bottom of the Matrigel, followed by leucocrystal violet staining and counting of cells
