 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH was collected from a local farm affiliated to Yunnan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yunnan Province, China. 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH was sequenced with a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy. The sequencing data was submitted to NCBI database (NCBI Sequencing Program VOVZ00000000). Yeast extract, peptone, macro agar, yeast nitrogen base (YNB) with ammonium sulfate without amino acids, biotin, buffered glycerol-complex medium (BMGY), glycerol and methanol were purchased from Sangon (Shanghai, China). Selective marker zeocin was purchased from Invitrogen (California, USA). LB agar medium supplemented with kanamycin was used for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B cultivation, yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) supplemented with zeocin was used for 
 <italic>P. pastoris</italic> X33 cultivation, BMGY was used for the recombinant FIP-mco expression.
