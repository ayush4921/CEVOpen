<p>Cells were added into cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts by NE-PER ® Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents. Protein concentrations of the extracts were measured by BCA assay. Rabbit anti-IκBα antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit anti-β-Actin antibody and anti-Histone 3 antibody were purchased from Abcam (Catalog number ab8227, ab1791). Mouse anti-NF
 <bold>-</bold>κB p65 subunit antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz. Western blot analyses were performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Actin level in cytoplasmic extraction and Histone 3 in nuclear extraction were detected to show equal protein loading.
