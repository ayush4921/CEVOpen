 <italic>Morchella conica</italic> is an edible mushroom belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Morchella</italic>. It prefers humid areas covered by deciduous and coniferous forests subjected to seasonal flooding (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). It has been consumed as tasted food. Despite the popularity of morels, the difficulties of culturing wild 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> make them very expensive in food markets (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). On its molecular study, several components isolated from 
 <italic>M. conica</italic>, including polysaccharides, have been reported to exhibit immunomodulatory, antitumor, and antioxidant activities. For example, a kind of polysaccharide NMCP-2 from 
 <italic>M. conica Pers</italic>. shows antioxidant activities against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in human embryonic kidney cells (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Another two kinds of polysaccharides from 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> demonstrate their inhibition on nitric oxide production in macrophages (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, numerous aspects of their biological features such as life cycle and ecology remain poorly understood, especially little is known on molecular study of the species.
