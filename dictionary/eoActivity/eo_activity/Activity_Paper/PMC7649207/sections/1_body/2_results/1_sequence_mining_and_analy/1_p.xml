<p>Local BLAST using reported FIPs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Table S1</bold>
 </xref>) against 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH genome (NCBI Sequencing program VOVZ00000000) revealed one predicted protein (scaffold3t326) with significant sequence similarity to ACA (percent identity: 50%) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and YZP (percent identity: 41.6%) (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This predicted protein, FIP-mco, consisted of 133 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 13.57 kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 4.53. The amino acid composition of FIP-mco lacks His and Met but is rich in Ala, Thr, and Val residues, which is similar to the typical FIP sequence characteristics (
