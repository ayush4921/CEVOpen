<p>Along with 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH, we chose the other six reported genomes: 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), 
 <italic>L. edodes</italic> (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), 
 <italic>L. tigrinus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), 
 <italic>M. importuna</italic> (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), 
 <italic>C. cinerea</italic> (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), and 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) for further bioinformatics analysis. It revealed five homologs in the genomes by BLASTp using the amino acid sequences of ACA and YZP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">
  <bold>Figure 1</bold>
 </xref>) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>–
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Secondary structure prediction of FIP-mco and its homologs showed high structural similarity between the seven predicted proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">
  <bold>Figure 1</bold>
 </xref>). All of the proteins consist of two α helices and seven β sheets, indicating a similar folding pattern which could give insight into similar structural motifs or potential function between the proteins. Through the construction of the phylogenetic tree, it showed that FIPs from 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic> were clustered into one lineage, indicating that they are highly conserved among the genus. Interestingly, FIP-tvc and FIP-cru were also clustered in the lineage. FIP-dsq2, FIP-bbo, and FIP-ppl were clustering in a separate lineage. Above FIPs were included in a primary lineage compared with other relatively isolated FIPs, such as FIP-nha and FIP-lrh. FIP-mco, PCP, ACA, and YZP were clustered into another lineage, and there was substantial evolutionary distance between them and the FIPs mentioned above. The results indicated that FIPs were likely derived from two separate ancestors (
