<p>Three cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were detected to evaluate the immunomodulatory activity of rFIP-mco. The results showed that the cell viability of the THP1 cells were almost not affected by rFIP-mco at different concentrations (

 </xref>). By the ELISA assay, it showed that rFIP-mco could significantly reduce the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (

  <bold>Figures 7B–D</bold>
 </xref>). The protein rFIP-mco (30 μg/ml) reduced the expression level of TNF-α from 717.10 to 373.52 pg/ml. The expression level of IL-1β was reduced from 567.78 to 362.16 pg/ml when added with 30 μg/ml rFIP-mco. For IL-6, the value was 404.55 to 227.25 pg/ml. In the three inflammatory cytokines, rFIP-mco had a more significant effect on TNF-α than on IL-1β and IL-6. In this experiment, the immunomodulatory protein rFIP-mco had no influence on the cell viability of the THP-1 cells but reduced the expression level of the three cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 significantly in THP-1 cells.
