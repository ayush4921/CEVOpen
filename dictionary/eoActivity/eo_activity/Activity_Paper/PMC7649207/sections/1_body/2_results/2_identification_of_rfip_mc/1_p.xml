<p>By BLAST, a new FIP candidate protein was found in 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH. FIP-mco encoding gene was obtained and synthesized from the sequenced 
 <italic>M. conica</italic> SH, designated FIP-mco. FIP-mco comprised 399 bp with 133 amino acids. After expression in 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> X33 and subsequent purification, the protein sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. A single band of rFIP-mco was observed near 13 kDa in SDS-PAGE (

 </xref>), which was approximately the calculated theoretical size of the protein. Western blot using 6 Ã— His-tag antibody suggested the recombinant protein had been expressed and possessed the immune recognition (

 </xref>). By determination of the SDS-PAGE and Western blot, the recombinant protein of FIP-mco (rFIP-mco) was successfully expressed, purified, and identified.
