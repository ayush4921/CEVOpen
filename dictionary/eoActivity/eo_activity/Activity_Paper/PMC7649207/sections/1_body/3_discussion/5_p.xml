<p>In the study of biological activity of rFIP-mco, it can significantly inhibit the proliferation of A549 and HepG2 cancer cells at all the set gradient concentrations. The protein rFIP-mco can remarkably inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells at the concentration of 5 μg/ml, which is a relative low effecting concentration reported to date. The effect of rFIP-mco was especially apparent in HepG2 cells, which was similar to that of some FIPs such as rFIP-nha (

In the determination of the effect on cell viability of the THP1 cells by rFIP-mco at different concentrations, it was found that cell viability of the THP-1 cell was almost not affected. About the different effects of rFIP-mco on A549, HepG2, and the THP-1 cells, the possible cause may be that THP-1 belongs to a kind of blood malignancy while A549 and HepG2 belong to solid tumor. The functional targets for rFIP-mco may be different in different cancer cells, or may express higher in A549 and HepG2 cancer cells while expressing lower or with no expression in the THP1 cells. This also conforms to previous report, which demonstrates that the biological activities of FIPs are quite varied despite high sequence and structure conservation (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It was considered to be associated with the structural differences at the loop DE and loop FG (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Moreover, structural differences at the N- terminal α-helix region may be also an important factor in cell surface recognition (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Besides, we also studied the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cancer cells. The results showed that the proliferation of A549 and HepG2 cancer cells may be inhibited through G0/G1 to S-phase arrest and increased apoptosis. According to previous report, rFIP-ppl (rFIP from 
 <italic>Postia placenta</italic>) could effectively induce MGC823 and HepG2 tumor cell apoptosis in a dose dependent manner, and the apoptotic effects were cell specific (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which was in accordance with the result in this study. As the increase of the concentration of rFIP-mco, the ratio of apoptotic cells also went ascend. At the concentration of 30 μg/ml, the effect on HepG2 apoptotic cells are more significant, which is consistent with the result of cytotoxicity assay. Moreover, rFIP-mco can apparently repress A549 and HepG2 cancer cell migration and invasion, and rFIP-mco showed a stronger effect on the migration and invasion of A549 cells compared with that on HepG2 cells. The results demonstrated potential application prospect of FIP-mco as antitumor therapeutic agent both in cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
