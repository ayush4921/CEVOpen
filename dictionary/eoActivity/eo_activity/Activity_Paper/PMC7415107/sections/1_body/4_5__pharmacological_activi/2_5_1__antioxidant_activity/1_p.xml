 <italic>Quercus</italic> genus has been reported to possess antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. A recent study by Arina and Harisun [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] has evaluated the effect of extraction temperatures on the tannin content and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Quercus infectoria</italic> (
 <italic>Manjakani)</italic>. According to the result, the extract gives high DPPH scavenging capacity with an IC50 value of 0.064 mg/ml at the extraction temperature of 75°C. Another study showed that the thermotreatment and extraction technique had a determinant role in the antioxidant efficiency of 
 <italic>Quercus cerris</italic> L. wood [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The antioxidant activities of leaves and acorn of 
 <italic>Q. suber</italic> were investigated using 3 different solvents (hexane, methanol, and water). In this case, the aqueous extracts displayed the highest antioxidant activity, based on DPPH and ABTS assays. This antioxidant activity might be ascribed to the presence of phytochemical compounds such as phenolic compounds in the acorn extracts [
