 <italic>Q. sideroxyla</italic> infusions have exhibited the highest antioxidant activity followed by 
 <italic>Q. eduardii</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. durifolia</italic> infusions, based on Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>β</italic>-sitosterol-D-glucoside and condensed tannin fractions 
 <bold>(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)</bold> isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Quercus phillyraeoides</italic> have also been studied for their antioxidant potential. The highest DPPH scavenging capacity was exhibited by fraction 
 <bold>5</bold>, followed by fractions 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, and 
 <bold>4</bold> with IC50 values of 9.34, 10.53, 10.84, 12.98, and 13.12 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Furthermore, Amessis-Ouchemoukh et al. [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] investigated the antioxidant activity of carob pods (
 <italic>Ceratonia siliqua</italic>), white figs (
 <italic>Ficus carica</italic>), and acorn (
 <italic>Quercus ilex</italic>). Their results showed that 
 <italic>Quercus ilex</italic> and 
 <italic>Ceratonia siliqua</italic> were very effective in scavenging DPPH and ABTS radicals, 93.93 ± 0.13 and 82.45 ± 0.23% in the DPPH assay and 83.09 ± 0.07 and 81.51 ± 0.12% in the ABTS assay, respectively. As expected in this research, the obtained inhibitions were better than those displayed by standards BHA, catechin, quercetin, and trolox with 26.63 ± 0.56, 56.09 ± 0.24, 70.43 ± 0.15, and 61.21 ± 1.15%, respectively. Extracts from other 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species have been also tested. As an example, Sánchez-Burgos et al. [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] showed that aqueous extracts obtained from the leaves of different white 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species (
 <italic>Q. grisea, Q. laeta, Q. obtusata, and Q. resinosa</italic>) exhibited high radical scavenging activity against (DPPH) and HO• radicals.
