<p>Perez et al. [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] studied the cytotoxic activity of 17 triterpenoids isolated from oak heartwood of 
 <italic>Quercus robur</italic> against human prostate cancer (PC3) and human estrogen-dependent breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines and lymphocytes derived from human peripheral blood. The obtained results demonstrate that breast cancer cells (MCF-7) were the most affected by triterpenoids, with roburgenic acid, being the most active compound (IC50 = 19.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). The authors also reported the selectivity for some triterpenoids against lymphocytes, exhibiting an IC50 &gt; 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, while active against cancer cells. Moreover, the genotoxicity of 
 <italic>Q. resinosa</italic> leaves extracts was evaluated on HeLa cells by the single-cell electrophoresis assay (comet assay), indicating that phytochemical compounds present in extracts obtained from their decoctions increase the oxidative process and other damage to DNA in transformed human cells [
