<p>Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] reported that acorns (
 <italic>Quercus liaotungensis</italic>) and their galloyl triterpenes exhibited stronger antiproliferative effects against t-HSC/Cl-6 cells than the reference silymarin, suggesting its potential for being developed into antihepatic fibrosis food or medicine. In the same year, Singh and Bisht [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] investigated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> hepatoprotective activity of the root extract of 
 <italic>Q. oblongata D. DON</italic> and clearly showed the positive effect of the ethanolic extract at the dose of 300 mg/kg in comparison to the reference silymarin. Similarly, it was stated that the administration of 300 mg/kg of the 
 <italic>Q. dilatata</italic> extract displayed protective effect against bisphenol A- (BPA-) induced hepatotoxicity by restoring hepatic inflammation towards normal [

 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] investigated the hepatoprotective effects of acorn extracts on carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage in rats. Their analyses showed that the aqueous extract at 250 and 500 mg/kg displayed excellent hepatoprotective potential, indicating that this solvent is a better alternative, with no toxic effects. In addition, several studies have shown that 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> spp. exhibited hepatoprotective effects [
