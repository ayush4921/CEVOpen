<p>The main compound found in the methanol leaves extract of 
 <italic>Quercus suber</italic> was gentisic acid [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. However, another study performed by Yin et al. [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], who analyzed the 50% ethanol crude extract of 
 <italic>Mongolian oak cups</italic>, demonstrated that ellagic acid (EA) and kaempferol derivatives were the main phenolic components. Moreover, Sari et al. [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] reported five compounds, which are lyoniresinol-9-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-xylopyranoside, lyoniresinol- 9-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-glucopyranoside, (-)-8-chlorocatechin, polydatin, and cocciferoside that occur in the 
 <italic>Quercus coccifera</italic> bark.
