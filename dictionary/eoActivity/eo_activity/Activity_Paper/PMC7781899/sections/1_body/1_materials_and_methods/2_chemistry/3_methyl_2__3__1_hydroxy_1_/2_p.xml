<p>Methyl 2-isothiocyanatobenzoate 
 <bold>1</bold> (0.193 g, 0.001 mol) was allowed to react with L-norephedrine (2-amino-1-phenylpropan-1-ol) (0.151 g, 0.001 mol) 
 <bold>2</bold> in NMR tube in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> and measured immediately for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR to give 
 <bold>3</bold>. When the reaction was carried out in the presence of chloroform containing a catalytic amount of triethylamine the reaction gave 
 <bold>4</bold> instead of 
 <bold>3</bold> at room temperature. The product 
 <bold>4</bold> was crystallized from ethanol. Derivative 
 <bold>3</bold> was rapidly converted to 
 <bold>4</bold> at room temperature.
