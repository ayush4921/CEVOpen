  <p>Herbal extract-induced asexual parasite (AS) growth inhibition. A graphical representation of the difference in the number of asexual parasites (AS; rings, trophozoites, and schizonts) identified in each thin smear expressed as a percent of the parasites identified in the control untreated culture (% inhibition). A total number of 5000 RBCs were counted in each thin smear. The data represents the mean (SEM) of the observed growth inhibition.</p>
