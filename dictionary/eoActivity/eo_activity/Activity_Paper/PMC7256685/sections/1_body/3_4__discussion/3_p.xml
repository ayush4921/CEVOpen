<p>The 50% effective concentration (EC

 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cordifolia</italic> fruit against the 3D7 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> parasite strain using the parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay was found to be 4.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] which is similar to 5.81 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of the NF54 strain that was obtained in this study (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Supplementary file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">2</xref>). Another study in Ghana estimated the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for a 50% ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cordifolia</italic> leaves against the 3D7 parasite to be 14 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml using a similar SYBR Green 1 assay [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The main difference in IC
 <sub>50</sub> values could be attributed to the solvent [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], as the active agent in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cordifolia</italic> is ellagic acid [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which is more soluble in water than ethanol. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cordifolia</italic> exhibited a ‘moderate' activity against the artemisinin-resistant parasite (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Supplementary file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">3</xref>), which is an excellent indication that it has a potent antimalarial activity that could be used effectively to treat artemisinin-resistant parasites. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>indica</italic> exhibited a ‘low' activity against the artemisinin-resistant parasite (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Supplementary file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">2</xref>), which suggests that it would not be a good candidate to effectively treat an infection that comprises of artemisinin-resistant parasites. Both 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>cordifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>indica</italic> however exhibited a similar activity against both the artemisinin-sensitive and artemisinin-resistant parasite isolates, suggesting that their possible modes of action against the malaria parasite are different from the mode of action of artesunate, which exhibited a 10-fold difference in 50% inhibitory concentration against the artermisinin-sensitive and artemisinin-resistant parasites (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
