<p>The recent reports of artemisinin-resistant and artemisinin-tolerant 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>falciparum</italic>) parasites call for more innovative methods to control and eventually eliminate malaria [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Gametocytes, the sexual transmissible forms of the malaria parasite, have been suggested to be produced at each round of asexual replication in the host [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Gametocytes develop through five developmental stages: early-stage (stages I, II, and III) also referred to as young gametocytes and late-stage (stages IV and V)/mature gametocytes. Gametocyte development is known to last 10 days in vivo [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; however, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, early-stage gametocytes can be distinguished from asexual parasites after 7 days of continuous culturing [
