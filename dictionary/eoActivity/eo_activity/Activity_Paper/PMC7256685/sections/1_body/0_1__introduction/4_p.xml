<p>Many studies have determined the antimalarial activity of herbal extracts against the asexual disease-causing parasite using the standard 72-hour drug assay [

In this study, the short- and long-term effects of aqueous extracts of four selected herbal plants collected from the Western Region of Ghana on malaria parasite growth in vitro were determined using artemisinin-resistant IPC_4912, the artemisinin sensitive CamWT_C580Y and the chloroquine-sensitive NF54
