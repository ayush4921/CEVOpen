<p>Synchronized ring-stage parasites were obtained by treating a culture containing more than 5% ring-stage parasites with a solution of 5% sorbitol. Two days (48 hours) after synchronization, the cultures, which were predominantly ring-stage parasites were plated at 2% for the SYBR Green 1 assay or 1% parasitaemia for the long-term parasite exposure assay.</p>
