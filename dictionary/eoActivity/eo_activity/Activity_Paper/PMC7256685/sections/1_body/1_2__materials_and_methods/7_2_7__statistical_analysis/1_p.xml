<p>For the SYBR Green 1 drug assays, the data obtained from the herbal extract-treated uninfected RBC was used as the background and subtracted from the corresponding infected RBC dataset. Data was transformed, normalized, and subjected to a nonfit linear regression test (log(inhibitor) vs. normalized response test) to enable estimation of the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for each herbal product.
