<p>Malaria parasites caused more human deaths and diseases than all other eukaryotic pathogens combined [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In fact, there were about 228 million cases of malaria worldwide and 405 000 malaria deaths in 2018 with children under 5 years of age still the most vulnerable group affected [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In spite of being manageable, malaria continues to exert a heavy toll on mankind. The disease disproportionately affects the poor and disadvantaged people, who have limited access to health facilities and can barely afford the recommended treatment in most countries [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Cameroon continues to be a malaria endemic country where it is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among the most vulnerable groups [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Artemisinin-based combination therapy has significantly reduced malaria morbidity and mortality. However, recently reported failures in treatment and parasite resistances [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], coupled with the fact that the cost of the current antimalarial drugs is prohibitive in poor settings, stress the urgent need for new safe and affordable antimalarial agents.
