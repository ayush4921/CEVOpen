<p id="Par15">Sucrose synthase was assayed in a mixed solution contained 100 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 5 mM uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG), 10 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 5 mM fructose 6-phosphate, and 0.3 mL of the sample. The reaction mixtures were allowed to stand for 30 min at 37 ℃, 200 µl of 30% (w/v) KOH added to terminate the reactions. Placing the tubes in water bath for 10 min to destroying the remaining fructose 6-phosphate and fructose. After cooling, 0.1% (w⁄v) resorcinol of 0.25 ml and H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> of 2.5 ml were added to each test tube and left for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 520 nm following the procedure as modified from Verma et al.
