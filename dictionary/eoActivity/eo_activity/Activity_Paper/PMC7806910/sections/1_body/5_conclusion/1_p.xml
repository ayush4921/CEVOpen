<p id="Par42">In conclusion, Si regulates C and N metabolism and alters physiological activities, particularly in plants subjected to NaCl stress conditions, which could alleviate adverse effects induced by salt stress on 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic>. Specifically, Si significantly increased the total sugar and total N contents in 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> due to balanced regulation of related enzymes, and the increase in total sugar and total N also played a protective role in osmoregulation under salt stress. Si could alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress and then improve plant growth. Therefore, we studied the relationship between Si and C and N metabolism under different concentrations of NaCl, pertinently regulating key enzyme activity through external conditions, to obtain optima for the Câ€“N metabolism of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic>. Additionally, this test provides a theoretical basis for the actual production of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> to improve yield and quality, which has very important practical value to improve the absorbability of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> in saline. Future research should further explore the possible mechanisms of Si uptake and transport in 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> to exploit Si-induced beneficial effects. This will allow us to better understand the interactions between Si application and plant responses. This information will be used in fertilization practices to enhance stress tolerance in crop systems.
