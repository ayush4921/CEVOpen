<p id="Par27">As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the root dry weight per plant of 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic> in 2015 was significantly larger than that in 2014, and the root dry weight tended to increase gradually with the passage of time. In the growth period, the application of Si significantly increased the dry weight of roots under salt stress conditions. Adding Si under salt stress resulted in maximum increases recorded of 85.39%, compared with the control in both years.
