<p>The deciduous tree 
 <italic>Rhus potaninii</italic> is 5–8 m tall. It grows on the hill or mountain forests at an altitude of 900–2500 m. The 
 <italic>R. potaninii</italic> belongs to Anacardiaceae family of Sapindales order. The Galla chinensis, induced by infection with Gallnut Aphid on 
 <italic>R. chinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>R. potaninii</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. punjabensis</italic>, is a traditional Chinese medicine (National Pharmacopoeia Committee 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It is known to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects (Sun et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In recent years, 
 <italic>Galla chinensis</italic> has attracted the attention of drug researchers at home and abroad because of its unique advantages such as strong pharmacological effect, extensive sources, and strong selectivity (Karimi-Khouzani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
 <?page-start page-number="2426"?> Although there are many pharmacology related research of it, there are few researches on its genome. Therefore, our research provides a basis for the study of the coevolution of Gallnut Aphid and host tree and the further study on phylogenetic evolution of 
 <italic>R. potaninii</italic>.
