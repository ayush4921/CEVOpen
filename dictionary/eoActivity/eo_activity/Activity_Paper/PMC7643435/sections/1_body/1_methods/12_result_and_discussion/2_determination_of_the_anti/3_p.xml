<p id="Par39">To understand the role of geraniol, a major constituent in CKEO, in antimicrobial activity, we compared the antibacterial activity of CKEO and geraniol against different pathogens. MICs of CKEO for all tested organisms were found to be lower than the MICs of geraniol. The MICs of geraniol in literature ranged between 0.5–1.4 mg/mL against different pathogens, which support the result of the present study [
