<p>We employed three analysis models to verify the appropriateness of assumptions made in this study and to validate study findings. “Model 1” analysis discovered the ORs among all IndSIC sections using “housewife” as “Reference 1” and Section S (Other services as member of organization, repair of household) as “Reference 2”. Housewives, the “Reference 1”, were considered to have the most similar tasks in all settings, less probability of contact to workplace exposures, the majority of them being non-smokers, and them being at a lower risk of lung cancer compared to other occupations [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The limitation of this reference group is that they were not part of IndSIC and that they were all females. Section S (Other services as member of organization, repair of household) was chosen to be “Reference 2” because it had the most similar OR to “Reference 1”.
