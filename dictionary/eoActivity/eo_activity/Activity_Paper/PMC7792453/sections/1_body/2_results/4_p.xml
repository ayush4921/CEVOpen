<p>When several sections were subdivided into divisions or groups in “Model 2”, subjects who had worked in Division A01 (crop, animal production, and hunting) (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.36–11.25), Division C20 (chemical and chemical product) (OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.09–21.60), and Section F (construction) (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.20–6.37) had a significantly higher chance of developing lung cancer compared to “Reference 1”. Division A 02 and 03 (forestry and fishing) of Section A did not show an increased chance of developing lung cancer. Compared to “Reference 2”, subjects in Division A01 (crop, animal production, and hunting) (OR = 3.7, 95% CI = 1.20–11.32) and Section F (construction) (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.07–6.14) maintained a higher chance of developing lung cancer, while subjects working in Division C20 (chemical and chemical product) did not show a statistically significant odds ratio (
