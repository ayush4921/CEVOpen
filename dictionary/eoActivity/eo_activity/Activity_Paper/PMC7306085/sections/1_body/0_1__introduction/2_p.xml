<p>The misuse of chloroquine in the management of malaria has led to the development of chloroquine-resistant parasites worldwide [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Kenya, the use of chloroquine has been discontinued as the first line treatment for malaria due to the prevalence of resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is currently the only available treatment option for malaria as the quinolines (quinine, chloroquine, and mefloquine) have been reported to cause cardiotoxicity, and the malarial parasites have already developed sturdy resistance to them [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Unfortunately, resistance of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to artemisinin has also been reported elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].
