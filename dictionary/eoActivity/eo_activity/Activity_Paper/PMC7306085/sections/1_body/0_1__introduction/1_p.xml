<p>Globally, malaria continues to be in the top list of the major global health challenges. A global estimate of 655,000 malarial deaths was reported in 2010 of which 91% were in Africa and 86% of these were children under 5 years of age [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Africa is particularly more susceptible, and conservative estimates cited that malaria causes up to 2 million deaths annually in Africa [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The World Health Organization reported that about 2 billion people in over 100 countries are exposed to malaria, and the situation is exacerbated on the African continent which is characterized by limited access to health services and chronic poverty [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In East Africa and Kenya particularly, malaria remains endemic in the Lake Victoria basin and the coast with the country's highest rate of infection at 27% (6 million cases) in 2015 from 38% in 2010 [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The Kenyan population at risk of malaria as of 2016 was estimated at 100% [

 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> and
