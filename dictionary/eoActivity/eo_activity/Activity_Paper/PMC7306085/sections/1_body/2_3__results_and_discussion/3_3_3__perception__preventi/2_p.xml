<p>Except in the case of life-threatening illnesses or where there is concern that there may be some supernatural forces in the aetiology of the disease, malaria and its symptoms (periodic fever, sweating, headache, backache, and chills) are treated primarily using decoctions and infusions of plants. Whenever it is thought that malaria is due to supernatural forces, diviners (such as 
 <italic>Orgoiyon</italic> among the Tugen and 
 <italic>Oloiboni</italic> among the Maasai) are consulted [

 <italic>Oloiboni</italic> for treatment of malaria or other ailment(s) thought to be due to witchcraft [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. According to indigenous diagnoses, malaria is due to the presence of excess bile in the body, so the bile has to be expelled before healing can take place. Thus, purgation is regarded as the key treatment regimen for malaria [
