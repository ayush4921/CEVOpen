<p>Some antimalarial plants were reported as contraindicated to pregnant women and children (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Gathirwa et al. [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that the posology of antimalarial herbal preparations in Kenya sometimes is dictated by the plant to be used, the traditional herbalist, the sex and the age of the patient, reiterating that pregnant women and children are often given lower dosages compared to other adults. This indicates the existence of research gaps with regard to the potential toxicities and corresponding counteracting mechanisms of antimalarial plants in Kenya. This gap represents a barrier to effective development and exploitation of indigenous antimalarial plants. In essence, some of the plants listed are reported to exhibit marked toxicity. 
 <italic>Teclea simplicifoli</italic> (roots) is regarded to be poisonous by rural Kenyans [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (L.) G. Don is another such plant known to house neurotoxic alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Vincristine and vinblastine in this plant are highly cytotoxic antimitotics that block mitosis in metaphase after binding to mitotic microtubules [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Side effects such as kidney impairment, nausea, myelosuppression, constipation, paralytic ileus, ulcerations of the mouth, hepatocellular damage, abdominal cramps, pulmonary fibrosis, urinary retention, amenorrhoea, azoospermia, orthostatic hypotension, and hypertension [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] have been documented for antitumor drugs vincristine and vinblastine derived from this plant. These observations could partly explain why some antimalarial herbal preparations in Kenya are ingested in small amounts, applied topically, or are used for bathing. This gives a justification for the investigation of the plants for their potential toxicity.
