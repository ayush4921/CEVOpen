<p>The diuretic effects have been attributed to the flavonoid fraction (particularly quercetin and its derivatives), which was shown to inhibit the neutral endopeptidase, resulting in an enhanced urinary flow [

 <xref rid="B93-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The inhibition of neutral endopeptidase leads to an increase in the plasma concentration of natriuretic peptides, which have strong natriuretic properties [

(1991) found that this flavonoid fraction (25 mg/kg b.w.) increases the urine output in rats by about 88%, and causes a decrease in the excretion of sodium and potassium, accompanied by an increase in calcium excretion [
