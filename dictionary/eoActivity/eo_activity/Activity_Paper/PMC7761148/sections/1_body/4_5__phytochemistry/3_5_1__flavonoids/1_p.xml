<p>Among the flavonoids, rutin, quercetrin, astragalin, nicotiflorin, biorobin, and narcissin have been considered “the most representative” [
 <xref rid="B62-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], and they are accompanied by their aglycons [
 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. More recently, flavanones aglycones and glycosides have also been detected and quantified in the different parts of the plant: eriodictyol (the largest amount in the flowers, followed by leaves and then stems, mostly as glycosides), naringenin (similar quantitative distribution in flowers, leaves, and stems, mostly as glycosides), and very small amounts of hesperitin (not assessed separately in each aerial parts) [
 <xref rid="B98-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Eriodictyol and naringenin are present in the form of both R and S enantiomers, whereas hesperitin was detected only as the S enantiomer [
 <xref rid="B98-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. All flavonoid heterosides seem to be 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glycosides, as for the majority of 
 <italic>Solidago</italic> species (the notable exception being 
 <italic>S. graminifolia</italic> (L.) Salisb, in which mono- and di-C-glycosylflavonoids have also been reported [
 <xref rid="B58-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], but which now is considered a synonym for the 
 <italic>Euthamia graminifolia</italic> (L.) Nutt [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). The presence of flavonoid-C-heterosides in 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> has also been occasionally claimed in secondary sources [
 <xref rid="B59-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], but we could not locate a primary reference reporting them. Cyanidin-3-gentiobioside is the main anthocyanin present in the leaves, but at least one other cyaniding-glycosyde was reported in very small amounts [
 <xref rid="B99-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Flavonoid glycosides tend to be better extracted in ethanol of 70% or higher concentrations [
 <xref rid="B83-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. As mentioned above, hyperoside is considered the key flavonoid by the European Pharmacopoeia [
 <xref rid="B81-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, in one paper, quercitrin was the major phytochemical from a quantitative standpoint [
 <xref rid="B84-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], whereas other sources reported rutin as the dominant flavonoid [
 <xref rid="B59-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] (a mean content 196.42 mg 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> reported by [
 <xref rid="B59-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]). A qualitative and quantitative comparative study of flavonoids from extracts of four 
 <italic>Solidago</italic> spp. reported in Romanian flora was carried out by Dobjanschi L. et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], who found a total flavonoid content for 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> of 4.06%, expressed as rutin. They also found that for 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic>, specific was the presence of rutin and hyperoside, whereas quercitrin (unlike the findings of V. Kraujalienė et al.) was absent [
 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Spasmolytic effects (as discussed below) [
 <xref rid="B31-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B97-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], diuretic activity [
 <xref rid="B10-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], have been attributed to the flavonoids, and other effects have also been specifically ascribed (at least partially) to some flavonoids, e.g., antiadipogenic effects to kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside [
 <xref rid="B100-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>].
