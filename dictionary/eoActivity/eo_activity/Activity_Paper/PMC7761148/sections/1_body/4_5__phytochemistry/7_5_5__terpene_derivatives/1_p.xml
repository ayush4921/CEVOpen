<p>A number of over 60 compounds have been described in the essential oil obtained from the flowering tops of 
 <italic>S. virgaurea</italic> L. collected in Poland [
 <xref rid="B74-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], whereas in specimens from Lithuania, 106 compounds were identified in flowers and 95 in leaves [
 <xref rid="B105-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The key compounds (as found in three samples from three different sites of Poland) were the monoterpenes α-pinene (27.4–34.1%), myrcene (7.8–17.9%), β-pinene (5.4–7.5%), limonene (3.0–14.1%), and sabinene (0.4–11.8%), as well as the sesquiterpenes germacrene D (8.2–17.0%), and in smaller amounts α–humulene, β-caryophyllene, and α–muurolene [
 <xref rid="B74-biomolecules-10-01619" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In Lithuanin specimens, the composition reported recently was rather different: in the leaves, the most important compounds detected were caryophyllene oxide, trans-verbenol, spathulenol, humulene epoxide II, α –pinene (only 5.21%), and germacrene D; in flowers of the same origin, the most important compounds were caryophyllene oxide, humulene epoxide II, germacrene D, trans-verbenol, spathulenol, and bornyl acetate [
