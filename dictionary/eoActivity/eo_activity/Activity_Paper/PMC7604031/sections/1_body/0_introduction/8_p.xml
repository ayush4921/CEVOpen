<p id="par0060">For the industrial production of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, the harvesting time and processing in producing areas are considered as the key factors for the quality formation of medicinal materials (
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Since 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> is a perennial herb, its stele of the root gradually decays from the base after growing for about 4 years (known as “hollow roots”) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Although it has been recorded in the classical prescriptions and the medical classics that the hollow roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> has the best curative effect in TCM, the theoretical basis of this statement remains unclear. Meanwhile, the factor of harvesting time is very important for the quality and yield of medicinal materials as well as the income of farmers during the cultivation process. At present, the farmers and herbalists believe that harvesting time at two and a half years or three years can ensure the best quality, the highest yield, and the highest land use efficiency for 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. However, there is no clear evidence to show whether the contents of medicinal active ingredients of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> harvested at such time have the highest levels. In addition, the primary processing in producing areas (removing impurities, drying, slicing, etc.) is considered as another key factor that affects the contents of medicinal active ingredients. Previous studies have shown that the contents of medicinal active ingredients in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> after harvesting are closely related to enzyme activities in roots (

 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016b</xref>). The active ingredients such as baicalin and wogonoside in fresh roots are easily reduced in enzyme solution under humid environment or washing and soaking in water (
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Liu, 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic research on the effects of post-harvest treatment and processing technology on the contents of medicinal active ingredients to reveal such mechanisms. Taken together, it is of great theoretical significance and practical prospect to reveal the effects of different processing technology on the medicinal active ingredients under the background of increasing market demand for 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>.
