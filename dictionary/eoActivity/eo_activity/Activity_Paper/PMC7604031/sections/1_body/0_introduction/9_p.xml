<p id="par0065">On the basis of our previous research in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> over the past 15 years (

 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2013</xref>), in this study we conducted a comprehensive study from the following aspects by taking eight medicinal active ingredients from the root of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> as indicators: (1) the contents of active ingredients in roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> from growing 1â€“15 years were compared and analyzed to determine the optimal harvest time; (2) six medicinal active ingredients in the parts of stele and cortex in roots of 2-year and 15-year old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were compared and analyzed to reveal the differences of active ingredients in different growth years; (3) the dynamic changes of the contents of active ingredients in fresh-crush and fresh-cut roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> at room temperature were compared and analyzed to reveal the influence of post-harvest treatment on the contents of active ingredients; (4) the effects of six different post-harvest treatment on the contents of active ingredients were systematically designed and compared to determine the best primary processing technology. Collectively, the above results will provide a theoretical basis for the scientific harvest and the primary processing in the producing area of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, and provide a reference for the selection of optimal processing technology of medicinal materials for the industrial production of medicinal crops.
