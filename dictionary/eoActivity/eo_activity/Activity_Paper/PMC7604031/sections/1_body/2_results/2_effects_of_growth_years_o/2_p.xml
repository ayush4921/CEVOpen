<p id="par0130">To investigate the effects of growth years on the contents of active ingredients in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, the roots with different growth years (ranging from 1–15) were collected and then dried at 80 °C in oven after removing sediment and impurities. The contents of eight medicinal active ingredients were further estimated (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The results showed that the contents of baicalin in roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> in different growth years were all higher than 12 % (corresponding to 120 mg/g), which met the minimum requirement of the Pharmacopoeia (2015 version; 9%, corresponding to 90 mg/g) and could be used as medicinal materials (
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">National Pharmacopoeia Committee, 2015</xref>). Further ANOVA analysis showed that the content of baicalin exhibited a "V" trend changing with growth years (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It is relatively high at both ends (2 years old and older than 7 years old) but low at the middle period (3–5 years old). In general, the total amount of the four main active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin) (13.5 %, corresponding to 135 mg/g; 
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">National Pharmacopoeia Committee, 2020</xref>) in roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> showed the following trend: 15 years &gt; 9 years &gt; 2 years &gt; 7 years &gt; 12 years &gt; 3 years &gt; 5 years &gt; 4 years &gt;=1 year. Among them, the total content of the four main active ingredients in 15-year-old roots was as high as 190 mg/g, followed by that of 9-year-old roots (185.57 mg/g). The content of 2-year-old roots reached 180 mg/g, which was significantly higher than that of 1-year-old roots (149.73 mg/g) (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤  0.05). For the other four active ingredients (scutellarin, scutellarein, chrysin, and apigenin) with lower contents, they also showed significant differences among different growth years (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The contents of scutellarein and scutellarin were significantly lower than those of all the four main active ingredients (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt;  0.001). For the former, its content continued to increase in the first three years and remained basically stable after the fourth year. While for the latter, its content continued to decrease with growth years, and reached the lowest level (0.03 %) in 15-year-old roots. Conversely, for chrysin which is the precursor of baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin in the flavonoid synthesis pathway, its content reached the highest level (about 0.08 %) in 15-year-old roots.
