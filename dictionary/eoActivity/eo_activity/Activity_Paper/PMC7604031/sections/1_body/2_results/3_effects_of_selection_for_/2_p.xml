<p id="par0135">To further reveal the mechanism regarding the "V" trend of the contents of the four main active ingredients, we next investigated the disparity of active ingredients in different parts (cortex and stele). For 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, as the growth period increases, the part of stele in the whole root gradually decays, and the proportion of cortex increases rapidly. Our results showed that the contents of active ingredients including baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin in cortex were significantly higher than those in stele (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤  0.05, 
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ). Thus, the contents of older roots (rotten stele, older than 4 years) were significantly higher than those of younger roots (non-rotten-stele, not older than 4 years). The proportion of stele and cortex in the root of 2-years-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> was balanced, so the content of four active components retained high levels. However, for 3- to 5-year-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, the enlargement of roots was mainly due to the rapid growth of stele. Therefore, the contents of active ingredients were relatively low. When 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> grows for more than three years, the part of stele in the whole roots begin to rot and the proportion of cortex increases year by year. Meanwhile, the contents of six main active ingredients in 15-year-old roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were significantly higher than those in 2-year-old roots (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Further comparative analysis of the contents of six active ingredients in cortex and stele revealed that the contents of five medicinal active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, scutellarin, baicalein, wogonin) in the cortex of 2-year-old and 15-year-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were all significantly higher than those of the stele (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤  0.05) except for scutellarein. However, the contents of baicalin, wogonoside, scutellarein in the stele of the roots of 2-year-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were all significantly higher than those of the cortex. The contents of baicalein and wogoninin in the stele of 15-year-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were all significantly higher than those of 2-year-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. The above results indicated that the contents of active ingredients in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> tended to decrease with the increase of growth years (more than 3 years). Since the stele began to rot after several years, the proportion of cortex in roots increased year by year. Due to the great difference of the contents of active ingredients in cortex and stele, the contents of six medicinal active ingredients in the whole root of 2-year-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> was lower than that of 15-year-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, but it was higher than that of 3- to 5-year-old 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. Collectively, these results will give reasonable interpretations why 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> with rotten stele is taken as top-quality products in TCM, thereby providing theoretical basis for determining the best harvesting time as 2 or 2.5 years.
