<p id="par0115">The extraction and measurement of eight active ingredients (baicalin, scutellarin, chrysin, scutellarein, wogonoside, apigenin, wogonin, and baicalein) were conducted using our previous protocol (
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). First, 0.5 g dried sample was accurately weighed and placed in a centrifuge tube. Then the sample was added with 20 mL 70 % ethanol. After 30 min of ultrasonic treatment (500 W, 80 kHz), the sample was cooled to room temperature, and then filtered and the filtrate was collected. Next, 20 mL 70 % ethanol was added to the residue followed by sonicating for 30 min under the same condition. After filtration, the two filtrates were combined into a 50 mL volumetric flask and 70 % ethanol was added to the scale line. Then the sample was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter after thoroughly mixing to obtain the sample solution. The eight medicinal active ingredients of samples were extracted using high-performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, New York, USA) (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). The determination condition was as below. Mobile phase: acetonitrile to 0.1 % formic acid. Gradient elution: 0 ∼ 10 min, 10 % ∼ 15 % acetonitrile; 10 ∼ 20 min, 15 % ∼ 20 % acetonitrile; 20 ∼ 30 min, 20 % ∼ 25 % acetonitrile; 30 ∼ 60 min, 25 % ∼ 45 % acetonitrile; 60 ∼ 65 min, 45 % ∼ 10 % acetonitrile. Flow rate: 1.0 mL/min. Detection wavelength: 274 nm. Column temperature: 30 °C. Sample size: 10 μL.
