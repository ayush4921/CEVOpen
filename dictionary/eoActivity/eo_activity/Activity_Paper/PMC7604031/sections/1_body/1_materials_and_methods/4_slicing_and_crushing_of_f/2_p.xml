<p id="par0110">After collecting the fresh roots of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, the soil was removed and the surface moisture of roots were dried. The dried roots were then sliced quickly and mixed thoroughly. The fresh slices were divided into two parts. One was crushed directly and another was left untreated. The two groups of samples were placed in a petri dish, sealed with plastic wrap to retain water, and then stored at room temperature for 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 2.5 h, 3 h, 3.5 h, 4 h, 4.5 h, 5 h, 6 h, 8 h, 11 h, 22 h, 23 h, 24 h, and 25 h, respectively. Finally, these samples were immediately placed in a 10 mL centrifuge tube, quick-frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. After completely frozen, these samples were freeze-dried at -80 °C for 6 h using freeze dryer (GOLD-SIM, Newark, USA), and then crushed and filtered through a 60-mesh sieve.
