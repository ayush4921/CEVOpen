<p id="par0070">In this study, the germplasms of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> from singe genetic source (originated from the main producing area in Shaanxi province) were planted from 2004 to present in the Germplasm Resources Garden for Medicinal Plants in Shaanxi Normal University (N34°09′, E108°54′), Xi’an, China. To determine the age of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> for further experiments, the germplasms with different growth years were planted separately in the garden. For experiments regarding different ages, the root samples were collected from three plants of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> with similar phenotypic and physiological characters of each age group (planted in 2004, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018) (Table S1). For experiments regarding different storage time and different processing methods, the root samples were collected from three plants of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> with similar phenotypic and physiological characters planted in 2017. For experiments regarding different parts, the samples of cortex and stele were collected from three plants of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> with similar phenotypic and physiological characters planted in 2017. All the plant samples of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> were harvested in September 2019. After removing sediment and impurities, the samples were prepared for further experiments.
