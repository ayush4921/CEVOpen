<p>A wide range of EOs has been investigated in different studies (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04711-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04711-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In this review, we tried to summarize the results of research studies from the last few years; however, it should also be noted that there are many studies related with the activities of different EOs such as 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic> (fennel) [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>,
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (lemongrass) [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], 
 <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> (mustard) [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], and 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> (tea tree) [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>,
 <xref rid="B145-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Moreover, differences in the fungal cultures, geographical origin, plant parts from which EO was derived, extraction method, and harvesting time results in the formation of a database containing numerous studies.
