<p>The antibacterial effects of essential oils occur in two ways: either by the restriction of the bacterial growth (bacteriostatic) or by killing the bacterial cells (bactericidal) [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These antibacterial activities can be determined by using agar/disc diffusion, broth micro/macro dilution, and agar dilution methods. The antimicrobial activity of EOs mainly depends on the chemical composition as well as the parts of the plants. On the other hand, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria differ in terms of their sensitivity against EOs [

 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These differences have been explained by several mechanisms including the more resistant nature of Gram-negative bacteria due to their double layer of phospholipids [
