<p>Essential oils have antimicrobial and other biological activities due to their bioactive volatile components [

Within the compounds present in EOs—such as terpenes, alcohols, acids, esters, epoxides, aldehydes, ketones, amines, and sulfides—terpineol, thujanol, myrcenol, neral, thujone, camphor, and carvone are the most critical ones for their activities [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although major components are generally responsible for their biological activities, the contribution of minor components to these activities should not be omitted. The use of different microbial cultures, different EOs, different concentration ranges, and the use of different antimicrobial test methods on different media have led to the formation of an extensive database. Although the antibacterial effect of EOs has been the subject of several studies for many years, the number of studies concerning the antifungal and antimycotoxigenic effects has not yet reached sufficient levels. Increased cases of fungal infections in recent years and the contamination of food and animal feed products with mycotoxins are considerable issues for both consumers and producers. Nowadays, there has been a significant increase in the number of studies performed on other biological activities of EOs because of the increasing data on the cidal or static effects of EOs on microorganisms.
