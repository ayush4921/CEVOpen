<p>The use of essential oils at high concentrations in foods may lead to organoleptic problems because of their odorous characteristics. From this point of view, using essential oils in combination is considered as an important approach in terms of reducing the required concentrations to contribute to food safety. The increase in the antibacterial activity of EOs, when used in combination, has been proposed by several researchers. Not only synergistic but also additive, non-interactive, and antagonistic interactions have been reported [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Within these interactions, EO combinations that have synergistic and additive effects have been suggested for food applications [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The synergism was reported when the EO combination had higher inhibitory effect than the inhibitory activities of individual EOs [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In a research investigating the antibacterial activity of thyme and oregano EOs and their major compounds (thymol and carvacrol), the combination of thymol and carvacrol, aromatic oxygenated monoterpenes, were found to have additive antibacterial effects against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella infantis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Moreover, additive antibacterial action was observed with the combination of thyme and oregano EOs [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While no antagonism was reported for the combinations of cardamom, cumin, and dill weed, the highest antimicrobial activity was observed in a cardamom and dill weed EO combination. This high antimicrobial activity was attributed to the synergistic effect of 1,8-cineole content (29.2%) of cardamom EO and limonene content (27.4%) of dill weed EO [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A synergistic effect was also reported for the combination of cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde as the main constituent) and clove (eugenol as the main constituent) against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and synergistic antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As mentioned previously, the efficacy of EOs used in combination was not only tested against bacteria but also against fungi. In this respect, within carvacrol, thymol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, and 1,8-cineole interactions, the most synergetic combinations were reported to be thymol/1,8-cineole and thymol/
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In another research, antimicrobial activities of oregano, clove, and cinnamon EOs that have aromatic compounds (eugenol in clove and cinnamon EOs and carvacrol in oregano EO) were attributed to the presence of an aromatic nucleus and a phenolic OH group [
