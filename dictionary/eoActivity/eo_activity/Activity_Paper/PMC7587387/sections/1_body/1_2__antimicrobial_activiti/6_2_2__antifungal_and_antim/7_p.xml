<p>In a study investigating and comparing the effectiveness of a group of EOs, including spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon EOs, the most effective one was found to be cinnamon EO against 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. Moreover, tested 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp. showed considerable antifungal sensitivity to EOs obtained both from the bark and the leaf of cinnamon [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Similarly, within several EOs, including 
 <italic>Mentha haplocalyx</italic> (peppermint) and 
 <italic>Cinnamon zeylanicum</italic> (cinnamon), the most effective one was indicated to be cinnamon EO with the lowest MIC values against 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aspergillus ochraceus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The most effective components of cinnamon (
 <italic>Cinnamon zeylanicum</italic>) EO due to their biological activities were indicated to be eugenol and cinnamaldehyde [
 <xref rid="B141-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. The antifungal activities of cinnamon EO have been determined against several fungi including 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], 
 <italic>Aspergillus ochraceus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], 
 <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], 
 <italic>A. parasiticus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>], and 
 <italic>Fusarium proliferatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The inhibitory effect of cinnamon EO from 
 <italic>Cinnamomum casia</italic> (cinnamon, 78% e-cinnamaldehyde) was also proved against 
 <italic>Aspergillus carbonarius</italic> [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In addition to 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Fusarium verticilloides</italic> was also investigated in terms of its sensitivity to cinnamon EOs, including different levels of cinnamaldehyde, the main component of cinnamon EO, as 85% and 99%. It was concluded that higher inhibitory effects were observed when the cinnamaldehyde concentration was higher [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In addition to the antifungal activities listed above, the antimycotoxigenic activities of cinnamon EO have also been the subject of many studies. Especially, the inhibition of aflatoxin B

 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], ZEA [

 <xref rid="B132-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>], and deoxynivalenol (DON) [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] by cinnamon EO were studied.
