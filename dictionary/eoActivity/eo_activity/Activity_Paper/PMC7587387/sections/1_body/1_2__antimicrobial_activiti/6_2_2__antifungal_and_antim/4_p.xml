<p>In a study comparing the thymus (
 <italic>Thymus capitatus</italic> L.) EO to eucalyptus (
 <italic>Eucalyptus globulus</italic> L.) and pirul (
 <italic>Schinus molle</italic> L.) EOs, it was concluded that thymus was the most effective EO against both 
 <italic>Aspergillus parasiticus</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium moniliforme</italic> [

 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic> is one of the most common plant species, and the effectiveness of its EO commonly characterized by its 1,8-cineole content is well established against many molds [

In a study conducted with thymus, clove, and eucalyptus EOs, all EOs showed antifungal activity, but considering their activity levels, it was suggested to use especially thymus and clove EOs as an alternative to synthetic fungicides [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. With respect to the studies in the literature, one of the most widely studied essential oils is clove EO, and its antifungal activity has been attributed to its main component eugenol [
 <xref rid="B121-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Although the inhibition of 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> was completely achieved at 200 µL/L [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], at 100 µL/L, the conidial germination of 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> was inhibited by 87% [

 <italic>Rhizopus nigricans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>] was also proved. In addition to in vivo applications, in vitro studies also confirmed the antifungal effects of clove EO to prevent gray mold in strawberries [

 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In addition to the antifungal activities of clove EO, its antimycotoxigenic abilities were also investigated by several researchers. The inhibitory effects of clove EO against ochratoxin A [

 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Lavandula dentata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Laurus nobili</italic> EOs were observed to have ochratoxin A (OTA) inhibition ability. Within these EOs,
