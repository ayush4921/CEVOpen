<p>Our extensive literature search showed that one of the most extensively studied essential oils on antifungal activity was rosemary (
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>) EO. In these studies, the antifungal activities of rosemary EO against 
 <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and 
 <italic>Fusarium proliferatum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have been reported. Additionally, antifungal activities against 
 <italic>Mucor pusillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], and 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] were also noteworthy. However, their sensitivities to corresponding EOs were at different levels. For example, although 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> inhibition was 93% at 20 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], 67% inhibition of 
 <italic>Fusarium verticillioides</italic> was achieved at a higher concentration (600 µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. On the other hand, the growth of 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> was completely inhibited by rosemary EO at 25.6 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Moreover, rosemary EO was effective against 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In contrast to 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, rosemary EO was not effective for controlling 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium miniolateum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Penicillium oxalicum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. While significant levels of antifungal activity of rosemary EO have been shown by the above-mentioned studies, antimycotoxigenic activity is the other biological activity of rosemary EO that should be considered. The antimycotoxigenic activity of rosemary EO was proved against fumonisin B
 <sub>1</sub>, fumonisin B
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. While Aflatoxin B
 <sub>2</sub> production was inhibited by rosemary EO [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], it was ineffective on the degradation of zearalenone (ZEA) toxin [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].
