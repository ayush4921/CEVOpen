<p>Another EO that has a wide range of antifungal activity was cumin EO. In addition to being one of the most popular spices in the world due to its strong characteristic flavor [
 <xref rid="B126-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], the EO obtained from cumin has broad use because of its high antimicrobial activity and broad spectrum of antifungal activity. The antifungal activity of cumin EO has been reported against 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,

 <xref rid="B94-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], and 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In addition to the molds listed above, another mold that was investigated for its sensitivity against 
 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> EO was 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. However, it should also be noted that there are variations between different EOs with respect to the EO concentration required for the complete fungal inhibition. On the other hand, different data obtained from the studies carried out using broth microdilution and macrodilution methods could be attributed to the screening method [
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Additionally, as already well known, chemical compositions of EOs can vary depending on the part of the plant used to obtain the EO [
 <xref rid="B110-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], which leads to differences in the biological activities of EOs. On the other hand, the origin of the plant used to obtain the EO also makes a difference. For example, cumin seed EO from Iran was observed to contain α-pinene (29.2%), limonene (21.7%), 1,8-cineole (18.1%), and linalool (10.5%) as the most significant components [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. However, the most abundant components in cumin seed EO from the same variety, 
 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> L., and extracted with the same hydrodistillation method but obtained from India were cymene (47.08%), gamma-terpinene (19.36%), and cuminaldehyde (14.92%). In addition to the above-mentioned antifungal activities, another important biological activity of cumin EO is the antimycotoxigenic activity (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04711-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In this sense, at a concentration of 0.5 µL/mL 
 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> (L.) seed EO, aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> was completely inhibited [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Similar to cumin EO, aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> was also inhibited by 
 <italic>Piper bettle</italic> L. EO with a remarkable antifungal activity [
 <xref rid="B127-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. On the contrary, the application of EO at low concentration may stimulate mycotoxin production. For instance, OTA and aflatoxin B
 <sub>1</sub> production were stimulated by 
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="B125-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] and 
 <italic>Piper bettle</italic> L. EO [
 <xref rid="B127-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] at low concentrations, respectively.
