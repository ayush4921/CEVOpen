<p>To summarize, EOs could be directly used in food products with some novel applications such as encapsulation, edible films, and edible coatings. Encapsulation technology provides improvements on oxidation stability, heat stability, and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of EOs. Moreover, the addition of EOs to edible films and coatings can increase heat stability and resistance to breakage, reduce swelling and solubility, and also add to and/or improve the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of the products.</p>
