<p>The function of secondary metabolites from medicinal and aromatic plants, which can be in the structure of terpenes, phenols, aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and ketones, are strongly correlated with their biochemical and physiological features [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The above-mentioned biological activities of EOs are generally associated not only with major components but also minor components of EOs [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The chemical compositions of plant EOs vary depending on the type of the plant species and their geographical location, environment, and maturation stage, as well as the obtaining method of EOs [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, the part of the plant where the EO is obtained from including flowers, stems, leaves, or buds is another critical factor [

To the best of our knowledge, while their antibacterial and antioxidant activities are well known, antifungal and antimycotoxigenic activities of EOs have yet to be investigated deeply. In addition to all these facts, some strategies are required to protect the biological activities of EOs during food processing. EOs are volatile at room temperature [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and can be easily degraded by oxygen and temperature fluctuations [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04711" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, methods to increase the stability and activity of EOs are required, and novel techniques such as encapsulation, the use of edible coatings, and active packaging may provide the opportunity to solve these problems [
