<p>In vitro studies have been followed by in vivo antimicrobial tests to measure the efficacy of EOs in the food systems. There are studies focusing on the application of EOs especially using recent technologies such as edible coating on beef [

Since EOs are recognized as natural antioxidants, and they mostly have a non-toxic nature, studies on EOs have attracted more attention for their potential use in place of synthetic antioxidants. Recently, many research studies have been carried out on the antioxidant activity of different EOs, and most of these studies put antioxidant activity of EOs at the forefront [
