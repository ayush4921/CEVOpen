 <italic>In-vivo</italic> acute toxicity studies in Swiss albino mice treated with Leaf methanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> did not reveal significant variations signifying diminutive side effects. Furthermore, antitumour activity against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma and Daltonâ€™s Lymphoma Ascites mediated tumours treated with leaf extract declined the tumour burden in dose-dependent manner with lifespan prolonged up to 51.43% in 500 mg/kg b.wt 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> treated ascites tumour-induced mice. The antitumourigenic and metastatic potency determined in our analysis could therefore be linked to the synergistic activity of secondary metabolites present in leaf methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>.
