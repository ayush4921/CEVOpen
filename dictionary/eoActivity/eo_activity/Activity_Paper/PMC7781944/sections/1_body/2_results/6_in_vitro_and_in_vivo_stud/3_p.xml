<p>Effects of LEAM on the survival of ascites tumour-bearing animals are represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0003">Figure 3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0005">Figure 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Ascites tumour harbouring mice was administered with LEAM for 10 consecutive days and the days of survival were recorded. Treatments with methanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> were found to exhibit an increase in the life span in a dose-dependent manner. With LEAM treatment, lower concentration of 100 mg/kg b.wt. exhibited 21.33% increase in life span which did not significantly alter from the control group. The administration of 200 mg/kg b.wt. of the extract on EAC induced ascites tumour showed that the plant drug was moderately efficient with 31.18% increase in life span and average life span of 23 days. Treatment of 24 h tumours with Cisplatin and 500 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM through the intraperitoneal route retarded the increase in tumour growth significantly (p &lt; 0.005) by prolonging the life to 56% and 51.43%, respectively, compared to the untreated group. Consequently, this route increased the mean survival time when administered with 500 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM and Cisplatin which were found to be 27.5 and 28.3 days, respectively, compared to control having a mean life span of 18 days. All mice administered with 100 and 200 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM succumbed to death by 35
 <sup>th</sup> day whereas 500 mg/kg b.wt. and Cisplatin groups extended death up to 40 days compared to control where all mice died by 25
 <sup>th</sup> day. A higher concentration of the extract showed better efficacy compared to 100 and 200 mg/kg b.wt. of the plant drug.
