<p>For 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> cytotoxicity study, Trypan blue dye exclusion method was used to evaluate short-term cytotoxicity. This was assessed by incubating 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> DLA and EAC cells in 1 mL PBS (pH 7.2) with initial concentrations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 µg/mL of LEAM at 37°C for 3 h. The percentage of cell deaths were determined by trypan blue exclusion method. Three replications of each experiment were performed and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of each extract was calculated [
