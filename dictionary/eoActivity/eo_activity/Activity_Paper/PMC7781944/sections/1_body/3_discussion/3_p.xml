<p> Nalini and Durairaj [
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] investigated the effects of hydroethanolic leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> against Daltonâ€™s Lymphoma ascites-induced tumour in mice indicating that 200 and 400 mg/kg b.wt. increased life span by 26% and 33.5%, respectively. Nonetheless, when treated with 200 and 500 mg/kg b.wt. of mice, our study with methanolic extracts showed a comparatively better increase in life span by 31.18% and 51.43% of mice, respectively. This may be attributed to higher levels of alkaloids, phenolics, flavonoids, and terpenoids in methanol solvent which have higher solubility of bioactive compounds over other solvents and thus the constituents may show active synergistic effects against cancer [
