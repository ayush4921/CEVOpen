<p>In addition to those activities discussed above, phloridzin also exhibited a capacity to improve bone in vivo. Puel et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] reported that phloridzin was able to elicit protective effects on bone loss in osteoporosis in relation to inflammation. Antika et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] reported that phloridzin and phloretin could promote osteoblastogenic bone formation through activating canonical glycogen synthase kinase3β (GSK-3β)/β-catenin signaling involving runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) in cell-based and aged mouse models. Londzin et al. [
 <xref rid="B95-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] found that phloridzin (20 mg/kg) significantly increased unfavorable effects on the muscle and decreased the growth of bones, whereas it (50 mg/kg) did not affect most of the detected musculoskeletal parameters in type 2 diabetic rats.
