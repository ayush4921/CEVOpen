<p>Apple is one of the most commonly consumed fruits all over the world, and is a good source of polyphenols. There is a lot of evidence that frequent apple consumption contributes to human health, because polyphenols in apple have lots of beneficial biological functions, and phloridzin is one of polyphenols [

 <italic>O</italic>-glycosides. Flavonoid O-glycosides are compounds containing a carbohydrate moiety, which is 
 <italic>O</italic>-glycosidically linked to the 2-phenylchromen-4-one flavonoid backbone. Phloridzin (also referred to as phlorizin; chemical name phloretin-2′-
