<p>At present, chemical extraction, high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC), resin adsorption technology and preparative HPLC methods are mainly used to separate and purify phloridzin. Dong et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] separated, analyzed and identified 99.87% pure phloridzin from the crude extract of 
 <italic>Lithocarpus polystachyus</italic> by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and HPLC-ESI-MS. Fromm et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] reported that resin adsorption technology was a very effective tool for further purification as well as for the selective enrichment of phloridzin from apple seeds. Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] found that X-5 resin and polyamide resin were feasible and effective methods for the separation and purification of phloridzin from thinned young apples. Liang et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] found that the HSCCC–HPLC–diode array detector–mass spectrometry (HSCCC-HPLC-DAD-MS) method served as a simple, rapid and effective way to achieve phloridzin with high purity (over 99%) from 
 <italic>Malus doumeri</italic> leaves. Gao et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] demonstrated that the prepared magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers (MMIPs) were suitable for phloridzin’s selective adsorption from complex samples such as natural medical plant extracts and biological samples. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-22-00962" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] reported that macroporous resin followed by a preparative HPLC method was used for the purification of phloridzin from apple leaves; the phloridzin purity reached above 98% after further recrystallization with a recovery yield of 75.8%.
