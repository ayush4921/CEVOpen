<p>On the other hand, a study in VERO cells showed that polyphenol geraniin obtained from the bark of the 
 <italic>Nephelium lappaceum</italic> L. plant had a dose-dependent virucidal effect (

 <sub>50</sub> of 1.75 μM. on DENV-2 [

Additionally, through a viral attachment assay, this polyphenol at a concentration of 26.3 μM inhibited 100% of the formation of infectious viral particles, but when its effect was evaluated after the internalization of the virus, the inhibition was only 40%. Based on these results, an in silico study was performed by molecular docking, demonstrating that the binding affinity of geraniin to domain III of the viral envelope protein is favorable, with a free energy binding of −9.8 kcal/mol. Finally, a recombinant rE-DIII protein was produced, and a competitive binding ELISA assay was performed to demonstrate that geraniin binds to this domain, avoiding viral particle adhesion to its cellular receptor [
