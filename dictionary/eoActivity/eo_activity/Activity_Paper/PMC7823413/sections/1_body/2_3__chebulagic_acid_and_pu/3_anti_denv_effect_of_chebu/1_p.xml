<p>Both molecules were evaluated against DENV-2 strain 16,681 infection in HeLa, VERO, A549 and HEp-2 cells. The effectiveness of these compounds at different concentrations (1–10 and 100 µg/mL) was confirmed when prechilled monolayers at 4 °C were cotreated with DENV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of five, at the same time demonstrating their effectiveness against infection. In this sense, there was a significant inhibition of viral particle adhesion and fusion to the cell membrane [
