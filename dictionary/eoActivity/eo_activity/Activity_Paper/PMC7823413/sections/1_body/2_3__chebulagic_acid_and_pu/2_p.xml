 <xref rid="B55-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and antiviral activity. The anti-HCV effect of chebulagic acid has been shown by NS3-4A protease and RNA replication inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 9.03 µM and 22.25 ± 8.70), with higher selectivity index (SI) than geraniin in Huh 7.5 cells (4.7 vs. 1.9) [
 <xref rid="B43-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In contrast, chebulagic acid inhibited EBV DNA polymerase

 <sub>50</sub>: 18.6 µM) [
 <xref rid="B42-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Additionally, its anti-influenza A virus (IAV) effects, as a neuraminidase inhibitor, have been probed, even for oseltamivir-resistant IAV, showing viral release inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 1.36 μM) but no activity on other steps of the viral cycle, such as entry or RNA replication [
 <xref rid="B56-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In contrast, chebulagic acid and punicalagin inhibited HSV type 1 (HSV-1) entry and spread by acting as GAG-competitors (EC
 <sub>50:</sub> 17.02 ± 2.82 and 10.25 ± 1.13; SI: 18.62 and 31.11, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B57-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], as in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (EC
 <sub>50:</sub> 25.50 ± 1.51; 16.76 ± 0.88), measles virus (MV) (EC
 <sub>50:</sub> 34.42 ± 4.35; 25.49 ± 2.94), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (EC
 <sub>50:</sub> 0.38 ± 0.05; 0.54 ± 0.04) and HCV (EC
 <sub>50:</sub> 12.16 ± 2.56; 16.72 ± 2.55) in HeLa, CHO-SLAM, HEp-2 and Huh-7.5 cells, respectively [
 <xref rid="B58-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, their antiviral mechanism of action is dependent on the viral model used.
