<p>The sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) pathway is another proposed mechanism even when the antiviral effect of NDGA (10 µM or 35 µM) was demonstrated in other flaviviruses, with ZIKV and WNV at an MOI of 1 in VERO-CCL81 and HeLa3-WNV cells (cells that express the structural proteins C, prM and E of WNV) [
