<p>Among the articles that included the evaluation of antivirals targeting cell targets, a small molecule, GW5074, blocks the entry of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) into the cell nucleus [
 <xref rid="B194-biomolecules-11-00011" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>]. VERO cells were treated with or without GW5074 (20 µM) 2 h prior to infection with DENV-2 strain NGC at an MOI of 4. The results showed a marked reduction in NS5 nuclear localization of 2an by immunofluorescence. The mechanism of action indicates that GW5074 interferes with binding to the IMPα/β1 heterodimer, a nuclear transport protein involved in the import of NS5 into the nucleus and thus with the depletion of the subsequent impact of the antiviral response by the cell [
