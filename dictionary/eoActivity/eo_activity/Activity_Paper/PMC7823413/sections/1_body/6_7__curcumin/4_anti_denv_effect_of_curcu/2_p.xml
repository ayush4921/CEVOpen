<p>The antiviral effect of curcumin against many enveloped viruses was described above. Continuing with this, a study determined that this compound completely cleared DENV-2 and another flavivirus, JEV, during the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-treatment strategy. However, the antiviral effect was not evidenced when curcumin was added to the cells after infection. Consequently, these studies concluded that curcumin can act as a direct antiviral or host-target antiviral agent [
