<p>The compound cardol triene also showed in vitro anti-
 <italic>DENV</italic> activity when added to VERO cells 48 h before the infection; it was able to inhibit cell membrane fusion with the viral envelope protein of DENV-2/NG (10 µM; MOI of 1). The results also showed that the major inhibition of intracellular RNA and infectious virions was observed after infection (87.00 ± 6.43% and 91.73 ± 4.53%, respectively), and even cardol triene exhibited broad spectrum inhibition against all dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1–4; EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.35 µM, 7.13 µM, 8.98 µM and 8.21 µM, respectively). A predicted in silico mechanism of action by molecular docking was made. Then, it was postulated that this compound has a high affinity (energy scored between −41.44 and −50.47 kcal/mol) for the kl loops of the DENV E protein, and this complex was demonstrated to be stable by molecular dynamics (300 ns of simulation) [
