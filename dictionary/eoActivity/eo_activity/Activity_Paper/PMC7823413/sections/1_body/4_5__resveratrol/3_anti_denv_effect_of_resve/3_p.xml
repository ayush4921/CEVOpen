<p>Although the mechanism of action has been more elucidated for some compounds, the question remains whether structural analogs have similar properties or whether apparently small differences in the chemical structure could modify the inhibition percentages obtained and could even have a completely different mechanism of action. For these reasons, two resveratrol analogs, PNR-4-44 and PNR-5-02, were evaluated in Huh7 cells infected with DENV-2/NG, demonstrating a reduction in the cytopathic effect of the virus in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, both analogs had an effect at 12 h postinfection in an addition time assay, inhibiting the viral genome but not affecting the viral polymerase [

The study suggests that the decrease in the viral genome can be attributed to other nonviral factors, since it is known that viral replication requires the presence of cellular molecules that can be altered in the presence of analogs [

Because of these factors, the cellular components that intervene in the replicative cycle of the virus offer a possible therapeutic route in which they can be considered treatment targets. Although both resveratrol phenolic analogs were shown to be active in events after virus entry, only PNR-5-02 had partial inhibition in stages prior to viral entry by inhibiting replication by 34%, indicating that it may have an additional effect on cellular factors in host cells, as reported in other studies [
