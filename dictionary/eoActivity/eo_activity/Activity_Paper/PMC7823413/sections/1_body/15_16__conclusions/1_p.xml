<p>The results discussed in this review show the clinical potential of phenolic compounds as antiviral agents, especially against dengue virus. Some of the compounds are widely found in medicinal plants and foods or are drugs used for other clinical purposes; thus, they may have greater toxicological safety for use in humans as anti-dengue drugs. Despite the structural diversity of bioactive compounds, it is not possible to establish a structureâ€“antiviral activity relationship. However, the presence of phenolic hydroxyl groups in chemical structures should have an important contribution to antiviral action and should be investigated for the development of synthetic derivatives with therapeutic applications against dengue infection.</p>
