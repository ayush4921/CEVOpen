<p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs and formulae have long been used in treating viral diseases. Some of them have been clinically tested to treat COVID-19

 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> Georgi, has been reported for widely used in TCM for heat clearing, fire purging, detoxification, and haemostasis. Huangqin is officially recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015 Edition)

 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> and its ingredients. We found that the ethanol extract of

 <sub>50</sub> of 0.39 µM. Both the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> and baicalein effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cell assay. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 3CL
