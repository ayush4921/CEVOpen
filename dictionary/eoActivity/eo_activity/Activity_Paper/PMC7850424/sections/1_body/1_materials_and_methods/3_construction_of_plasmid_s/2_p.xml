<p>The DNA of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (referred to GenBank, accession number MN908947) was synthesised (Hienzyme Biotech, Changsha, China) and amplified by PCR using primers n3CLP-Nhe (5′-CATGGCTAGCGGTTTTAGAAAAATGGCATTCCC-3′) and n3CLP-Xho (5′-CACTCTCGAGTTGGAAAGTAACACCTGAGC-3′). The PCR product was digested with 
 <italic>Nhe</italic> I/
 <italic>Xho</italic> I and cloned into the pET 21a DNA as reported previously

 </xref>. The resulting SARS-CoV-2 pET 3CL-21x plasmid encodes a 35,064 Da SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with a C-terminal 6xHis-tag. The SARS-CoV-2 pET 3CL-21x plasmid was further transformed to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 &lt; DE3&gt; for protein expression as reported
