 </xref> and 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> components were prepared using Protein Preparation Wizard and LigPrep module, respectively. Then, the binding site was defined as a 20 × 20 × 20 Å
 <sup>3</sup> cubic box centred to the centroid of C145. After that, molecular docking was performed using Glide. Extra precision (XP) and flexible ligand sampling were adopted. Post-docking minimisation was performed to further refine the docking results. All the above-mentioned modules were implemented in Schrödinger version 2015-4 (Schrödinger Software Suite, L.L.C., New York, NY, 2015).
