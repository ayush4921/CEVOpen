<p>A colorimetric substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA (GL Biochemistry Ltd., Shanghai, China) and assay buffer (40 mM PBS, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton 100, pH 7.3) was used for the inhibition assay. Stock solutions of the inhibitors were prepared with 100% DMSO. The 100 µl reaction systems in assay buffer contain 0.5 µM protease and 5% DMSO or inhibitor to the final concentration. First, SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was diluted with assay buffer to the desired concentration. Five microlitres DMSO or inhibitor at various concentrations was pre-incubated with 85 µl diluted SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> for 30 min at room temperature. Then 10 µl 2 mM substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA (dissolved in water) was added into the above system to the final concentration of 200 µM to initiate the reaction. Increase in absorbance at 390 nm was recorded for 20 min at interval of 30 s with a kinetics mode program using a plate reader (Synergy, Biotek, Winooski, VT). The percent of inhibition was calculated by
