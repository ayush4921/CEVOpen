<p>We further tested the antiviral activity of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> ethanol extract and baicalein against SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR. Vero cells were pre-treated with the extract or baicalein for 1 h, followed by virus infection for 2 h. Virus input was then washed out and the cells were treated with medium containing the extract or baicalein. Viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of the infected cells and quantified by RT-PCR. The 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> ethanol extract significantly reduced the growth of the virus with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of about 0.74 µg/ml with low cytotoxicity (SI &gt; 675,
