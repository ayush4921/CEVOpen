<p>Based on the docking analysis, we searched for baicalein analogues from available flavonoid suppliers and selected eight flavonoids and two glycosides for experimental testing (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14756366.2021.1873977" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S1</ext-link>. Four flavonoid compounds were found to be potent SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors. Among them, scutellarein is mainly distributed in genus 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> and Erigerontis herba (Dengzhanxixin or Dengzhanhua in Chinese) in its glucuronide form, scutellarin. Scutellarin has long been used in cardiovascular disease treatment for its ability to improve cerebral blood supply

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>, scutellarein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 5.8 µM, while scutellarin showed mild inhibitory activity at 50 µM concentration. The other three flavonoid compounds, dihydromyricetin, quercetagetin, and myricetin derived from 
 <italic>Ampelopsis japonica</italic> (Bailian in Chinese), 
 <italic>Eriocaulon buergerianum</italic> (Gujingcao in Chinese), and 
 <italic>Polygoni avicularis</italic> (Bianxu in Chinese), respectively, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.20, 1.24, and 2.86 µM. Interestingly, scutellarein and myricetin were reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV, indicating their potential as multi-target anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents
