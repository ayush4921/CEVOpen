<p>As the synthesis and function of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> take place inside the host cell, its inhibitors should be effective mainly at the post-entry stage. Since the above data were obtained by full-time incubation, we further tested the inhibition activity of baicalein and 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> extract at the entry or post-entry stage (see 
 <italic>Materials and Methods</italic> section in Supporting Information for details). Both baicalein and the extract are active at post-entry stage, while the extract also shows noticeable inhibition activity at the viral entry stage. The high activity and multiple action stages of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> crude extract in the antiviral assay implies that it may also interact with other viral or host targets in addition to SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition, which can be further explored in the future.
