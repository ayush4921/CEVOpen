<p>The SARS-CoV2 RdRp model, consisting of 801 amino acids, was designed using the SARS-CoV RdRp as a homolog. The active site of RdRp is highly conserved and contains aspartate residues that protrude from the beta-turn joining the b15 and b16 (

With a vital role in viral genome replication, the active site residues of RdRp and most of the 5-Åregion surrounding it are surface accessible and can bind to free nucleotides, including ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP. Similar to the viral proteases, RdRp is regarded as a molecular target for the development of new drugs against SARS-CoV2 (Liu et al.,

The structure resembles a partially curled right-hand grip and can be assorted into three regions namely the palm, the thumb and the fingers (Quimque et al.,
