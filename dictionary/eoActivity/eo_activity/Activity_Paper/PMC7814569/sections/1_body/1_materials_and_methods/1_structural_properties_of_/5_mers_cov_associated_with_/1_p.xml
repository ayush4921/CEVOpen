<p>MERS-CoV engages the transmembrane dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the primary receptor. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infects host cells through binding the receptor binding domain (RBD) on its spike glycoprotein to human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4). hDPP4 extracellular domain consists of a variable N-terminal eight-blade β-propeller domain and a conserved C-terminal α/β-hydrolase domain (
