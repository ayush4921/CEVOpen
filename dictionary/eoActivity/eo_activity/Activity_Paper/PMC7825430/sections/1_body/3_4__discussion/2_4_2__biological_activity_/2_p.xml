<p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no information about the chemopreventive properties of polysaccharide fractions from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> against colon cancer. Therefore, crude polysaccharides from the wild growing cauliflower mushroom were subjected to both antiproliferative activity determination and cytotoxicity examination. The studies were performed on human colon epithelial cell line CCD841 CoN and on three different human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines, which represent the successive stages of colon cancer development according to Dukes classification (Caco-2: Dukes B, LS180: Dukes B, HT-29: Dukes C).
