<p>We also used another enzymatic method for testing antioxidant activity, i.e., the catalase assay. Catalase protects cells from oxidative stress through the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen [
 <xref rid="B32-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the promotion of catalase activity is one of the indirect mechanisms of antioxidant activity that is beneficial from the point of view of normal cell physiology. On the other hand, it was shown that catalase contributed to the increased resistance of cancer cells to pro-oxidant drugs (especially in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-mediated processes). The inhibition of catalase expression and activity results in increased oxidative stress in cancerous cells. This provides new insight into understanding the possible anticancer properties of some compounds [

 <xref rid="B59-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Therefore, searching for catalase inhibitors seems reasonable in order to design synergistic agents for anti-cancer drugs, which may help to sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells [
