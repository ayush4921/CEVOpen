<p>Various medicinal properties of 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> are mostly attributed to the presence of β-glucans. According to Japan Food Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan), the β-glucan content in 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> is more than 40% of the dry weight [

 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00161-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This discrepancy may result from the origin of the mushrooms, since the 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> used in this study was collected from the natural environment in Poland, while Asian species are mostly cultivated. Moreover, the taxonomy and systematics of 
 <italic>Sparassis</italic> Fr. species have been refined according to phylogenetic relationships and placement. It was proposed that 
 <italic>Sparassis</italic> should be classified into three groups: 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> from Europe and eastern North America, 
 <italic>S. radicata</italic> from western North America, and 
 <italic>S. latifolia</italic> from Asia [
