<p>The ability of crude polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity was determined in vitro with the use of the COX (ovine) Colorimetric Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit. Briefly, 10 µL of the polysaccharide sample (1 mg/mL, in 5% DMSO) were added to the reaction mixture containing 150 μL of assay buffer, 10 μL of heme, and 10 μL of the enzyme (either COX-1 or COX-2). Peroxidase activity can be assayed colorimetrically by monitoring the appearance of oxidized

 <italic>N</italic>’-tetramethyl-
 <italic>p</italic>-phenylenediamine (TMPD) at λ = 590 nm. Acetylsalicylic acid (1 mM) was used as a control. The percent COX inhibition was calculated as shown below:
