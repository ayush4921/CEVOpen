<p>The degree of inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation (LPO) was performed according to [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] described in detail by [
 <xref rid="B29-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Absorbances of reaction mixtures were measured at λ = 480 nm. Six dilution of CPS were examined to plot a dose–response curve. The result was expressed as the concentration of polysaccharides providing 50% of activity based on a dose-dependent mode of action (EC
 <sub>50</sub>).
