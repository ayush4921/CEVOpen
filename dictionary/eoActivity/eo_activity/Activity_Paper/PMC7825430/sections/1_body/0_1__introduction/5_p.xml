 <italic>Sparassis crispa</italic>, also known as cauliflower mushroom in English or Hanabiratake in Japanese and Ggoksongee (meaning a blossom) in Korean, is an edible and medicinal mushroom growing in the temperate regions of Europe and North America [
 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It is also a very popular cultivable species in Asian countries, especially in Japan [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-13-00161" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite its popularity, bioactive polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> have not been exactly defined and studied to date. The present study is an attempt to extend this knowledge. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the content of α- and β-glucans and determine the chemical composition and structure of the crude polysaccharides from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> collected from the natural environment in Poland. Furthermore, the anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> crude polysaccharides were examined in vitro to determine their chemopreventive potential.
