<p>The BrdU assay (more sensitive and specific antiproliferative assay) revealed no influence of CPS on DNA synthesis in human colon epithelial CCD841 CoN cells. Simultaneously, 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> polysaccharides decreased the proliferation of all investigated human colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 Caco-2 = 834 µg/mL; IC50 LS180 = 145 µg/mL; IC50 HT-29 = 103 µg/mL). Among the examined colon cancer cell lines, Caco-2 was the most resistant to the antiproliferative abilities of CPS. The significant inhibition of DNA synthesis (9.4%) was noted only after the treatment with polysaccharides at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. On the contrary, the strongest anticancer effect was observed in HT-29 cells, wherein even 10 μg/mL of CPS inhibited the cell proliferation by 20.1%, while 100 μg/mL of CPS caused a 50.8% reduction in DNA synthesis. LS180 cells were more resistant to CPS treatment than HT-29, and the decrease in BrdU incorporation was in the range from 7.3% (10 μg/mL) to 40.6% (100 μg/mL).
