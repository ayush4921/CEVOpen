<p>We determined the antioxidant activity of CPS using different methods involving different modes of antioxidant action. The results are presented in 
 <xref rid="nutrients-13-00161-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. They revealed that the crude polysaccharide from 
 <italic>S. crispa</italic> exhibited moderate potential in antiradical activity against ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> with the EC
 <sub>50</sub> level of 16.27 mg/mL CPS. CPS was found to have the highest antioxidant potential in the determination of reducing properties (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.82 mg/mL) and chelating activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.76 mg/mL). Our study also included an evaluation of the ability of CPS to inhibit lipid peroxidation. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> value obtained indicates a high activity of CPS (2.76 mg/mL). The antioxidant activity of CPS was then evaluated with the ORAC assay, giving the result 168.51 ± 0.21 µM Trolox/g CPS.
