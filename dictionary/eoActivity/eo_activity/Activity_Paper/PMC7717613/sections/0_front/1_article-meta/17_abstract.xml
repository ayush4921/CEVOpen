 <p>Mangosteen is one of the best tasting tropical fruit widely cultivated in Southeast Asia. This study aimed to quantify xanthone content in different parts of 
  <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic> by LC-QTOF-MS and determine its influence on their cholinesterase inhibitory activities. The total xanthone content in 
  <italic>G. mangostana</italic> was in the following order: pericarp &gt; calyx &gt; bark &gt; stalk &gt; stem &gt; leaves &gt; aril. The total xanthone content of pericarp was 100 times higher than the aril. Methanol extracts of the pericarp and calyx demonstrated the most potent inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 0.90 and 0.37 µg/mL, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between xanthone content and cholinesterase inhibition. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed α-mangostin and γ-mangostin of pericarp as the key metabolites contributing to cholinesterase inhibition. Due to the increasing demand of mangosteen products, repurposing of fruit waste (pericarp) has great potential for enhancement of the cognitive health of human beings.
