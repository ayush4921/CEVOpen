<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, all xanthones demonstrated good linearity (

 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.99) over a range of concentrations used. The LODs and LOQs of xanthones were in the range of 5–500 ng/mL and 25–5000 ng/mL, respectively. The xanthone content in methanol and aqueous extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> are summarised in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The highest total xanthone content was found in the methanol extract of pericarp (521.2 mg xanthones/g of extract or 185.5 mg of xanthones/g of dry powdered raw material). The total xanthone content in the methanol extracts of different parts of the plant were in the following descending order: pericarp &gt; calyx &gt; bark &gt; stalk &gt; stem &gt; leaves &gt; aril. Interestingly, the methanol extract of aril had 100 folds lower in total xanthone content compared to pericarp. A previous study quantified xanthones in the aril and pericarp of

 </xref>. The authors reported 8.6 mg and 0.43 mg of γ-mangostin, 1.4 mg and 0.26 mg of 8-deoxygartanin and 33.2 mg and 2.13 mg of α-mangostin in each gram of pericarp and aril dried materials, respectively. The levels of the three xanthones in pericarp dry material were lower; however, their levels in aril were higher compared to our present study. The difference could be due to the difference in the ripening stages of the fruits and the extraction solvent used, which was methylene chloride. On the other hand, a more recent study on the xanthone analysis of six different maturity levels of mangosteen rind extract using LC-MS/MS analysis reported the γ-mangostin levels in the range of 0.94–66.13 mg per gram of extract, which were comparable with the present study (57.0 mg/g extract)

 </xref>. In contrast to the methanol extracts, total xanthone content in the aqueous extracts are relatively much lower attributed to the relatively non-polar nature of the prenylated xanthones. The total xanthone content for aqueous extracts was in the range 2.9–7.3 mg/g of extract. Aqueous extract of bark had the highest total xanthone content followed by pericarp, stem and leaves. In addition, calyx, aril and stalk had almost similar total xanthone content.
