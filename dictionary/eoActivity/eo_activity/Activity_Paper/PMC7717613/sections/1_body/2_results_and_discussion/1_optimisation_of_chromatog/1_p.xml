<p>For the LC-QTOF-MS method optimisation, various chromatographic parameters including mobile phase compositions, analytical columns and elution programmes were systematically optimised to acquire a better peak resolution and capacity for identification and quantification of xanthones between their adjacent peaks in the chromatogram. A small amount of formic acid was introduced to increase the peak shape and as an ionic modifier to enhance the mass response of the marker compounds in the 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> extracts. Different reverse phase (RP) columns were used for optimisation, and Zorbax SB-C18 column was chosen due to its superiorities at satisfactory separations for all investigated analytes, acceptable peak shape, and low system back-pressure. A gradient elution programme was optimised to obtain good baseline separation for all marker compounds. Representative total ion chromatograms for the methanol and aqueous extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> are shown in
