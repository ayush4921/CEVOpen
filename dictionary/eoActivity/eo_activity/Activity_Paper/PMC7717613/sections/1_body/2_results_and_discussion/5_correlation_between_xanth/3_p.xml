<p>Our previous paper describes on bioactivity-guided isolation of potential cholinesterase inhibitors from 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> pericarp. We identified six bioactive xanthones, namely α-mangostin, γ-mangostin, mangostanol, 3-isomangostin, garcinone C and 8-deoxygartanin, of which the most potent inhibitor of AChE was garcinone C while γ-mangostin was the most potent inhibitor of BChE

 </xref>. In the present study, we determined the content of the bioactive xanthones in different parts of the plant to identify the potential source of the bioactive xanthones. In addition, we tested their cholinesterase inhibition to validate our hypothesis that xanthones are the chemical constituents responsible for the cholinesterase inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic>. The findings clearly support our hypothesis, and this is the first study to show that pericarp has the highest content of xanthones among all the other parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic>.
