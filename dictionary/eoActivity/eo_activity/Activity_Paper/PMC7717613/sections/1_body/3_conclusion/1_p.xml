<p>In conclusion, methanol extract of the pericarp contained the highest total xanthones among the organic and aqueous extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic>. α-Mangostin was the major xanthone in the methanol extracts of pericarp, calyx and bark and stem, while 3-isomangostin was the major xanthone in the aqueous extracts of all parts of the plant. On cholinesterase inhibitory potential, the methanol extracts of pericarp and calyx had the most potent inhibitory activities against AChE and BChE with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.90 and 0.37 µg/mL, respectively. The total xanthone content was found to be well correlated with their cholinesterase inhibitory activities. Since there is an increasing demand for mangosteen products, repurposing of fruit waste (pericarp) enriched with bioactive xanthones has great potential for enhancement of the cognitive health of human beings. The series of prenylated xanthones found in 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> are attractive lead molecules in the field of medicinal chemistry for further structural modification and optimisation in the search of potent cholinesterase inhibitor with favourable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles.
