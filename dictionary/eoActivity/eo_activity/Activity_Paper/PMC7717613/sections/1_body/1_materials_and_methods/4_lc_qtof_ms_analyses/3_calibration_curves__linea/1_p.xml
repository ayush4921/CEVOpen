<p>The linear dynamic ranges of the LC-QTOF-MS method for the determination of the six xanthones were evaluated from a set of five solutions, at concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 50 µg/mL (some of the xanthones had much lower linear range, refer to 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Each individual marker compound at a fixed concentration was consecutively injected three times. The calibration curves were constructed by plotting peak height against the analyte concentrations and the linearity of six compounds were evaluated by linear regression analysis. The LODs of the xanthones were in the range of 5 to 500 ng/mL, while their LOQs were in the range of 25 to 5000 ng/mL.
