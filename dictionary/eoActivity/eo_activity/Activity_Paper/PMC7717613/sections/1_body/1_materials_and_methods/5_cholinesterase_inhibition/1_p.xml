 </xref>. For both AChE and BChE inhibitory assay, 140 µL of 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH8) was added to a 96 wells microplate followed by 20 µL of test samples and 20 µL of 0.09 units/mL of AChE or BChE enzyme. Then, 10 µL of 10 mM 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was added into each well followed by 10 µL of 14 mM of acetylthiocholine iodide or S-butyrylthiocholine chloride. The enzymatic hydrolysis reaction as indicated by the absorbance was measured for 30 min using Tecan Infinite 200 Pro Microplate Spectrometer at 412 nm. Galantamine was used as a positive control for both assays. Absorbencies of the test samples were corrected by subtracting the absorbencies of their respective blank.
