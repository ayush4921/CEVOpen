<p>The local inhabitants of rural areas of Punjab widely use grasses for ethnoveterinary purposes. For example, 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic>, 
 <italic>Eleusine indica</italic>, 
 <italic>Bromus japonicus</italic>, 
 <italic>Phragmites australis</italic>, 
 <italic>Eragrostis minor</italic> and 
 <italic>Desmostachya bipinnata</italic> are reported to treat various stomach problems whereas 
 <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>, 
 <italic>Brachiaria ramosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Arundo donax</italic>, 
 <italic>Chrysopogon zizanioides</italic>, and 
 <italic>Panicum antidotale</italic> are used to treat microbial infections in cattle [

 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. They prefer to use grasses as fodder because these are highly palatable than other form of fodders [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Their palatability also depends on animal choice and may also be linked with their seasonal availability, morphological and chemical nature of plant [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Animals generally prefer fresh foliage over dried because leaves of grasses are rich source of protein and cellulose, and have low lignin than forbs and shrubs [
 <xref rid="pone.0241705.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Grasses beside the nutritional and healthcare services also reduce the grazing pressure on other palatable species and improve the productivity in livestock [
