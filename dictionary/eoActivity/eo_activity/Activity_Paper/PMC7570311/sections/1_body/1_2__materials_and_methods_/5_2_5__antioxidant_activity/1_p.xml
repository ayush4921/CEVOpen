<p>The antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> extracts were explored in three different experiments: ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), β-carotene bleaching and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) [

 <sub>50</sub> (µg/mL) values were defined as the amount of extract scavenging 50% of β-carotene bleaching/DPPH solution/FRAP reagent. These values were calculated by plotting the inhibition percent against extract concentration. In the DPPH experiment, serial concentrations of the extracts were incubated in methanolic DPPH solution previously prepared (5 mL of 0.004%) for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm. A positive control was used in the experiment (butylated hydroxytoluene, BHT). In the β-carotene-bleaching experiment, the absorbance was measured at 470 nm. In the FRAP experiment, Trolox (positive control) was used and the absorbance was measured at 593 nm. All experiments were repeated thrice.
