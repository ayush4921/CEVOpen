<p>Previous investigations showed that 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seeds and isolated compounds such as vasicinone, harmine, peganine and harmalacidine have antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities against Med-mek carcinoma, UCP-med sarcoma and Jurkat [

 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Harmine inhibited cell growth and vasicinone showed strong antiproliferating activity. The Chinese-origin 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> showed high amounts of 4-hydroxyisoleucine, asparagine, proline, lysine, vasicine and sucrose in the methanolic extracts of leaves [

 <italic>P. harmala</italic> seeds. In the current study, the antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts were mainly attributed to major polyphenols including cynaroside, hydrocaffeic acid and protocatechuic acid. Only a single previous investigation showed that cynaroside isolated from Turkish-origin 
 <italic>Teucrium chamaedrys</italic> has antiproliferative activities against HeLa cells [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, the current investigation is the first report studying the cytotoxic activities of cynaroside against HeLa, as well as other, cancer cells. Protocatechuic acid (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) has anticancer effects against known cancer cells [
