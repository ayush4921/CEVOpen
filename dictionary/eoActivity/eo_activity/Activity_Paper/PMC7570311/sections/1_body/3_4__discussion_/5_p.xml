<p>There were antiproliferative activities of

 <italic>P. harmala</italic> extracts against cancer cells (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01086-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> showed higher antiproliferative activities than 
 <italic>P. harmala.</italic> In addition, there were antiproliferative activities when applying polyphenols such as quercitrin, cynaroside, trifolin, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid and rutoside against [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] cancer cells. Flow cytometry showed obvious apoptotic cell accumulation when applying 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> methanolic leaf extracts, as well as quercitrin, trifolin and cynaroside. In a previous investigation on Bosnian-origin 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic>, a mild cytotoxic effect was found in the plant extracts against HeLa cancer cells but no activity was found when using the extracts of Serbian-origin plants [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. No studies revealed a complete polyphenolic picture of this species. The antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> found here are related to the main polyphenols detected, such as quercitrin and trifolin. A previous investigation revealed that the quercetin flavonoid has antiproliferative activities against RAW264.7 cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Other studies revealed that quercetin has cytotoxic activity against lung cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-01086" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Trifolin is a galactosideconjugated kaempferol that is formed by the kaempferol 3-ogalactosyltransferase and has apoptotic activity against lung cancer cells attributed to intrinsic and extrinsic pathways [
