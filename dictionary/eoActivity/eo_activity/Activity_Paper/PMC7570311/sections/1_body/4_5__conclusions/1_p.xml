<p>The novel findings of this study can be summarized in the exploration of the polyphenol composition, and associated anticancer activities, of methanolic leaf extracts of 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> from natural populations in Saudi Arabia. Several polyphenols were identified by HPLC-DAD in the leaf extracts, including 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, rosmarinic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, quercitrin, rutoside, quercetin and trifolin, in 
 <italic>F. alnus,</italic> and hydrocaffeic acid, protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid and cynaroside, in 
 <italic>P. harmala. F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts showed antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities against cancer cells using MTT and flow cytometry assays. These anticancer activities were attributed to the polyphenolic composition of leaves including quercitrin, trifolin and cynaroside, which resulted in necrotic cell accumulation during apoptotic phases. 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> showed strong antioxidant effects attributed to the polyphenolic composition of leaves including quercitrin, trifolin, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, rutoside, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, chlorogenic acid and ferulic acid in 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and cynaroside, hydrocaffeic acid and protocatechuic acid in 
 <italic>P. harmala.</italic> These antioxidant effects were associated with reduced ROS production in treated cells compared to controls. This is the first study investigating the antioxidant activities of hydrocaffeic acid and showing strong antioxidant activities. Finally, this is the first study revealing the activation of caspase family proteases in cancer cells by 
 <italic>F. alnus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. harmala</italic> leaf extracts.
