<p>The green leaves were dried for 10 days below shade and floor. The ground leaves (310 mg) were soaked in adequate amount of methanol (95%). Importantly, methanol is known as the maximum common solvent that is used to extract most of the phyto-constituents found in natural materials. During the extraction, amber glass was used to keep methanol-soaked powder of the plant leaves and stored at 25 °C/room-temperature and permitted to draw for numerous days (5–7) with continuous shaking and stirring. When the solvent become concentrated, the contents were decanted using cotton and then filtered via Whatman clear out paper No. 1. The solvent was evaporated with the help of a water tub to produce a viscous mass and then kept at room temperature.</p>
