 <sup>2</sup>) in diameter. The mice were separated into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). Group 1 treated with negative control (1% Tween-80), group 2 treated with positive control (diazepam 1 mg/kg), groups 3 and 4 received the plant extract dosages of 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively. Thirty minutes after oral administration of vehicle or MEBPL and 15 min after administration of diazepam, respectively, every animal was positioned at the middle of the wooden space to freely move and the amount of dipping head into the holes was observed for each mouse and recorded for 5 min.
