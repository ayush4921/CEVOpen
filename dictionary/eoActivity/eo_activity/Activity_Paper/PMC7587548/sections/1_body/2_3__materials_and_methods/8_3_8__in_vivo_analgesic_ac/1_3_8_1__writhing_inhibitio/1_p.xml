<p>Analgesic effect of MEBPL was studied by the writhing inhibition of mice after inducing acetic acid [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04737" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The experimental mice were separated into 4 different groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) and were unfed for two hours before starting the test. Tween-80 (1%) solution at 10 mL/kg b.w. as negative control, diclofenac sodium (reference drug) at 10 mg/kg b.w. as positive control and doses of MEBPL at 200 and 400 mg/kg b.w., respectively, administered orally using gavage. After 30 min of administration, acetic acid (0.7%) was injected intraperitoneally into the treated animals and then the writhing response was noted for 20 min.
