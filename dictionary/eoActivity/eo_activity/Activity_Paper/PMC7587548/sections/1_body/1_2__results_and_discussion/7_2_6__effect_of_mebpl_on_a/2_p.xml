<p>Besides, MEBPL showed significantly reduction in the peristalsis index. The dose of 400 mg/kg exhibited noteworthy reduction of peristalsis index by 51.30 ± 5.04% (

However, the observed anti-diarrheal activity by the MEBPL could be the availability of secondary metabolites like flavonoids and tannins which can cause death of the worms in the gastrointestinal tract by selectively binding with free proteins [
