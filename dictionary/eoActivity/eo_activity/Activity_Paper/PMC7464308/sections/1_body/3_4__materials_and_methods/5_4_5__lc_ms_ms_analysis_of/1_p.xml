<p>LC-MS/MS analysis were performed by using a Shimadzu LCMS-8040 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in positive and negative mode. Electrospray (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was operated under the following condition, the interface voltage was −3.5 kv for the negative mode and the positive mode was 4.5 kv, the nebulizing gas flow rate was 3 L/min, drying gas flow rate was 15 L/min, a desolvation line temperature was 250 °C, and the heat block temperature was 400 °C. The stationary phase was Hector M 18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, RSTech, Daejeon, Korea). The mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile-formic acid (99.9:0.1) using a gradient elution of 28–50% B at 0–60 min under the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The optimized collision energy in the MRM mode for compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>2</bold> were 18 V and 22 V, respectively.
