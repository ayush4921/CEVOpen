 <sc>d</sc>
 <sup>20</sup> +35.0 (
 <italic>c</italic> = 1.0, MeOH). The IR spectrum of 
 <bold>2</bold> showed strong absorption of hydroxyl (3398 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and ester (1728 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) groups and double bonds (1066 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The molecular formula was identified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to be C

 <italic>z</italic> 930.5. Similar to compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>2</bold> showed seven tertiary methyl groups at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 0.88, 0.90, 0.91, 1.02, 1.12, 1.27 and 1.33, with 3H, singlet signals. Analysis of the chemical shifts of 
 <bold>2</bold> led to the same aglycon as 
 <bold>1</bold>. Three anomeric protons were observed at

 <sub>H</sub> 4.77 (t, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 4.4 Hz, H-1′), 4.99 (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.0 Hz, H-1′′′) and 6.21 (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.0 Hz, H-1′′), corresponding to the three anomeric carbons at

 <sub>C</sub> 89.4) with H-1′ (
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 4.77; d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 4.4 Hz) confirmed that Ara-1 was linked at the C-3 position of the aglycon. The linkage at the C-28 position and sequence of the disaccharide chain Glc(1→6)Glc were confirmed by the HMBC correlations of H-1′′ (

 <sc>d</sc>-glucose, 
 <sc>l</sc>-arabinose by HPLC after acid hydrolysis. Therefore, compound
