<p>Efforts have been made to identify the specific chemical components responsible for the immunomodulatory activities of 
 <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-03699" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As a result, various oleanolic acid-based saponins, as well as its aglycon, were isolated preferentially as pure forms, suggesting that oleanolic acid-based glycosides are, at least in part, responsible for the pharmacological activities of 
 <italic>S. hexaphylla</italic>.
