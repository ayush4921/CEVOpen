<p>Leaf leachate is one of the major routes of allelochemical release into the environment and, just like other routes of allelochemical release, requires a specific bioassay to evaluate plants with such potential. The sandwich method was developed to evaluate the allelopathic activity of plants through leaf leachates under controlled laboratory conditions [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is a less time-consuming bioassay method that can be used to screen a large number of samples [

 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this study, either 10 or 50 mg of dried sample was placed into each well of a six-well multi-dish plastic plate. Agar growth medium in the sandwich method was found to be best for the lettuce seedling growth in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, we used agar (Nakalai Tesque, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan; 0.75% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) as the growth medium after sterilization (115 °C, for 2 h). Lettuce (
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L. Great Lakes 366, Takii Seed Co. Ltd., Japan) was used as the test plant material in the initial bioassay because of its uniformity in germination and sensitivity to allelochemicals [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After placing five seeds of lettuce on the agar medium, the multi-dish plastic plates were sealed with plastic tape and covered with aluminum foil for incubation under completely dark conditions for 72 h at 22 °C. The blank control was set up without any plant material, and five lettuce seeds were placed on the agar medium in each well. The lettuce radicle and hypocotyl lengths were measured and compared with that of the control to calculate elongation percentage (Equation (1)). Each experiment was repeated three times, and the average value was obtained.
