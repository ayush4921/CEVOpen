<p>The management of weeds on the field is an important measure for crop production in most countries including China. Weeds constantly compete with crop plants, causing considerable crop productivity losses in many agricultural systems. In effect, weeds have been documented as serious plant pests since ancient times [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Weeds have always played a significant role throughout the domestication of crop plants, necessitating the practice of weed control measures [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In modern agricultural practices, herbicides are widely used to control weeds, but there are some environmental concerns about their excessive use. Furthermore, cases of herbicide resistant/tolerant weeds are gradually on the rise [

Allelopathy is a phenomenon observed in many organisms (especially in plants) that involves the production and release of bioactive compounds into the environment. These compounds (allelochemicals) are released from the aerial or underground parts in the form of root exudation, leachates by dews and rains, volatilization, or decomposition of plant tissue. These bioactive compounds influence the growth and development (inhibitory or stimulatory) of neighboring plants [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The weed suppressive and antimicrobial activities of some allelopathic plants or their extracts have been reported [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are increasing opportunities to utilize allelopathic species or their extracts to minimize the use of synthetic herbicides in sustainable agriculture [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. From an ecological perspective, allelopathy may play an important role in the process of biological invasion. Some invasive plant species are perceived to be successful because they possess novel bioactive compounds that function as allelopathic agents or as mediators of the new plantâ€“plant interactions [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some effects of allelochemicals on the growth and development of susceptible plants include, but are not limited to, reduced radicle and shoot extension, darkened and/or swollen seeds, curling of root axis, discoloration of seeds, lack of root hairs, necrosis, increased number of seminal roots, and reduced dry weight accumulation [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous studies on the screening for potential allelopathic species by water extraction method found that medicinal plants showed relatively strong allelopathic activity [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Medicinal plants are an important part of the biodiversity of China, and there are about 10,608 medicinal higher plant species. This accounts for about 83.4% of all medicinal biological resources in China [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and about 30.3% of all medicinal plants in the world [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00684" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, studies about these Chinese medicinal plant species for allelopathic potential have not been widely reported. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential allelopathic activity of Chinese medicinal plants and identify the allelochemical responsible for the plant growth inhibitory effects of the candidate species.
