<p>Identification and quantification of shikimic acid in the fruit of star anise were conducted by using reversed-phase High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The data were evaluated according to the retention time and UV spectrum of the standard compound. The quantification of shikimic acid was obtained from the calibration equation from the peak areas of the standard solutions at the different concentrations. The HPLC chromatograms of standard shikimic acid and star anise are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00684-f002">Figure 2</xref>. According to the calibration equation, shikimic acid contents of star anise were determined. It was found that the fruits of star anise contained relatively high shikimic acid content (7.1% dry weight).
