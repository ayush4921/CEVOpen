 </sup> Varying concentrations of Date palm extracts were used to assess the microbial biofilm inhibition. The microtiter plate assay was used to quantify the biofilm inhibition potential by measuring the absorbance of the solubilized crystal violet at 550 nm in microtiter plate reader using 30% acetic acid in water as the blank. All the tests were carried out in triplicates.
