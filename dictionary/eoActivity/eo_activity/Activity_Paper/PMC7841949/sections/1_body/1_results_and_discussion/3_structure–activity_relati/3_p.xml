<p>Among halogen-substituted derivatives, compound 
 <bold>13</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.1 ± 0.1 μM) bearing bromo group at 
 <italic>para</italic> substitution was slightly more active in comparison to the 
 <italic>meta</italic> bromo-substituted compound 
 <bold>14</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.27 ± 0.04 μM). Compound 
 <bold>15</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.09 ± 0.11 μM) having 
 <italic>para</italic> fluoro group was the most active compound of this series, which may be due to the inductive effect of the fluoro group. Changing the position of the fluoro group from para to meta in compound 
 <bold>16</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.25 ± 0.05 μM) resulted in decreased inhibition. Nonetheless, compound 
 <bold>17</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.38 ± 0.05 μM) with two fluoro atoms at ortho and para positions, respectively, demonstrated moderate inhibition in comparison to the standard acarbose, which was also found to be less active than compound 
 <bold>15</bold>, which showed that addition of another fluoro atom resulted in increased inductive effect, thus making it less available to bind with the active site of enzyme. Compound 
 <bold>18</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.20 ± 0.08 μM) with changed positions of the fluoro group also displayed similar activity to compound 
 <bold>17</bold> (
