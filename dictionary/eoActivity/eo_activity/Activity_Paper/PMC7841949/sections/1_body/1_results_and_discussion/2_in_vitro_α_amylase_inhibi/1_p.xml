<p>Twenty-four indole-3-acetamides 
 <bold>1–24</bold> were synthesized and screened for antihyperglycemic and antioxidant activities. The molecules 
 <bold>1–24</bold> displayed good to moderate inhibition against α-amylase enzyme with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging between 1.09 ± 0.11 and 2.84 ± 0.1 μM. However, the antioxidant potential was evaluated with DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities. All synthetic derivatives potentially scavenged the reactive oxygen species in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value ranges of 0.35 ± 0.1–2.19 ± 0.08 and 0.81 ± 0.25–2.75 ± 0.03 μM for ABTS and DPPH activities, respectively (
