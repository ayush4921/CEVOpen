<p>Indole-3-acetamides (
 <bold>1â€“24</bold>) were synthesized via a one-pot multicomponent reaction of indole-3-acetic acid with 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and different substituted anilines.

 </sup> First, indole-3-acetic acid was allowed to react with CDI in the presence of catalytic amount of pyridine in acetonitrile. Pyridine used in this reaction helps in the deprotonation of carboxylic acid and makes it more feasible to react with the coupling reagent. CO
 <sub>2</sub> gas evolved during the reaction resulted in the formation of an intermediate A, which was subsequently treated with different substituted anilines to afford indole-3-acetamides. The synthetic analogues were purified and characterized using different spectroscopic techniques including 
 <sup>1</sup>H-, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, electron ionization-mass spectroscopy (EI-MS), and high-resolution EI-MS (HREI-MS) (
