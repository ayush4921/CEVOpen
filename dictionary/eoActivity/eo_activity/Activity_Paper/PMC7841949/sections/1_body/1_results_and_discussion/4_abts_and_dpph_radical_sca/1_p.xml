<p>Among 24 synthetic derivatives, the 
 <italic>para</italic> flouro-substituted compound 
 <bold>15</bold> was found to exhibit superior ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activities in comparison to 
 <italic>para</italic> chloro-, bromo-, and iodo-substituted compounds 
 <bold>21</bold>, 
 <bold>13</bold>, and 
 <bold>20</bold>, respectively. It showed that the flouro group with a high negative inductive effect and the smallest size among all halogen substituents was most active, and an increased size of halogen atoms and decreased inductive effect resulted in declined scavenging activity. Compounds 
 <bold>14</bold>, 
 <bold>16</bold>, and 
 <bold>19</bold> with 
 <italic>meta</italic> bromo, flouro, and iodo substituents, respectively, displayed similar activities; nonetheless, these compounds were less active in comparison to their 
 <italic>para</italic>-substituted analogues. Compounds 
 <bold>17</bold> and 
 <bold>18</bold> bearing di-flouro substituents at ortho para and meta para positions, respectively, also displayed decreased activity in comparison to mono flouro-substituted compound 
 <bold>15</bold>. This pattern showed that the number, nature, and positions of the halogen groups play a crucial role in DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities.
