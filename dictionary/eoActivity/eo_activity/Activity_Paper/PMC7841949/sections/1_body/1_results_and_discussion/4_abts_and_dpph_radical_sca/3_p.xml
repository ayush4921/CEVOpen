<p>Hyperglycemia has many adverse effects along with the promotion of auto-oxidation of glucose to form free radicals. The antioxidant defense system is capable of scavenging a particular amount of free radicals; thus, the excessive production of free radicals results in macro- and microvascular dysfunction and polyneuropathy. Therefore, the drugs that can effectively scavenge the free-radical formation would be a preferable therapeutic strategy to prevent oxidative stress and the related diabetic vascular complications. Since the synthetic molecules (
 <bold>1–24</bold>) were capable of inhibiting the activity of α-amylase enzyme as well as free radicals, these molecules might act as lead candidates for drug discovery and research. Further research and modifications in the structures of these molecules might be helpful for the discovery of new drug molecules.
