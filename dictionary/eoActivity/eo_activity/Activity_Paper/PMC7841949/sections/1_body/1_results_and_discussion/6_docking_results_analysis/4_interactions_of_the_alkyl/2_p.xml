<p>Overall, the whole series of 2-(1
 <italic>H</italic>-indol-3-yl)-
 <italic>N</italic>-phenylacetamide derivatives shows the best activity against α-amylase enzyme. Different groups like halides, methanethiol, alkyl, and alkoxy groups at various positions of the phenol ring of the phenylacetamide compound may be responsible for their best inhibitory activity against α-amylase enzyme. Details about the interaction and docking of these compounds are given in
