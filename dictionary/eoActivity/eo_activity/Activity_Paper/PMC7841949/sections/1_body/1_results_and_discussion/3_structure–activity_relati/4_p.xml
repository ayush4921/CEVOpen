<p>Compound 
 <bold>19</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.28 ± 0.08 μM) having a 
 <italic>meta</italic>-substituted iodo group was less active compared with the 
 <italic>para</italic> iodo-substituted compound 
 <bold>20</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.14 ± 0.08 μM). Compound 
 <bold>21</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.76 ± 0.2 μM) with 
 <italic>para</italic> chloro substitution was the second most active compound of the series. Compound 
 <bold>22</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.33 ± 0.09 μM) bearing chloro and methyl substituents para to each other displayed weak inhibition in comparison to compound 
 <bold>21</bold>. The decreased activity of this compound might be due to the addition of methyl group and change in the position of the chloro group (
