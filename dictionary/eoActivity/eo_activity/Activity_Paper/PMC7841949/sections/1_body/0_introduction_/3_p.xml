<p>Indole belongs to the class of heterocyclic compounds and possesses a benzene ring fused with a pyrrole ring with a 10-electron system from four double bonds and one nitrogen atom lone pair. It has been used as a primary precursor molecule for the synthesis of a variety of pharmaceuticals and fragrances.

 </sup> Keeping in mind the antidiabetic potential of indoles, the synthetic molecules were considered for their α-amylase inhibition and antioxidant activity. The results showed that these compounds have dual abilities of lowering the postprandial hyperglycemia and scavenging the free radicals effectively and may serve as lead molecules in drug discovery and development (
