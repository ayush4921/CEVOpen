<p id="Par21"> In vitro antibacterial activity of all fractions was assessed against gram-positive and negative bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 6538P and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 8739). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by broth micro-dilution method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Serial dilutions of fractions and antimicrobial agents were prepared in 96-well plates by using (Mueller-Hinton Broth) MHB, and was made in a concentration ranging from 0.125 to 64 mg/mL Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) medium. The standard saline solution was prepared to get inoculants turbidity solution equal to 0.5 McFarland standards. The inoculants of the microbial strains were prepared from 20 h bacterial culture that were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland standard turbidity and were further diluted (1:100) using MHB medium just before adding to the serially diluted samples. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and MIC values were recorded as the lowest concentrations which could inhibit visible growth of microorganisms. Each experiment was done in triplicate. The ampicillin was used as the standard antibacterial agent.
