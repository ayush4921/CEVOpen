<p id="Par32">According to calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> values reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and chloroform fractions depicted much higher cytotoxicity than ethyl acetate and water-soluble fractions. However, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction was found to be more potent than chloroform fraction in such a manner that it showed IC
 <sub>50</sub>s = 20.89, 10.24, 20.98, and 26.90 µg/mL against A549, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HDF, respectively. Although the cytotoxic activity of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction towards A549 was a little lower than etoposide on the same cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.58 µg/mL), its activity towards MDA-MB-231 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.30 µg/mL) was as the same as etoposide (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.98 µg/mL). It merits mentioning that cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction against MCF-7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.24 µg/mL) was significantly higher than etoposide (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.08 µg/mL). Apart from high cytotoxicity against MCF-7, the higher the selectivity index (SI) ratio (2.6) was calculated comparing with those obtained for A549 and MDA-MB-231. SI indicates the cytotoxic selectivity for an agent against cancer cells versus normal cell. The greater the SI value is, the more toxic the agent is against cancerous cells but safe against HF [
