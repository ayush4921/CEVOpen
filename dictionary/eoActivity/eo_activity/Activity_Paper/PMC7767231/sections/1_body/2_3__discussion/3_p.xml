<p>Cytokines are immune response regulators for infection and play an important role in inflammation and trauma management [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. IL-1β is a member of the interleukin-1 family of cytokines, also known as catabolin [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. IL-1β produces as a protein through activated macrophages, which are processed in a proteolytic fashion by caspase-1. In inflammatory reactions, IL-1β is an important mediator of various cellular activities, such as cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, proposing that IL-1β plays a key role in microbial infections [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. T-cells and macrophages secrete IL-6, which triggers an immune reaction to trauma and other inflammatory tissue injuries, in response to a specific microbial molecule, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These PAMPs bind to a main class of molecules called pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system. They appear on the outside and intracellular compartments and cause the production of cytokines. Therefore, IL-6 appears in several disease processes such as cardiovascular, autoimmune, cancer and in septic disorders [

The results of the present study indicate that pretreatment of RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) to LPS treated rats showed significant reduction in the circulating plasma levels of IL-1β and IL-6 as compared to the LPS alone treated animals. These results are in agreement with the previous finding of Wali and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which indicated that IL-1β and IL-6 blockade may be an important novel treatment strategy against overwhelming sepsis or septic shock.
