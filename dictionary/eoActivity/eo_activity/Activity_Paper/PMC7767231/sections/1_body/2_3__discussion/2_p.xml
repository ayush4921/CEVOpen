<p>The life-threatening organ injury that occurs during gram-negative sepsis is not primarily the result of direct injurious actions of the bacteria but is postulated to be due to an excess of endogenous factors released by the host in response to the LPS portion of the gram-negative cell wall [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. TNF-α is an endogenous mediator associated with the initiation of events as a major proximal factor, which ultimately leads to organ injury and death in both animals and humans due to gram-negative sepsis. A number of experimental evidence suggests that TNF-α is a pivotal player in gram-negative sepsis pathogenesis. First, purified, endotoxin-free recombinant TNF-α induces the same clinical and pathological changes in experimental animals, as seen in gram-negative sepsis in patients [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Second, elevated circulating levels of TNF-α occur in patients with septic shock, and levels correlate with clinical outcomes [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Third, neutralizing antibodies to TNF-α protect against the lethality of either LPS or gram-negative bacteremia in various animal models [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This evidence suggests that, when used appropriately, antagonists of TNF-α production or actions may be effective in treating septic shock [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To treat gram-negative sepsis effectively with therapeutic strategies directed against potentially injurious endogenous factors, it is imperative to recognize the temporal expression of these endogenous factors in vivo. For example, dexamethasone is a potent inhibitor of LPS-stimulated TNF-α production, suppressing TNF-α synthesis and release both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, dexamethasone has proved to be poorly effective in treating septic shock in clinical studies [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This difference in effect is at least partially associated with the rapid temporal expression of TNF-α and the time of administration of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone is an effective inhibitor of TNF-α production if administered shortly before or after LPS challenge but is much less effective in inhibiting TNF-α production when administered 20 min after LPS [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. One reason why dexamethasone may be ineffective in the treatment of some clinical cases of septic shock is that it is administered too long after the initiating stimulus. Similarly, neutralizing antibodies against TNF-α is only effective in inhibiting the lethal effects of LPS or gram-negative bacteria when administered before or in some models shortly after the stimulus [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-06045" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the present study, our data demonstrated that pretreatment of RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) has potential to inhibit LPS induced inflammation as evident by the decreased plasma TNF-α circulating levels.
