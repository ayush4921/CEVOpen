<p>The hydro-alcoholic extract of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. obtained from leaves induced a significant antioxidant activity, the results being close to the value of ascorbic acid, used as standard reference. The results of the current study corroborate the traditional use of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. as antioxidant and suggested that the high antioxidant effect was due to the high amount of total phenolic content and total flavonoids content obtained. Moreover, the results obtained from in vivo and skin biophysical parameters assessments indicated that 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. presents anti-inflammatory activity and promising wound healing properties. Both basil hydro-alcoholic extracts show a good biocompatibility and tolerance on the vascular developing plexus, as indicated by the HET-CAM assay. The hydro-alcoholic extracts applied in the range of concentrations tested seem to be optimal beneficial ingredients for wound healing and regenerative medicine and they may be included even in nutraceutical formulations if the plant extracts are characterized in terms of active compounds and biological profile. In addition, the in vitro evaluations have shown that 
 <italic>Ocinum basilicum</italic> extract is a source of non-toxic active compounds on skin-related cells and it may act as a possible antimelanoma protective agent.
