<p>In order to verify the possible modifications of the skin parameters after exposure to the hydro-alcoholic basil extracts, in vivo evaluation was performed on healthy human skin. As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f005">Figure 5</xref>, no important modification of the main skin parameters was found during these tests: the level of the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) has changed with just around 2.5 g/m
 <sup>2</sup>/h in the case of both extracts while the modification was approx. 1.5 units for the reference; the melanin has increased with around 60 units for both extracts and 30 units for reference, but it is important to know that its scale is large, ranging between 0 and 999 units.
