<p>The HET-CAM (hen’s egg chorioallantoic membrane) method was used to evaluate biocompatibility and to explore the potential irritability induced on irrigated mucosal tissues by hydro-alcoholic basil extracts. The assessment involved monitoring the potential haemorrhage, coagulability or blood vessel lysis when exposed to sample solution for the duration of 5 min. Both extracts tested at the highest concentration considered for this study (150 µg/mL) induced a very weak sign of irritation, according to the scale set by Luepke (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f004">Figure 4</xref>), with no severe alteration of the developing vascular plexus. The SLS sample used as positive control indicated a high degree of irritation, while distilled water, the negative control, had no irritative effect. The solvent used as dilution media of the extracts (DMSO, 0.5% in distilled water), showed a low IS value, thus being non-irritative.
