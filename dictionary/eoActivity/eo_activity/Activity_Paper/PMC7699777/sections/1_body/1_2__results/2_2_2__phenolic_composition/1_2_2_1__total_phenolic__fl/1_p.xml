<p>Screening intervention was designed to identify the phenolic compounds (TP), the content of flavonoids and flavonols (TF and TFv), the condensed tannins (TT) and the antioxidant capacity, exerted by the two hydro-alcoholic extracts from 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. aerial part and leaves. The extraction yield percentages for the hydro-alcoholic extracts from 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. aerial part and leaves of using 70% ethanol by maceration techniques are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05442-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Likewise, in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05442-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> are depicted the total phenolic, flavonoid and flavonols content, using the Folin–Ciocalteu method and aluminium colorimetric assay, respectively; as well as the condensed tannins. The highest quantity of phenols was detected in leaves extract (OBHE)—231.62 mg GAE/g dm, whereas the hydro-alcoholic extract prepared from the whole aerial part (without leaves) showed a lower content, OBAE—177.36 mg GAE/g dm.
