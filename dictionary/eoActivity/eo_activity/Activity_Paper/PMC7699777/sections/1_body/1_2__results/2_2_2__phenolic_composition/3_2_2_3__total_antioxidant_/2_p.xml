<p>Referring to the reaction kinetics of the subsequent concentrations of OBAE hydro-alcoholic extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), all three concentrations react very quickly with DPPH radical, scavenging the substrate in the first 300 s; after that, the kinetic of the reaction reached equilibrium.
