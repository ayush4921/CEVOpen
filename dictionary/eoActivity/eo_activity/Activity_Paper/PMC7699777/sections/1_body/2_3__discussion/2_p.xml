 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. (basil) is an ancient plant used in traditional medicine due to its therapeutic potentials. In certain regions of the world, the fruits of basil are used against worm infestation, inflammations, combating diarrhea, even to treat certain eye diseases. People of Vietnam regularly consume basil infusions, due to its anthelmintic, diaphoretic, antiemetic, and antidiarrhoeaic properties. If they are well separated and prepared, parts of basil could be successfully used against pains, infections, impotency, hypertension and diabetes [

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. hydro-alcoholic extracts reveal a rich content regarding the investigated parameters (phenols, flavonoids, flavonols and condensed tannins), higher in the case of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. hydro-alcoholic extract obtained from leaves (OBHE) than that obtained from aerial parts (OBAE) (

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. ethanolic extract [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Comparing the results reported by the authors, our results are different and have shown increased activity. The authors found a total phenolic content of 175.57 ± 2.43 mg GAE/g plant material in ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. and a total flavonoids content of 6.72 ± 0.19 mg RE/g plant material. Furthermore, the results reported in the present study exceeded the results obtain for other samples of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. from Romania using various extractions emphasized. As an example, Benedec and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] obtained a value for total phenolic compounds equal with 7.36 ± 0.19 g RAE/100 g plant material. The values obtained in the present study regarding the total phenolic content and flavonoid content also exceeded the results obtain for aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. obtained by Yesiloglu and Sit [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The authors have reported that the values for the aqueous extract were: TP = 100 mg GAE/g extract and TF = 42.5 mg CE/g extract, whereas the values for the ethanolic extract were: TP = 116 mg GAE/g extract and TF = 24.2 mg CE/g extract. The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. prepared by Rezzoug and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] had a slightly lower phenolic compound content (226 mg/g, gallic acid equivalents) as against our results (231.62 mg GAE/g dm) and the highest flavonoid content (213 mg/g, rutin equivalents).
