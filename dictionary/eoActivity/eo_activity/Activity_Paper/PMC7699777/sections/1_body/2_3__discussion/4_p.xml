<p>For the identification of the individual phenolic compounds in both hydro-alcoholic extracts, the retention times and mass spectral were compared with the calibration standards. By using the external calibration method, which is based on peak areas, all quantification was performed. The LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of nine phytocompounds in both hydro-alcoholic extracts, such as: gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, epicathechin, coumaric acid, rutin, resveratrol, quercetin and kaempferol (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05442-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Many research studies have focused on exhibiting the pharmacological activities of these phytocompounds, which were also found by our research group in both hydro-alcoholic basil extracts investigated. In the literature data, these bioactive phytocompounds types, like—flavonoids, phenolic acids, and alkaloids have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiarrhoeal, antidepressant, hepatoprotective and anxiolytic properties. Moreover, both hydro-alcoholic basil extracts investigated in the present study are rich in flavonoids, flavonols, phenols, and tannins, which are polyphenolic compounds with demonstrated biologically activity against free radicals, microorganisms, toxins from liver, tumors and inflammation [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] investigated the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. and found the presence of flavonoids, phenolic compounds, protein, aminoacids, glycoside, gums, mucilage, tannins, flavones, triterpenes, steroids, and saponin. In a study conducted by Rezzoug and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the HPLC analysis of an ethanolic extract obtained from aerial parts (leaves) of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. detected 15 phenolic compounds. The data revealed that the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. had high amounts of rutin, epicatechin and vanillic acid: 476.28 μg/g, 225.01 μg/g, and 138.24 μg/g, respectively. Two phenolic compounds, quercetin (0.36 μg/g) and caffeic acid (6.48 μg/g), were found in low concentrations. By comparing their results with ours, it could be concluded that the differences might have come from the extract preparation and from the solvent used; since Rezzoug’s group used ethanol absolute as the extraction solvent, whereas in our case, 70% ethanol was used. Moreover, Vlase and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] prepared an ethanolic extract from all the aerial part of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. identifying and quantifying two hydroxycinnamic acid derivates (namely ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid); three flavonoid glycosides, isoquercitrin (quercetin 3-glucoside), rutin (quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside) and quercitrin (quercetin 3-rhamnoside) and two free flavonoid aglycons (quercetin and luteolin), found in small quantities. Caftaric, gentisic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids were also identified in the basil extract, but they were in too low concentrations to be quantified. Kwee and Niemeyer [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported that the methanolic extract of basil contains individual phenolic compounds, influencing its antioxidant capacity. However, regarding the major differences recorded between our research group and other researchers in terms of LC-MS analysis’ results, they could have come from various parameters such as: extraction method applied, extraction solvent, extraction time and so on [
