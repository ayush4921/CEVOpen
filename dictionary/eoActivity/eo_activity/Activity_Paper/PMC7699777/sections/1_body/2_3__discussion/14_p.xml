<p>The Interagency Coordinating Committee on the Validation of Alternative Methods, together with 15 regulatory and research agencies, including Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began to focus, more than 10 years ago, on developing new promising alternative animal models, in order to reduce or even replace the use of animal models in in vivo studies. The promising alternative methods are designed both to reduce the number of animals used, thus exempting more animal models of pain and suffering, as well as to obtain preliminary data. One of the alternative methods proposed by the Interagency is the hen’s egg test on the chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) [

Comparing the outcome induced by the two extracts, the leaf extract showed a better degree of biocompatibility, causing minimal signs of irritability upon the vascularized chorioallantoic membrane. Other studies indicated
