<p>As a general observation, the results obtained in this study revealed that OBHE and OBAE induced only a slight dose-dependent cell viability reduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f002">Figure 2</xref>) on the healthy cell panel. Human melanoma A375 cells were affected only after treatment with the highest test concentration 150 µg/mL of OBHE and OBAE, the cells expressing viability of 64.42% and 76.42%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f003">Figure 3</xref>). These results may be related to either cells’ phenotype or to the low concentrations used (25, 50, 75 and 150 µg/mL), since regarding the cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. on tumorigenic cell lines, Al-Ali and co-workers demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect was more pregnant when extract concentration equal with 160 and 320 µg/mL were used on the hormone-sensitive breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell line, therefore, higher concentrations than those tested in the present study [

Nevertheless, taking into consideration these aspects, it would be recommended as a future research direction that cell viability assays to be repeated under the same parameters (hydro-alcoholic extracts and the cell lines) as those employed in the current study, but using higher concentrations (e.g., 250, 500, and 1000 µg/mL) to make a better correlation between the effect induced by higher concentrations (&gt;250 µg/mL) of basil extracts on non-tumorigenic cells versus tumoral cell lines. In another study, Arshad Qamar et al. revealed that basil methanolic extract manifested anti-proliferative effects on MCF-7 cells, which can be related to the alterations of microtubule assembly induced by ursolic acid from the basil methanolic extract [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This group of authors fractionated the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> into petroleum ether in two fractions: soluble and insoluble. From the insoluble fraction four compounds were isolated, mainly ursolic acid, which was further applied at a concentration of 100 µM on MCF-7 cells to assess the cell viability percentage. Finally, we believe that the cytotoxic potential is given by the ursolic acid not by the basil methanol extract itself (like it was used in the present study). In addition, it is well-known that ursolic acid has antitumor potential; moreover, the authors sustained the fact that the anti-proliferative potential of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> extract against breast cancer cells may be partly due to the effects of ursolic acid on F-actin and microtubules [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Kathirvel and Ravi demonstrated that 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> oil induced significant anti-tumor effect on other cell lines: human cervical cancer—HeLa cells and human laryngeal epithelial carcinoma—HEp-2 cells, showing an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 90.5 and 96.3 mg/mL, respectively [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In this case, the authors used the MTT assay for cytotoxicity screening and found out that at concentrations between 150–300 µg/mL, the basil essential oil affects the percentage of cell viability significantly, reaching a rate of 100%. The essential oil of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> showed a dose dependent cytotoxicity (from 20 to 300 µg/mL) on all cell lines tested. The same study reported a cytotoxic effect manifested by 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> oil on mouse embryonic fibroblasts—NIH 3T3 cells, still the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (120.7 mg/mL) is higher than those recorded for tumor cells [
