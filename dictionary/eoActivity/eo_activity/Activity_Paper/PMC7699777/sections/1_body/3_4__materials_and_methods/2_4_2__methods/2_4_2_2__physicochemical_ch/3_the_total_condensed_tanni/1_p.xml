<p>The TT content in both hydro-alcoholic extracts was determined by dosing polyphenols contained in the analyzed samples, which are adsorbed on the hide powder, according to the protocol described by our group of research in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. First of all, the filtrate of each hydro-alcoholic extracts was prepared by adding an exactly volume of water to a specific amount of each lyophilized extracts, and then, the mixture was heated in a water bath for 30 min. After cooling under running water, each mixture was quantitatively transferred to a 250 mL volumetric flask. The solution was filtered, and the first 50 mL of the filtrate was removed. Then, from each filtrate were calculated the total polyphenols and the polyphenols that were not adsorbed on the hide powder. After the pyrogallol solution was determined, the percentage content of tannins was expressed using the following Equation (1):
