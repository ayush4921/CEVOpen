<p>The MTT assay was employed to evaluate the cell viability of all five selected cell lines (normal—HaCaT, JB6 Cl 41-5a, 1BR3, HEMa and and tumorigenic—A375 cells) after 24 h post-treatment with different concentrations (25, 50, 75, and 150 µg/mL) of OBAE and OBHE. This technique is a consecrated method used to evaluate the cell viability of various cell lines exposed to diverse compounds, including phytocompounds. In brief, 1×10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well were plated onto a 96-well plate. The following day, cell media was removed and the cells were treated with different concentrations of OBAE and OBHE (25, 50, 75, and 150 µg/mL) for 24 h. Control cells were treated with specific growth media. To determine cell viability rate, the absorbance of each well was measured at 570 nm wavelength, by the means of spectrophotometry, using a microplate reader (xMarkTM Microplate; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).
