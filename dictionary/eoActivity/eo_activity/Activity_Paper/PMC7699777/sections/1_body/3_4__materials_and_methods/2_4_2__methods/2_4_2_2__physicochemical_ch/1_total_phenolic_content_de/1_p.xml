<p>The total phenolic content of both hydro-alcoholic extracts from basil leaves and aerial part was evaluated using the Folin-Ciocalteu method, slightly modified [

The absorbance of each sample was measured at 760 nm using an UviLine 9400 Spectrophotometer from SI Analytics (Deutschland, Germany). An ethanolic solution of gallic acid was tested in parallel in order to obtain a calibration curve (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.996). The total phenolic content of the two extracts were calculated as milligrams of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per gram of dry material.
