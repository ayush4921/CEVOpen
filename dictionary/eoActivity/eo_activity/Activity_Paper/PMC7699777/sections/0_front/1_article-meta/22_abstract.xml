 <p>The current study was aimed to evaluate the phenolic composition parameters of two hydro-alcoholic extracts of 
  <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. (OB) obtained from the aerial part (without leaves) and leaves, in order to determine their contribution to the antioxidant activity (AOA). Both hydro-alcoholic extracts have proven to be rich in polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, flavonols and tannins. Therefore, the leavesâ€™ extracts reveal an inhibition percentage of 89%, almost comparable with the standard reference (95%). To complete the toxicological profile, the study also assessed the potential cytotoxicity of basil hydro-alcoholic extracts on immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT), skin human fibroblasts (1BR3), mice epidermis (JB6Cl41-5a) and primary human melanocytes (HEMa) cells, correlated to A375 antitumor in vitro activity. The extracts did not induce significant cytotoxic effect on any of the selected normal cell lines but showed relevant activity on A375 cells. Considering the low values obtained regarding the irritative effects in the chorionallantoic membrane of the egg on blood vessels, we can emphasize that both extracts can be considered as biocompatible ingredients. Regarding the potential activity of hydro-alcoholic extracts on human skin, the decrease of erythema values after the application of extracts was a relevant observation which indicates the anti-inflammatory potential of
