<p>The IC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% inhibitory concentration) assumed a similar trend to that of percentage motility. Based on the IC
 <sub>50,</sub> the methanol extract was more efficient than the aqueous extract (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). This was evidenced by the lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.766 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> recorded by methanol extract compared to a higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.295 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> recorded by aqueous extract against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> Bristol N2 after 48 h (

 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.906 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> proved more promising against the motility of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 after 48 h than the aqueous extract which recorded a higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.45 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 (
