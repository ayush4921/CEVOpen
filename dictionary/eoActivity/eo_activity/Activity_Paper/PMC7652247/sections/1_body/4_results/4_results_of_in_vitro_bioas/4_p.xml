<p>Generally, a significant difference was recorded in the larvicidal activity between aqueous and methanol extract (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) against both strains of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, the extracts performance against the motility of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> Bristol N2 and 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 were statistically the same (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). A highly significant difference between the performance of ivermectin and the extracts against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 was recorded (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) as ivermectin was not effective against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316. This is also evidenced by the performance of ivermectin and the negative control against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 were statistically the same (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). However, ivermectin proved more efficient than the plant extracts (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) against the motility of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> Bristol N2.
