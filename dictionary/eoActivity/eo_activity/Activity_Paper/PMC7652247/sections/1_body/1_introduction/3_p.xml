<p>Furthermore, sustainable worm control has been threatened by anthelmintic resistant species of the parasites especially those of small ruminants because understanding the genetic basis of resistant of parasitic nematode is extremely difficult. This problem has been overcome to some extent with the emergence of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a research model especially in studying anthelmintic resistance. This organism has been central to define the mechanism of anthelminthic action and this could serve as a model to solve the problem resulting from anthelmintic resistant (
