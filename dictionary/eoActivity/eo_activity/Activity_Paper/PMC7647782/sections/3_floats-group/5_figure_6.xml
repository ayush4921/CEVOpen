  <p>Cytotoxic effect of ethanol (a) and aqueous (b) extracts upon MDA-MB-231, Lovo, and HCT-116 cell lines. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results are expressed as a relative percentage of the optical density (OD) values measured in the control (untreated cells) and in the ethanolic or aqueous extract-treated cells. Results are reported as the means Â± SD of triplicate measurements.</p>
