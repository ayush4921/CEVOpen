<p>In order to study whether ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> were able to produce inhibitory or lethal effect on human cell lines, the cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> extracts in MDA-MB-231, Lovo, and HCT-116 cells was evaluated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Recorded data support our starting hypothesis of a viable use of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> extracts as a therapeutic drug for metabolic syndrome or other related disease. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> and clinical studies are needed to support the results obtained in this study.
