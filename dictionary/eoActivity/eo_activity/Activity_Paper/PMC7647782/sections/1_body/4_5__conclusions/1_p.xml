<p>The results of this study indicate that E. 
 <italic>cyparissias</italic> is a good source of inhibitors for various digestive enzymes (such as 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase, lipases, and phospholipases) and has considerable antioxidant properties. In addition, the ethanolic extract was found to present a higher inhibition activity when compared to the aqueous extract and all positive or commercial inhibitors used. Therefore, this new natural plant-based drug may be a promising alternative to prevent and treat metabolic syndrome.
