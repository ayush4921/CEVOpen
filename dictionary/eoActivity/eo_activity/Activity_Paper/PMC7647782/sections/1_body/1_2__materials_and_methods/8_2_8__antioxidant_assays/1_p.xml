<p>In every sample of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> extract, the antioxidant activity was evaluated by using the DPPH radical scavenging and reducing power assays as previously described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. To measure DPPH activity, a sample of 0.5 mL for each concentration was mixed with an equal volume of DPPH ethanolic solution and incubated in darkness for 1 h at ambient temperature. The activity was determined by comparing the absorbance at 519 nm of DPPH radicals to that of the control (containing all reagents except the extract).
