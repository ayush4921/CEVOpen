<p>The inhibitory effect of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> on dromedary, stingray, and porcine lipase activities were investigated at different concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The assay was carried out by incubating 12 IU of enzymes (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of extract. A positive control using commercial orlistat (Xenical, Hoffmann-La Roche) was run in parallel in the same conditions. Inhibition of lipase activities was expressed as the percentage of residual activity after incubation with Euphorbia extracts compared to the negative control (no enzyme added). Lipase activities were measured using tributyrin as a substrate under the optimal conditions for each enzyme, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values correspond to the half maximal inhibitory concentration.
