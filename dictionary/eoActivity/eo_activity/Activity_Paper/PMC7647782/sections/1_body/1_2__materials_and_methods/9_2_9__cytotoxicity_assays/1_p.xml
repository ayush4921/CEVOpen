<p>In order to test the possible cytotoxic effect of the two extracts on human cell lines, the viability of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (ATTC, Manassas, VA, USA), Lovo, and HCT-116 cell lines were evaluated after incubation for 48 h with different concentrations of ethanolic and aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic>. Cells were grown to confluence at 37°C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in DMEM medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mg/mL D-glucose, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 IU/mL of penicillin, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of streptomycin. Solutions containing 10, 25, 50, and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL were mixed with DMEM. A negative control was run in parallel using the same volume of saline buffer. After 24 h, MDA-MB-231, Lovo, and HCT-116 cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, stained with a solution of 0.1% crystal violet, and lysed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Absorbance was then measured at 600 nm. Experiments were carried out in triplicate. Cytotoxicity was expressed as a relative percentage of the optical density (OD) values measured in the control and those of ethanolic and aqueous extract-treated cells.
