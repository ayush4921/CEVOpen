 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the inhibitory effect of ethanolic and aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> on the three digestive phospholipases used. Interestingly, the obtained data clearly indicated that both the ethanolic and the aqueous extracts (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>) effectively suppressed activities of all phospholipases used better than the oleanolic acid used as a positive control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values presented in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> showed that the ethanolic extract was about two to three times more efficient to inhibit the digestive phospholipases used than the aqueous extract. The ethanolic extract inhibited the three enzymes with an IC
