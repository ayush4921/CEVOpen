<p>As shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1(c)</xref>, the two extracts as well as the commercial inhibitor tested caused a dose-dependent inhibition at the concentrations range used. One can also note that, out of the two extracts tested, the ethanolic extract showed the most promising results in inhibiting the lipolytic activity of the three enzymes with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.0 ± 0.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 2.9 ± 0.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 2.3 ± 0.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for DrPL, SPL, and PPL, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The aqueous extract inhibited the three enzymes with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 23.1 ± 0.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for DrPL, 21.0 ± 0.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for SPL, and 27.2 ± 0.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for PPL. Notably, the inhibitory potency of the two extracts on tested lipase activities was more pronounced than that of the commercial drug orlistat showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 97.2 ± 2.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/L, 109.8 ± 4.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/L, and 52.1 ± 2.3
