<p>The result of the DPPH radical scavenging assay is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Among the studied plant extracts, root, leaves, and stem extracts of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> exhibited high antioxidant activity in DPPH free radical scavenging assay as 89%, 88%, and, 81%, respectively, in 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of leaves extract was 9.80 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml. Similarly, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of root extract and stem extract was found to be 10.19 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml and 13.64 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml, respectively, which was very close to that of standard (ascorbic acid) as 9.99 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml. The leaves extract of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> exhibited DPPH radical scavenging assay as 34% with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 19.73 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml, but flower extract of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> exhibited low antioxidant activity, i.e., 4% with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 165.36 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml. IC
 <sub>50</sub> is defined as the amount of antioxidant required to inhibit 50% of DPPH free radicals under the experimental conditions.
