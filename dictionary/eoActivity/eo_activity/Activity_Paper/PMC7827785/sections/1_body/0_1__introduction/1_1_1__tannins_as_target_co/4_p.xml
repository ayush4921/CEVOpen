<p>Finally, CoTs and PTs will be briefly described. CoTs are tannins of high molecular weight, created as a result of the bonding between flavan-3-ols with either GTs or ETs. This type of tannin can be obtained from tree species such as

Finally, PTs are polyphenols obtained from brown marine algae and formed by phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) (PG) synthesized via the acetate–malonate pathway. They are grouped into six major groups (fucols, phloroetols, fucophloroteols, fuhalols, carmalols and eckols) depending on to the type of bonds between PG units and their content of hydroxyl groups, being more complex with a higher level of PG units [
