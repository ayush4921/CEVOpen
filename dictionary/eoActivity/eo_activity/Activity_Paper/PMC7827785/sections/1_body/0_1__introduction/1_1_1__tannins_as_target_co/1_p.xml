<p>Tannins are a diverse group within phenolic compounds widely distributed in nature. They are secondary metabolites of plants usually produced as a result of stress and they exert a protective role, including photoprotection against UV rays and free radicals or defense against other organisms and environmental conditions, such as dryness [

 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00137" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tannins are a heterogeneous group, having molecular weights between 500 and 20,000 Da and very different chemical structures [

This property is related to their chemical structure as they possess phenolic rings able to bind to a wide range of molecules and act as electron scavengers to trap ions and radicals [

Regarding tannin classification, they have been historically classified into hydrolyzable tannins (HTs) and condensed tannins (CTs), and the latter are also called proanthocyanidins. Nowadays, the classification according to their chemical characteristic and structural properties has been updated. Thus, tannins can be grouped into gallotannins, ellagitannins, CTs, complex tannins (CoTs) and phlorotannins (PTs, an exclusive class of tannins found in the algal species of the Phaeophyceae class) [
