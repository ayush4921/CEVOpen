<p>Tannins extracted from different genera have also been experimentally demonstrated to act as antiviral agents. For instance, an extract of 
 <italic>P. granatum</italic>, with punicalagin, GA and EA as major components, was analyzed against herpes simplex virus 2. The compound punicalagin showed significant antiviral activity, comparable with the positive control. However, when used as part of the extract, the required concentration to achieve total inhibition was higher [

When these three HTs were tested in a human hepatocyte cell line (HepG2.117), they showed a dose-dependent reduction of supernatant e antigen levels, which indicated that the tannins were interfering with the synthesis, stability or transcription of the viral DNA [

 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> and 
 <italic>Taraxcum officinale</italic> exhibited inhibitory effects in the range of 126–166 μg/mL against dengue virus serotype 2 when tested in vitro using hamster kidney cells (BHK-21). Recently, an in silico evaluation of the application of 19 HTs was performed to screen their potential ability to inhibit the activity of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the potential allosteric ligand of different HTs with 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease enzyme (described to be involved in virus transcription) was evaluated. Among the tested HTs, pedunculagin, tercatain and castalin interacted with the catalytic dyad Cys145 and His41 through stronger binding forces. Other HTs, like tellimagradin I, punicalin, chebulagic acid or β-pedunculagin, may have secondary roles in the inhibition of the activity of this catalytic target [
