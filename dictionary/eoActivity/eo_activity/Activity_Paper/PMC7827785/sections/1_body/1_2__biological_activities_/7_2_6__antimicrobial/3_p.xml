<p>Different parts of 
 <italic>C. sativa</italic> (leaves, burs, outer and inner shells) were also tested for antibacterial activity. Leaves contained the highest phenolic composition, with trigalloyl-HHDP-glucose-like molecules, as major tannin representatives, also present in burs. Outer shells were rich in GA, while the main compound in the inner shell was syringetin-hexoside. Extracts from inner shells were able to inhibit the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. faecium,</italic> and Gram-negative 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniaea</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, with MIC values between 25 and 50 mg/mL [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic>, such as vescalagin and castalagin, were isolated, purified and demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Apart from them, commercial crude extracts obtained from quebracho, chestnut and mimosa, and two classes of tannic acid and one of GA, were analyzed. From the results, it was observed that tannic acid possesses much better growth inhibitor activity than GA against 
 <italic>E. coli.</italic> On the other hand, a crude extract of chestnut had stronger antibacterial properties than purified vescalagin and castalagin, probably due to the synergy exerted by the molecules contained in the extract [

 <italic>C. sativa</italic> extracts have been reported to inhibit 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> growth when applied at 1200 µg/mL and 3–150 µg/mL, respectively [
