<p>Antifungals have a broad range of applications but it is difficult to determine the ideal treatment regime because their use can be limited and is often accompanied by side effects. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to an increased resistance to these types of medications (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">De Oliveira Santos et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, researchers are exploring therapeutic alternatives, such as the use of plant essential oils or extracts. These have been proven beneficial in the treatment of several diseases due to their phytochemical components that have physiological and therapeutic effects on humans, limited toxicity, and low therapeutic costs (

 <xref rid="ref-80" ref-type="bibr">Sardi et al., 2013</xref>). The World Health Organization reports indicate that up to 25% of modern medicines used in the United States of America originate from plants. In Africa and Asia, 80% of the population still uses medicinal herbs in their primary health care centers (

 <italic>Vitex</italic> is one of the largest of the 250 genera in the family Verbenaceae found worldwide (

 <italic>Vitex agnus-castus</italic> (VA-C) and its safety as a medicinal plant are well stated (

 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Ghannadi et al., 2012</xref>). Other studies have investigated the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from the leaves of VA-C (

 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Keikha et al. (2018)</xref> evaluated the antifungal activity of ethanolic and aqueous lead extracts on
