<p>We found that the extracts of VA-C differed in their inhibitory effect according to the type of solvent and this is may be due to the difference in the degree of polarity between the solvent. Water has the highest polarity of 1,000 followed by methanol (0.762) and finally, ethanol (0.654). The compounds extracted by these highly polar solvents differ in quantity and quality (
