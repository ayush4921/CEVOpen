<p>Our results showed that alcohol extracts (methanol and ethanol) and aqueous extract have the ability to inhibit the growth of all tested 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. These results are in agreement with 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Kalhoro, Farheen &amp; Aqsa (2014)</xref> study, which found that the ethanol VA-C leaf extract has the potential to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Our results are also consistent with 
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Malta≈ü et al. (2010)</xref> who observed that the methanol extract of VA-C leaves inhibits the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Moreover, we showed that the inhibitory capacity of the solvents varied significantly in descending order of ethanol, then water, then methanol. These results are in line with a recent study conducted by 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Keikha et al. (2018)</xref> who found that VA-C ethanol leaf extract has the highest inhibiting effect against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> isolates than water extract. Our results showed a similarity in the inhibitory effect of all extracts with nystatin (10 mcg) as a positive control against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, where the inhibitory effect for the positive control was higher than all extracts against 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>.
