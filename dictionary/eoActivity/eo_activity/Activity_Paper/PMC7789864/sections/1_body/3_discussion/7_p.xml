<p>The GC-MC analysis result revealed that all three VA-C extracts were rich in chemical compounds that act as an anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti-Alzheimer, anti-diarrheal, anti-diabetic, anti-viral, antioxidant, anti-allergic, nematicide, antibacterial, antifungal. These extracts are also used as food preservatives and flavorings, as previously found in other published works (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Several of these secondary metabolites belong to important chemical groups such as polyphenols, fatty acids, terpenes, terpenoid, steroids, aldehydes, alcohol, and esters. These results are in agreement with a previous study of 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Keikha et al. (2018)</xref>, which stated that the VA-C extract was rich in chemical compounds, and the alcoholic extract contained 36 chemical compounds that belong to different chemical groups. Our results showed that the majority of compounds were 4,5-Dichloro-1,3-dioxolan-2-one in both ethanol and methanol, 1H-Indene, 2,3-dihydro-1,1,2,3,3-pentamethyl in ethanol, Isobutyl 4-hydroxybenzoate in methanol, and Benzoic acid and 4-hydroxy- in water. 
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Keikha et al. (2018)</xref> found that the majority of compounds in the VA-C ethanol extract were Î±-Pinene, isoterpinolene, caryophyllene, and azulene. The difference in the number of phytochemical compounds may be attributed to the variations among the VA-C genotypes (
