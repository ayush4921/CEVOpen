 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The gum portion is composed of pentose and hexose sugar containing a couple of oxidation and digestive enzymes. The essential oil is a mix of mono-terpenes, diterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. β-boswellic acid (Bas) is the main constituent of each species of the genus 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure1</xref>). There are 6 main Bas, including α- and β-BA (10 to 21%), acetylated α- and β-BA (0.05–6%), 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA, 2.5 to 7.5%), and 3-O-acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA, 0.1– 3%), which are found in each 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species with variable amounts. The contents of BA, which can be found in the market as the standardized extracts, change from 37.5-65% (
