 <italic>Boswellia</italic> internationally known as Indian frankincense or olibanum has been used to treat various diseases. The frankincense or olibanum, a yellowish-brown oleo-gum resin, is prepared from 
 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species such as 
 <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> (

 <italic>Boswellia</italic> genus contains about 25 different species. A number of the prominent species consist of 
 <italic>B. frereana, B. sacra, B. ovalifoliolata, B. carterii, B. papyrifera, B. rivae, B. neglecta</italic>, and so forth (

 <italic>Boswellia</italic> in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (

 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> gum on diabetic side effects in animal models (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Moreover, this plant has useful impacts on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL), blood glucose, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of patients with diabetes who had received 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> gum at a dosage of 900 mg every day with no significant complications (
