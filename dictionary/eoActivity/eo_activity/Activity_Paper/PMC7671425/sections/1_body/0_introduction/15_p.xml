 <italic>Boswellia</italic> species tree and the corresponding gummy resin are completely known due to their useful impacts on several diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM) (

 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the extract of 
 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> has antidiabetic impacts and can prevent the microvascular complications of diabetes in the kidney and liver (

 <italic>B.</italic>
 <italic>serrata</italic> oleo-gum-resin generated considerable antidiabetic activities via influencing the hepatic gluconeogenesis, pyruvate carboxylase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (

 <italic>et al.</italic> studied AKBA contribution to the prevention of inducing auto-immune reaction, insulitis, and hyperglycemia in a model of multiple low dose streptozotocin (MLD-STZ) diabetes. The induction of hyperglycemia or high blood sugar has been done via injection of IP 40 mg/kg STZ in male mice for five days every day, whereas the second treatment group has been administered KBA with STZ for ten days. In STZ treated rats, a considerable burst of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltrating lymphocytes (CD3) into pancreatic islets, and emerging peri-insular apoptotic cells have been registered. A significant increase in plasma glucose has been observed (124.4±6.65 versus 240.2±27.36 mg/dl, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05). Nonetheless, concurrent treatments with AKBA and KBA indicated a significant decrease in pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the detection of infiltrating lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and emerging peri-insular cells has not been reported (
