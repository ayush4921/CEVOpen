<p>Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was initially obtained as a white amorphous solid. HRESIMS analysis of 
 <bold>2</bold> revealed a molecular formula of C
 <sub>27</sub>H
 <sub>36</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 489.2490 for [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup>), implying 2 C and 4 H more than in Aspidin BB 
 <bold>1</bold>. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum displayed remarkably downfield-shifted singulet signals at

 <sub>H</sub> 15.86, 11.41 and, 10.05, which are characteristic of the hydroxyl groups found in acylphloroglucinols Aspidin derivatives [

 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR data of 
 <bold>2</bold> were very similar to those for 
 <bold>1</bold> except for the presence of a supplementary signal at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 1.39 (m) integrating four protons (H11 and H12), and a two methyl triplet at

 <sub>H</sub> 0.93 (
