<p>In accordance with the literature [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Aspidin BB (
 <bold>1</bold>) was strongly active against both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and MRSA but was inactive against the human pathogenic fungi. Aspidin BB (
 <bold>1</bold>) is known to exert strong antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, like 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermis</italic> or 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Li et al. identified the relationship between antibacterial activity and increase levels of reactive oxygen species in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells. Moreover, the authors demonstrated that 
 <bold>1</bold> induced peroxidation of membranes, DNA damage and protein degradation in 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. By comparing the effects of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains, our results demonstrated that a longer carbon chain (2 additional carbons) on the acylfilinic acid moiety is correlated with 4- to 8-fold stronger activity (

 <bold>1</bold>), the antibacterial potency of Aspidin VB (
 <bold>2</bold>) may result from better cell wall penetration due to a longer alkyl chain inducing improved lipophilicity. Computed molecular properties of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were obtained with the SwissADME web tool (
