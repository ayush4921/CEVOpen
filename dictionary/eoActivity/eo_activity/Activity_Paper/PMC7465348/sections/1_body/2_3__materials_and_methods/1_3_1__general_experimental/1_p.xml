<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer or on a Bruker 700 MHz spectrometer equipped with 5 mm inverse detection Bruker. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in ppm based on the signal for TMS. Chemical shifts were referenced using the corresponding solvent signals (

 <sub>H</sub> 2.05 and

 <sub>C</sub> 29.92 for (CD

 <sub>2</sub>CO). HRESIMS measurements were performed using a Waters Acquity UHPLC system with a column bypass coupled to a Waters Micromass LCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface (ESI). X-ray diffraction data for compound 
 <bold>1</bold> were collected on the PROXIMA 2A (PX2A) beamline at the SOLEIL Synchrotron, Gif-sur-Yvette, Paris, France. They were indexed, integrated with XDS [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and scaled with AIMLESS [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as implemented within the autoProc toolbox [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For compound 
 <bold>2</bold>, data were collected using redundant ω scans on a Rigaku XtaLabPro single-crystal diffractometer using microfocus Mo Kα radiation and a HPAD PILATUS3 R 200K detector. Its structure was readily solved by intrinsic phasing methods (SHELXT) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and by full-matrix least-squares methods on F2 using SHELX-L [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The non-hydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically, and hydrogen atoms, identified in difference maps, were positioned geometrically and treated as riding on their parent atoms. Molecular graphics were computed with Mercury 4.3.0. Flash chromatography was performed on a Grace Reveleris system with dual UV and ELSD detection equipped with a 40 g C
 <sub>18</sub> column. Preparative HPLCs were conducted with a Gilson system equipped with a 322 pumping device, a GX-271 fraction collector, a 171 diode array detector, and a prepELSII detector electrospray nebulizer. The columns used for these experiments included a Phenomenex Kinetex C8 5 μm 4.6 × 250 mm analytical column and Phenomenex Kinetex C8 5 μm 21.2 × 250 mm preparative column. The flow rate was set to 1 or 21 mL/min, respectively, using a linear gradient of H
 <sub>2</sub>O mixed with an increasing proportion of CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN. Both solvents were of HPLC grade, modified with 0.1% formic acid.
