<p>The crude extract and pure compounds isolated were tested against human pathogenic microorganisms, including the bacterium 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 29213), MRSA (ATCC 33591), 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10213) and 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic> (SNB-TR1) to screen their antibacterial and antifungal activities. All ATCC strains were purchased from the Pasteur Institute. The clinical isolate was provided by Prof. Philippe Loiseau, Université Paris Sud. The ITS sequence was deposited in the NCBI GenBank database under the registry number KC692746 corresponding to SNB-TR1 strain. The tests were conducted in accordance to the reference protocols from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [

Vancomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) and oxacillin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) were used as positive controls for bacteria. Fluconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) and itraconazole (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) were used as positive controls for fungi. All assays were conducted in duplicate.
