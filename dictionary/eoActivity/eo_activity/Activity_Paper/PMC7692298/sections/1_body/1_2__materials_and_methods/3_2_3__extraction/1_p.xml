<p>The 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> powder (1.60 kg) was extracted utilizing 8 L of 70% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) aqueous methanol. The plant extracts were filtered onto a single layer of filter paper (No. 2; Toyo Roshi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Plant residues were extracted again for one day with the equivalent amount of methanol (100%) and filtered. Both filtrates were mixed and evaporated until dry using a rotary evaporator at 40 Â°C.
