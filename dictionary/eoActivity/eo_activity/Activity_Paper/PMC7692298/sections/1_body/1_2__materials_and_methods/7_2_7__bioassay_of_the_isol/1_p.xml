<p>The extracted compounds were diluted in methanol to make final bioassay concentrations: 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mM of substance 1 and 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 mM of substance 2 were applied to filter paper (No. 2, 28 mm; Toyo Roshi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) in Petri dishes (28 mm) and kept in a draft chamber to desiccate the solvent. The growth inhibitory activity of the isolated compounds, as previously described, were calculated using cress and Italian ryegrass. The I
 <sub>50</sub> values for these compounds against the tested plant species were determined as mentioned above.
