<p>The I
 <sub>50</sub> values show that the inhibitory activity of vanillic acid against the growth of cress and Italian ryegrass was stronger than that of gallic acid. The disparity in phytotoxic activity might be due to the difference between their chemical structures as the phytotoxic activity of allelopathic compounds is determined based on their structural variations [

 <xref rid="B91-foods-09-01591" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Vanillic acid and gallic acid (a derivative of benzoic acid) contain a benzene ring. In vanillic acid, an OH group, an OCH
 <sub>3</sub> group, and a COOH group are found on the benzene ring, and gallic acid has three OH groups and one COOH group but no OCH
 <sub>3</sub> group. Research on the relationships between structure and activity showed that the number and location of OH and OCH
 <sub>3</sub> groups determine the phytotoxic effects of benzoic acid [
 <xref rid="B92-foods-09-01591" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In addition, hydroxy and methoxy substituents in the benzene ring have been reported to either decrease or increase the phytotoxic effects of benzoic acid [
 <xref rid="B93-foods-09-01591" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. However, a compound to drug should have amphipathic characteristics, including aqueous solubility and sufficient lipid solubility. Vanillic acid and gallic acid both have excellent aqueous solubility due to their COOH group. However, the methoxy group in vanillic acid increases more lipid solubility than that of the hydroxyl group present in gallic acid, which may be the reason that vanillic acid shows stronger inhibitory effects compared to the gallic acid.
