<p>The biological activity of vanillic acid and gallic acid were tested against cress and Italian ryegrass. The obtained results of the assay exhibited that the growth of the cress and Italian ryegrass seedlings was significantly impaired by both compounds (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01591-f006">Figure 6</xref>). The level of inhibition by the isolated compounds increased with increasing concentration, suggesting that the inhibition was dose dependent. Vanillic acid and gallic acid significantly restricted the growth of the cress seedlings at concentrations of 0.03 and 3 mM, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01591-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Vanillic acid had the highest inhibition (12% of control) against the growth of the cress shoots and roots at a concentration of 1 mM, whereas gallic acid exhibited maximum suppression of the growth of the cress shoots and roots at 12.8 and 7.8% of control growth, respectively, at a concentration of 30 mM (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01591-f006">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, vanillic acid and gallic acid significantly arrested the seedling growth of Italian ryegrass at concentrations of 0.1 and 3 mM, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01591-f006">Figure 6</xref>). At 1 mM, vanillic acid showed maximum inhibition against the growth of the Italian ryegrass shoots and roots at 39.4 and 38.9% of control, respectively, while gallic acid displayed maximum suppression against the growth of the shoots and roots at 16.9 and 2.8%, respectively, compared with control growth at a concentration of 30 mM.
