<p>In the partitioning purification step, the H
 <sub>2</sub>O and EtOAc fraction of the 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> extracts displayed concentration-dependent growth inhibitory effects against the growth of cress seedlings, but a higher inhibitory effect was found in the EtOAc fraction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01591-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, the EtOAc fraction was again purified using various chromatographic proceedings (column of silica gel, Sephadex LH-20 column, and reverse-phase C
 <sub>18</sub> cartridges), and for each purification proceeding, the inhibitory activity was measured using a cress bioassay. Using the reverse-phase of HPLC in the bottommost purification step, two phytotoxic compounds were isolated. The phytotoxic substances were identified based on NMR and spectral analysis of the data and by comparison with the previously recorded data.
