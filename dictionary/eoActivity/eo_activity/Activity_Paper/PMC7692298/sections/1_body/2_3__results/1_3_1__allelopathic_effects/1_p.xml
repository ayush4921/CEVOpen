<p>The aqueous methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> suppressed the seedling growth of the tested plants (lettuce, cress, rapeseed, alfalfa, barnyard grass, Italian ryegrass, timothy, and foxtail fescue) at various concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01591-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The growth seedlings of all the tested plants (other than barnyard grass) were completely arrested (100%) in the concentration of 300 mg DW equivalent extract of 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic>/mL. When the tested plants were exposed to the concentration of 100 mg DW equivalent extract of 
 <italic>W. chinensis</italic>/mL, the lettuce seedlings were completely inhibited and the shoot and root growth of alfalfa, rapeseed, cress, barnyard grass, Italian ryegrass, timothy, and foxtail fescue were restricted to 9, 2.9, 6, 10.6, 12.1, 14.3, 7.4, and 0.2% growth compared with the control shoots and 8.7, 1.3, 4.1, 4.4, 0.1, 5.7, and 5.6% growth compared with the control roots, respectively. The growth inhibition of the tested plants was different at other concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01591-f002">Figure 2</xref>). These findings indicated that the 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> extracts suppressed the seedling growth of both the dicots and monocots species, and the inhibition of growth increased when the concentration of the extracts increased. The I

 <xref rid="foods-09-01591-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The lettuce seedling was the most susceptible to the extracts based on I
 <sub>50</sub> values, and the least sensitive was the barnyard grass shoots and alfalfa roots. These findings suggest that the growth inhibition by the 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> extract varied among the tested plants. The concentration-dependent and species-specific inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> extracts indicate that this plant might contain an allelopathic potential and might therefore possess allelochemicals.
