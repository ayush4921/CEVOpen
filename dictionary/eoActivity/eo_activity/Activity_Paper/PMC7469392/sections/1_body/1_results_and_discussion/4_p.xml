<p>The

 <sub>app</sub> value of quercetin was higher than that of kaempferol. The only difference between these two compounds is the presence of a hydroxyl group at position C-3′ (

 </xref>) in quercetin. This hydroxyl group is replaced by a methoxy group in isorhamnetin derivatives. When the 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values for all of the flavonol glycosides with two sugars were compared, it was found that quercetin glycoside 
 <bold>8</bold> showed higher monolayer permeability than the isorhamnetin (
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5)</bold> and kaempferol glycosides (
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold>). The lowest 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values among these glycosides with two sugars were attributed to the kaempferol glycosides 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold>, suggesting that the hydroxyl functionality at position 3′ may affect intestinal permeability, possibly by facilitating transporter recognition and binding.
