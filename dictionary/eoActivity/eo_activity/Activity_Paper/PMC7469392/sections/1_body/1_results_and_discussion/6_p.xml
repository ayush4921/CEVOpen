 <sub>app</sub> value of 15.7 (±1.16) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s, a twofold decrease in permeability compared to the four sugar bearing 
 <bold>11</bold>. As seen previously for the flavonoids, a higher degree of glycosylation also favors monolayer permeability of the saponins. Gypenosides LVI (
 <bold>11</bold>) and XLVI (
 <bold>10</bold>) are both glycosylated at two sites on the molecule and bear a total of four and three sugar units, respectively, and exhibit higher
