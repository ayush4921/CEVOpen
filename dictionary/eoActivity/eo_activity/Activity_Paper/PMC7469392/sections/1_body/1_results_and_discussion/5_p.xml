<p>A recent study correlated Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability with the likely oral bioavailability in humans. They characterized

 <sub>app</sub> values of &lt;(1–2) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s as low permeability corresponding to 0–20% human fraction absorbed (Fa),

 <sub>app</sub> values of 2–10 × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s as moderate permeability corresponding to 20–80% Fa and

 <sub>app</sub> &gt; 10 × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s as high permeability indicating 80–100% Fa.

 </sup> With these values as a guide, compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>5</bold>, and 
 <bold>7</bold> with the aglycones kaempferol and quercetin can be said to show low to moderate membrane permeability across Caco-2 monolayers, whereas compounds 
 <bold>8</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> exhibited high Caco-2 cell permeability, making them strong candidates for human oral bioavailability. Previous studies on the intestinal membrane permeability of quercetin and kaempferol confirmed that both aglycones cross Caco-2 monolayers via passive diffusion.

 </sup> It has also been reported that glycosylation generally leads to a decrease in Caco-2 monolayer permeability unless significant active transport occurs.

 </sup> Caco-2 cells are known to express active transporters, including sugar transporters, such as SGLT1, GLUT2, and GLUT5.

 </sup> A study by Liu et al. also reported that a sugar transporter, SGLT1, is responsible for the transport of glycosides in Caco-2 cells.

 </sup> Analyzing our permeability assay data with the literature reports in mind, it can be interpreted that the glycosylated flavonoids assessed here may be actively transported, possibly by sugar transporters across Caco-2 monolayers.
