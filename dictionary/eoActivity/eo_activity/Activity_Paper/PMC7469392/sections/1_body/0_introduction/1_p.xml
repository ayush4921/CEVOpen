<p>The plant kingdom has been sustenance, medicine, fuel, and shelter for humankind since our first appearance on this planet. Our reliance on plants for medicinal purposes is recorded in our most ancient civilizations.

 </sup> The use of plants or plant-derived substances as drugs is a common feature of all civilizations, and it continues to be a critical source of healthcare for much of the world’s population. The past two decades have seen the herbal medicine industry grow from a modest to a global industry. The global herbal medicine market was estimated to be worth US$83 billion in 2008

 </sup> In many parts of Africa and Asia, particularly in China, over 80% of the population relies heavily on traditional medicine for primary healthcare.

 </sup> Approximately, 20–70% of the population from Australia and Europe use some form of traditional medicine in personal healthcare.

 </sup> The scientific community has always shown significant interest in the chemistry and bioactivity of the compounds isolated from medicinal herbs or extracts. Hence, bioactivity-guided isolation of natural products is still one of the major pathways for the discovery of drugs or lead molecules. While activity-guided isolation of natural products is an excellent strategy, a somewhat underexploited property of potentially active compounds is the evaluation of the oral bioavailability of compounds in a complex herbal extract. In this study, we address this issue by investigating the potential bioavailability of the flavonoids and saponins isolated from a Chinese medicinal herb, 
 <italic>Gynostemma pentaphyllum</italic> (Thunb.) Makino, using the Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability model to provide some direction as to which of the many compounds present in this complex herb might be responsible for its undoubted pharmacological activity.
