 </sup> Most of these bioactivities exhibited by 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> are thought to be due to the presence of two groups of bioactive compounds, saponins and flavonoids. Reports suggest that approximately 165 saponins are present in 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic>.

 </sup> The major saponins present in 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> belong to the dammarane class of saponins (known as gypenosides, if isolated from 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic>). Dammarane saponins are characterized by a dammarane aglycone with an acyclic side chain (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>). Dammarane aglycones are tetracyclic triterpenoid sapogenins in which C-1, C-2, C-3, C-12, and C-20 positions are either hydroxylated or glycosylated and the C-17 position can possess a variety of modified side chains. A variety of flavonoids have also been isolated from 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> with the free aglycone forms (quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin) being reported;

 </sup> however, the most prominent flavonoids present in 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> are found as quercetin and kaempferol glycosides (
