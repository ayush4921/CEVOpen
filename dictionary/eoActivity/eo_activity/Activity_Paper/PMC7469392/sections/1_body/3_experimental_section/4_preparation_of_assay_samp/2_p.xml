<p>To produce the calibration curves, stock solutions of all of the compounds (1000 ppm) were made in the HBSS/HEPES buffer. The stock solutions were serially diluted to achieve concentrations of 500, 250, 125, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 10, 5, 2.5, and 1 ppm. The solutions were analyzed by LCMS, and the calibration curves were assembled using Microsoft Excel 2016.</p>
