<p>The apical and basolateral compartments of the wells were prepared by removing all media, washing twice with PBS and twice with warmed HBSS/HEPES buffer, gently aspirating to remove all possible liquid, loading fresh buffer, and incubating the plates for 30 min. The buffer was removed and the wells gently aspirated to remove all possible liquid. Fresh buffer was loaded into the basal sides (600 μL) and the compounds and the standards were loaded into quadruplicate apical wells (100 μL). Then, the plates were placed into a shaking incubator (37 °C, 55 rpm). The samples were taken from the basal side (200 μL) and replaced with buffer every 30 min for 150 min. At 150 min, the apical side was also collected. The samples were stored at −80 °C for further LCMS analysis.</p>
