 <italic>C</italic>/d
 <italic>T</italic> is the steady-state linear rate of change of concentration in the receiver chamber (basal) (μg/sec). The rate of drug transport was calculated by linear regression analysis using Microsoft Excel 2016 software (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). All data were presented as mean ± SD in cm/s × 10
