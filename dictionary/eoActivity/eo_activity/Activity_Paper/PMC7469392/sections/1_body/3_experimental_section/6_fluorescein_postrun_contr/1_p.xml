<p>Transwells were prepared by removing all media and washing twice with PBS buffer and twice with prewarmed HBSS/HEPES buffer. Fluorescein (100 μL) was loaded into each apical well used for compounds. The plates were placed in the shaking incubator (37 °C, 55 rpm). The samples were taken from the basal side (200 μL) and replaced with buffer every 20 min for 60 min. The samples were stored at −80 °C for further analysis. The fluorescein postrun control assay was not conducted on the propranolol or fluorescein wells.</p>
