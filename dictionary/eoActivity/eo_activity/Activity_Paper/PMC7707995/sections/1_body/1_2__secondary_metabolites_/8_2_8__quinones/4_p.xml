<p>Studies with terpenoids, lignans, and quinones are more limited in the literature; however they exhibit greater depth of studies aimed at treating ALS. Unlike studies with tannins, these three metabolites, despite the few studies found, have advanced to 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, presenting significant results in different pathways. Few studies have reported the isolation of the main compound and do not report the extraction methodology transparently. Finally, despite having been carried out 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, the studies have not yet been reported or evaluated in clinical tests. It may be related to difficulties in isolation, since the extractive methods were not well understood in the study.
