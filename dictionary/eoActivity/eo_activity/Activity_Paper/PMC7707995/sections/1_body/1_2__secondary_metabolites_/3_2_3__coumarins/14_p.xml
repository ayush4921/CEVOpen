<p>Most coumarins from natural products could potentially be tested for antioxidant activity, reduction of DPPH, inhibition of induced peroxidation, reduction of glutathione-induced death, and induction of neuroprotection. In general, there is an improvement in dealing with neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, through the use of isolated coumarins or plant extracts containing them. The results were promising when performed in silico, in vitro, and experimentally in vivo, revealing its antioxidant effect, prolongation of the programmed death of neural cells, and neuroprotection, beyond the reduction of free radicals.</p>
