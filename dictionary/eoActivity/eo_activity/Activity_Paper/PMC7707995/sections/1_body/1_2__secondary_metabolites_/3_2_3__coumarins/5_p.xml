<p>Li and Seeram identified the presence of seven lignans, as well as two coumarins isolated from the butanol extract of the maple syrup (MS-BuOH), being identified as scopoletin and fraxetin (32) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These coumarins were evaluated for their antioxidant activity and obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 68.2 ± 31.2 and 46.5 ± 3.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Therefore, these compounds better result in comparison to the seven isolated lignans (values ranging between 101.5 ± 5.9 and 1335.9 ± 47.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and stilbenes contained in sugar fraction of maple syrup (&gt;2600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Moreover, fraxetin also showed a better result when compared to vitamin C (IC
