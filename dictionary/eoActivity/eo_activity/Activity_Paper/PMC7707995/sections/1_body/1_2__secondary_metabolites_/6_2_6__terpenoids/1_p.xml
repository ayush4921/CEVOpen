<p>Terpenoids are terpenic compounds that have undergone oxidation. Many studies have been reported with the use of terpenoids in the treatment of diseases [

 <italic>Tripterygium wilfordii</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Celastraceae.</italic> In this study, the neuroprotective effects were examined in the G93A SOD1 transgenic mice model for ALS. Studies have shown that the treatment with celastrol significantly improved motor function, delaying ALS symptoms, and also causing a decrease in mice's weight. Another relevant result was the increase in survival of the G93A mice treated with celastrol, registering 9.4% and 13% at the dosages of 2 mg/kg/day and 8 mg/kg/day, respectively. Moreover, an increase of 30% of the neuronal concentration in the lumbar spine suggests a protective effect. Histological analysis revealed a reduction in TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, iNOS, CD40, and GFAP immunoreactivity. Thus, celastrol can be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of ALS [
