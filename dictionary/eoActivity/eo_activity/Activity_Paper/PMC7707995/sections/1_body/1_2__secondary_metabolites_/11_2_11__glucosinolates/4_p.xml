<p>In another study, Galuppo et al. [
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>] evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of GMG-ITC against ALS 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> using SOD1tg mice, which physiologically develop SOD1G93A at around 16 weeks of age and can be considered a genetic model of the disease. The rats were treated once a day with GMG (10 mg/kg) bioactivated with myrosinase (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L/rat) by intraperitoneal injection for two weeks before the onset of the disease, and the treatment was prolonged for another two weeks before sacrifice. The results showed statistically significant differences between mice treated and untreated with GMG-IT (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.003), demonstrating that the administration of GMG-IT was able to delay the onset of the disease for approximately two weeks, probably due to its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic effects, suggesting that this compound could be a potential drug for the treatment of this disease.
