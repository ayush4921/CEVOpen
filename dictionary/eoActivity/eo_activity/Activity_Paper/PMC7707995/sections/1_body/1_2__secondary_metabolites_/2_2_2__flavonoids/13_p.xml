<p>As mentioned in the literature, glutamate toxicity is a major contributor to the appearance of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Alzheimer's disease. Hence, Elmann and collaborators [

 <sup>2+</sup> cells of neuroblastoma of mice intoxicated with glutamate. The results show that the compounds protected astrocytes from cell death induced by oxidative stress and inhibited microglia activation, demonstrating its significant protective effect. In this sense, we highlight the importance of flavonoids as a therapeutic potential tool against the decrease in the time of onset of symptoms and the increased survival of patients with ALS, whether by antioxidant, neuroanti-inflammatory, and antiprotein aggregation mechanisms.
