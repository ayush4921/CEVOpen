<p>In the study conducted by Adewale and colleagues with the leaves of 
 <italic>Solanum macrocarpon</italic>, a plant typical of India, had its antioxidant activity verified in the protection of the tissues of rats, especially the liver and brain, against iron-induced lipids (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>). Aqueous extracts showed levels of flavonoids and phenolic compounds (with the presence of tannins). The results demonstrated that the aqueous extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>S. macrocarpon</italic> showed high inhibition of lipid peroxidation induced by iron sulfate II with an inhibition value of 92.91 ± 1.56% at a concentration of 3.33 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, showing to be more effective than the quercetin control (concentration of 90.15 ± 1.35 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Thus, the aqueous extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>S. macrocarpon</italic> presented with a strong antioxidant agent, offering protection against oxidative damage of liver and brain tissues, which places it as a potential for future analyses in the treatment of ALS and neurodegenerative diseases [
