<p>The studies presented above with extracts containing tannins in the treatment of ALS demonstrate the lack of in-depth studies, considering that they do not perform in vivo experiments, therefore limited to in vitro studies, and, consequently, there are no subsequent preclinical tests and specific clinical trials for ALS. Possibly this continuity of the experiments is linked to the isolation and quantification of the compounds, considering that the majority of the studies did not present gas chromatography techniques.</p>
