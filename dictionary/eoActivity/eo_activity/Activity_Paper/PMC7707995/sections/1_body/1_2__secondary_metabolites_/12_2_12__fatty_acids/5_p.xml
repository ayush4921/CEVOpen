<p>Trostchansky and collaborators also evaluated the response of transgenic SOD1G93A mice with ALS after the treatment with 16â€‰mg/kg/day of nitro-oleic electrophilic acid (NO
 <sub>2</sub>-OA) subcutaneously. It was observed that NO
 <sub>2</sub>-OA significantly improved the grip strength and performance on rotarod (also called rotating bar that assesses motor coordination and balance) compared to animals treated with vehicle or oleic acid (AO), suggesting NO
 <sub>2</sub>-OA as a promising therapeutic compound [
