<p>Mei et al. isolated 12 lignans from the fruit of the 
 <italic>Broussonetia papyrifera</italic> plant, among which 9 were unpublished. The ethanolic extracts of each lignan were evaluated for its antioxidant activities via MTT and DPPH in PC12 neuronal cells induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and also for the capability of eliminating DPPH radicals. The results showed that all ethanolic extracts were efficient in antioxidant activities, reducing the action of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the CP12 cell line. Compounds 44, 45, 46, 47, and 48 (

 <sub>50</sub> values of 236.8

 <italic>μ</italic>M, 273.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, 281.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, and 60.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively, with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations ranging from 0.16 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Lignan 48 showed the best antioxidant activity. Subsequent studies may apply these lignans for pharmacotherapeutic treatments of ALS and additional neurodegenerative diseases [
