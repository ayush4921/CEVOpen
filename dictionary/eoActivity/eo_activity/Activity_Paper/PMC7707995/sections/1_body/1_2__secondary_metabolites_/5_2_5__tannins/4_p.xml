<p>The antioxidant activity of polyphenols is mainly linked to its redox properties and hydrogen donation [

 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Aware of these properties, Mahesh and collaborators carried out studies to evaluate the antioxidant effect and of a plant native to India, 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> (
 <italic>combretaceae</italic>), traditionally used to treat various diseases in Asia. The elimination of superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and nitric oxide radicals with the aqueous extract of the fruit peel of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> was evaluated showing significant results with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.031 mg/mL, 0.097 mg/mL and 0.744 mg/mL, respectively. Thus, although the tannin fraction has not been isolated, the author attributes a greater contribution to the antioxidant properties. It also highlights the importance of studying 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> for possible applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [
