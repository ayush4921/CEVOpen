<p>There are reports in the literature suggesting that the mutation in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) at position 85 of glycine and arginine is a fundamental cause for the onset of ALS. Taking advantage of the antioxidant activity of the flavonoids kaempferida (19) and kaempferol (20) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the study performed by Srinivasan and Rajasekaranb evaluated through molecular docking their aggregation affinity towards SOD1. Kaempferol portrayed stronger hydrophobic interactions with the target in comparison to kaempferida, thus qualifying it as a possible prototype for the design of new drugs for the treatment of ALS [
