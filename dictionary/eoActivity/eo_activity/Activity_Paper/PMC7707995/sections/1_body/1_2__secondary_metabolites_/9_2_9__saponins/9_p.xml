<p>Astragaloside IV (AST-IV) (54) is a small saponin and the main active component in 
 <italic>Astragalus membranaceus</italic>, holding anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiaging, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective effects. The neuroprotective effect of this compound was observed in neural microglia cells, in which the presence of AST-IV in the concentration of 1 to 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/L protected the microglia from death caused by LPS and negatively regulated the release of proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor 
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), and nitric oxide, as well as the expression of Toll-like 4 receptors (TLR4), MyD88, and nuclear factor 
 <italic>κ</italic>B (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B) of these cells. These results indicate that AST-IV exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on microglia, possibly by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathways and protects neurons from microglia-mediated cell death by converting the inflammatory M1 microglia into a M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype, indicating the potential of this compound for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [
