<p>Another 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study was carried out by Hamamcioglu and collaborators, in which the evaluation of the potential of the neuroprotective effect in PC12 (dPC12) cells, as well as the antimutagenic and antigenotoxic effects of the species of the plant 
 <italic>Glaucium acutidentatum</italic> of the 
 <italic>papaveraceae</italic> family was carried out. The methanolic extract, at a concentration of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, showed better results for cell damage, caused by H

 <sub>2</sub>, with values between 80 and 90% of neuroprotection, in comparison to the aqueous extract that presented a rate between 65 and 75%. It was also observed that the aqueous extract presented no cytotoxicity (90 to 96%), while the methanolic extract presented moderate cytotoxicity (67 to 75%) at any concentration. Another important data demonstrated in the same study is concerning the neuritis index, which is strongly linked to the neuroprotective effect. The higher the value, the better the neuroprotective result [

 <sub>2</sub>, neuritis concentration dropped to 50.7 ± 0.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, while the control untreated cells presented a value of 80.3 ± 0.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and the extracts (methanolic and aqueous), in a concentration of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, exhibited values of 78.8 ± 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 78.2 ± 0.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively. Furthermore, the extracts showed antimutagenic activity (75.0 and 74.8% inhibition) and antigenotoxic activity. This is a pioneering study for antigenotoxic activity. The results demonstrate strong candidates for the treatment of multiple degenerative diseases, including ALS [
