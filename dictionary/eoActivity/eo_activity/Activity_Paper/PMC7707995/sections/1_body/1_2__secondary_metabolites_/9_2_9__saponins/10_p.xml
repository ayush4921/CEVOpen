<p>The evidence of possible beneficial effects during 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, shown in the studies above, is a starting point for the achievement of new therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of ALS. However, it is important to note that such studies demonstrate a lack of methodological standardization of the samples used, ranging from commercially obtained saponins [

 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>] to plant extracts [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The lack of standardization of the samples can influence the reproducibility of the results obtained in these initial tests.
