 <sup>+</sup> level alteration as compared to that of F10 mg/kg treated rats. The HME, especially at 200 mg/kg, was able to elicit saliuretic index as closer to F10 mg/kg treated rats. This could be related to the presence of higher K
 <sup>+</sup> content in the plant extract and might have advantageous during hypokalemic conditions [
