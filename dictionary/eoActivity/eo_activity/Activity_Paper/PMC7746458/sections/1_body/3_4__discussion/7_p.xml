<p>Loop diuretics enhance urinary outflow and excretion of Na
 <sup>+</sup>, K
 <sup>+</sup>, and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. When loop diuretics inhibit Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup>/2Cl
 <sup>−</sup> cotransporter at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, it leads to increased Na
 <sup>+</sup> load to the distal convoluted tubule, which indirectly causes urine acidification [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Hence, the HME caused significant urine K
 <sup>+</sup> and Cl
 <sup>−</sup> excretion (at 200 mg/kg), satisfactory natriuresis index (at 400 mg/kg), and significant acidic urine at all test doses. Therefore, it can be suggested that HME of the plant might have loop diuretic like the mechanism of action.
