<p>The rats treated with three test doses of HME, EAF, and CF, especially at maximum test doses, showed a significant increment of urine output, starting from the 6th hr and continued till the 24th hr compared to the normal control. However, among the fractions, AF failed to reveal a significant increment of urine output. This could be attributed due to the existence of higher concentration of the diuretic active ingredient(s) in the HME and variation in type, quality, and quantity of active constituent(s) presented in these fractions [
