<p>Collectively, the diuretic activity of the HME and its EAF was found to be highly potent when compared to the CF and AF. This indicates that the pharmacologically active ingredient(s) of the root bark of 
 <italic>C. myricoides</italic> might have better solubility nature in the 80% methanol and better fractionated by ethyl acetate than other solvents used. Moreover, the results indicated that the diuretic activity of the HME is found to be higher than all fractions and comparable with a single oral dose (10â€‰mg/kg) of furosemide. This might be due to the fact that the crude extract (HME) contains more pharmacologically active ingredient(s) and might act synergistically [
