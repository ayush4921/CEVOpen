<p>The screening of diuretic activity was performed using the model described by Lipschitz [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Kau [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The overnight fasted rats for food but not for water were hydrated using a single oral dose of normal saline 25 mL/kg [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. At the beginning of the treatment, the fasted but hydrated rat's urinary bladder was emptied by gently compressing at the pelvic area and using the pulldown of their tails [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Then, the rats were administered the test doses as described in the section of grouping and dosing. Immediately after administration, the rats were placed individually in the metabolic cage. The excreted urine volume was collected and measured at the end of 1st hr, 2nd hr, 4th hr, 6th hr, and at the last 24th hr intervals after dosing [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Urine pH was measured from a fresh urine sample of each rat using a digital pH meter [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The collected urine was stored in a refrigerator (−80°C) for further urine analysis.
