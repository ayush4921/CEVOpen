<p>Unlike the HME, all the test doses of AF failed to show a significant increment of urine output (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The EAF exhibited increment of urine output at 400 mg/kg starting from the 6th hr compared to the normal control group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). It also (400 mg/kg) displayed a noticeable and continuous increment of urine output until the 24th hr compared to the normal control group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In this fraction, both the 200 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg also caused a significant increment of urine output compared to the normal control at the last 24th hr. The CF of the HME produced a significant increment of urine output in a dose-dependent manner compared to the normal control group at the 24th hr.
