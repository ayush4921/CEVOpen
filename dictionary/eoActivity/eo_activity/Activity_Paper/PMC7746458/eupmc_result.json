    "<h4>Introduction</h4><i>Clerodendrum myricoides</i> (Lamiaceae) has been traditionally used for the treatment of various ailments, including body swelling and urine retention. The present study aimed to evaluate the diuretic activity of a crude extract and solvent fractions of the root bark of <i>C. myricoides</i>. <i>Methodology</i>. The coarsely powdered root bark of <i>C. myricoides</i> was extracted by a cold maceration method using 80% methanol. A portion of the extract was fractionated based on the polarity index of solvents to obtain chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions. To investigate the diuretic activity of the plant, rats were divided into fifteen groups. The normal control groups received either water or 2% tween 80, the standard group received furosemide (10 mg/kg), and the test groups were administered the hydromethanolic extract and solvent fractions at the doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg by the oral route. The urine volume, urine pH, urine, and serum electrolytes were determined and compared with the standard and normal control groups.<h4>Results</h4>The crude hydromethanolic extract, ethyl acetate, and chloroform fractions induced significant diuresis at a dose of 400 mg/kg (<i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to the aqueous fraction. The hydromethanolic extract at 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg also caused noticeable diuresis (<i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to the standard, furosemide. Rats treated with hydromethanolic extract, ethyl acetate, and chloroform fractions showed delayed onset and prolonged diuresis in a dose-dependent fashion compared to the aqueous fraction (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The hydromethanolic extract and solvent fractions produced the highest saliuretic and natriuretic index compared to the standard, furosemide. The crude hydromethanolic extract also failed to produce any sign of toxicity up to 2000 mg/kg.<h4>Conclusion</h4>From this study, the hydromethanolic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of the root bark of <i>C. myricoides</i> produced a prominent diuretic effect in rats."
