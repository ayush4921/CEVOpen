<p>Available literature data on TPC and TFC in 
 <italic>Allium ursinum</italic> are very diverse and heterogeneous which is mainly caused by different procedures for extract preparation and chemical analysis. In previous study (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gitin et al., 2012</xref>) reported TPC values of 27.9 g GAE/100 g (dry basis) in leaf extract obtained by 12-day maceration with 70% ethanol, while 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Djurdjevic et al. (2004)</xref> determined 3.24 mg/g of total free phenolics in dry leaves extracted with 80% (v/v) boiling aqueous methanol, followed by boiling ethyl acetate. TFC content of fresh leaves was also strongly dependent on extraction method. According to 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gitin et al. (2012)</xref> flavonoid content determined using ultrasound assisted extraction was 7.3 mg Quercetin/kg fresh leaves compared to 2.7 mg QE/kg using conventional maceration. In another recent study (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Pavlović et al., 2017</xref>), the authors applied five different extraction techniques followed by determination of TPC and TFC in dried extracts of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> leaves. According to obtained data TPC varied from 24.32 to 43.97 mg of GAE/g of extract and values for TFC were from 7.46 to 38.56 mg of Rutin/g of extract. Several previous studies (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 1981</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Carotenuto et al., 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2009</xref>) have shown that main polyphenols present in ramsons leaves are most certainly flavonoids, among them kaempferol derivatives were found to be predominant (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Oszmiański et al., 2013</xref>). To the best of our knowledge not a single one of mentioned studies have not considered the bioaccessibility of ramsons polyphenol compounds. In current study total phenolic and flavonoid content have been examined in bioaccessible fraction obtained after 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion of fresh ramsons leaves in presence of complex food matrix. The aim of this experimental design was to mimic feeding conditions as closely as possible. Obtained results showed that the concentrations of total polyphenols and total flavonoids in bioaccessible fraction were far lower than those detected in fresh and dry leaves as well as their concentrated extracts. Determined content of TPC after the digestion in presence of food matrix was only 235–264 μg GA/mL, from which 110 μg GA/mL was present in bioacessible fraction of food matrix digested without 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic>. Similar results were obtained for TFC 40.4–55.4 μg QE/mL in samples containing 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> and 22.7 μg QE/mL, in food matrix alone. Observed low yields were expected due to mild extraction conditions in aqueous medium of the mimicked digestive tract compared to organic solvent extraction applied in previous studies. However, it was not the only limiting factor. Various types of interactions between food constituents (proteins, carbohydrates, lipids or fibers) and polyphenols affecting their bioaccessibility have been documented previously (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Stanisavljević et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Pešić et al., 2019</xref>). When compared TPC and TFC values before (SN1t
 <sub>0</sub>–SN3t
 <sub>0</sub>) and after the digestion (SN1t
 <sub>0</sub>–SN3t
 <sub>0</sub>) a mild increase after completed digestion was observed in majority of samples containing 
 <italic>A. ursinum.</italic> Similarly, in samples containing solely food matrix (SNM) increased TPC and TFC values have also been recorded upon digestion. Thus, it is not clear which portion of that increment might be attributed to release of phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> during the digestion. Results obtained for TPC should be interpreted with the great caution especially in samples containing complex food matrices in aqueous media. It has been determined previously that Folin-Ciocalteu’s reagent is also showing reactivity toward reducing sugars, ascorbate, certain organic and fatty acids, aromatic amines and peptides which could be released during the digestion of food constituents (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Prior et al., 2005</xref>). Total flavonoid content of food matrix was noticeably high, although approximately three times lower than in samples containing ramsons. This might be explained by the shortcomings of aluminum chloride based assay, which is dependent on the type of flavonoid present in the sample and are specific only for a limited number of flavonoids while it can react with phenolic acids giving non-specific absorbance at 510 nm (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Pêkal and Pyrzynska, 2014</xref>). It has been shown previously that food matrix used in our study contains significant amount of phenolic acids and several flavonoids (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Pešić et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies showed that composition of food matrix and the effect of co-digestion of polyphenols may affect their antioxidant activity as well. As it can be observed from 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, radical scavenging activity measured by DPPH assay showed strong positive correlation with TPC (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.93) and TFC (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.94), while correlation of these parameters with ferrous ion chelating capacity (FCC) was far lower, 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.73 with TPC and 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.68 with TFC. DPPH scavenging activity was significantly elevated after the digestion in case of two samples SN1 an SN2 while remained unchanged for samples SN3 and SNM. Values of FCC were also increased upon completed digestion in all studied samples with the most prominent increment in food matrix digested alone (SNM). Considering these results, it can be concluded that bioaccessible constituents of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> did not substantially contribute to FCC, which in majority originates from food matrix and components of the digestive fluids. It can also be observed that the increase in FCC after digestion was higher in the food matrix alone than in combination with ramsons, indicating that some ramsons components interfere with the nutrient matrix components, resulting in a moderate increase in FCC. This situation has already been documented in the case of the combined digestion of polyphenols from grapes and the same type of nutrient matrix (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Pešić et al., 2019</xref>). Taken altogether the quantities of TPC and TFC in bioaccessible fraction of ramson, digested in presence of food matrix were moderate, compared to one recorded previously in dry or fresh leaves and their extracts. This was expected, having in mind mild extraction conditions of simulated digestive tract and interactions of phenolic compounds with food constituents. Nevertheless, determined values of TPC and TFC were approximately two times higher in samples containing ramson than in food matrix digested alone. Results of DPPH assay were positively and strongly correlated with TPC and TFC, while the contribution of phenolic compounds to FCC was less pronounced.
