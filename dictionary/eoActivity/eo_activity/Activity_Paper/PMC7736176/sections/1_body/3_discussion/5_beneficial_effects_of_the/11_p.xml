<p>Finally, the immunomodulatory effects of the strains 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227, as well as 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extract, were evaluated. Both strains 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 significantly stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 0.001 respectively), as well as the production of immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The obtained results indicate the potential of these probiotics to stimulate the immune system’s response to extracellular pathogens. Cell culture supernatant of 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and UV inactivated bacteria 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR 227 decreased the production of proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 0.001 respectively). Given that UV inactivated strains significantly reduced the production of IFN-γ, the major Th1 cytokine, important for response to intracellular pathogens, the supernatants of cell cultures appear to better choice for use as postbiotics. Possible utilization of 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 cell culture supernatant as postbiotic could be a good strategy to stimulate the response to pathogens, without reducing the ability of the immune system to respond to a concomitant viral infection. Plant extract treatment and treatment with food matrix did not exert effects on cytokine production.
