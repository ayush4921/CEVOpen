<p>The safety status of probiotic strains implies the absence of the virulence factors (e.g., hemolytic and/or gelatinase activity) and susceptibility to clinically relevant antibiotics (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">European Food Safety Authority, 2012</xref>). The results obtained in this study confirmed that the strains 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 are safe to be used as probiotics since they do not exhibit hemolytic and gelatinase activity and are susceptible to all clinically relevant antibiotics.
