<p>The cytotoxic effects of the undigested and digested 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extracts were investigated on human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa and human colon adenocarcinoma LS174 cell lines (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, United States). The cells were cultured in the complete nutrient medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 
 <sc>L</sc>-glutamine (2 mM), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and penicillin (100 IU/ml), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 25 mM HEPES), as described elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Matić et al., 2013</xref>). HeLa (2,000 cells per well) and LS174 (7,000 cells per well) cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates. The cells were allowed to adhere for 24 h, and afterward, five concentrations of tested extracts were added to the cells ranging from 1.25% to 20% (five serial two-fold dilutions). The nutrient medium was added to the control cells. Cell survival was determined by MTT assay after 72 h treatment, according to the procedure firstly described by 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Mosmann (1983)</xref> and modified by 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ohno and Abe (1991)</xref>. All experiments were done in triplicate. Cisplatin was used as a positive control. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration was defined as the concentration of an extract causing the inhibition of cell survival by 50% compared with a control cell sample.
