<p>Relative 2,2-Diphenyl-1-Picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity measurement was determined according to 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al. (2006)</xref>. The reaction mixture consisted of 100 μL of supernatant diluted with methanol. Five different concentrations (10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 μL) of supernatant and Trolox were used. Then, 100 μL of 200 μM DPPH in methanol was added to each microplate and shaken. Blank contained 200 μL of methanol and control sample was prepared by mixing 100 μL of methanol and 100 μL of DPPH solution. Absorbance was continuously recorded each minute for 1.5 h at 515 nm. The percent of DPPH quenched for each time point was calculated according to the equation:
