<p>HeLa and LS174 cells were exposed to extracts of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> for 24 h (applied concentrations were 5% for HeLa and 20% for LS174 cells). After incubation the cells were collected, washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 70% ethanol on ice, according to a standard protocol (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ohno and Abe, 1991</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Ormerod, 1994</xref>). Cell samples were stored at −20°C for at least one week before staining. The cells were incubated with RNase A in PBS (final concentration 200 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37°C. Next, the propidium iodide, at a concentration of 40 μg/ml, was added to the cells. Cell cycle phase distributions were assessed by FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, United States). CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences) was used for data analyses.
