 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Bioaccessible fractions of undigested ramson SN1t
 <sub>0</sub>-SN3t
 <sub>0</sub> contained 187–221 μg GAE/mL and food matrix alone had lower phenolic content of 92 μg GAE/ml, while digested samples showed significantly higher TPC values of 235–264 μg GAE/ml for ramson samples and 110 μg GAE/ml for food matrix. In case of all studied samples 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion provoked a statistically significant increase in TPC. Total flavonoid content of bioaccessible fraction before the digestion ranged from 35.1 to 46.2 μg QE/ml, while after the digestion, a slight increment was recorded in two ramsons samples SN1 and SN2. Bioaccessible fraction of undigested food matrix contained a significant content of flavonoids 15.8 μg QE/ml which was also increased after the digestion as it can be seen from 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Antioxidant activity of undigested samples, measured by kinetic DPPH scavenging assay, followed the same trend as TFC, ranging from 0.35 to 0.45 μM TE/ml. The digestion provoked a significant elevation of radical scavenging in SN1 and SN2 samples. Food matrix showed twice lower activity for undigested sample and the increment after digestion was not observed. Ferrous ion chelating capacities before digestion ranged from 42.5%, detected in food matrix, up to 71.3% in SN2 sample. Substantial increase of FCC after digestion was recorded in all samples including food matrix.
