<p>In order to determine inter-strain differences among the 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> isolates, 15 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> strains were analyzed by PFGE. The dendrogram produced by SPSS software demonstrated genomic similarity ranging from 75 to 100% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Two clusters with differences up to 25% were observed. Cluster I comprise one pulsotype (14 isolates); while cluster II contains only one pulsotype with one isolate BGSR163. The band pattern revealed the presence of two different 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> PFGE puslotypes (strains) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), hence the strains BGSR163 and BGSR227, belonging to different PFGE pulsotypes, were chosen for cytotoxicity assay, as well as for evaluation of probiotic potential â€“survival through simulated GIT, adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells (IEC), and immunomodulatory activity, as the main criteria for selection of probiotic strains.
