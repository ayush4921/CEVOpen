<p>Investigation of the mechanisms of the cytotoxic activity of the 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extracts by cell cycle analysis revealed that all tested extracts applied at a concentration of 5% induced remarkable increase of HeLa cells in the subG1 phase in comparison with those determined in control, untreated cell sample after treatments that lasted 24, 48, and 72 h. The effects of the extracts on cell cycle phase distribution are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>. The differences between the percentages of HeLa cells at specific phases of the cell cycle exposed to undigested and digested 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> extracts were observed. Undigested extracts 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> after 24 h incubation caused accumulation of HeLa cells within the G2/M cell cycle phase in comparison with control cells. The increase of cells in the S phase was observed in HeLa cells treated for 48 and 72 h with undigested extracts. Among undigested extracts, the extract 1 induced the most intensive accumulation of cells within the S phase, which was accompanied with G2/M phase arrest after 48 h treatment. The treatment with food matrix of HeLa cells did not significantly affect their cell cycle phase distribution (
