<p>The survival of the strains 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR163 and 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> BGSR227 in chemically simulated GIT transit was tested. The results revealed that both strains successfully survived the passage through simulated GIT conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref>). The results showed that the number of viable cells of both 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> strains after 10 min (simulated mouth conditions) was not significantly changed compared to that at the beginning of the experiment. However, 110 min exposure to simulated gastric conditions lowered the number of viable cells of both 
 <italic>L. fermentum</italic> strains for approx.1 log unit (ΔLogBGSR163 = 0.8 and BGSR227 = 1), although the number of viable cells was rather high (8 Log CFU/ml). Interestingly, when the cells were exposed to the simulated small intestine conditions (100 min) with increased bile salts concentrations, the growth of the strains was restored (ΔLogBGSR163 = 0.7 and ΔLogBGSR227 = 0.8). The survival rate of the strain BGSR163 was 98.85%; Δlog CFU/ml = 0.1), while the survival rate of BGSR227 was 97.73%; Δlog CFU/ml = 0.2 (
