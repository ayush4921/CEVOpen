<p>Two-dimensional gas chromatography analysis of 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> bioaccessible fraction obtained after digestion revealed presence of seven volatile compounds which were absent in supernatant of digested food matrix (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A,B</xref>). The dominant compounds in the analyzed spectrum of samples containing 
 <italic>A. ursinum</italic> were allicin decomposition products: 3,4-dimethylthiophene; 1,3-dithiane; diallyl disulfide; allyl methyl disulfide; 2-vinyl-1,3-dithiane; (E)-1-propenyl methyl disulfide; (E)-1-propenyl allyl disulfide (
