<p>The docking studies were executed through the Maestro module (Schrödinger Inc.). Rilpivirine and elvitegravir were taken as the standard inhibitors of HIV-RT (PDB ID: 4I2P). The synthesized compounds were docked against rilpivirine, as it showed high binding affinity and docking score with the protein compared to other pyrimidine-containing NNRTIs. This PDB ID was selected as the resolution of the protein structure was good (2.30 Å) and it was in a complex with a rilpivirine (TMC278)-based analogue. We have redocked the cocrystallized ligand, namely (2E)-3-[4-({6-[(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-7H-purin-2-yl}amino)-3,5-dimethylphenyl]prop-2-enenitrile within the same constraints as where it was crystallized with 4I2P; the docking score and RMSD value were recorded. The docking score was the same as previously calculated (–11.63 Kcal/mol), which showed that the process was precise; the RMSD value was 0.559, indicating the accuracy of the docking process.</p>
