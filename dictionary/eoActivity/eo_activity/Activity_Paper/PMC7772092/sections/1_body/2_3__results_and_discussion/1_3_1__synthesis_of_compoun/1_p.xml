<p>The general chemistry of the synthesis of the starting material, 2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehyde (1), is based on the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction [30,31]. The N-phenylacetamide after formylation and cyclization formed 2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehyde. The Vilsmeier reagent acted as formylating agent (Scheme, Figure 1). Compound (1) and substituted acetophenones were taken as starting material for the synthesis of chalcones from which 2 series of compounds were synthesized.</p>
