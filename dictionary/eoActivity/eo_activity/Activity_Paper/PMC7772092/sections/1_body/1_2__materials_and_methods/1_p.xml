<p>All of the reagents were purchased from commercial sources and were used without any additional purification. Precoated Merck TLC plates were utilized for monitoring the progress of the reaction (Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA). Melting points were measured with a Stuart melting point apparatus (SMP-11) with an open glass capillary tube and are uncorrected (Cole-Parmer Ltd., Stone, UK). Infrared (IR) spectra of compounds were recorded on a Bruker FT-IR spectrophotometer (Bruker BioSpin Corp., Billerica, MA, USA). Mass spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 with EI mode (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan). 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) and 13C NMR (carbon nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra were recorded with the help of a Brucker Avance II (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer using CDCl3 as a solvent (Bruker BioSpin Corp.). TMS (tetramethylsilane) was used as an internal reference standard (Î´ = 0). IR, NMR and mass spectra of the synthesized compounds are provided as supplementary information.</p>
