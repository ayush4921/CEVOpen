<p>Oxidative stress is associated with the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases and disorders such as cardiac diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and cancer [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and plant-based secondary metabolites play protective role against reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated disorders [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5–8</xref>]. However, the identification of natural antioxidants and their source has drawn attention over synthetic drugs owing to their benefits. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder associated with genetic pathophysiology and environmental factors primarily responsible for the destruction of synovial fluids, inflammatory cartilage degeneration, morning stiffness, bone alcoholysis and joint deformities [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent research studies revealed that approximately 0.5–1% of people are globally suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, where women are affected more than men, women: men (3:1) [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Notably, ROS, lipoxygenase, pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumour necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, prostaglandins, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme and macrophage colony-stimulating factor plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis. In the rheumatoid synovium, the activation of polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages enhanced O
 <sub>2</sub> consumption with the release of toxic free radicals, which can damage joint and cartilage tissue that leads to triggers an inflammatory response and cytolysis [
