<p>Approximately 500 g coarse powdered leaves were dissolved in 3000 mL of methanol at a ratio of 1:6 (plant sample: solvent) at room temperature (25 ± 2°C) for 3 days with occasional shaking and stirring on a shaker machine and then filtered using cotton followed by Whatman #1 filter paper. The filtrate was concentrated by evaporating the solvent using a water bath at a temperature of 40–45°C to yield a viscous mass of crude methanol extract. Around 50 g of the crude methanol extract was fractionated, followed by modified Kupchan method [
