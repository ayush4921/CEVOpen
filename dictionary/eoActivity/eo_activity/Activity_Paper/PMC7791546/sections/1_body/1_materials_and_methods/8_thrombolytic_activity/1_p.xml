<p>The thrombolytic activity of AMFV was evaluated following the clot lysis test [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref>]. About 5 ml of venous blood drawn from ten healthy adult volunteers (Consent approval number: ECPD-IIUC-2019/02) 1:1 (male: female) with no history of an oral contraceptive and anticoagulant treatment. Consent was taken from the participants before collecting the blood sample. Blood from each volunteer distributed in nine pre-weighed sterile Eppendorf tube (0.5 ml/tube) and incubated for 45 min at 37°C to form the clot. After clot formation, serum was removed carefully without disrupting the clot, and each tube was reweighed to define the clot weight. In each tube having the pre-weighed clot, 100 µl of AFMV as the positive control, 100 µl of normal saline as negative control and 100 µl of SK as positive control were separately added. Incubation was done for 90 min at 37°C to notice clot lysis. After incubation, released fluid was separated using micropipette and tubes were reweighed to get the difference in clot weight after clot disruption. The percentage of clot lysis was calculated using the following formula:
