<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>M. vitifolia</italic> were collected randomly from hill tract area of Chittagong, Bangladesh. A taxonomist then verified the collected plant samples, and a voucher specimen has been deposited with a number (accession#75488) for future references. The extraneous, objectionable contaminants were removed by hand and then washed the plant materials using freshwater. Washed plant materials were dried in shaded place at low temperature (45–50°C) and crushed into coarse powered using a mechanical grinder.
