<p>Denaturation of intra-cellular protein is a well-known reason for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. The inhibitory activity against protein denaturation is one of the most common methods to investigate the anti-arthritic activity of the plant extracts. Protein denaturation is associated with heat, superficial anxiety and chemical vulnerability which helps to generate auto antigens-associated type-III hypersensitivity reaction in certain arthritic diseases [

The present experimental findings showed that AFMV exhibited a significant and dose-dependent inhibitory percentage that was parallel to the reference drug. Secondary metabolites include triterpenoids, phenols, tannins and flavonoids might be responsible for this anti-arthritic activity. Research also suggests that flavonoids have the specific potential to inhibit protein denaturation [
