<p>The homeostatic balance between free radicals and antioxidants play a central role in the expression of genes and receptor activation. However, a negative shift in the levels of free radicals can become harmful for the biological system, resulting in several diseases like inflammation, neurodegenerative disorders, aging and cancer [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Antioxidants counteract abnormal effects in the body associated with free radical damage and oxidative stress. Therefore, natural products have gained more attention of researchers in identifying, screening and characterising antioxidants to replace the synthetic ones. Numerous studies have reported that polyphenols and their rich extract can reduce oxidative stress associated with the chronic inflammatory diseases [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activity was analysed by DPPH free radical scavenging assay and reducing power capacity assay. AFMV exhibited a significant (
 <italic>P&lt;0.01</italic>) correlation between extract and ascorbic acid for the percentage of inhibition in scavenging abilities. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of AFMV indicated that it has promising protein donating ability and might serve as a free radical inhibitor. The reducing power capacity of AFMV extract was evaluated by using Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> reduction assay. The results of the mentioned assay reveal significant reduction (
