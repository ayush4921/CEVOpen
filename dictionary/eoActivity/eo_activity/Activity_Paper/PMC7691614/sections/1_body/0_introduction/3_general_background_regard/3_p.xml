<p>Herbal products’ regulations vary greatly between countries and continents. In the EU/EEA, herbal products fall into two main categories, depending on their primary intent of use: i) ‘herbal medicines’ that are regulated under medicinal products’ legislation and ii) ‘herbal food supplements’ that are covered by the provisions of food legislation. The European Directive 2002/46/EC defines food supplements as concentrated sources of nutrients or other substances with nutritional or physiological effect whose purpose is to supplement the normal diet. Regarding more specific provisions for nutrients or other substances, the Directive 2002/46/EC so far only regulates which vitamins and minerals may be added to food supplements and which vitamin/mineral substances or compounds may be used. Daily maximum amounts for vitamins and minerals in individual food supplement products have not yet been established at the EU level. With respect to ‘other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect’, current specific provisions (with only a few exceptions) are lacking as to which ‘other substances’ may be used in food supplements or regarding daily maximum amounts for individual substances in food supplement products.</p>
