<p>The use of herbal preparations has gained popularity in industrialised countries as complementary or alternative approach to pharmacotherapy involving synthetic, monosubstance pharmaceuticals (WHO,

With a high demand driven by consumer's health concerns, cultural factors, the belief that herbal preparations are natural and thus safe, and since herbal products are often viewed as being balanced and moderate home remedies, thousands of herbal products, including herbal food supplements, are advertised, marketed and distributed via various channels, including pharmacies, natural herbal shops, online retail stores and social media platforms (Raclariu et al.,

Herbal preparations often contain a complex mixture of natural chemicals, the composition of which depends, among others, on plant growth conditions, the part of the plant used for processing and the conditions of processing, i.e. conditions of extraction from the plant. Despite their popularity, the assessment of their safety requires a thorough multidisciplinary scientific investigation and validation of their chemical and biological activities, including potential pharmaceutical, pharmacological and toxicological activities. However, in cases where herbal products are sold as food supplements, surveillance of such herbal products with respect to potential adverse effects (nutrivigilance) remains difficult because these products do not require a medical prescription and are sold as over‐the‐counter products. Legislative frameworks that take into account monitoring, consistent documentation and evaluation of adverse effects associated with food supplements are not in place in many EU countries.
