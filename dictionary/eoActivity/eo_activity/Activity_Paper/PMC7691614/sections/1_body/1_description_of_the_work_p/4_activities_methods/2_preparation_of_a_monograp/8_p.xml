<p>Several human observational studies were identified (Caparros‐Lefebvre and Elbaz,

 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). These studies suggested an association between the long‐term consumption of fruits and infusions made from other plant parts 
 <italic>of A. muricata</italic> (i.e. leaves) and an increased incidence of movement disorders that resembled Parkinson′s disease. In one of these studies. the post‐mortem neuropathological and biochemical examination of some affected patients showed an accumulation of tau proteins in the midbrain (Caparros‐Lefebvre et al., 
 <xref rid="efs2e181112-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). However, causality in relation to 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> is difficult to prove and information provided in the observational studies is insufficient in this respect.
