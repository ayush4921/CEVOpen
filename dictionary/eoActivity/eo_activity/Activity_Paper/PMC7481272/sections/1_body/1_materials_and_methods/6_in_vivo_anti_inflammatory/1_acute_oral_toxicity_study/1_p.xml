 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Briefly, five female mice (aged 8–9 weeks and weighing 30–35 g) were withheld from food with free access to water for 3 hours prior- and one-hour post-administration of extract. A single dose of the extract at 2 g/kg body weight was given orally to the first mouse and followed for 2 days to observe any signs of toxicity or mortality. Then, the remaining four mice were given the extract orally at the same dose as described for the first mouse. All mice were closely observed for the first 30 min, intermittently every 30 min for 4 hours and then daily for 14 days for the presence of changes in skin and fur, hyperactivity, tremors, sedation, convulsions, lethargy, and coma. Bodyweight of each mouse was also recorded before extract administration and weekly.
