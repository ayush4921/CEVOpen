<p>110 g weighed dried and powdered leaves of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> were macerated with 70% ethanol for 3 days with intermittent shaking using an orbital shaker. Muslin cloth and then Whatman filter paper number 1 were used to filter the extract. The marc was then re-macerated twice to maximize the amount of extractible constituents in the extract. Then, the collected filtrates were dried in a drying oven at 40 ± 1 ºC. The dried crude extract was stored in an amber glass container in a refrigerator at −4 ºC until use. The percentage yield was determined using the equation below.
