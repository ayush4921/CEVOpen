<p>Mice used in each model were grouped randomly into five groups each containing five mice. Group I was used as a negative control treated with distilled water (DW). Group II, III and, IV served as test groups treated with crude extract at doses 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, respectively. Group V served as positive control and each mouse was administered with the standard drugs (Pethidine at 5 mg/kg in tail immersion test, acetylsalicylic acid/aspirin at 150 mg/kg in the acetic acid-induced writhing test, and 100 mg/kg aspirin in carrageenan-induced paw oedema model). All treatments were dissolved in distilled water (except pethidine as it was liquid preparation) and administered orally.</p>
