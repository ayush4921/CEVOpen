<p>This test was performed to assess the effect of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> leaf extract on acetic acid-induced peripheral pain in mice model according to the method described by Koster et al (1959).
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Mice were fasted with free access to water for 16 h prior to experiment. Then, mice were treated orally as per the experimental design described above. After 45 min of the treatment, each mouse was injected 10 mL/kg body weight of acetic acid suspension (0.7% v/v, in normal saline) intraperitoneally. Then, the number of abdominal writhes of each mouse in each group was counted during a 15-min period, which was begun after 5 min of acetic acid injection. The peripheral analgesic activity is expressed in percentage inhibition of abdominal writhes using the following formula:
