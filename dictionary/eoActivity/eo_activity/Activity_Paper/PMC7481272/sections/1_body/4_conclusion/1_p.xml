<p>To conclude, the ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> exhibited significant in vitro hyaluronidase inhibition, in vivo anti-inflammatory activity, and peripheral and central anti-nociceptive activities in mice model. Some of these activities, especially the anti-inflammatory activity may be attributed to the reported secondary metabolites such as stigmasterol, lupeol, and lup-20(29)-ene-3Î²,23-diol. Besides, the extract was found to cause neither sign of acute toxicity nor mortality at a single oral dose of 2 g/kg. Hence, the findings of the present study may justify and partly supports the traditional use of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> leaf for the treatment of pain and inflammatory conditions. Further works to characterize the responsible bioactive molecules from the plant leaf extract and elucidate the mechanism of action may be suggested.
