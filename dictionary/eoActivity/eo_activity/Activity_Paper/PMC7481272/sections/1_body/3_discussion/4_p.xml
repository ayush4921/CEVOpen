<p>In addition to the writhing model, tail-flick model was also used to determine the central anti-nociceptive property of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> leaves extract. The thermal-induced pain model can be conducted either by dipping the tail of mice in hot water or placing the tail of mice on radiant heat.

 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Immersing tail of mice in hot water is linked with acute and quick tail movement and recoiling of the whole body which is a spinally mediated reflex to the stimuli.

 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In this study, an oral dose of an extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> exhibited a significant prolongation of reaction latency (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 versus distilled water-treated group) to the thermal stimuli beginning from 60 to 180 min in a dose-dependent fashion. This central anti-nociception property is in agreement with previous studies, which reported potent anti-nociceptive activity of the aqueous extract of the aerial parts and roots of 
 <italic>Hygrophila auriculate</italic>
 <xref rid="cit0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> as well as chloroform, alcoholic and aqueous leaf extracts of 
 <italic>H. spinosa</italic>
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> against thermal stimuli in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, a significant increment of pain threshold to the thermal-induced pain has been reported from the extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> seeds.
