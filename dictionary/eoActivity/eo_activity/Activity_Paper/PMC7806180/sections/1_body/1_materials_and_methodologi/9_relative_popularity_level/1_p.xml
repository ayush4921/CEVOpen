<p>The relative popularity level index of the plants was calculated to assure and re-affirm obtained FL statistical values of the plants. Sometime, FL cannot be explained properply, particulalry when it provides similar values although above 50%, then there is need of a correction factor and RPL is used for this purpose. RPL usually ranges between 0–1 showing lowest and highest range. If its value is one or near to it, then it proves that plant species is frequently used to cure the disease and vice versa [

 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. It is known that number of uses increases when number of informants rises because of correlation coefficient factor r = 0.10. For example, if one plant species is cited by more 25 or more informants as ethnomedicines then its RPL rank is raised and RPL is determined as percentage of (I
 <sub>u</sub> /25); score one (1) is assigned if cited or mentioned by the half or more number (12) of total informants that was 25 and plant species used to cure any disease is known as popular (“P”) medicinal plant in the area. If any plant is cited by less than 12 informants then RPL value will be ranked as unpopular (“UP”) [

 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The marginalized value between ‘P and UP’ of the plant is the point where if informants number is increased then number of medicinal uses per plant species does not rise.
