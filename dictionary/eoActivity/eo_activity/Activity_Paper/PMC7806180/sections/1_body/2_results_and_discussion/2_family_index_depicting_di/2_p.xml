<p>These above stated families are the most prevalent and dominant in the study area proving that MPs of these families are prevalent in the area and easily accessible to the local communities. The prevalence of these families in TEK of the area means that plants of these families have good quantity of phytoconstituents and local inhabitants have been using these for long time. The remaining families having ≤ five or less number of plants are also being used in TEMs but their ratio is less indicating either their less popularity or scare occurrence in the area. Similar reports about the presence of secondary metabolites have been cited in the previous works where plants of families like Moraceae, Lamiaceae, Asteraceae and Poaceae have been used for cure of different infirmities by local people of KPK, areas of Pakistan [

 <xref rid="pone.0243151.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In previous research studies, similar results have been reported that many plants belonging to 46 families of lesser Himalaya regions of Pakistan are prevalently used to cure reproductive and respiratory disorders [
