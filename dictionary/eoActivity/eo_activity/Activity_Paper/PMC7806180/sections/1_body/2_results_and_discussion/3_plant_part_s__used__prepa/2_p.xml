<p>It has been found that excessive collection of leaf along with other parts like roots and bark from plants have caused severe threats for many medicinal plants in the study area. It is also found plants’ leaves have more efficacy than other parts because leaf has more quantity of chemical constituents; furthermore potential of herbal medicine depends on use-mode, method of preparation and utilization technique [

There is need to start awareness campaigns to train local people about mechanism of plants’ parts collection so that medicinal plants may not be severely damaged and thrilled towards endangered and extinction zones. TEMs reported here have been prepared by using different recipes and methods such as extract, infusion, tea, decoction, powder, poultice and paste etc (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243151.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The most common form of utilization of ethnomedicines was decoction with 29.28%, followed by tea (23.05%), extract (12.17%) and least usage form was pickle (0.66%), because pickle cannot be prepared from all parts or fruits of plants. These findings are coincident with previous works stating that decoction was the most prevalent use-form in TEMs promulgated in different areas of Pakistan [

 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Sometime, plants are used as single recipe and sometime used as admixture in combination of different plants parts and later one is considered as the most efficient because synergistic (compound) ethnomedicines have high potential to cure infirmities [

 <xref rid="pone.0243151.ref117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. It is also found that decoction has more efficacy than other use-forms because it has more concentration of phytochemicals than tea or soup and same type of reports had been provided in the past publications [
