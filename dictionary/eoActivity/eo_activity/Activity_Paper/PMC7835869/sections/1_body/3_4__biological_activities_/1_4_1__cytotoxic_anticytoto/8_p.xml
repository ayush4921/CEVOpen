<p>Limited studies exist regarding the antimutagenic potential of the rose extracts. Aqueous extracts of three different cultivars of 
 <italic>R. centifolia</italic> petals (1.5 mg/mL) reduce the frequency of mutations (from 4% to 55%) in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells compared to those induced by the direct mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate [
