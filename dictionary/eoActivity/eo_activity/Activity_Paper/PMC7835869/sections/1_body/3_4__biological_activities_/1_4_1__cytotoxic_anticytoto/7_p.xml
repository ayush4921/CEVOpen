<p>There is scarce data on the antiproliferative effect of 
 <italic>R.centifolia</italic> extracts and oil. Kalemba-Drożdż and Ciermiak (2019) found that the aqueous-alcoholic extracts of this species (1% tinctures diluted 100-fold in RPMI medium) did not affect the viability of human lymphocytes when applied for 1 h and 24 h. Rose extracts do not show or have low genotoxic activity at the tested concentrations [
 <xref rid="B74-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], whereas the tested oil of 
 <italic>R. centifolia</italic> has cytotoxic activity. The essential oil of 
 <italic>R. centifolia</italic> in a concentration of 1% showed a high toxic effect in human lymphocytes in vitro after incubation for 1 h.
