<p>The total phenolic content (TPC) of the methanol extracts of fresh flowers (FFs) and spent flowers (SFs) of the 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> grown in Turkey is totally different. The FF extract has a TPC five times higher than that of the SF. The antioxidant activity (AOA), tested by a method based on the formation of a phosphomolybdenum complex and the ability for inhibition of DPPH radicals of the FF extract, is higher than that of SF extract, and a positive correlation with the TPC is observed [

 <italic>R. centifolia</italic> from India demonstrated a dose-dependent acceptance of DPPH, good AOA, as well as the potential to scavenge superoxide anion radicals (•O
