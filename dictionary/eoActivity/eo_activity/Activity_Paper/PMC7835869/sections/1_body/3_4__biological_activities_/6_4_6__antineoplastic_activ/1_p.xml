<p>Regarding the four 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> species upon which this review is focused, research on the antineoplastic activity has been done only for 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> (and its variety the Taif rose) and 
 <italic>R. gallica</italic> (more precisely its draft in 
 <italic>R. canina</italic>). Still, these studies amount to more than a dozen (see 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00127-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Rose essential oils pass easily through and permeabilize the cell membrane and coagulate the cytoplasm, thus damaging lipids and proteins [

 <xref rid="B129-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Essential oils stimulate depolarization in mitochondrial membranes and also change their fluidity [

 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The main compounds in rose essential oil are citronellol, linalool, geraniol, flavonoids, and citral, which have been reported to have anticancer activities together with monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes [

 <xref rid="B134-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Terpenes in essential oils could change the nature of the cell membrane, thus causing cell death [
