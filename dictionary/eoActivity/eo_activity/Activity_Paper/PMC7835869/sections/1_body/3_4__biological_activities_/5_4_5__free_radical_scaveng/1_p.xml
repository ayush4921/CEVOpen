<p>Oxygen is a very important molecule for aerobic life, necessary for respiration and energy metabolism, but it may also be dangerous in some conditions due to its ability to form reactive oxygen species (ROSs). Normally, cells control the levels of ROSs by balancing the generation of ROSs with their elimination by antioxidant defense systems. Under extreme conditions, this balance is disturbed, and over-generated ROSs are capable of oxidizing cellular proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, thus violating their function [
