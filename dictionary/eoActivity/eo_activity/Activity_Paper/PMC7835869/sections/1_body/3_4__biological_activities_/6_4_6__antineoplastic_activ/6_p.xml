 <italic>R. damascene</italic> “Alexandria” and the 
 <italic>R. gallica</italic> “Francesa” draft in 
 <italic>R. canina</italic> were studied through SRB assay with a 48 h incubation, and were found to be moderately cytotoxic against tumor cell lines, while no hepatoxicity towards liver primary culture was observed. Flavonoids were the predominant compounds [

 <sub>50</sub>, etc.), measuring units (μg/mL, μM, etc.), and incubation times applied in the different articles. Still, we have tried to perform an analysis of the information presented in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00127-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Regarding IC
 <sub>50</sub>, an isoprenylated aurone (IC
 <sub>50</sub> on acute myeloid leukemia NB4 cells 4.8 μM and on neuroblastoma SHSY5Y cells 3.4 μM) [

 <italic>R. damascena</italic> and crude methanol extract and its aqueous fraction from Taif rose (IC50 of 9 and 8 µg/mL on hepatocarcinoma cells, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B147-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] were the most active. All components that have IC
 <sub>50</sub> values lower than 20 µg/mL are also very prospective anticancer candidates according to the guidelines of the National Cancer Institute. The components from the same species that decreases cancer cell viability to less than 15% were all from
