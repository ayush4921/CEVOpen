<p>UV radiation is a very harmful exogenous factor that induces ROS formation, and treatment with antioxidants is reasonable. Karamalakova et al. (2018) studied antiradical and antioxidant properties before and after UV and γ- irradiation of rose oil using electron donation potential estimation assays, DPPH, ABTS, and Nitric oxide ion scavenging assays, as well as assessing the protection of lipid membranes against radiation damage. Samples after irradiation showed a significant reduction in their donor potential in comparison to non-irradiated oil; nevertheless, in all studied concentrations the ability for scavenging DPPH is higher than the positive control of quercetin. Both γ-irradiated and non-irradiated oil samples demonstrated an increase in scavenging abilities towards ABTS and NO in a concentration-dependent manner [
