<p>As can be seen, many research groups have focused their research programs on investigating the antimicrobial activities of plants from the 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> species, and their extracts, in the hope of discovering new antibacterial agents. The antimicrobial potency of rose ethanolic extract and essential oils against respiratory tract pathogens has been investigated for many years. The application manner of this oil is variable, depending on the symptoms of the disease and the treated area. The commonly used method is the inhalation of rose oil, which significantly decreases oxyhemoglobin concentration and activity in the right prefrontal brain cortex and increases feelings of comfort. Haze et al. (2002) found that the vaporous inhalation of rose oil decreases relative sympathetic activity of the nervous system, as measured by heart rate variability and low frequency amplitudes of systolic blood pressure in healthy adult females [

Inhaling essential oil molecules, or absorbing essential oils through the skin, transmits messages to the limbic systemâ€”a brain region responsible for controlling emotions and influencing the nervous system. The inhalation of rose oil showed protective effects against damages caused by intoxication with formaldehyde in the male reproductive system [

There are data reporting that the main rose oil components, citronellol, geraniol, and nerol, had strong antimicrobial activity against some bacteria. Asthma is a disorder that is caused by chronic inflammation in the airway. One of the major symptoms of asthma is a chronic cough. Although there is a large number of research which indicates some progress in asthma treatment, local and systematic adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids can lead to alternative and complementary remedies. Herbal remedies, because of their effective constituents, have been accepted as a third effective treatment in asthma [
 <xref rid="B105-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Investigations regarding the effects of herbal remedies in asthma treatments are still inconclusive and there is evidence regarding the benefits of plant essential oils in the treatment of asthma. It is accepted that there is direct correlation between bronchodilating potency and cough inhibition [
 <xref rid="B106-biomolecules-11-00127" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. It has been elucidated that polyphenols and flavonoids have a significant effect on cyclooxygenase (COX)-1, (COX)-2, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), and 12-LOX, due to their anti-inflammatory properties. It seems that the anti-inflammatory effects might be useful in cases of asthma where pathogenesis inflammation plays a major role. The above-mentioned evidence suggests that there is a close correlation between asthma, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Essential oils are a good choice of treatment that can help millions of people affected by asthma [
