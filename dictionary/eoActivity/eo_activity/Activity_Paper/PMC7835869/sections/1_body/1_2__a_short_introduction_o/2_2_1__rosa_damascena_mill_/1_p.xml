 <italic>R. damascena</italic> Mill., i.e., damask rose with thirty corolla leaves, is the most important scented rose species that originated in Central Asia. According to Iwata et al. (2000), the oldest damask roses have a three-parent origin—
 <italic>R. moschata</italic>, 
 <italic>R. gallica</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. fedschenkoana</italic> [

 <italic>R. gallica</italic> L. and 
 <italic>R. canina</italic> L., others suggest 
 <italic>R. gallica</italic> and 
 <italic>R. moschata</italic>, 
 <italic>R. centifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>R. alba</italic>, or 
 <italic>R. centifolia</italic> and

 <italic>Rosa X damascena</italic> Mill. (=
 <italic>R. gallica</italic> X 
 <italic>R. moschata</italic>). The botanical characteristics of 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> can be described as follows: it is a perennial shrub, strongly branched, and reaching a height of 2.5 m. The branches are light green with large, curved down flattened spines. The leaves have five to seven elliptical toothed leaf parts. The flowers are collected in panicle inflorescences with 3–9 flowers (sometimes up to 31), which bloom consecutively. They have 5–60 corolla petals, colored pale pink to pinkish red [
