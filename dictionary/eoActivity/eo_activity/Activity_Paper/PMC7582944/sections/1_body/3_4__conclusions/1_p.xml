<p>In the present study, quantitative and qualitative analyses of the methanol extracts of four 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. (
 <italic>I. pallida</italic>, 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic>, 
 <italic>I. sibirica</italic>, and 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic>) rhizomes were performed using a new HPLC method. Eleven phenolic compounds were identified. The identification was based on co-chromatography with reference compounds and UV/MS data. According to our analysis, mangiferin, tectoridin, germanaism B, irigenin, irisolidone-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside, and irisolidone were the major compounds of 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. and can be proposed as chemical markers suitable for the development of quality control protocols of these species. This is the first report on the detailed analysis of the chemical composition of 
 <italic>I. pallida</italic>, 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic>, 
 <italic>I. sibirica</italic>, and 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic>. Biological evaluation of the 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. extracts revealed that 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes extract exhibited a potent antioxidant effect. The antioxidant activity was attributed to gallic acid and mangiferin content. 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> rhizomes were for the first time shown to inhibit superoxide anion generation in fMLF-induced human neutrophils and increase the NRF2 expression. The phytochemical and pharmacological results indicated that 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> rhizomes extract contain a balanced mixture of phenolic compounds with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic biological activities.
