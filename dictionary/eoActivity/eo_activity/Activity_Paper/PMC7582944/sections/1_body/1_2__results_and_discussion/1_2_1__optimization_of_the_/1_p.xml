<p>In the current research, we applied certain modifications to an HPLC method developed for the simultaneous determination of phenolic compounds in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. dichotoma</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The applied modifications resulted in a better separation of compounds with good peak symmetry. In our study, we used methanol as the extraction solvent and an ultrasonic bath to enhance the extraction efficacy. Chromatographic separation of the extracts was carried out using a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with an ACE C
 <sub>18</sub> column. Gradient elution was applied with 0.1% acetic acid in water-acetonitrile and acetonitrile with increasing polarity from 5% to 95%. Similar polyphenolic compounds were detected in the extracts of 
 <italic>I. pallida, I. hungarica, I. sibirica</italic>, and 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> rhizomes as demonstrated by HPLC-DAD and UPLCâ€“MS/MS analyses. Compound identification was based on their co-elution with reference compounds previously isolated from the rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. pseudacorus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], as well as based on the UV/MS spectroscopic data. For the qualitative analysis of phenolic compounds, a more selective and sensitive negative ionization mode method was selected for the crude plants [
