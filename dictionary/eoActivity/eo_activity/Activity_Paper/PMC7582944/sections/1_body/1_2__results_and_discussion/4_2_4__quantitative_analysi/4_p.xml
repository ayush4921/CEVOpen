<p>The amounts of germanaism B (
 <bold>5</bold>) and irisolidone-D-glucoside (
 <bold>6</bold>) were the highest in the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> and 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes (7.089 to 6.285 mg/g and 7.507 to 7.353 mg/g, respectively). The concentrations of irigenin (
 <bold>9</bold>) (5.518 ± 0.031 mg/g) and xanthone mangiferin (
 <bold>2</bold>) (5.747 ± 0.080 mg/g) in 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> were also high in comparison with the other tested 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. According to the conducted HPLC analysis, every 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. contained mangiferin with its amounts varying from 0.267 (
 <italic>I. sibirica</italic>) to 5.747 mg/g (
 <italic>I. variegata</italic>). These amounts were higher compared with the previous reports. For example, the amount of mangiferin in 
 <italic>I. dichotoma</italic> rhizomes from different regions in China was 0.86–2.03 mg/g which was almost three times less compared with 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> from Ukraine [

 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], thus its identification and quantification in 
 <italic>Iris</italic> raw materials are important from a therapeutic perspective. Among hydroxycinnamic acids, gallic acid (
 <bold>1</bold>) was found in the extracts of 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> (3.729 ± 0.134 mg/g) and 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> (2.362 ± 0.076 mg/g).
