<p>According to our results, 
 <italic>I. sibirica</italic> rhizome extract can be distinguished from other extracts by having low amounts of phenolic compounds. The amounts of mangiferin (
 <bold>2</bold>) (0.267 ± 0.002 mg/g) and caffeic acid (
 <bold>3</bold>) (0.288 ± 0.012) were the highest among other identified compounds in this 
 <italic>Iris</italic> rhizome. However, the content of all compounds including tectoridin (
 <bold>4</bold>) (0.038 ± 0.001 mg/g), germanaism B (
 <bold>5</bold>) (0.012 ± 0.000 mg/g), irisolidone-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside (
 <bold>6</bold>) (0.115 ± 0.005 mg/g), nigricin (
 <bold>8</bold>) (0.079 ± 0.002 mg/g), and irigenin (
 <bold>9</bold>) (0.069 ± 0.000 mg/g) was much lower in comparison with the other species. Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>, and 
 <bold>11</bold> were absent in the extract of 
 <italic>I. sibirica</italic> rhizomes which was predictable because they are considered minor metabolites of 
 <italic>Iris</italic> plants.
