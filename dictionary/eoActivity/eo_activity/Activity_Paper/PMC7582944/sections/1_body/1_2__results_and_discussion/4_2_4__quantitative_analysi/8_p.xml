<p>According to the results of the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the phenolic antioxidant compounds in 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. growing in Ukraine, it can be concluded that these plants were not inferior to 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. grown in other places around the globe. The presence and high content of phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> and 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> encouraged us to subject these two species to intensive pharmacological investigations.
