  <p>Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) protective activity of 
   <italic>Iris</italic> rhizomes extracts. The cells infected by HCoV-229E were treated with the samples (orange) or vehicle (grey), any difference between them would indicate protective effects against HCoV-229E infection. The uninfected cells were also treated with the samples (dark blue) or vehicle only (light blue), serving as a control for cell viability after the treatment with the samples or vehicle. 
   <italic>I. var</italic> W,
