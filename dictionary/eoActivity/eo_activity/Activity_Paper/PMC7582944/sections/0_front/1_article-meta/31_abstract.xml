 <p>The major groups of antioxidant compounds (isoflavonoids, xanthones, hydroxycinnamic acids) in the rhizome methanol extracts of four Ukrainian 
  <italic>Iris</italic> sp. (
  <italic>Iris pallida</italic>, 
  <italic>Iris hungarica</italic>, 
  <italic>Iris sibirica</italic>, and 
  <italic>Iris variegata</italic>) were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using HPLC-DAD and UPLC-MS/MS. Gallic acid, caffeic acid, mangiferin, tectoridin, irigenin, iristectorigenin B, irisolidone, 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,5′-tetramethoxyisoflavone, irisolidone-7-
  <italic>O</italic>-
  <italic>β</italic>-
  <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, germanaism B, and nigricin were recognized by comparing their UV/MS spectra, chromatographic retention time (tR) with those of standard reference compounds. 
  <italic>I. hungarica</italic> and 
  <italic>I. variegata</italic> showed the highest total amount of phenolic compounds. Germanaism B was the most abundant component in the rhizomes of 
  <italic>I. variegata</italic> (7.089 ± 0.032 mg/g) and 
  <italic>I. hungarica</italic> (6.285 ± 0.030 mg/g). The compound analyses showed good calibration curve linearity (r
  <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.999) and low detection and quantifications limit. These results validated the method for its use in the simultaneous quantitative evaluation of phenolic compounds in the studied 
  <italic>Iris</italic> sp. 
  <italic>I. hungarica</italic> and 
  <italic>I. variegata</italic> rhizomes exhibited antioxidant activity, as demonstrated by the HPLC-ABTS system and NRF2 expression assay and anti-inflammatory activity on respiratory burst in human neutrophils. Moreover, the extracts showed anti-allergic and cytotoxic effects against cancer cells. Anti-coronavirus 229E and lipid formation activities were also evaluated. In summary, potent antioxidant marker compounds were identified in the examined 
  <italic>Iris</italic> sp.
