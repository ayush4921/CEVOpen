<p>The release of interleukin-1 
 <italic>β</italic> (IL-1 
 <italic>β</italic>), which is a cytokine, plays a key role in the initiation of the gout disease. Actually, the crystals lead to the activation of monocyte and then releasing caspase-1, which induces the IL-1 
 <italic>β</italic> secretion [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The blocking of this cytokine represents an effective treatment of acute and chronic gout. Among IL-1 
 <italic>β</italic> inhibitors that are used, there are anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept, and pralnacasan [
