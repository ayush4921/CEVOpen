<p>Available treatments for PD consist mainly in restoring dopaminergic tone either by administering catecholamines such as L-DOPA and Carbidopa (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), cabergoline, lisuride, and pergolide) and non-ergot-derived small-molecules (pramipexole, ropinirole, and piribedil). Because of the short half-life of L-DOPA, catechol-
