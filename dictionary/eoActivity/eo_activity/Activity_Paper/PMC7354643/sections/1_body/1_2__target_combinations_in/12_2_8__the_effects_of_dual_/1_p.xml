<p>Another innovative approach in the search for MTDLs envisages the possibility to act on ChEs or BACE-1 and to couple this activity with the modulation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS is composed of endogenous lipid-signaling molecules defined as endocannabinoids (ECBs) and their cellular targets, the G-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors (type-1 and type-2 CBRs), along with the transporters and enzymes responsible for ECB biosynthesis and metabolism. 
 <italic>N</italic>-Arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide (AEA)) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are two members of the ECB signaling molecules, and they activate CBRs to modulate a wide range of responses and processes including pain, inflammation, and thermoregulation [

Amongst the latter, the Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) was originally identified as the enzyme responsible for AEA hydrolysis [
