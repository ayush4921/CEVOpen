<p>With the aim of discovering MTDLs for AD treatment able to modulate ECS via direct CBR stimulation, Nuñez-Borque et al. have identified two CBR agonists which also act as BACE-1 and/or BuChE inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. No 
 <italic>K</italic>i values were reported for CBRs, but functional experiments confirmed the agonist profile for 
 <bold>40</bold> and 
 <bold>41</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>), and while 
 <bold>40</bold> had a 60% inhibition of BACE-1 at 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, compound 
 <bold>41</bold> had a 38% inhibition at the same concentration and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> on BuChE of 2.5 nM. In rat primary cortical neuronal cultures, both compounds efficiently attenuated A
 <italic>β</italic>-induced cell death, increasing cell viability, while only 
 <bold>40</bold> was able to improve performances in an animal model of AD, namely TgAPP transgenic mice. Moreover, this compound was able to restore abnormal features of the AD lymphoblast, thus having an impact on nonneuronal cell cycle alterations, considered systemic manifestation of the disease. This was achieved either by preventing the enhanced serum stimulation of cell proliferation or by sensitizing cells to apoptosis in conditions of higher resistance to serum deprivation-induced cell death. More detailed studies are needed to completely understand the effects and mechanisms behind these MTDLs, but they represent a nice way to address AD from a different perspective.
