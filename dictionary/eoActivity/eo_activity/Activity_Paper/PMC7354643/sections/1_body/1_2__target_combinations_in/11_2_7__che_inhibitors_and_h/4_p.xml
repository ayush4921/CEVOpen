<p>All the compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit 
 <italic>h</italic>AChE and to bind to guinea pig (gp) 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>R. They showed an overall decrease in 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>R affinity, with the 
 <italic>N</italic>-benzylpiperidines being the weakest ones, although some analogues changed their functional activity on the receptor, acting as an antagonist instead of a partial agonist, as Donecopride was. They all displayed a potent inhibition of AChE, with the 
 <italic>N</italic>-benzyl groups on piperidines enhancing this activity, behaving as noncompetitive inhibitors, suggesting a possible interaction with the PAS and the subanionic site of the active site. These interactions were subsequently confirmed by the X-ray analysis of the crystal structures of selected compounds with the enzyme. Regarding the 
 <italic>σ</italic>1R affinity, most of the compounds of the series were very potent ligands of this receptor, and the presence of the indole ring was crucial for the activity. One of the best compounds (IC
 <sub>50</sub> (AChE) = 28.8 nM, 
 <italic>K</italic>i (5 − HT
 <sub>4</sub>R) = 37.5 nM, and 
 <italic>K</italic>i (
 <italic>σ</italic>1R) = 5.1 nM) was also evaluated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in a dizocilpine-induced amnesia model, showing a protecting effect in the passive avoidance test that correlates with its 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> potent 
 <italic>σ</italic>1R affinity. For all these reasons, this new series of compounds has a great potential to be useful in the treatment of AD and deserves further investigation.
