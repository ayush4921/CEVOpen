<p>The use of diethyl acetamidomalonate to build up a 1,2,3-triazole core (the metal-chelating part), 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked to the substituted phenyl groups (the hydrophobic part), led to compounds with general structure 
 <bold>54</bold>, which were meant to interact with the hydrophobic pocket of A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregates. The 2-iodophenyl group was the best performing in the ThT assay, inhibiting A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> self-aggregation by 78% with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, as also confirmed by TEM analysis. In addition, this analogue was able to disaggregate preformed fibrils at a concentration of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. When tested for its metal-chelating characteristic, it resulted in being able to complex Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> in a 2 : 1 stoichiometry and this maintained the metal in a redox-inert state preventing the production of ROS. Also the effect on Cu-mediated A
 <italic>β</italic> aggregation was evaluated, and while the presence of Cu alone increased the formation of A
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>42</sub> fibrils, the treatment with the selected compound was followed by its drastic decrease. The same disruptive effect was observed on preformed fibrils whose precipitation was induced by the presence of the metal. The compound had no effect on SH-SY5Y neuronal cell viability whilst it could increase the same viability by up to 78% at 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M after A
 <italic>β</italic>-induced toxic insult. Hence, there is plenty of evidences to state that these structures could substantially contribute to the discovery of novel MTDLs, acting on the principal hallmarks of AD and thus endowed with neuroprotective effects.
