<p>Serotonin and its receptors (5-HTRs) have been conferred notable attention during the past decades, especially for their peculiar distribution in brain areas connected to memory and learning and thus for the role played by this system in cognition [

 <sub>4</sub>R and 5-HT
 <sub>6</sub>R have been the principal focus of the latest researches, and the effects of 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>R agonists and 5-HT
 <sub>6</sub>R antagonists (or a combination of these efficacies) have been evaluated [
