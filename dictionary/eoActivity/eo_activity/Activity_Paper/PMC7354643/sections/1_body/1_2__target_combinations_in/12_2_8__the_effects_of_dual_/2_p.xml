<p>ECS can be modulated either by direct stimulation of CBRs or by inhibition of the ECB catabolic enzymes, leading to increased levels of ECBs [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>–
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. For this latter purpose, Montanari et al. have recently proposed some compounds, here represented by 
 <bold>39</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>), endowed with inhibitory activity towards FAAH, AChE, and BuChE [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. They evaluated several structures where the triazole linker of 
 <bold>39</bold> was replaced by a more flexible 
 <italic>N</italic>-methylalkyl chain, some of which were able to inhibit both AChE and BuChE to a similar extent, and to retain a good activity towards the FAAH enzyme. However, a more balanced profile was achieved with 
 <bold>39</bold>, having an IC
 <sub>50</sub> against 
 <italic>r</italic>FAAH, 
 <italic>h</italic>AChE, and 
 <italic>h</italic>BuChE of 922, 42.7, and 27.9 nM, respectively, and thus displaying good selectivity for BuChE. Cytotoxicity evaluation on SH-SY5Y cells up to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M showed no acute toxicity and, although no in vivo evaluation was performed, these compounds are worth further investigation for AD treatment.
