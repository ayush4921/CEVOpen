<p>Starting from the structure of the previously described Donecopride (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], Lalut et al. focused their research on novel ligands endowed with AChE inhibitory activity and 
 <italic>σ</italic>1R affinity [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Modifications to the aromatic region of the reference compound with the introduction of a substituted indole ring (
 <bold>33</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>) afforded a different receptor affinity profile, where the activity on 5-HT
 <sub>4</sub>R was partially lost while the interaction with 
 <italic>σ</italic>1R become the pivotal feature for the new analogues. Together with the binding affinity for 
 <italic>σ</italic>1R, the indole scaffold was also increasing the interactions with the peripheral anionic site (PAS) of AChE.
