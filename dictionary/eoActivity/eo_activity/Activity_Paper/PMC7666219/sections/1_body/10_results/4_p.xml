<p id="Par15">PAs were detected in the stream water and in the seepage water in wells G2 and G3 during all sampling events. In all sampled matrices the concentrations of N-oxides were similar to the concentrations of the equivalent free base compounds. The most frequently found and abundant PAs in the various sampled water corresponded to the most abundant PAs in the plants (senkirkine, senecionine, and senecionine N-oxide). No other PA metabolites were detected, whereas N-oxides are known to be the subject to metabolic back-transformation to corresponding free base PAs
