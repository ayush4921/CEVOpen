<p id="Par18">The concentrations of individual type 2 PAs that are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> did not exceed 10 ng/L, except in the stream water under non-base flow conditions (108 ng/L of retrorsine and 27 ng/L of seneciphylline in sampling event No. 2, and 56 ng/L of erucifoline and 46 ng/L of retrorsine N-oxide in sampling event No. 4). Type 1 PAs comprised cyclic diesters only, whereas type 2 PAs also included open-chain diesters and monoesters (Table 1 of the SM). Open-chain diester and monoester PAs have not been reported in butterbur in this or in previous studies
