<p id="Par17">Total PA concentrations in the well seepage waters were highest during sampling event No. 3 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) which corresponded with the largest biomass of adjacent butterbur. The greater plant coverage of the well (well G3, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) was associated with higher PA concentrations in the well water. There were fewer plants around the wells at subsequent sampling events due to regular biomass cutting and removal by a maintenance company to ensure access to the wells. This biomass removal possibly caused reduced PA concentrations.
