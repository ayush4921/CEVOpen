<p id="Par28">The seepage water was sampled by manually scooping it from the top 50 cm in 1 L bottles with an extension stick. Deep groundwater was sampled using a pump. The samples of all water types were taken in triplicates of 1 L in polypropylene bottles and frozen within 8 h at – 20 °C prior to analyses. To avoid any possible cross-contamination, no plant samples were taken during groundwater sampling events (Table 2 of the SM). A PA-free blank water was sampled, processed and analysed among all surface and groundwater samples as a field control.</p>
