<p id="Par27">Butterbur plants were sampled by cutting 3 whole average-height leaves from the ground surface and digging 10–15 cm segments of 3 rhizomes. Each sample was collected approximately 5 m from one another. The sampled biomass was frozen within 8 h at – 20 °C prior to analyses. The stream water was sampled at the surface water monitoring site during the dates listed in Table 2 of the SM. Intense precipitation resulted in a sudden flow increase, whereas dry periods from July to September resulted in no water movement or dry stream bed. Supplementary stream water samples were irregularly taken at 3 additional surface water sampling sites (Fig.
