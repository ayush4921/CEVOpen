<p id="Par32">The instrumental limits of detection and quantification of different PAs were in the range of 2–7 and 5–9 µg/L, respectively. The solid phase extraction provided a 1000 times concentration of the water samples with a 90% recovery rate

 </sup>. Field blanks consisted of laboratory grade deionised water that was brought to the field during each sampling event, sampled, handled, prepared and analysed along with the water samples in order to monitor any possible contamination by the PAs during the sampling and preparation steps. All concentrations of PAs in water blanks were below the limits of detection. The average recovery rate of surrogate (caffeine) was 94% ± 11 (n = 3). The concentrations of all the free base PAs and N-oxides were quantified against certified external standards purchased from Phytolab (Germany).
