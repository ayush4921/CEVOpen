 <sub>R</sub>) ± 0.15 min. Each MRM mode recorded only one PA by predefined parent and product ions

 <sub>R</sub> would have also recorded other PAs. However, only 21 PAs were detected in the samples. When an analyte was detectable but not quantifiable its concentration was set equal to its limit of detection (LOD)
