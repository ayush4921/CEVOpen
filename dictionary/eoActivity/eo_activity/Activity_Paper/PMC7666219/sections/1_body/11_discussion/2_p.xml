<p id="Par20">Other known PA producing plants were not observed in the studied area and the control wells contained neither PA types. That implies that all PAs in water likely originated from butterbur. The highest concentrations of type 2 PAs in the seepage water were observed in sampling event No. 7 (October) at which time there were the highest proportion of naturally wilted and decaying butterbur. The type 2 PAs may have originated from other unknown sources, transformed in decaying biomass or in the water from the type 1 PAs.</p>
