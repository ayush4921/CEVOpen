<p id="Par25">The PA releasing butterbur tends to invade moist and disturbed lands like shaded sides of roads, bridge embarkments, the shores of artificial surface water bodies, edges of ditches, channelized streams and water wells. According to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the species is omnipresent in most of western and northern Europe, common in the rest of the Europe and occasionally found across North America

 </sup>. No mitigation operations of these species exist. In northern Europe climate change is leading to an increase in precipitation that together with various land management activities will further stimulate the spread of butterbur, leading to an increased risk of PA contaminated water. The absence of regulations on natural toxins in water has resulted in a lack of suitable methodologies for their monitoring and identification. This study illustrates the need for the advancement of procedures to monitor persistent plant toxins and indicates the need for water cleaning technologies to facilitate their removal.
