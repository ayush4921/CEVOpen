 </sup>. Invasive and foreign ornamental species tend to contain highly toxic natural compounds. Inedible parts of agricultural crops contain natural toxins that could possibly also be released to larger land areas such as carcinogenic quinolizidine alkaloids in leaves and blossoms of lupin, and the acute toxic steroidal alkaloid solanine in leaves and stems of potato

 </sup>. To some extent, the natural toxins are regulated in food. Plant toxins not entering the human food chain are generally regarded as not harmful to humans. However, their aquatic toxicity and waterborne ingestion by humans remain largely unknown. In addition to direct harm, ingested plant toxins can interact with other contaminants in humans creating synergies and cumulative adverse health effects
