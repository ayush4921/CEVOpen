<p>â‘¡ In recent years, the research found that 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> total flavonoid extract has a good protective effect on liver tissue injury, and can improve and repair the damaged liver tissue structure, showing a good prospect of development and application in hepatoprotective and anti-hepatic fibrosis. However, many studies have reported that the pharmacological mechanisms of hepatoprotection and anti-hepatic fibrosis are not comprehensive and specific enough. Most of the studies on active constituents stay at crude extracts (mainly total flavonoid extracts), and there is a lack of in-depth study on monomer compounds. Therefore, it is necessary to screen and predict the action targets of active substances by means of systematic and network pharmacology, combined with modern research methods, and to clarify its specific pharmacological mechanism. At the same time, we further explore the biological activity and potential action mechanism of the extract of total flavonoids from 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>.
