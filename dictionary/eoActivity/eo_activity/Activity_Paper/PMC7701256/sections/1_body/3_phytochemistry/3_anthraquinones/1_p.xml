<p>Anthraquinones are abundant in polygonaceae plants, which have many pharmacological effects, such as anti-virus, anti-tumor, liver protection, blood lipid lowering, blood pressure lowering, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and so on. Four anthraquinones, emodin (

 <bold>28</bold>), aloe-emodin (
 <bold>29</bold>), and α-tocopheroIquinone (
 <bold>30</bold>), were isolated from the roots of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> for the first time in 2004 (
