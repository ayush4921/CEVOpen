<p>In recent years, fingerprint has been widely used in the quality control of traditional Chinese medicine. 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tian etÂ al. (2013)</xref> tested the 51 batches of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> samples collected from different locations or in different harvesting times in China by establishing the HPLC fingerprint determination method of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>, than analyzed the fingerprint obtained by chemometrics, similarity analysis, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis. Finally, the characteristic map is obtained. On the basis of the above, the pharmacodynamic similarities and differences of different batches of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> with statistical differences were analyzed. Finally, the researchers used mathematical statistical methods such as grey correlation degree method to statistically analyze the chemical information characterized by the chromatographic peaks of the chemical fingerprints of different batches of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> and the biological information characterized by the results of pharmacodynamics. Look for chemical substances that are closely related to pharmacodynamics. These studies have laid a good foundation for the identification of active components and quality control of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic>.
