<p>For a long time, 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> has been widely used to treat diseases caused by viral infections such as herpes zoster (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Modern pharmacological studies have found that ethanol extract, water extract, and n-butanol extract of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> have good antiviral activity, and it is found that the main active constituents are flavonoids and water-soluble phenolic acids. 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2010)</xref> tested the effect of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> extract against herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) in vitro by MTT, and it was found that its ethanol extract and ethanol elution part of D101 macroporous resin had significant antiviral effect, which was similar to positive control drug acyclovir (ACV), and the virus inhibition rates were 78.10%, 75.2%, and 81.6%, respectively; taking rutin as the standard reference substance, the content of active extract was determined by aluminum nitrate complexation spectrophotometry, and the results showed that the content of flavonoids was more than 80%. Through further experimental studies, it was found that the flavonoids of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> had a strong inhibitory effect on the replication and intercellular transmission of HSV-1 virus (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2011</xref>), and could significantly prolong the survival time and improve the survival rate of mice with encephalitis induced by HSV-1 infection (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). It is an effective method for the treatment of recurrent HSV-1 infection. However, it remains to be further studied on how the active components enter the cell and through what mechanism to block the virus infection and inhibit the replication of the virus.
