<p>It was found that the ethanol extract had a significant inhibitory effect on xylene-induced auricle swelling in mice, with an inhibition rate of 81.67%, while that of aspirin, a positive control drug, was only 61.83%. The swelling inhibition rates of ethyl acetate and n-butanol isolated part from the 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> ethanol extract on mouse auricle were 22.39% and 41.47%, respectively, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory active components were lost or not effectively separated in the separation process of ethanol extract, and the separation and extraction process needs to be further optimized (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Long and Li, 2010</xref>) study found that the ethanol extract could significantly inhibit the increase of abdominal capillary permeability induced by acetic acid in mice, and reduce the absorbance (OD value) of mouse peritoneal saline washing solution at 590 nm. In addition, ethanol extract could significantly reduce the contents of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> and MDA in serum and inflammatory tissue of rats with toe swelling induced by carrageenan. It is suggested that the anti-inflammatory mechanism of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> may be related to the decrease of the content of PGE
 <sub>2</sub> in inflammatory tissue and the inhibition of lipid peroxidation.
