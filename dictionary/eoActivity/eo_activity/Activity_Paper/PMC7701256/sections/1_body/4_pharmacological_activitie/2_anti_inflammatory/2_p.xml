<p>In the study of 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Zhang Q. et al. (2012)</xref>, it was found that a drug with 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> as the main component, named GBG, was effective in the treatment of pelvic inflammation in rats caused by plastic tube insertion into the uterus, reducing endometrial congestion and edema, reducing the rate of uterine swelling, and improving pathological damage such as uterine adhesion occlusion, epithelial cell degeneration, and necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. In addition, GBG can also significantly inhibit the local tissue swelling of mice caused by a variety of inflammatory substances and the formation of granulation tissue in rats, and reduce the inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner (
