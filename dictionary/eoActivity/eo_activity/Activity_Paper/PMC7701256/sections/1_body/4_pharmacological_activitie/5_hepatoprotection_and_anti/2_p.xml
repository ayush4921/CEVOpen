<p>In addition to the hepatoprotective effect, the total flavonoid extract of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> also showed significant anti-fibrosis activity (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cao, 2012</xref>) and had a good antagonistic effect on rat liver fibrosis induced by DMN (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Guo and Shan, 2012</xref>). After the intervention of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> total flavonoid extract, the contents of serum HA, LN, PC III, IV-C, and other pathological indexes of liver fibrosis decreased, the degree of proliferation of hoof tissue in liver tissue decreased, the distribution of collagen decreased, and the degree of inflammation and fibrosis of liver tissue were greatly improved (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>); the mechanism is related to the fact that the flavonoid extract of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> can inhibit the expression of TGF- β1, prevent the activation of HSC into fibroblasts, inhibit the synthesis of extracellular matrix ECM, and promote its degradation (
