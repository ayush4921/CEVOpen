<p>The water extract of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> has certain inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli in vitro, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is 0.031 g/mL, 0.25 g/mL,0.063 g/mL, 0.125 g/mL, and 0.063 g/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2008</xref>). After further study, it was found that the bacteriostatic effect of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> organic solvent extract was better than that of water extract; through the study on the antibacterial activity of petroleum ether extract, ethyl acetate extract, and n-butanol extract of the 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> ethanol extract, it was found that ethyl acetate had the strongest antibacterial activity and had significant bacteriostatic effect on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, and other pathogens (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2008</xref>). N-butanol extract can inhibit Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and while petroleum ether has no inhibitory effect on the above bacteria (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2013</xref>), this may be related to the fact that most of the petroleum ether extracts contain chlorophyll, tannins, and other components, but most of these components have no pharmacological activity. In addition, from the prominent anti-bacterial activity of ethyl acetate and n-butanol extract, it can be inferred that the anti-bacterial components of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> have greater polarity and may be dominated by flavonoids. The bacteriostatic experimental studies on 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> are all in vitro, and only the anti-bacterial activity of the crude extract was evaluated, but it is not clear which compound is the main anti-bacterial component. The bacteriostatic experiment of 
 <italic>P. perfoliatum</italic> in vivo has not been reported.
