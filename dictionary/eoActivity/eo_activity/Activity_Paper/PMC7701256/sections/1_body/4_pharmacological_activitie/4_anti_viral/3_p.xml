 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Wang (2009)</xref> reported that the water-soluble phenolic acids in PEE are the main active substances against hepatitis B virus (HBV), which can significantly inhibit the secretion of antigen (HBeAg) by HepG22.2.15 cells. The inhibition rate at non-toxic concentration can reach 74.02 Â±11.43%, and the treatment index TI &gt; 2.0, which is a low-toxic and efficient drug. Most of the anti-HBV active constituents are concentrated in n-butanol and water parts and contain common structural unit Gallic acyl groups. The more the number of Gallic acyl groups in the structure, the stronger the anti-HBV activity.
