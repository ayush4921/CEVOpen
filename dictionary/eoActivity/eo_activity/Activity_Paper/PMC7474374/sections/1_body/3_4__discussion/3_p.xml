<p>The latex of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> showed antibacterial activities against the MRSA and CRPA. All latex of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> showed the antibacterial activities against MRSA and CRPA in the diffusion method (20.4–23.7 mm and 12–15 mm), MIC (0.19–6.25% and 25%), MBC (0.39–12.5% and 50%). These results are following the research report by Hernandez-Hernandez [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that the latex of 
 <italic>Jatropha neopauciflora</italic> Pax demonstrated inhibition against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. In another study, the latex of 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> displayed potent antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Phytochemical screening of latex showed the presence of flavonoids. These flavonoid compounds have been reported to be used by plants for protection against bacteria and are responsible for antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The latex of 
 <italic>J. curcas</italic>, 
 <italic>J. gossypilofia</italic> Linn., and 
 <italic>J. multifida</italic> has the potential to be developed as anti-MDR-bacterial agents, especially against MRSA and CRPA strain, but further in vivo research is still needed to explicate on the effects.
