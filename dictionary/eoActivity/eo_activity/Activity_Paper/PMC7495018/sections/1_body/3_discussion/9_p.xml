<p id="p0225">Diarrhea is one of the most common infectious diseases prevalent mainly among poor communities [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Castor oil-induced diarrheal test is a widely employed experiment where castor oil works by changing the permeability of the intestinal mucosal membrane to electrolytes and water and thus produces diarrhea [
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The antidiarrheal activity of plant extract is often attributed to the presence of tannins that form protein tannate to denature proteins. It creates resistance in the intestinal mucosa which reduces secretion [

Rajabhau et al. found 29.76% and 70.23% protection against diarrhea at the 250 and 500 mg/kg body weight dose respectively by ethanolic extract of

 <italic>Lagerstroemia speciosa</italic> showed significant antidiarrheal activity [

 <italic>Lagerstroemia speciosa</italic> at the dose of 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight exhibited a reduction of diarrheal feces by 32.75% and 51.72% [
