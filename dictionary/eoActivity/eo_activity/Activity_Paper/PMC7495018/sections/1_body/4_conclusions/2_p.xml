<p id="p0235">Our present study revealed that the flowers from all of the three selected plants are rich in phytochemicals. The study also revealed the potential bioactivities of the methanolic extracts of three flowers. DrFME showed good thrombolytic and anticoagulant activity, CfFME showed good analgesic activity and LsFME showed good antioxidant, antihelminthic, antidiarrheal, and antihyperglycemic activity. There are previous reports of utilizing different plant parts of these plants while the use of flowers were less focused. Our study not only explored the potential medicinal properties of these flowers but also indicates that flowers can also be a source for compounds with potential pharmacological properties. It can be said that these flowers hold promises for their future utilization in a more elaborated and targeted way. The present study is a baseline foundation for the exploration of eficacy of the flower extracts. The toxicity and safety of the extracts should be evaluated in future endevours. Further investigations should be directed at the isolation and characterization of specific compounds responsible for specific bioactivity in the background of the elucidation of their mechanism of action. Moreover, the compounds can be studied elaborately to assess the possibility of developing novel pharmaceutical agents of plant origin to fight against diseases and disorders.</p>
