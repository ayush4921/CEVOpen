<p id="p0115">The hemolytic assay was conducted according to the method described previously with slight modification [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Five mL of blood was centrifuged immediately after collection. The plasma was discarded and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-pH 7.4) by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The cell suspension was prepared by finally diluting the pellet to 0.5% in PBS. A volume of 2.0 mL of the cell suspension was mixed with 2.0 mL of extracts of various concentrations. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 7 min. The free hemoglobin in the supernatants was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. PBS and distilled water were used as minimal and maximal hemolytic controls. The level of percent hemolysis by the extracts was calculated according to the following formula:
 <disp-formula id="ufd2">Hemolysis (%) = (A
  <sub>t</sub>-A
  <sub>n</sub> / A
  <sub>c</sub>-A
  <sub>n</sub>) × 100
 </disp-formula>Where A
 <sub>t</sub> is the absorbance of the test sample; A
 <sub>n</sub> is the absorbance of the minimal hemolytic control (PBS) and A
 <sub>c</sub> is the absorbance of the maximal hemolytic control (distilled water).
