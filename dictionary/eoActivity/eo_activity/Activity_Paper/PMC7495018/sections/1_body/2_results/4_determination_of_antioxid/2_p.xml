 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The extracts showed excellent antioxidant capacity where the highest antioxidant capacity was found for LsFME. The antioxidant capacity can be interpreted as LsFME &gt; DrFME &gt; CfFME (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were obtained where it was found that the LsFME (41.51 μg/mL) has the lowest IC50 value, followed by DrFME (110.5 μg/mL) and CfFME (165.0 μg/mL) (
