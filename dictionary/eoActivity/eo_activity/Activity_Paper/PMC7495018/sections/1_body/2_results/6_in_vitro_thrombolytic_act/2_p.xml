<p id="p0160">The thrombolytic activity was evaluated by measuring the ability of the extracts to lyse blood clots and represented by percent clot lysis (%). The results of the thrombolytic activity are depicted in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. The extracts were utilized at two different concentrations. Among the extracts, the highest thrombolytic activity (35.5%) was found for DrFME at its 10 mg/mL concentration which was followed by 32.2% thrombolytic activity of CfFME at its 10 mg/mL concentration. The thrombolytic activity of DrFME at its 5 mg/mL concentration (27.8%) was higher than the thrombolytic activity shown by the CsFME at its 10 mg/mL concentration (25.2%). In contrast, the positive control streptokinase showed 78.67% clot lysis activity while the negative control distilled water achieved clot lysis to a negligible extent (3.83%).
