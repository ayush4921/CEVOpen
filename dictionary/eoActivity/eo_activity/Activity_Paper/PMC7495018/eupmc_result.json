    "<i>Delonix regia</i> (Bojer ex Hook.) Raf., <i>Cassia fistula</i> L. and <i>Lagerstroemia speciosa</i> L. are three ornamental plants that produce colorful flowers. The present study aimed to evaluate the phytochemicals and bioactivities of methanolic extracts of flowers from <i>Delonix regia</i> (DrFME), <i>Cassia fistula</i> (CfFME), and <i>Lagerstroemia speciosa</i> (LsFME). The presence of ten different chemical classes in varying degrees was confirmed while qualitatively screened. During quantitative determination, LsFME possesses the highest amount of total phenolic (418.0 mg/g), flavonoid (50.8 mg/g), and tannin (256.3 mg/g) contents. The extracts showed excellent antioxidant capacity in a concentration-dependent manner with the lowest IC50 value (41.51 μg/mL) displayed by LsFME. LsFME paralyzed the experimental worms at 2.95 min and killed at 3.96 min. DrFME was found to be more effective in thrombolytic (35.5% clot lysis) and anticoagulant activities. Negligible hemolytic activity (IC50 > 200 μg/mL) found for all extracts which suggest their less potential toxicity. The <i>in vivo</i> experiments revealed that the CfFME has the highest analgesic (64.34% pain inhibition) activity while LsFME has the highest antidiarrheal (70.27% inhibition) and antihyperglycemic (46.94% inhibition) activities at 400 mg/kg of body weight doses. This study has shown the presence of phytochemicals and potential bioactivities which indicates the possibility of these flowers to be used as a source of phytochemicals as well as safe and effective natural medicine."
