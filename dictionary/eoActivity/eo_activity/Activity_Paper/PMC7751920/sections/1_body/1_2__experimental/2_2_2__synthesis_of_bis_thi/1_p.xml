<p>To a solution of hydrazine monohydrate (5.0 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL), a suspension of an appropriate isothiocyanate (5.0 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL) was added dropwise with vigorous stirring and cooling in an ice bath. The mixture was allowed to stand overnight. The solid molecule so formed was filtered and dried, producing thiosemicarbazides as an intermediate product. Terephthalaldehyde (2.0 mmol) and thiosemicarbazide derivatives (4.0 mmol) were stirred into 50 mL of absolute ethanol in the presence of 3 drops of glacial CH
 <sub>3</sub>COOH. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 h. When the reaction was finished, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The solid products so formed were filtered and dried (Scheme 1). They were obtained according to an earlier procedure, with slight changes [25].
