<p>The 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of the compounds were taken in DMSO- 
 <italic>d
  <sub>6</sub>
 </italic> ; the chemical shifts are summarized in Table 5. In the compounds ( 
 <bold>1-9</bold> ), the aromatic C signals of the aryl ring (C1–C6) were observed between 163.4 and 111.4 ppm and those from the terephthalaldehyde ring (C9–C10) were observed between 141.1 and 128.2 ppm. The characteristic -C=N (C8) peaks of imine were observed at 144.1 and 141.0 ppm for all compounds (1–10). The other remarkable characteristic, -C=S (C7) peaks of the thiosemicarbazone region, were observed at 178.1 and 175.6 ppm for all compounds ( 
 <bold>1-10</bold> ). In compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> , the methoxy carbon atoms (–OCH
 <sub>3</sub>) resonated at 56.4 and 56.1 ppm. For compound 
 <bold>8</bold> , the methylene carbon signal was detected at 47.1 ppm. In compound 
 <bold>9</bold> , the methylene carbon signals (Ar-CH
 <sub>2</sub> and -CH
 <sub>2</sub>–N) were detected at 35.3 and 45.5 ppm. For compound 
 <bold>10</bold> , the aliphatic C signals of the cyclic ring (C1–C6) were observed between 53.1 and 25.4 ppm. Furthermore, in compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> , 
 <bold>6</bold> , and 
 <bold>7</bold> , the C atoms (for C1–C6) were also split into doublets caused by interacting with the atomic nucleus of F. Additionally, in compounds 
 <bold>1-7</bold> , the signals of the carbon were shifted downfield (high values of δ) relative to the signal of benzene (128.5 ppm) due to the presence of the 2–OCH
 <sub>3</sub> (152.1 ppm), 3–OCH
 <sub>3</sub> (159.8 ppm), 4–NO
 <sub>2</sub> (145.9 ppm), 3–Cl (143.2 ppm), 2–F (159.0 ppm), 3–F (163.4 ppm), and 4–F (161.4 ppm) atoms/groups (see Supplementary information).
