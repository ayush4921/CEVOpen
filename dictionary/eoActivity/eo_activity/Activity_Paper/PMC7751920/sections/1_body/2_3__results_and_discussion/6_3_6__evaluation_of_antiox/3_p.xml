<p>In view of this information, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> , possessing a nitro group ( 
 <italic>p</italic> –NO
 <sub>2</sub>) which had strong electronwithdrawing through inductive effect, showed the strongest antioxidant activity against the DPPH radical amongst all test molecules. The reason is that the electron-withdrawing groups reduce the bond strength between nitrogen and hydrogen atoms, thus decreasing electron density in the structure, which causes easier loss of the hydrogen atom. In a previous study, compounds containing nitro groups, which draw electrons on the ring, showed much higher antioxidant activity than various substituted structures [10]. At the same time, experimental results on halogens showed different activities depending on their position according to the –NH. Antioxidant activity order was 
 <bold>4</bold> ( 
 <italic>m</italic> –Cl) &gt; 
 <bold>5</bold> ( 
 <italic>o</italic> –F) &gt; 
 <bold>7</bold> ( 
 <italic>p</italic> –F) &gt; 
 <bold>6</bold> ( 
 <italic>m</italic> –F). In similar studies, antioxidant activity among the halogen-containing compounds was –Cl &gt; –F [8,43,44]. As for the effect of each position of the fluorine atom, 
 <italic>o</italic> –F and 
 <italic>p</italic> –F substituents have a strong inductive electron-attracting effect which causes easier hydrogen atom loss, whereas 
 <italic>m</italic> –F substituent has poor inductive effect.
