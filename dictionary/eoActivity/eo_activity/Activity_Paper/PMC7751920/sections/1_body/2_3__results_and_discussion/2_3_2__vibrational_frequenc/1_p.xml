<p>In the FT-IR spectra, the signal of the aldehyde group (-CHO, 2 bands) of the starting material was not observed at 2780–2660 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, the symmetric and asymmetric stretching peaks of the amino group (-NH
 <sub>2</sub>) did not show at 3520–3250 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>. Instead, new vibrations for the –C=N stretching peaks of imine group were observed at 1599–1522 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>. These results indicated a successful reaction, as expected. For the synthesized compounds (1–10), the amine group (–NH) vibration peaks were observed at 3368–3269 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>, the –C=S signals of the thiosemicarbazone region were observed at 1462–1409 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>, and the -C–N group vibrations were observed at 1222–1152 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>. The other considerable vibrations were in the spectrum of compounds 
 <bold>1-10</bold> resulting from the –C-O, –NO
 <sub>2</sub>, Ar–Cl, Ar–F, and –CH
 <sub>2</sub>, functions, respectively. The -C–O stretching vibrations of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were observed at 1045 and 1048 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>. The nitro group (–NO
 <sub>2</sub>) stretching peaks were observed at around 1508 and 1317 cm
 <sup>-1</sup> for compound 
 <bold>3</bold> . The Ar–Cl vibration signal of compound 4 was observed at 767 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>. For compounds 
 <bold>5-7</bold> , Ar–F vibration signals were observed at 940, 932, and 936 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively. In the literature, Ar–Cl and Ar–F vibration peaks were observed at around 811–856 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>, 900–1038 cm
 <sup>-1</sup>, respectively [10,28].
