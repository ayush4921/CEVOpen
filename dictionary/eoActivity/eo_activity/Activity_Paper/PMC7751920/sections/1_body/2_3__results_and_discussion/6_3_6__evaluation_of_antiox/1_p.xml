<p>Antioxidant activity of all of the molecules was determined according to a reported procedure [26,27] as described in the experimental literature, with minor modifications. It can be assumed that the hydrogen losing capacities/abilities or structurally stable radical creation after the interaction of the compounds with DPPH free radicals is related to the antioxidant activity of the molecule being studied [36]. Percentage inhibition changes of ascorbic acid and synthesized molecules are given in Figure 5. All compounds followed a steadily increasing sequence depending on the concentration. The synthesized molecules produced lower free radical scavenging at all concentration ranges compared to ascorbic acid.</p>
