<p>There is no ultimate cure for HSV, but the current strategies are mainly focused on symptomatic relief. Both innate and adaptive immune systems can control HSV infections. In fact, the nature of HSV infection is dependent upon how the virus bypasses the host innate immune system. In the current system of practice, antiviral drugs are classified as virucidal, immunomodulators, and chemotherapeutic agents [

Even though these drugs are in practice, they can fail to meet the treatment expectation via either unwanted drug side effects or drug resistance to nucleoside analogues via mutation. Therefore, clinicians and microbiologists are always looking for a better alternative.
