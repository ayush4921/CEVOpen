<p>HIV is a member of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04878" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. HIV contains two copies of single-strand RNA, which is the contributory agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) by a progressive decline of the immune system. In this condition, the infections take advantage of the weaker immune system, where the immune system is no longer in a stage to fight back. HIV is an enveloped positive-sense virus, which is meticulously focused on the immune system by infecting CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [

This T helper cell is the core of the immune system, whereby it handles signal transduction toward the rest of the immune cells and thereby protects the whole system against life-threatening infections and endangering subjects. The first stage of infection is the attachment of HIV to the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> lymphoid cell surface. After the viral capsid enters the cell, reverse transcriptase liberates a positive sense single-stranded RNA, coping it into a complementary DNA. Then, the nuclei of host cells become integrated with the viral RNA. The integrated DNA is then transcribed into RNA in the presence of transcription factors such as NF-kB, which is then spliced into messenger RNA (mRNA) [
