    "<h4>Background: </h4> Guduchi Ghan Vati (aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia) is an essential herbal plant in Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda) that is well documented as an immunomodulator and antimicrobial agent. A recent in silico study found the therapeutic efficacy of Guduchi against SARS-CoV-2. Based on available evidence, we conducted a feasibility study of the safety and efficacy of Guduchi Ghan Vati in asymptomatic patients with covid-19.  Patients and methods: An open label, feasibility trial was conducted on 46 patients in the hospital setting. A single-arm study with no control group and blinding was executed in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. All patients orally received 2 tablets (1000 mg) twice daily for 2 weeks. Clinical parameters were collected at baseline, day 3, day 7 and day 14. Patients were continuously monitored for side effects and adverse reactions during the study period. . <h4>Results:</h4> Out of 46 asymptomatic patients included in the study, 40 completed the 14-day follow-up period. None developed any Covid-19 symptoms after admission to the hospital. On day 3 post-treatment, viral clearance was reported in 16 (32.5%) patients. By the end of D-7, 38 (95%) patients had viral load disappearance. Follow-up at D-14 showed that all participants tested negative. <h4>Conclusion:</h4> In adult patients with asymptomatic Covid-19, Gudhuchi Ghan Vati could be effective. Randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes in patients with Covid-19 are urgently needed to confirm the definite benefit with Ayurveda."
