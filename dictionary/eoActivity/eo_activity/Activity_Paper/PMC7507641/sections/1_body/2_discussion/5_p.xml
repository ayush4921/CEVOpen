<p id="Par48">Our results showed specific microbiomes in 27 samples of medicinal licorices. Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples, followed by Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a), which is consistent with the results of Cheng et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] The phylum Proteobacteria, which constitutes the largest and phenotypically most diverse phylogenetic lineage at present [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], is an important group of microorganisms in evolutionary, geological, and environmental terms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Numerous studies have confirmed that Proteobacteria is the main dominant phylum of the endophytic bacterial communities associated with plants ranging from economic crops, such as soybean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] and tomato [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], to ornamental plants, such as peony [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].
