<p id="Par49">Among the 27 samples of medicinal licorices analyzed in this study, unidentified 
 <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic> was the dominant genus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Unidentified
 <italic>-Rhizobiaceae</italic>, which may be non-culturable or not studied, may be a bacterium of potential importance in the endophytic bacterial community of licorice, because of the nitrogen fixation function of rhizobia, which has become a research hotspot in legumes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Wei et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] demonstrated high tolerance to NaCl, pH and temperature in a large number of isolated rhizobia from 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Liu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] showed that inoculation with rhizobia improved the growth of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> and increased the dry weight of the underground rhizome. These studies all showed that beneficial rhizobia coexist with and promote the growth of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza</italic> medicinal licorices. In addition, our results also showed a significant positive correlation between unidentified-
 <italic>Rhizobiaceae</italic> and the content of GIA, GTF and LI (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Although the scope of beneficial and culturable 
 <italic>Rhizobiae</italic> is still unclear at present, this information provides a direction for future research on improving the efficacy of medicinal licorices.
