 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In terms of soil physicochemical factors, GIA and LI had a very significant positive correlation with soil ammonium nitrogen (SAN) (

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), GIA, LI and GTF were very negatively correlated with water content (PWC), total potassium (PTK) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> a, b, c) and crude fiber (CF). In addition, GTF also showed a very significant negative correlation with total phosphorus (PTP) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d). There was a significant relationship between leaf nutrients and a small number of variables. Specifically, PWC was positively correlated with SNN, but negatively correlated with SAN; organic carbon (POC) was positively correlated with soil total potassium (STK); total nitrogen (PTN) was positively correlated with POC; total phosphorus (PTP) was very positively correlated with SNN, TS and PTN; PTK was very positively correlated with SNN, TS, PWC, PTN and PTP, but negatively correlated with SAN; CF was very positively correlated with PWC and PTK.
