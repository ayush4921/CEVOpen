<p id="Par34">In 27 samples, a total of 1,979,531 effective sequences were obtained after quality control. The sequencing results for each sample are listed in Supplementary Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>. The effective sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% identity, and a total of 2432 OTUs were obtained. The rarefaction curves were normalized to the lowest number of sequences, showed that the number of OTU in each sample increased gradually with quantity of sequence, thus confirming that the amount of sequencing data is adequate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). According to the OTUs, 28 phyla, 45 classes, 106 orders, 216 families, 508 genera and 313 species were annotated. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a shows the 10 bacterial phyla with the greatest abundance in the bacterial community in the roots of medicinal licorices. Proteobacteria dominated the observed sequences at the phylum level, representing 79.917, 64.420, 80.265, 82.848, 65.733, 87.886, 64.544, 75.024 and 85.847% of the total number of species in E.W, R.W, S.W, E.D, R.D, S.D., E.G, R.G and S.G, respectively. In addition, Actinobacteria occupied a large part of the relative abundance in E.G (18.960%) and R.D (22.171%), respectively. In addition, the abundance of Bacteroidetes was high in the R.W, accounting for 19.742%; the abundance of Firmicutes was also high in the R.G, E.G and R.W samples, accounting for 8.735, 7.466 and 6.287%, respectively (Fig.
