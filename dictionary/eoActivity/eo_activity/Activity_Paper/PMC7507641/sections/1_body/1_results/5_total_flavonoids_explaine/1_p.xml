<p id="Par43">Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) based on the Bray–Curtis distance showed that the bioactive compounds, soil physicochemical and leaf nutrient components had significant effects on the endophytic bacterial community in the roots of medicinal licorices (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Specifically, the contents of GIA, GTF, and LI all had a significant effect on the endophytic bacterial community in the roots (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Among them, the content of GTF explained the difference in the composition and distribution of endophytic bacterial communities in the roots of cultivated medicinal liquorices to the greatest extent (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Among the soil environment factors, TS of soil was identified as the factor that most significantly affects the endophytic bacterial community, followed by SAN and SNN. Among the leaf nutrients factors, PWC was identified as the factor that most significantly affects the endophytic bacterial composition, followed by PTK and PTP. In addition, Mantel tests revealed that the combination of medicinal components is the environmental factor with the greatest correlation with the endophytic bacterial community, indicating that the combination has the greatest impact on the microbial community (

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.008) (Supplementary Table S
