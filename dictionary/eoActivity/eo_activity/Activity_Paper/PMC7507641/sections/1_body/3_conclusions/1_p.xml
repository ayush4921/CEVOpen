<p id="Par52">In this study, numerous endophytic bacteria communities were detected in the roots of medicinal licorices based on high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, we identified significant differences in the relative abundance of some endophytic bacteria among plant species and growing year. Furthermore, the contents of glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin and total flavonoids in the roots of medicinal licorices increased significantly with the main effect planting year, and the total flavonoid content shown to explain the differences in the composition and distribution of endophytic bacteria community to the greatest extent.</p>
