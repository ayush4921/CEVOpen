<p id="Par31">Currently, there is little information about the composition of endophytic bacterial communities in the roots of medicinal licorices at different times in the planting year, and the factors influencing the community structure are not clear. Furthermore, the factors influencing the content of bioactive compounds of medicinal licorices also remain to be elucidated. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a three-year licorice planting experiment in the field and used Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology to detect the composition and diversity of the endophytic bacterial community of medicinal licorice roots to explore the factors affecting the accumulation of bioactive compounds and the structure of the endophytic bacterial community.</p>
