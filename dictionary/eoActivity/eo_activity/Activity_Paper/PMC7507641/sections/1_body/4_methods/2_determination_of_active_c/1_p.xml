<p id="Par54">The root samples were dried at 60 °C for 72 h to constant weight (it has been confirmed that glycyrrhizic acid (GIA) and liquiritin (LI) do not decompose at this temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]). The dried root samples were ground to a powder with a pestle and mortar and passed through a 60 mesh sieve. An aliquot (0.2 g) of powdered root sample was extracted with 71% chromatographic methanol in an ultrasonic bath (250 W, 40 kHz) at room temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The extract was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was filtered (0.22-μm pore size) (Agilent, USA). The GIA and LI contents in the dried root samples (0.2 g) of the medicinal licorices were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Agilent-1260 Infinity, USA) using an Agilent ZORBAX SB-C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) with mobile phase (chromatographic methanol: ultra-pure water: 36% glacial acetic acid = 71:28:1) and mobile phase (acetonitrile:0.5% glacial acetic acid = 1:4) respectively, and a gradient elution flow rate of 1.0 mL•min-1. GIA and LI were detected at 254 nm and 276 nm, respectively. The injection volume was 5 μL and the column temperature was 30 °C. The GIA and LI reference materials (CAS#1405-86-3 and CAS#551–15-5, respectively) were purchased from Solarbio and used for calibration purposes. The total flavonoid content (GTF) in medicinal licorices was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at 334 nm with the LI standard (CAS#551–15-5) as the control.
