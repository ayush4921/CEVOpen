<p id="Par53">In May 2016, the seeds of three species of medicinal licorices (
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza inflata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>) were purchased from Xinjiang Beiling licorice Technology Co., Ltd. (Xinjiang, China), and were sown in the south of Yanqi County (86°17′33″ E, 42°11′34″ N), Xinjiang, China. There were nine separate sample plots (4 × 4 m per plot, 3 plots × 3 replicates for each species of licorices). The fields were ploughed each year before sowing and each sample plot was harrowed to 20 cm. The licorice plant seeds were watered immediately after sowing, in the middle growth period and at the stage of maturity. Seeds were sown in this way every year for 3 years. Details of the temperature, rainfall and soil factors during the experimental period are shown in Supplementary Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Field sampling was conducted in August 2017, August 2018 and August 2019, when liquorice roots and rhizosphere soil (depth 0–40 cm) were collected. To ensure that the experiment was representative, three well-grown licorice roots were randomly selected and cut out with sterile scissors. Each root was divided into two parts: one part was placed into a ziplocked bag for the determination of the bioactive compounds in the root, while the other part was placed into a sterile bag and quickly transported on a piece of ice to the laboratory. To eliminate the interference of other microorganisms, the surface of roots was sterilized in the laboratory by first rinsing soil from the roots under running water followed by washing with sterile distilled water. The roots were then soaked in 75% alcohol for 30 s for surface disinfection, then washed five times with sterile distilled water before soaking in 5% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min. Finally the roots were washed five times with sterile distilled water and air-dried under sterile conditions. To confirm that the surface sterilization process was successful, the last rinse solution was inoculated onto a Luria–Bertani (LB) medium and cultured at 28 °C for 72 h. No bacterial growth confirmed that the surface sterilization was successful. All root samples were immediately placed on ice and then stored at liquid nitrogen prior to total DNA extraction. Soil samples from the rhizosphere were air-dried and sieved through a 2-mm mesh. The following soil physicochemical characteristics were analyzed according to the methods described by the Bao et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]: The content of organic matter (SOM) was determined by external heating with potassium dichromate. The total nitrogen (STN) content was determined using the perchloric acid-sulfuric acid digestion method. The total phosphorus (STP) content was determined by acid digestion (molybdenum-antimony colorimetry). The total potassium (STK) content was determined by acid digestion (atomic absorption spectrometry). The total salt (TS) content was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. Nitrate nitrogen (SNN) and ammonium nitrogen (SAN) contents were analyzed using 0.01 M calcium chloride extraction. In addition, leaf samples, were air-dried to constant weight, ground to a powder using a pestle and mortar and passed through a 60-mesh sieve. The following plant nutritional components were then analyzed: The content of organic carbon (POC) was determined by external heating with potassium dichromate. Water content (PWC) was determined by weighing. The total nitrogen (PTN) content was determined using the perchloric acid-sulfuric acid digestion method. The total phosphorus (PTP) content was determined by acid digestion (molybdenum-antimony colorimetry method). The total potassium (PTK) content was determined by acid digestion (atomic absorption spectrometry). The crude fiber (CF) content was determined using the acid-base detergent method. All the samples were labeled by combination with letters and numbers, with the first letter representing the age of the medicinal licorices (E, R and S: years 1, 2, and 3, respectively), the second letter representing the species (W, G and D: 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, and 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza inflata</italic>, respectively), and the third number representing the replicate number. For example, E.W.3 represents the third repetition of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> in the first year.
