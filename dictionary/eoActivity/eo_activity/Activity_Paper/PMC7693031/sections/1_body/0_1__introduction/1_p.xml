<p>Plant antioxidants are a natural reservoir of bioactive compounds. They play important roles in plant acclimation and adaptation to environmental challenges, but are also beneficial for human health. As sedentary organisms, plants cannot escape from environmental challenges, originating from natural origin (e.g., temperature, water availability, soil composition, pests…) or from anthropogenic practices (e.g., destruction of habitats, pollution…). Diverse abiotic factors, like pollution as well as nutrient deficiency, temperature regimes (heat/cold), water supply (drought/flooding), light intensity, day/night rhythms, and radiation, modify the balance between production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce a phenomenon well known as oxidative stress [
