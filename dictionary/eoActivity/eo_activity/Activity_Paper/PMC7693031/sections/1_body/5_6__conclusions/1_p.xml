<p>Cuba holds an extremely rich endemic plant biodiversity. This wealth in diversity is currently underexplored in terms of antioxidants and bioactive compounds mainly residing in plant secondary metabolites. This group of antioxidant phytochemicals is characterized by an enormous chemical diversity, which represents a gold mine of information both on the evolutionary adaptation to harsh environmental conditions and on the nutraceutical or pharmaceutical value of these plant species. Therefore, increased scientific attention for this research field is of utmost importance, not only to gain more knowledge on known antioxidant compounds, but also to discover new natural antioxidants. Subsequently, this can guarantee economically valuable products for human health. Biofortification strategies aiming to improve the nutraceutical and/or pharmaceutical value of plants will offer the opportunity to develop new enriched plant-derived foods and products. These could be useful either in the maintenance of human health or in the prevention or treatment of human pathologies. In addition, an immediate, increased scientific exploration of the antioxidant potential is needed as many Cuban endemic species are in danger of extinction. Integrating this scientific knowledge into ex situ valorization strategies emphasizes the need for in situ conservation of local species, which obviously requires incorporation in future nature management policies.</p>
