<p>Similar to enhanced germination performance, improved production of plants with medicinal interest that are traditionally used by the Cuban population is of utmost importance. For example, 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> (rosemary) was removed from the National Formulary of Phytopharmaceuticals of the National Health System, due to the lack of availability of the raw plant material. Therefore, several studies were carried out to evaluate the effects of MF-treated irrigation water on the production of this species. Growing 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> under different magnetic induction regimes improved morphological traits such as stem and root length, as well as leaf area [

For a better understanding of the effects of MF-treated irrigation water on plant growth and development, the elemental composition in these plants grown under optimal magnetic induction was determined and a significant increase in calcium, potassium and magnesium was observed. Furthermore, an increase in qualitative nutritional and pharmaceutical properties was observed in MF-irrigated plants. Investigating the monoterpene metabolites in hexanolic extracts of 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> L. revealed the presence of higher contents of linalol, citral and citronellal in plants irrigated with MF-treated water. The characterization of aqueous extracts highlighted an increase in different antioxidant compounds such as rosmarinic acid, camphor, α-terpineol, verbenone, endo-borneol, bornyl acetate and β-amirin in the plants irrigated with MF-treated water [
