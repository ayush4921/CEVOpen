<p>The production of vegetal foods in developing countries combining high crop productivity with high food nutritional quality, through sustainable agricultural practices, should constitute a substantial part of governmental strategies to safeguard food security. The use of strategies for biofortification of economically valuable crops has gained attention of the research community. The term ‘plant biofortification’ refers to enhancement of bioavailable nutrients and secondary metabolites like antioxidants in tissues of vegetal foods, by using traditional technologies like plant breeding, genetic engineering and plant fertilization [

Nevertheless, crossbreeding techniques are expensive, as well as time-consuming and imprecise, as the process requires successive crosses and back-crosses for several generations. In addition, parents must exhibit high genetic variability and heritability potential of genetic determinants [

On the other hand, use of synthetic chemicals to enhance antioxidant compounds and nutritional quality of fruits and vegetables is discouraged, because of the potential threat to the consumer’s health and the possible deleterious effects on the environment [
