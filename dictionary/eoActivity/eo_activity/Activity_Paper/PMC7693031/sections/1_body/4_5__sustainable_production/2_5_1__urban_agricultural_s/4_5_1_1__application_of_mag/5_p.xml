<p>A species of great agronomic and economic interest is tomato (
 <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic>), which is the second most consumed vegetable worldwide and is especially known for its nutritional benefits [
 <xref rid="B206-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. Tomato plants grown during 120 days and irrigated with MF-treated water using a drip irrigation system demonstrated an improved growth in comparison to control plants. Moreover, optimizing the magnetic induction (strength, duration, frequency) resulted in higher fruit weights. In follow-up experiments, both aqueous and ethanolic extracts were prepared from the tomato fruits to investigate whether applying MF-treated irrigation water affected their nutritional value. An increase in the content of the antioxidant AsA and of the secondary metabolites gallic acid, rutin and quercetin was observed in the extracts from fruits of plants irrigated with MF-treated water. With the use of an optimal magnetic induction, the synthesis of phenols and flavonoids was highly stimulated and the antioxidant properties of tomato fruits were increased. In general, the application of MF-treated irrigation water positively affects the presence of antioxidant compounds in tomato fruits, which can increase their nutritional value [
