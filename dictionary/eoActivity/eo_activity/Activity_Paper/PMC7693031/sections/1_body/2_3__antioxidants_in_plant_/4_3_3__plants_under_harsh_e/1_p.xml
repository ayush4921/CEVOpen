<p>Plants specifically growing in harsh environments are often characterized by increased levels of specific antioxidant compounds. Excellent examples are extremophiles that display an extraordinary ability to withstand unfavorable environmental conditions, such as salinity (halophytes), drought (xerophytes) and metal stress (metallophytes). For instance, the halophyte 
 <italic>Limonium virgatum</italic> was shown to contain high concentrations of polyphenols such as tannins [

 <italic>Anastatica hierochuntica</italic>, an extremophile from the Brassicaceae family displaying increased resistance against heat stress, low nitrogen levels and salt stress, was characterized by increased concentrations of AsA and DHA in comparison to 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The same was observed for 
 <italic>Eutrema salsugineum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B80-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. With regard to metal exposure, concentrations of several non-enzymatic antioxidants including carotenoids, phenolic compounds and AsA were higher in a metalicolous ecotype of 
 <italic>Silene vulgaris</italic>, collected from a metal-contaminated site, in comparison to a non-metalicolous ecotype of the same species originating from a non-contaminated area. Interestingly, the metalicolous ecotype did not display an enhanced tolerance to salinity, highlighting the stress-specificity of plant defense mechanisms [
