<p>The environment of plants is ever-changing and involves variation of natural origin (e.g., circadian rhythm, seasons, temperature, physicochemical soil characteristics, radiation) as well as alterations resulting from anthropogenic activities (e.g., pollution and climate change). Due to their sessile nature, plants are more prone to these environmental challenges and are therefore often subject to stress. This translates into an oxidative challenge characterized by increased ROS production [
 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These ROS play crucial roles in oxidative signaling and, together with other components like plant hormones, initiate an immediate and effective response to ensure plant acclimation and eventually adaptation to a stressful environment [

Nevertheless, increased ROS concentrations can also result in damage to cellular macromolecules such as DNA, proteins and membrane lipids. In order to finetune ROS levels to prevent oxidative damage, but still allowing oxidative signaling, plants possess an extensive antioxidant defense system consisting of enzymatic and non-enzymatic components (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01048-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Major enzymatic antioxidants are superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidases (POD) and members of the redoxin family [

Whereas these are directly involved in ROS detoxification, enzymes of the AsA-GSH cycle [monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR); dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR); glutathione reductase (GR)] and enzymes providing reducing power are important in recycling non-enzymatic antioxidants such as AsA and GSH. Both are important low molecular weight (LMW), water-soluble molecules [
