<p>The Siboney-Juticí Ecological Reserve is located in the southeastern of Cuba, approximately 10 km southeast of the city of Santiago de Cuba [
 <xref rid="B142-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The Reserve’s area is 20.8 km
 <sup>2</sup>. It retains all of its original terrestrial habitats, with coastal and precoastal xeromorphic scrub and semideciduous microphyll forest being the most abundant. In addition, three other habitats are present: mangrove stand, sea-grape woodland, and rocky-coastal vegetation complex. The Reserve has not been altered substantially by human activity. Interestingly, it harbors about 750 plant species including 159 endemics. This means that about 5.0% of Cuba’s total endemic vascular plants thrive on only 0.01% of the country’s surface area. Considering the dry and harsh environmental conditions, combined with the insularity of Cuba, a specific flora evolved with high chemical and pharmacological potentialities.
