<p>The Cuban national market related to nutraceuticals, dietary supplements and cosmeceuticals is at present limited despite the existing regulations to register plant-based medicines. Moreover, this new potential ‘medicinal’ source of products is not only restricted to plant derivatives, but also other natural sources such as edible mushroom and microalgae that are also underexplored and underexploited. Besides the vitamin-rich dietary supplements that are barely available, the 
 <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> nutritional supplements and the aforementioned Vimang
 <sup>®</sup>, represent the best-known functional products commercialized and registered as nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals in Cuba [

 <xref rid="B184-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. Nowadays, many efforts are intended to raise a market based on nutraceuticals and cosmeceuticals taking advantage of the Cuban biodiversity richness, especially when there is an accelerated increase in diseases associated with an inadequate lifestyle and unhealthy diets. Increasing efforts in the isolation and characterization of new secondary metabolites (i.e., polyphenols) from food and plant sources, and its subsequent evaluation and formulation as nutraceutical, food supplement and cosmeceutical presume an interesting assay-guided methodology. This must include not only studies on the design and stability of pharmaceutical formulations but also a well-structured platform for the development of in vitro and in vivo experiments to measure their bioavailability and efficacy, thus guarantying their therapeutic benefits. Cuban plants are natural product factories, housing uncountable new candidates for drugs and novel formulations. Nevertheless, most of the ethnobotanical information supporting the plant curative effects needs to be confirmed by a robust phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological screening platform.
