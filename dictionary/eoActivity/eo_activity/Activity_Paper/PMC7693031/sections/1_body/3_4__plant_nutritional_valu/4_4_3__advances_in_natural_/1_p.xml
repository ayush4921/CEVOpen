Plant-based nutraceuticals, mainly secondary metabolites like polyphenols, have demonstrated to exhibit therapeutic and disease-preventing effects in animal models and human trials. Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, are currently receiving more significant attention because of the underlying relation with oxidative stress [
