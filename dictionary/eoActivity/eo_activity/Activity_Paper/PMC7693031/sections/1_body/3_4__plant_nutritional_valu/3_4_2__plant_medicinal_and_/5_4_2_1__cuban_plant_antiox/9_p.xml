<p>In the case of tamarind, fruits and leaves are edible and can be used in salads, stews and soups [
 <xref rid="B161-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. The nutritional value of tamarind leaves is supported by fat, fiber, carbohydrate and vitamin contents. Bioactive compounds like flavonoids and other polyphenols have been found in the leaves [
 <xref rid="B162-antioxidants-09-01048" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>] with e.g., high levels of total phenols, mainly of the flavonoid type in an ethanolic extract [
