  <title>Appendix A</title>
  <p>A literature search using Cuban publications in journals indexed to Scopus with the keywords ‘antioxidant’ (=antioxida*; anti-oxida*) and ‘plant’ was performed in July 2020 as a basis to perform a VOSviewer analysis. It should be taken into account that there are studies published in Cuban journals that either are not indexed to Scopus or only have been recently. This leads to a certain number of publications being outside the scope of this literature search and therefore not accounted for.</p>
  <p>These publications were imported into VOSviewer (CWTS, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) for bibliometric analysis. A co-occurrence analysis was realized taking all keywords into account presented in the papers, employing the full counting method and considering 10 as the minimum number of occurrences of a keyword. The VOSviewer software visualizes the results as a bubble map (van Eck &amp; Waltman, 2010); two were generated. The first one focussed only on plant-related papers and the second one on antioxidant-related papers.</p>
  <p>For the plant papers, a total of 3056 publications were identified and analysed. From that, a total of 14,741 keywords were reduced to 544 taken into account its number of occurrences (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01048-f0A1">Figure A1</xref>). Topics with high citations included plant extract (272 occurrences), medicinal plant (124 occurrences), chemistry (142 occurrences), antioxidant activity (83 occurrences) and antioxidant (66 occurrences). Of the total number of publications (3056), 94 were specific to endemic species.
  </p>
  <p>The second bubble map was constructed employing 699 publications related to antioxidants. From a total of 6079 keywords, only 258 were represented considering its number of occurrences (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01048-f0A2">Figure A2</xref>). The most cited topics included oxidative stress (232 occurrences), antioxidant activity (242 occurrences), antioxidant (201 occurrences), antioxidants (170 occurrences), lipid-peroxidation (125 occurrences), plant extract (99 occurrences), mangifera indica extract (47 occurrences), mangiferin (45 occurrences) and flavonoids (32 occurrences). Of the total number of publications (699), 9 were specific to endemic species (
