  <p>Effect of SPP on caspase-3 activation in HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>/well) were incubated with SPP (50–500 μg/mL). The cell lysates were incubated at 37 °C with caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-AFC) for 1 h. The fluorescence intensity of the cell lysates was measured to determine the caspase-3 activity. The blank group was used as 0.1% DMSO-treated cells. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of results from three independent experiments (*
