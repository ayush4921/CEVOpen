<p>SPP was, consequently, selected for additional enzymatic experiments in HL-60 leukemia cancer cells, due to its cytotoxicity potential. SPP (50–500 µg/mL) was added to HL-60 cells, followed by incubation for 12, 24, and 48 h. Then, caspase 3 activation was measured according to the levels of Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-8-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Av-DEVD-AFC). The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04800-f002">Figure 2</xref> show that SPP (50 µg/mL) activated caspase 3, increasing the cleaved enzyme level by 2.5- and 4.5-fold after 12 and 24 h, respectively, and the cleaved, activated form of caspase 3 by five-fold compared to the control (
