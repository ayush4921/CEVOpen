<p>The freshly collected plant materials as leaves and stem barks were dried in a hot air oven at 50 °C and then powdered. To prepare the extracts, 1 g of each powdered sample was extracted using 70% ethanol solvent using ultrasonic for three times (100 mL each). The combination extract was filtered and concentrated by complete evaporation in vacuo. The dried extract was then stored at −20 °C. The entire study was conducted using a single batch of each plant extract to avoid batch-to-batch variation and maximize product consistency.</p>
