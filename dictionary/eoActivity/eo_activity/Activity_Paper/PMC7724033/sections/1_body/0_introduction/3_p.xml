<p>An examination of pathological conditions similar to COVID-19 along with the therapeutic approaches that are described in TPM manuscripts could pave the way for designing a series of natural products for the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection and related complications (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Kenari et al., 2018</xref>). The TPM approach includes lifestyle modifications, along with the administration of some medicinal plants to modify the quality and quantity of the four humors from a pathologic situation into the physiologic condition. The main organs affected in COVID-19 are the lung, heart, and kidney (

 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, another approach, which extracts TPM suggestions for the management of the disease is to focus on the natural agents that are specifically recommended as a tonic for these three organs. A “tonic”, e.g. a cardiotonic medicine, in TPM is defined as a medicine by which an ideal condition is provided for the physiological functions of an organ so that it is less vulnerable to the pathological conditions (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Aghili Khorasani, 1771</xref>). This study aims to introduce some of the medicinal plants that TPM claims are effective in the management of symptoms similar to COVID-19 and present current evidence on their efficacy.
