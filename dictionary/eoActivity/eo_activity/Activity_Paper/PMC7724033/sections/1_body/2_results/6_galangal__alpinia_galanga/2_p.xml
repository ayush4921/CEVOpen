<p>Seven diarylheptanoids from lesser galangal (
 <italic>A. officinarum</italic>) have demonstrated significant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral effects on RSV, poliovirus, and measles virus. The lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 5, 3.7, and 6.3 μg/ml against RSV, poliovirus, and measles virus, respectively; however, they were all higher than those of the gold standards, ribavirin and acyclovir (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Konno et al., 2011</xref>). In another study, the antiviral effects of two galangal diarylheptanoids were assessed against several types of influenza virus, one of which showed remarkable activity. The active compound was not only effective 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against all virus types, including oseltamivir-resistant type, but also showed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protective effects on the murine model of influenza. The compound showed a dose-dependent inhibition of viral RNA and antigen expression; while it was ineffective on the viral adsorption or invasion. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition of viral growth by 60 μg/ml of the compound was higher than 20 μg/ml of ribavirin (
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Sawamura et al., 2010</xref>). 1ʹ-Acetoxychavicol acetate, a phenylpropanoid from the greater galangal (
 <italic>A. galanga</italic>) also exhibited anti-influenza activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2 μM (460 ng/ml). This effect was mediated through the inhibition of viral ribonucleoprotein complex nuclear export, an important part of the viral life cycle that controls the transcription and replication (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the compound has demonstrated an inhibitory effect on the nuclear export of HIV-Rev protein. Analysis of the structure-activity relationship revealed that the presence of 10-acetoxyl-20-ene moiety, two acetyl functional groups, along with a 10-S configuration is crucial for its antiviral activity (
