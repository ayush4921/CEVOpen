<p>A recently published molecular docking analysis demonstrated the high inhibitory effects of garlic volatile organosulfur compounds on the invasion of SARS-CoV-2. This effect was mediated through the inhibition of ACE2, a participant in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Allyl disulfide and allyl trisulfide, the major components of garlic essential oil, showed the highest antiviral activity (

Garlic has demonstrated therapeutic activity against the Dengue virus, a member of the Flaviviridae family causing a lethal hemorrhagic fever. Diallyl disulfide, diallyl sulfide, and alliin could decrease the inflammatory markers in infected cells through the inhibition of oxidative damage (

There are several other reports on the antiviral effects of garlic against influenza viruses A and B, rhinovirus, rotavirus, HIV, and viral pneumonia. Most of these investigations date back to more than twenty years ago when current, more precise techniques were not available (
