 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; sage (
 <italic>Salvia officinalis</italic> L.) was widely studied for its therapeutic properties generated by its high polyphenol concentration. In the current study we found a value of 59.14 ± 1.47 mg GAE/g in the sage ethanolic extract which falls within the values reported by several other researchers [

 <xref rid="B38-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; however higher TP values have been reported in the ethanolic extract obtained from the aerial parts of sage collected from the spontaneous Romanian flora [

 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic> L.) samples we recorded a TP concentration of 47.09 ± 1.52 mg GAE/g, value which falls within the literature reported range [
 <xref rid="B40-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, a dependency of TP concentration on the plant variety and the agro-climatic conditions was reported in blueberry [
