<p>However, in certain cases, an antagonistic effect can be recorded when multiple natural compounds are associated; this behavior can be attributed to the presence of inactive compounds in plant extracts that are able to act as growth substrate for bacteria [
 <xref rid="B75-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Nevertheless, antagonistic effects occur much less frequently than synergistic ones, contrary to the older beliefs [
 <xref rid="B76-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In our study, the antibacterial activity of VHC2 product was much weaker compared to VHC1 despite the association of plant extracts with previously documented antimicrobial properties; we can hypothesize that the VHC2 poor antibacterial effect is caused by the antagonistic reactions between components. The antibacterial activities of the final products (powders and beverages), higher in VHC1 than in VHC2, cannot be correlated with their total polyphenolic content; polyphenols have been reported by many sources as antioxidant as well as antibacterial and antifungal active compounds but so far, the scientists have not reached a clear conclusion whether these two effects are related or not. However, numerous plant extracts have exhibited both antioxidant and antibacterial properties because of their high polyphenolic content [
 <xref rid="B77-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] which largely depends on the extraction process. For our two final products the main difference consists in their individual flavonoid percentages; therefore we might assume that the VHC1 product owes its antibacterial effect to the presence of flavonoids which act through the formation of complexes with bacteria and the inhibition of energy metabolism and DNA synthesis [

 <xref rid="B25-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; however, if we compare Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria, one can notice that the antibacterial activity of final products is not specific for either class but rather strain-dependent, the strongest antibacterial effect being exerted on 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. The weakest antibacterial effects were noticed on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mutans strains;</italic> for E. coli strain, this effect may be explained by the presence of an extra outer membrane which may hamper the membrane permeability to the plant extract [
 <xref rid="B78-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Contrary to our results, on other strains of 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> polyphenols exhibited a strong antimicrobial effect by decreasing the bacterial growth and changing their architecture [
 <xref rid="B80-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Therefore, we may conclude that the antimicrobial activity strongly depends on the specific strain used.
