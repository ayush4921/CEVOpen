The selection of the cell types used in our work was made based on the fact that gingival keratinocytes and fibroblasts are among the most abundant resident cells in the oral mucosa which will have a direct contact with our proposed products. Human gingival fibroblasts exhibit a higher ability to induce scarless wound healing compared to human skin fibroblasts, because of the different release of growth factors [
