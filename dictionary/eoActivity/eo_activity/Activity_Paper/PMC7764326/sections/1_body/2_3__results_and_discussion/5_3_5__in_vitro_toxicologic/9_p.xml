<p>The situation changes when the final products are tested on primary dermal and gingival fibroblasts, respectively, when cytotoxic effects were recorded in a dose-dependent manner, dermal cells being more sensitive compared to gingival ones. Similar results were reported by Bullock et al. in 2020 who revealed that oral fibroblasts were more sensitive to external agents than oral keratinocytes [
