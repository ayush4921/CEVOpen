<p>In order to assess the potential cytotoxic effects of the two products (VHC1 and VHC2) against the above-mentioned cell lines, the cells were cultured in 96-well plates (10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and allowed to adhere to the plate until reaching a suitable confluence (24–48 h). Stock solutions were prepared in culture medium (10 mg compound/mL) and the following concentrations were tested for each recipe: 5, 10, 25, and 50 µg/mL (cocoa was used as reference) for 72 h. After 72 h, 20 µL Alamar blue was added and the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C; the absorbance values were read at 570 nm and 600 nm, respectively, by using the xMark Microplate Spectrophotometer, Biorad, 168–1150, Hercules, CA, USA).
