<p>The Cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) method [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] was used in order to establish the antioxidant activity (AC) of the final products. Briefly, 1 mL CuCl
 <sub>2</sub> 0.01 M solution (S.C. Chemical Company S.A., Bucuresti, Romania), was mixed with 1 mL neocuproine (7.5 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> M) (2,9-Dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline) and 1 mL acetate buffer (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The resulting solution was mixed with 1.1 mL alcoholic extract (preparation see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2-foods-09-01844">Section 3.2</xref>) and incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. The solution absorption was measured at 450 nm using an ultraviolet–visible (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer (Analytic Jena Specord 205, Jena, Germany); Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethilcroman-2-carboxylic acid) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used as the reference. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
