<p>Worldwide, cocoa is considered to be a major agricultural product and cocoa-based products are widely used. However, despite the numerous health benefits of cocoa-based products, significant amounts of sugar are added, leading to tooth decay or other severe health problems such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. New natural sweeteners with low calories, similar taste that can also contribute to oral hygiene represents the goal in this particular field of research. This study aims to be an innovative approach in the field of functional foods, by obtaining two vegan, sugar-free hot chocolate, with nutritional, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-cariogenic potential, that can be used as adjuvant and complementary treatment in a healthy diet. Thus, this multipurpose work has taken into consideration the following issues: (i) To obtain a healthy alternative hot chocolate, sweetened with 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic> leaf powder instead of sugar and containing, besides cocoa and carob powders, other plants with high polyphenol content and strong anti-cariogenic activity; (ii) to analyze the raw materials as well as the finished products in terms of: nutritional properties, antioxidant activity, and total/individual polyphenols content; (iii) to assess the final productâ€™s antimicrobial activity against nine microbial strains; (iv) to determine the antioxidant activity and nutritional profile of the finished products; (v) to carry out an in vitro toxicological evaluation of these products; and (vi) to analyze the sensorial profile and consumer acceptance of obtained products.
