<p>The antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of polyphenols extracts from various plants are being increasingly studied by researchers in the field [

 <italic>Ceratonia siliqua</italic>, is frequently used to obtain chocolate-like foods. The carob can be noted for its high content in polyphenols which ensure its antioxidant, antimicrobial, and even anti-tumor effects [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], contains two main glycosides: stevioside (5–10%) and rebaudioside A (2–4%). Steviozide is 110–270 times sweeter than sugar whereas rebaudiozide A is 180–400 times sweeter than sugar. These glycosides do not induce a glycemic response when ingested, so Stevia is considered a “noble molecule,” its leaves can be consumed in their natural state as a sweetener, being needed only a small amount and being considered zero calories or low calories. In addition to its natural sweetening properties, as demonstrated by numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, Stevia presents a plethora of biological activities, such as antihypertensive, antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-carcinogenic, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-viral, anti-fungal, and inmunomodulator [

Regarding the antibacterial activity of Stevia leaves, it was found that they exhibit significant anti-cariogenic and antibacterial activity on several bacterial strains responsible for the formation and development of dental plaque such as

 <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactobacilus acidophilus</italic> [
