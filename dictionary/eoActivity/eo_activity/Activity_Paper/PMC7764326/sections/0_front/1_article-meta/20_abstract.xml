 <p>Increased sugar consumption and unhealthy dietary patterns are key drivers of many preventable diseases that result in disability and death worldwide. However, health awareness has increased over the past decades creating a massive on-going demand for new low/non-caloric natural sweeteners that have a high potential and are safer for consumption than artificial ones. The current study aims to investigate the nutritional properties, in vitro toxicological profile, total/individual polyphenols content, and the antioxidant, anti-cariogenic, and antimicrobial activity of two newly obtained vegan and sugar-free chocolate (VHC1 and VHC2). The energy values for the two finished products were very similar, 408.04 kcal/100 g for VHC1 and 404.68 kcal/100 g for VHC2. Both products, VHC1 and VHC2 present strong antioxidant activities, whereas antimicrobial results show an increased activity for VHC1 compared to VHC2, because of a higher phenolic content. In vitro toxicological evaluation revealed that both samples present a safe toxicological profile, while VHC2 increased cellular turnover of dermal cell lines, highlighting its potential use in skin treatments. The current work underlines the potential use of these vegetal mixtures as sugar-free substitutes for conventional products, as nutraceuticals, as well as topic application in skin care due to antimicrobial and antioxidant effects.</p>
