 <xref rid="plants-10-00069-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) of HPLC-ESI-MS/MS, eight tentative compounds are found in E-Anvi. In which, five compounds can be identified as flavonoids including kaempferol-O-galactopyranoside, genistin, quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, kaempferol 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside, eupatilin. The groups of benzophenones (annulatophenonoside), phenolic glycosides (dihydroferulic acid 4-O-glucuronide), proanthocyanidins (prodelphinidin B6) are also detected.
