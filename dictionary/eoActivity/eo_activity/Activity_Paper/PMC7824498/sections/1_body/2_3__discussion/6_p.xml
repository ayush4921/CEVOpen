<p>In addition to finding out potential therapeutic properties and phytocompounds, the specific direction of developing natural-based drugs is essentially considered to come up with the most effective approach [

One of the critical factors is that natural products must satisfy the safety requirements. In fact, some of them have shown hepatotoxicity with high application dose in clinical trials on humans [

 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Therefore, although numerous plant products have proven their potentials for therapeutic uses, very few of them have been officially registered and widely applied. An effective approach can be addressed such as investigating the biological properties of folk medicines and traditional food stuffs. Ginger shell (

 <xref rid="B64-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This plant species is popularly used with even no clinical data available. However, the overuse of these natural plants also leads to the loss of biodiversity [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Therefore, changing the conventional objects to other available resources, especially problematic invasive species, is a prospective direction. The exploitation of invasive weed for medicinal purposes can simultaneously solve the problems in biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.
