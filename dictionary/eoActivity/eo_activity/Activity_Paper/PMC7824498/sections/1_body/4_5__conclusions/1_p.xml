<p>This is the first investigation of the biological properties of the invasive weed 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> including antioxidants, anti-α-amylase, and anti-tyrosinase abilities, and cytotoxicity against CML cell lines. The results show that the ethyl acetate extract from 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> exhibits the highest antioxidant activity via ABTS, DPPH, reducing power assays, and β-carotene bleaching models. In addition, this extract reveals potential anti-tyrosinase capacity and potent cytotoxicity against K562 and Meg-01 cell lines. Meanwhile, the hexane extract displays strong α-amylase and Meg-01 inhibitory effects. The chemical analysis results indicate that 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> aerial parts are rich in flavonoids, palmitic acid, phytol, and γ-sitosterol, which may principally play a vital role in biological activities of the respective extracts. The finding suggests that 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> is a promising source of antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-tyrosinase, and antitumor agents. Further in vivo and clinical tests should be performed to confirm and develop the natural functional products from 
 <italic>A. virginicus</italic> for pharmaceutical purposes.
