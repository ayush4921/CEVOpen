<p>The process was performed according to the previous report of Tuyen et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Firstly, the combination containing β-carotene (200 μg), chloroform (1 mL), linoleic acid (20 μL), and tween 40 (200 mg), respectively was prepared. The obtained solution was then concentrated under vacuum at 40 °C by a rotary evaporator. Subsequently, fifty milliliters of oxygenated water were slowly mixed and shaken to generate a stable emulsion. The lipid peroxidation inhibition (LPI) was evaluated by adding methanolic sample/or control (500 µg/mL) to the working emulsion (1:8, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) in a total of 225 μL of reaction solution. Similar to anti-radical assay, methanol and BHT were used as controls. The absorbance readings were recorded every 15 min for a total of 13 times at 492 nm. The lipid peroxidation inhibition (LPI) was measured as follows: 
 <disp-formula>LPI (%) = A
  <sub>180</sub>/A
  <sub>0</sub> × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula>A
 <sub>180</sub>: absorbance of reaction at the 180
 <sup>th</sup> min, A
 <sub>0</sub>: absorbance of reaction at the beginning time point.
