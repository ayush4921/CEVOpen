<p>Based on the protocol demonstrated by Elzaawely and Tawata [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-10-00069" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], the discoloration ability of 80 µL of methanolic sample/or control on 40 µL of DPPH solution (0.2 mg/mL) in addition to 80 µL of acetate buffer (0.1 M, pH = 5.5) was observed. The absorbance was read after 20 min of incubation at 25 °C with an avoidance of direct light. The inhibition was recorded as percentage of decreased absorbance over the control at 517 nm.
