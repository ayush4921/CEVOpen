<p>The ABTS radical cation decolorization assay was performed according to the method of Re et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. ABTS radical cation (ABTS

 <sup>+</sup>) produced by reacting 7 mM ABTS solution with 2.45 mM potassium persulphate was diluted with ethanol to an absorbance of 0.6 ∼ 0.7 at 734 nm. The test samples were prepared by 2-fold serial dilution method in ethanol, and their final concentrations were ranged from 0.625 to 40 mg/mL. After the addition of 50 µL of sample solution to 100 µL of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> solution, the absorbance was recorded after 5 min at 734 nm. Tests were carried out in triplicate and ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. Inhibitions of ABTS radical cation, as well as IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, were determined as reported for the DPPH test.
