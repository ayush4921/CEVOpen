<p>For the GC analysis of lipophilic extracts, the temperature was programmed at 40 °C for the first 5 min, increased at a rate of 10 °C/min to 220 °C, held isothermal at 220 °C for 2 min, increased at a rate of 5 °C/min to 280 °C, held isothermal at 280 °C for 5 min, increased at a rate of 5 °C/min to 290 °C, and held isothermal at 290 °C for the next 20 min; The injector temperature was 290 °C and the injected volume was 1 µL. Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with a split ratio of 5:1.</p>
