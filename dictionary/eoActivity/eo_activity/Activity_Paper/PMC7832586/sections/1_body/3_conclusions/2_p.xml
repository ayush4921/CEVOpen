<p>In this study, the chemical composition of aromas and lipophilic extracts of black morel (
 <italic>M. importuna</italic>) grown in China was studied for the first time. We discuss the effect of the drying method (oven and freeze) on the chemical profile of black morel and found that different drying methods would induce the difference in the chemical composition of the black morel. Freeze drying was found to be more favorable than oven drying in holding nutrients and morel smell. Regarding the antioxidant and antimicrobial potentials of lipophilic extracts, only moderate antioxidant activities were shown.
