<p>Aldehydes reveal fresh, floral, and fatty smell, and they were identified from aromas of many common edible mushrooms [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 3-Methyl-butanal (11.49%), a compound with fruity aroma [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and benzene acetaldehyde (24.31%), which imparts floral and honey-like flavor [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], were found to be the major aldehydes in fresh black morel (
 <italic>M. importuna</italic>). Compared with fresh black morel, oven-dried and freeze-dried samples showed a decrease in content for these two compounds, especially freeze-dried samples, which will weaken the fruity and floral smell in turn.
