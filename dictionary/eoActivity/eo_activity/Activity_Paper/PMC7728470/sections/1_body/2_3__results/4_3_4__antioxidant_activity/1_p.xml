<p>The AEE and AME extracts from 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> aerial parts and roots were screened for antioxidant activity at five different concentrations using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) assays to determine free radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) to determine reducing power capacity. The standard antioxidant, i.e., ascorbic acid, was used as the positive control. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> (the concentration of extract or standard that can inhibit 50% of the DPPH or H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> capacity) or EC
 <sub>50</sub> (the concentration of extract or standard that can inhibit 50% of the FRAP capacity) values were determined from regression analysis of a plot of percent inhibition against the extract concentration (
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The results indicate a concentration-dependent increase in antioxidant scavenging activity. A comparison of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) obtained from the DPPH and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> assays for the different extracts and ascorbic acid is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The statistical analysis shows significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between AEE and AME and between the two different plant parts. It may be worth mentioning that in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, a lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the extract means higher free radical scavenging activity. The highest DPPH and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging potency was recorded for the AME from the roots (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.33 ± 1.88 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 39.37 ± 2.59 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively), and the lowest activity was recorded for the AEE from the aerial parts (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 52.17 ± 7.30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 91.22 ± 2.60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL).
