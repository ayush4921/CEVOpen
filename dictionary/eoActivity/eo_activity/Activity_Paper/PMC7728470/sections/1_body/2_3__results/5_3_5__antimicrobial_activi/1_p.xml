<p>An agar well diffusion assay was performed using 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of each 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> extract. The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) show that compared with the standard antimicrobials (ampicillin and nystatin), the four extracts (i.e., R-AME, Ap-AME, R-AEE, and Ap-AEE) exhibit appreciable activity against the tested human pathogens. Interestingly, Ap-AME exhibited broad-spectrum activity (100%) against all of the tested pathogens, with inhibition zones ranging from 12.6 ± 0.17 to 26.5 ± 0.20 mm, followed by Ap-AEE, with inhibition zones ranging from 10.1 ± 0.10 to 23.2 ± 0.17 mm; meanwhile, both root extracts exhibited low activity, with inhibition zones ranging from 7.1 ± 0.15 to 14.8 ± 0.35 mm.
