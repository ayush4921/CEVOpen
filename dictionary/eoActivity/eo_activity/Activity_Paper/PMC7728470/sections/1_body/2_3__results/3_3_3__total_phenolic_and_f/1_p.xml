<p>In this study, the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) of the aqueous ethanol (AEE) and aqueous methanol (AME) extracts of the aerial parts and roots of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> were determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride spectrophotometric methods, respectively. Their values were calculated using the linear equations obtained from the gallic acid calibration curve (
 <italic>y</italic> = 9.6851
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0353, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.99) for TPC and from the quercetin calibration curve (
 <italic>y</italic> = 31.904
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0272, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.99) for TFC. A comparison of the amounts of TPC and TFC in the different extracts of the aerial parts and roots of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The amounts of TPC obtained in the aerial parts and root extracts can be ranked in descending order by their mean values: R-AME &gt; R-AEE &gt; Ap-AME &gt; Ap-AEE. A similar trend was also observed for TFC. The TPC and TFC values were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) different among plant parts and between the extracts (solvents). Both extracts (AEE and AME) of the roots showed significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher amounts of TPC and TFC compared to the aerial parts. Moreover, the AME of the roots contained the highest TPC (87.72 ± 7.75 mg GAE/g) and TFC (25.60 ± 1.57 mg QE/g) compared to those of AEE (83.16 ± 5.34 mg GAE/g and 21.05 ± 2.18 mg QE/g).
