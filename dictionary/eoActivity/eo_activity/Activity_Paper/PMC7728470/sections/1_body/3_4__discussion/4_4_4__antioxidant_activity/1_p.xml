<p>The aerial parts and root extracts of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> were screened for antioxidant activity using the DPPH scavenging, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, and FRAP assays. The results show that all 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> extracts had strong antioxidant activities corresponding to their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values that ranged from 12.33 ± 1.88 to 52.17 ± 7.30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in the DPPH assay and from 39.37 ± 2.59 to 91.22 ± 2.60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> assay, while their EC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 20.82 ± 1.14 to 98.70 ± 2.21 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in the FRAP assay. A lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> or EC
 <sub>50</sub> value corresponds to a higher antioxidant capacity, and according to a previous report, a plant extract with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> or EC
 <sub>50</sub> of &lt;100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL is classified as a strong antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The outcomes herein indicate that the antioxidant potential displayed by the aqueous methanol extract of the roots was the highest. It displayed scavenging activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 12.33 ± 1.88 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in the DPPH and 39.37 ± 2.59 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> assays as well as reducing power capacity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 20.82 ± 1.14 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in the FRAP assay, which were comparable to those displayed by the standard antioxidant, i.e., ascorbic acid (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The present findings are in agreement with those previously reported for 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These appreciable radical scavenging activities of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> could be due to the relatively high TPC and TFC in the roots and aerial parts of this plant. Notably, the plant extracts' phenolic/flavonoid contents were mainly correlated with the plant's antioxidant capacities [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, the strong antioxidant activity observed in the current investigation is in accordance with the high TPC and TFC of the 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> extracts. Owing to its strong antioxidant activity, the use of 
 <italic>Z. spinosa</italic> for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and diabetes has been reported [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].
