<p>The antioxidant capacity of each sample was determined using the FRAP assay, as previously described by Benzie and Strain [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with some modifications. The assay is based on the reduction of the colorless complex of ferric tripyridyltriazine (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-TPTZ) to the blue color complex of ferrous tripyridyltriazine (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>-TPTZ) at low pH by the action of the extracts (antioxidants). Briefly, the fresh working FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 300 mM acetate buffer (pH 3.6) with a solution of 10 mM of TPTZ in 10 mL of a 40 mM HCl and 20 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution at 10 : 1 : 1 (v/v/v). Various concentrations (50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of each plant extract or ascorbic acid were prepared; 1 mL of each was added to 2 mL of the reagent and mixed thoroughly. Then, it was incubated at 37°C for 30 min, and the absorbance at 593 nm was determined using acetate buffer as the blank. A standard curve was plotted using various concentrations of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>.7H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The antioxidant capacity of each extract and the standard, i.e., ascorbic acid, was measured and expressed as 
 <italic>μ</italic>M of the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> equivalent, and the concentration of extract or standard that can inhibit 50% of the FRAP capacity (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) in 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of each plant extract was determined.
