<p>Since ROS are abundant and massively produced in diabetic patients, we aimed to draw a correlation between the inhibition of α-amylase and the FRSA of plant extracts, with the ultimate goals of identifying plant extracts possessing both antioxidant and antidiabetic activity and facilitating the screening process for identifying antidiabetic natural products, preferably those exhibiting both antidiabetic and antioxidant activity. To this end, the FRSA of several plant extracts was assessed using the DPPH assay, while α-amylase inhibition was measured using the DNS assay. 
 <italic>Pelargonium spp., Punica granatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Olea europaea, Rhus coriaria</italic>, 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana,</italic> and 
 <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> plant extracts were found to display some anti-α-amylase activity. An in-depth analysis of possible correlations between FRSA and α-amylase inhibition revealed that the plant extracts which exhibited an FRSA EC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 10 μg/mL showed some degree of enrichment for anti-α-amylase activity (at a 1.7 order of magnitude). These findings are of great importance as they may significantly shorten screening processes, saving both time and money.
