<p>The viability of cells exposed to different concentrations of the plant extracts was assessed using the Cell Proliferation Kit (XTT based) (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). The assay is based on the ability of the metabolically active cells to reduce the amount of applied dye, whose color changes to orange, the intensity of which is proportionate to the number of cells. The intensity of the color was measured with a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 450 nm.</p>
