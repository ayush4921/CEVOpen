<p>α-Amylase inhibitory activity was tested using a standard assay, with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Reaction mixtures containing 20 μL of extracts at different concentrations (8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5 mg/mL), 50 μL phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH = 6.8), and 10 μL of α-amylase (2 U/mL) were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, in 96-well plates. Thereafter, 20 μL of 1% soluble starch (100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 5 min, at 37 °C; the buffer did not include magnesium or calcium and served as the substrate for the reaction. Afterward, 100 μL of DNS color reagent was added, and the mixture was boiled for 10 min, after which the absorbance was measured at 540 nm with a microplate reader. Acarbose was used as a positive control, and each experiment was carried out in quadruplicate. The percentage of α-amylase inhibition was calculated according to Equation (1):
