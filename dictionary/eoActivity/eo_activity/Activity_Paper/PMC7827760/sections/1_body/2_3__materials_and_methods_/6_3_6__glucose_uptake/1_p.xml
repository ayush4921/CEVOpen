<p>Glucose uptake into skeletal muscle is mostly performed via GLUT4, which is recruited from the cytosol to the cell surface, a process that is stimulated by insulin or other antidiabetic molecules [

 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. GLUT4 content on cell surfaces has been documented to be positively correlated with glucose uptake activity in skeletal muscle cells [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. L6-GLUT4myc cells are the only cellular model available for investigating glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation without requiring cell permeabilization or fractionation. Cell-surface GLUT4-myc levels were quantitated using a previously published protocol [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. In brief, rat L6 muscle cell-line cells stably expressing myc-tagged GLUT4 were cultured (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 37 °C) in a complete growth medium composed of α-MEM, 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin. The cells (2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well) were seeded onto 24-well plates and cultured for 24 h, then treated with natural products and plant extracts for 20 h. Next, they were incubated with serum-free medium for 3 h and then treated with 1 µM of insulin (as a positive control) or with plant extracts at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (10 min), incubated with 0.1 M glycine, blocked with 3% (

After that, the cells were washed 5 times with wash buffer and reacted with anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at 4 °C, then washed another 5 times with wash buffer. Following this, 0.2 mL of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated in the dark at RT for 5–10 min, after which 3N hydrochloric acid (HCl) (0.2 mL/well) was added to terminate the reaction. Finally, the absorbance of the supernatants was measured using a Thermo Scientific Varioskan LUX Multimode Microplate Reader at 492 nm.
