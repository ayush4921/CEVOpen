 <xref rid="molecules-26-00317-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows that 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> display particularly high α-amylase inhibition and are as potent as acarbose (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 30 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]). Although the inhibition is clear, little is known about the mechanism by which it occurs. Further studies will shed light on the mechanism and help us to more effectively validate the use of the extract to treat type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, kinetic analyses are crucial to determining the type of inhibition exerted on α-amylase; the pattern of inhibition will suggest whether the active site of the enzyme is directly involved in the mechanism of action. In addition, the plant extract most likely contains some compounds that could serve as substrate analogs that compete for the active site of α-amylase.
