 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00317-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows the ROC plot, of the FRSA-Î±-amylase inhibition correlation model. The enrichment plot illustrates how quickly the active extracts of plants can be identified when they are sorted according to their FRSA. In the enrichment plot, a close-to-perfect curve reflects the high prioritization power of the proposed model.
