<p>These results are consistent with those of studies reporting increased glucose uptake as a result of enhanced GLUT4 levels in L6 cells [

Previous studies have also showed decreased GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in GLUT4 +/âˆ’ heterozygous mice and, as a result, a decrease in glucose uptake in muscle cells and an increase in peripheral insulin resistance, followed by an increase in blood glucose levels [
