<p id="Par45">Stress responses are the most common disease in livestock production activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The livestock production activities, such as purchasing new livestock, moving them into new houses, and changing them from free range to captive, may induce stress responses in livestock. Livestock illnesses, such as fevers and diarrhea, can occur if they do not adapt properly to their new environment. Prevention is the main method to treat stress responses in livestock. The Buyi people make decoctions from the roots of 
 <italic>Sophora tonkinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Mahonia fortunei</italic>, which is then administered orally to prevent stress responses in livestock. Most of the medicinal plants for animals are used by Buyi people to prevent diarrhea and colds, and to improve the immunity of livestock.
