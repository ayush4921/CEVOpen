 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> (56 URs), followed by 
 <italic>Plantago depressa</italic> (54), 
 <italic>Plantago asiatica</italic> (53), 
 <italic>Taraxacum mongolicum</italic> (52), 
 <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> (49),

 <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> (46), and 
 <italic>Benincasa hispida</italic> (45) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Medicinal plants with high URs strengthen the concept that such species are more significant to the local population and useful when sharing traditional knowledge. In this study, 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>officinale</italic> was found to be used to treat the common cold, abdominal pains, coughs, and vomiting in domestic animals. The usage mode of medicinal plant species by one community is different from that of other communities, due to the difference in traditional knowledge [

 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>officinale</italic> were used to antagonize the inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>Pinella pedatisecta</italic> and 
 <italic>Arisaema heterophyllum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The decoction of 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>officinale</italic> tubers was also used for abdominal pain and to enhance body temperatures in the study area [

 <italic>Plantago</italic>, which is known to have more than 200 species, is used extensively all over the world as a promising functional food resource, and for various remedies [
