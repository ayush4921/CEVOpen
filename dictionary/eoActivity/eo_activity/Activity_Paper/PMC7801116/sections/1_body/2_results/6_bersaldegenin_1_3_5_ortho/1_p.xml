<p>After 48 h of treatment the cells with the compound, we estimated cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. The obtained results indicate that bersaldegenin significantly arrested cell cycle in G2/M phase and slightly in S phase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10</xref>). The highest changes in inhibition of G2/M phase were observed for the compound concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/mL. The percentage of the cells in G2/M phase was 41.95 ± 3.48, 41.13 ± 3.11, 34.57 ± 1.42, 24.93 ± 0.84, 23.13 ± 1.09% for 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 μg/mL, respectively. We also observed slightly higher amount of the cells in S phase for the compound concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 μg/mL in comparison to the control. The results were 20.5 ± 1.13 and 20.73 ± 1.96%, respectively.
