<p>To study the effect of the compound on the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in HeLa cells, we treated the cells with different concentrations of the compound (0.1–5.0 µg/mL). The obtained results indicate that bersaldegenin did not significantly affect MMP in living cells. We observed depolarization only in the dead cells after 24 h of incubation. The percentage of depolarized/dead cells was 0.67 ± 0.16, 2.7 ± 0.22, 5.02 ± 0.43, 9.89 ± 0.71, 12.41 ± 0.69% at the compound concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 µg/mL, respectively. After 48 h, the percentage of depolarized/dead cells was comparable to the control. Then, in the amount of depolarized/live cells we observed slight increase (from 0.81 ± 0.24 for the control to 2.51 ± 0.32% for the bersaldegenin concentration of 0.1 µg/mL). After 3 h, we did not observe any changes in decrease in mitochondrial potential in the living and dead cells after treatment with the compound in comparison to the control sample (
