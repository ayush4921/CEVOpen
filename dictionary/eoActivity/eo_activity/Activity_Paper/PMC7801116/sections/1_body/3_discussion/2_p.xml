<p>The antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect of bufadienolides is known, however available data concerning these activities are limited. Han et al. tested a few bufadienolides (hellebrigenin, hellebrigenol, arenobufagin, bufotalin, and bufalin) on human liver cancer cells (HepG2). The results indicated that these compounds have significant antiproliferative effects in a concentration range below 150 ng/mL (Han et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These authors also studied arenobufagin and hellebrigenin on human glioblastoma cell line U-87 (Han et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed in these cells at the compounds concentration of about 20 ng/mL. Furthermore, this effect was not observed in normal cells – mouse primary astrocytes. Another authors showed inhibitory effect of bufalin and cinobufagin on the proliferation of androgen dependent (LNCaP) and independent prostate cancer cell lines (DU145 and PC3) (Yeh et al.
