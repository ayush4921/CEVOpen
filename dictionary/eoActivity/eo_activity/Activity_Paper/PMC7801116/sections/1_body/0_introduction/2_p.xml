<p>The compounds have been used from ancient times as medicines in cardiac dysfunction due to their strong effect on the heart. Nowadays, they are well-known as inhibitors of the Na
 <sup>+</sup>/K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase pump and cause increase in the contractile force of the heart (Kamboj et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Furthermore, they alter myocardial ion balance and increase intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration (Melero et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Schoner &amp; Scheiner-Bobis 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kolodziejczyk-Czepas &amp; Stochmal 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Among other pharmacological properties, bufadienolides have also antiviral, antibacterial, insecticidal, anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities (Kamboj et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Recently, the compounds have been investigated for cytotoxic and anticancer properties in normal and cancer cell lines (Gao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Han et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The results indicate that this group of compounds causes significant inhibition of cell growth, proliferation and induction of cell death. For example, Iguchi et al. isolated bufadienolides from 
 <italic>Helleborus foetidus</italic> L. and showed their cytotoxicity against leukaemia (HL-60) and lung cancer (A549) cell lines (Iguchi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Proscillaridin A revealed antitumor effects on glioblastoma cells, but not on normal cells – astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Berges et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Next, cinobufagin was tested on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The compound inhibited cell growth and triggered apoptosis by affecting the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in the cells (Zhu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Arenobufagin also reduced viability of MCF-7 cells and induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Deng et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
