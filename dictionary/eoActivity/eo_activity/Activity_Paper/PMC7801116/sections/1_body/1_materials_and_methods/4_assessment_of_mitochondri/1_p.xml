<p>HeLa cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well and treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 µg/mL. The concentration of DMSO in a control sample was 0.25% (v/v). After 3 h, 24 h, and 48 h of incubation, the cells were harvested and prepared according with Muse MitoPotential Assay Kit (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) protocol. The amount of depolarized/live/dead cells was determined by Muse Cell Analyzer (Merck Millipore). All the experiments were independently repeated three times.
