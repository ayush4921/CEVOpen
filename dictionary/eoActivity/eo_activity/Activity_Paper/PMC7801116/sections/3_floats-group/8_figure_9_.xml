  <p>Bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate induced phosphorylation of H2A.X in HeLa cells nuclei. DMSO (0.25% v/v, a negative control, A–C) and etoposide (10 μM, a positive control, D–F), and the compound were added to the cells at concentrations of 1.0 (G–I) and 5.0 μg/mL (J–L) for 24 h. (M) and (N) show HeLa nuclei after 6 h of incubation with the bersaldegenin compound at concentrations of 1 μg/mL (M) and 5 μg/mL (N). The nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (A, D, G, J, M, N) and anti-phospho-H2A.X (Ser139) Alexa Fluor 555 conjugate antibody (B, E, H, K, M, N). Arrows indicate γH2A.X foci signals visible in the nuclei. The graph shows the γH2A.X nuclei (%) with high fluorescence signal in the controls and the treated HeLa cells. The experiment was repeated twice. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Significant differences relative to the control are marked with an ‘*’ (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The images were done with a fluorescence microscope at 100× and 630× magnification.
