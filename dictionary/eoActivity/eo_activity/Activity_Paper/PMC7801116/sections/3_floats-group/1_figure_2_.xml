  <p>The RTCA viability profiles of HeLa cells treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate. The cells were treated with the compound in a concentration range of 0.1–20.0 µg/mL for 24 h. DMSO was added to the cells (a control sample) at a concentration of 0.25% (v/v). (A) The profiles of HeLa cells proliferation, (B) IC
   <sub>50</sub> values calculated during 24 h of treatment the cells with the compound. All the profiles were obtained by RTCA software v.1.2.1.
