 <caption>
  <p>The relative activity of caspase-9 in HeLa cells after treatment with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate. The cells were incubated with the compound at concentrations of 0.1–5.0 µg/mL for 1–24 h. The caspase activity was estimated by luminometer and is presented in comparison to the control (0.25% DMSO). Each sample was run in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Significant differences relative to the control are marked with an ‘*’ (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
