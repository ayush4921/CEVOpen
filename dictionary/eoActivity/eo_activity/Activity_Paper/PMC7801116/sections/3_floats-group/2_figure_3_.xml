  <p>The nuclei of HeLa cells stained with Hoechst 33342 dye after 24 h of treatment with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate. (A–D) show the cells under an inverted light microscope, (E–L) – under a fluorescent microscope. The cells were treated with DMSO (0.25%) – a control sample (A, E, I) and the bersaldegenin at concentrations of 0.5 (B, F, J), 1.0 (C, G, K), and 2.0 μg/mL (D, H, L). White arrows indicate Hoechst strongly positive nuclei. The images were done at 100× (A–H) and 400× magnification (I–L), respectively.</p>
