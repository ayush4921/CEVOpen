<p>To elucidate the function of the targets of RA and its role in signal transduction, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, Bioinformatics Resources 6.8, Laboratory of Human Retrovirology and Immunoinformatics (LHRI), Frederick, MD, USA) was used to analyze the GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment of the proteins [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The cellular components involved in the target proteins, molecular functions, biological processes and involved pathways were also described. In this research, the network model of the “Compound- Target-Pathway” interaction was established through Cytoscope 3.2.1 (National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), Bethesda, MD, USA).
