<p>Healthy and limpid fluorescent embryos (German Tubingen strain, purchased from Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University) were singled out at 24 h post-fertilization (hpf), digested with 1 mg/mL trypsin for 10 min at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. Embryos were inoculated into a 96-well microplate (three embryos/well). Meanwhile, 5 μM or 10 µM RA was added to the culture media, and PBS served as the control. Embryos were maintained in a 28.5 °C incubator for an additional 48 h. 72 hpf embryos were plunged into 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 2 h to be fixed, after which they were washed with PBS three times, dehydrated by soaking in 25, 50, 75 and 100% methanol in PBT buffer and gradually rehydrated to 100% PBT. The embryos were then balanced in NTMT buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl at pH 9.5, 50 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature for 0.5 h, and 375 mg NBT and 200 mg BCIP were added per mL NTMT buffer, respectively. After staining for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by adding PBST. The embryos were then plunged into a solution of 5% formamide and 10% hydrogen peroxide in PBS for 30 min. The photos were taken by fluorescence stereomicroscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Image J software was used to quantify the total length of SIVs. The antiangiogenic effect was defined as a reduction in SIVs’ length.
