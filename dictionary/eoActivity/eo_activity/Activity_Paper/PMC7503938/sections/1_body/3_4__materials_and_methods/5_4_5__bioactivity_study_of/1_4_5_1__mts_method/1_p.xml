<p>The in-vitro cytotoxicity test was carried out by MTS method. The SHL-60, MT4, Hela, HepG2, SK-OV-3 and MCF-7 cell lines were obtained from the Kunming Institute of Botany, Kunming, China. The cell suspension (100 μL) was cultured in a 96-well microplate and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The medium was then replaced with solutions of RA (100 μg/mL). After the incubation period, 20 μL MTS Reagent (5 mg/mL) was added to each well, after which the plate was returned to the cell culture incubator for 4 h. The supernatants were removed, and 150 μL DMSO was added to all wells to initiate the colorimetric reaction. The absorbances were measured at 492 nm on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay microplate reader. Two positive compounds, cisplatin (DDP) and Taxol, were used in each experiment.
