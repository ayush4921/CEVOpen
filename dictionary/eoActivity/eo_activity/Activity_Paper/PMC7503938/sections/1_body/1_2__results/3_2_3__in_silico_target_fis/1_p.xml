<p>We employed the computational target fishing methods to predict the most probable target of this RA, and the workflow can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f003">Figure 3</xref>a. Using PharmMapper, we identified a total of 102 potential proteins (fit score &gt; 3) that could be the targets of this RA, and using DARA-CPI we identified 125 potential targets (Z’-score &lt; 0.5) for this RA. There were 18 targets shared by both methods (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03919-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Next, we performed the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analysis for these 18 targets. A total of 20 pathways (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were found to be involved by the targets of this RA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f003">Figure 3</xref>b), including the “rap1 signaling pathway”, “PI3K-Akt signaling pathway”, “proteoglycans in cancer” and “focal adhesion”. We showed, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f003">Figure 3</xref>c, the top 5 terms of the biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions from the GO annotation results (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, “angiogenesis” and “transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinas signaling pathway” were found to be involved by the RA targets. The interaction network of this RA, its targets and potential pathways was visualized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f003">Figure 3</xref>d. We found that 11 targets of this RA had roles in different pathways.
