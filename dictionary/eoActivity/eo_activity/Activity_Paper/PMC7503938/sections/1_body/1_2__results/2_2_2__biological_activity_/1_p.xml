<p>We conducted the in vitro MTS assay to characterize the anti-cancer activities of this RA using some cancer cell lines. It showed that the half inhibitory activities of this RA in the HLâˆ’60, MT4, Hela, HepG2, SK-OV-3 and MCF-7 cells were 37.17%, 97.41%, 81.22%, 34.4%, 32.68% and 51.4% (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f002">Figure 2</xref>b shows the conversion of supercoiled plasmid DNA by calf thymus Topo-I, RA and camptothecin (a well-known Topo I inhibitor, used as a positive control). It was revealed that the RA had the potential of binding to DNA fragments at a 10 mM concentration and that the exhibited inhibitory activities were concentration-dependent. Next, we performed an experiment to evaluate the anti-angiogenesis activity of the RNA in zebrafish embryos. Compared to the control, the length of subintestinal veins (SIVs) significantly decreased in the zebrafish embryos treated with this RA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f002">Figure 2</xref>c,d). The results indicated an inhibitory effect of RA on the angiogenesis of zebrafish embryo. Furthermore, we evaluated the free radical scavenging activity of the RA. It was shown that this RA can serve as an effective scavenger against DPPH and ABTS radicals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f002">Figure 2</xref>e,f). Its scavenging abilities increased steadily with the concentrations. All concentrations of RA had a scavenging effect on the DPPH and ABTS radical. RA possessed the highest scavenging capacity (74.85% and 82.5%) on the DPPH radical and ABTS radical at 2.0 mg/mL, respectively. Its scavenging rate was close to the positive control (BHT) at different concentrations.
