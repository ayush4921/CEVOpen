<p>We found SRC and SYK to be putative targets of the RA isolated in this study (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03919-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Some studies have shown a variety of malignancies characterized by the abnormal activation of SRC or SYK [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. SRC and SYK are associated with cell survival, and their inhibition frequently leads to cell apoptosis, which is considered a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of malignancies [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. We found that SRC and SYK were involved in the protein tyrosine kinase activity, kinase activity and protein kinase activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). Tyrosine kinases are particularly important in the treatment of cancer and play a critical role in the development and progression of many cancers [

RTKs mainly activate the PI3K/protein kinase B, rat sarcoma (RAS)/MAPK signal transducer and downstream effectors of multicellular processes during cancer progression [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We identified 18 targets of the RA that participated in 20 KEGG pathways (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03919-f003">Figure 3</xref>b), some of which were involved in anti-tumor signaling pathways such as metabolic pathways, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and the NF-κB signaling pathway. These results indicated that the RA may exhibit anticarcinogenic effects. Furthermore, SYK is a regulator of mTOR and MAPK signaling in AML, and the inhibition of the PI3K pathway activity enhances the effects of SYK inhibition on AML cell viability and differentiation [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. SRC overexpression acts synergistically on epithelial cell cloning and promotes tumorigenesis, depending on the JNK and PI3K signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-03919" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, we can speculate that RA may influence tumor progression by targeting the expression of PTK (SYK/SRC), inhibiting the activity of RAS and attenuating the PI3K/Akt pathway and NFκB pathway.
