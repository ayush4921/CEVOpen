 <title>Availability of data and materials</title>
 <p>The data extraction form with the extracted data will be made public via osf.io. The full URL will be made available once the scoping review is published. Data used to calculate the time-to-signal will also be made available, since it will be included in the extraction form; the dates of onset of an ADR, or dates of reporting to VigiBase, will be available on request to the corresponding author.</p>
