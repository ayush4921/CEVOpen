<p id="Par58">We shall extract data to compute descriptive statistics in a form created in the Systematic Review Data Repository, adapted to scoping reviews [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Specifically, the tabs we shall use are “Publications” and “Design”. Data to be extracted will be publication year, country of origin, stakeholder, study design, type of evidence, metric for detection (in the case of SDRs), population involved, setting (or database for SDRs), eligibility criteria, possible confounding factors, brand name of the medicinal product(s) (where available) or active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), formulation, considered ADR(s), definition of signal, year of the case report of the suspected ADR that was first transmitted to VigiBase and that relates to the same medicinal product, and ADR in a considered signal and/or of occurrence of the ADR (fields: “FirstDateDatabase” or, if complete, “ReactionStartDate”).
