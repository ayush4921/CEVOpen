<p id="Par66">The complete (dd-mm-yy) date on which an ADR occurred, as stated in reports of ADRs entered in VigiBase, will be used to calculate the time-to-signal, by accounting for the date on which the signal relating to the same combination of medicinal product and the adverse effect was communicated. If the date of occurrence of the ADR is unavailable or incomplete, we shall use the first date on which the report was entered into VigiBase instead (field: UMCCalculated FirstDateDatabase). This field is necessarily complete, and follow-up reports are reconciled to it in VigiBase. For signals communicated by multiple stakeholders, the earliest date of communication will be considered. Depending on available resources, we may calculate the time-to-signal, beginning from the date on which cumulative disproportionality reaches statistical significance for the information component (lower limit of the 95% CI &gt; 0).</p>
