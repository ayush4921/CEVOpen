<p id="Par18">The aims of this scoping review are as follows: (a) to provide an evidence synthesis for decision-making at a regulatory level; (b) to collate signals currently in different platforms; (c) to produce an overview of the types and levels of evidence of studies that support signals; (d) to highlight any differences or similarities in assessment of the evidence used to support signals, with a particular focus on reports of ADRs; and (e) to better understand the delays before signals are detected and to clarify whether they have changed over time.</p>
