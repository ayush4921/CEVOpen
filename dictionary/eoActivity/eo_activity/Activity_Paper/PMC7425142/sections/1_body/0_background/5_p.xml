<p id="Par16">Over several decades of pharmacovigilance, many definitions of signals have been developed and applied, and different types of studies have been used to detect signals, resulting in a complex body of evidence whose breadth has been only partly characterized. Delays to withdrawals have been investigated systematically, while those relating to the time to signal have been limited in scope. Furthermore, while reports of ADRs remain a staple in signal detection, it is unclear to what extent their features (e.g. time to onset, dose-response relationship, positive de-/re-challenge) have been described or contributed to putative causal relationships. This is relevant when one considers that recent data-driven methods to prioritize signals arising from reports of ADRs are based on the quality of information of the reports themselves and a limited set of features, i.e. the presence of a narrative, the geographical distribution of the reports of ADRs, how recently reports of ADRs have been entered into a database, and a numerical measure of data completeness [
