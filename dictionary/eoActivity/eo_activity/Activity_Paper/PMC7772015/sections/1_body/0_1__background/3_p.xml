<p>Antioxidants are known to prevent oxidative stress, thereby treating DM and its complications [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> was confirmed to have well-established in vitro antioxidant activities and had inhibitory concentration, IC50 value of about 18.9 [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], giving hint the plant may have antidiabetic activity. It was screened phytochemically and reported that terpenoides, glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, steroids, phenols, and saponins were most commonly isolated biologically active principles responsible for its medicinal properties [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, the roots of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> have larger amounts of chromium which may be correlated to its use as treatment for DM [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, the present study was performed to determine the antidiabetic activity of the root extract and solvent fraction of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> in mice.
