<p>About 164 g out of 750 g sample was harvested following extraction with an extractive yield of 21.9%. For fractionation, 100 g of methanol crude extract was suspended in a separatory funnel with 400 ml of distilled water. Then, the suspension was shaken by adding 400 ml volume of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. Then, the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane layer so formed was poured into a beaker and labeled as “
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction.” The aqueous remainder was again mixed with same quantity of chloroform and shaken similarly, and the chloroform layer obtained was decanted to a second beaker and labeled as “chloroform fraction” likewise. The remaining aqueous residue was lyophilized to obtain pure aqueous fraction, placed in a third beaker and labeled as “aqueous fraction,” and the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and chloroform fractions were allowed to concentrate in an oven under a temperature set at 40°C. Finally, 12 g hexane and 17 g of chloroform fractions and 2 g of oleaginous jelly matter were obtained with the remaining 69 g being aqueous fraction. All fractions were put in an amber bottle and stored in a fridge till they were going to be used for the experiment.
