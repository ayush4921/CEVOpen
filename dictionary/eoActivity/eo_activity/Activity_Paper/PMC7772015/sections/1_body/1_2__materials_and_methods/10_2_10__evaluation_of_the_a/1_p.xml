<p>Overnight fasted mice were divided into 5 groups (6 mice in each group) at random. Next, group 1 received 10 ml/kg DW; groups 2, 3, and 4 were treated with hydromethanolic root extract of the plant of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg, respectively, whereas group 5 received 5 mg/kg GLC. Following 30 minutes of after crude extracts, standard drugs, and DW administration, each mouse was fed with 2 g/kg solution of 40% glucose in a quantity of 1 ml/kg. Each mouse's BGL was measured prior to treatment (at 0 minute) as baseline, and then, at 1/2 hr, 1 hr, and 2 hr after glucose administration [
