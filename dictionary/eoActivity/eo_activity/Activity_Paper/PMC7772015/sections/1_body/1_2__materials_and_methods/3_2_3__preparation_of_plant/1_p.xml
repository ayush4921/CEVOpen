<p>The dirt and particulate matter was removed from the root of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> by washing rigorously with distilled water. Then, root of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> was dried under shade at room temperature (20–30°C) with most favorable ventilation. The dried roots of the plant were pulverized into coarse powder by an appropriate electrical miller. The coarse powdered roots of the plant were macerated in 80% methanol in a ratio of 750 g of sample material: 7.5 liters of solvent (w/v) separately. Then, the extract was filtered by using gauze followed by Whatman filter paper No. 1. The marc was remacerated two times with fresh solvent (80% methanol), each for 3 days, and the filtrates so obtained from the sequential macerations were allowed to concentrate removing the methanol solvent by a rotavapor followed by drying in an oven with a temperature of not greater than 40°C, and the aqueous part was removed by lyophilization under reduced pressure. Then, the remaining solvent free extract was kept alone in a desiccator till it was used for the study and the fractionation process in case the extract could contain hygroscopic element.
