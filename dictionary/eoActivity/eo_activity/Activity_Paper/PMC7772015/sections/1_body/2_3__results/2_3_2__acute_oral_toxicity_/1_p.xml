<p>In the acute toxicity study of 
 <italic>Ajuga integrifolia</italic> root extract (AIRE) at the limit dose of 2000 mg/kg, mortality of mice and any signs of toxicity (behavioral, neurological, autonomic, or physical changes) did not occur during the first day as well as throughout the course of the study. Thus, the median lethal dose (LD50) of the AIRE can be considered as more than 2000 mg/kg.
