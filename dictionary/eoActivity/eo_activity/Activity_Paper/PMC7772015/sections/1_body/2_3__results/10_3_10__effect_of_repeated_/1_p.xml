<p>Significant increase in bodyweight was not noticed in mice treated with each of the three doses of aqueous fraction of AIRE at 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment compared to their baseline bodyweight in within group comparison (
 <xref rid="tab8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). Comparison within the group showed that the GLC-treated group increased bodyweight only slightly on the 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment. Bodyweight of mice received 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg aqueous fraction but not 100 mg/kg was considerably improved at 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day, with percentage increment of 4.95% and 6.32%, respectively, compared to the baseline. There was no significant change in bodyweight of the normal control compared to its baseline weights.
