<p>The oral glucose tolerance test is a suitable model to measure and evaluate the insulin action and tissues sensitivity to insulin whose pancreatic release is stimulated by ingestion of glucose. It is usually used to detect persons at risk of prediabetes and diabetes [

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Compared to the negative control, 100 mg/kg AIRE did not result in a significant (

 <sup>nd</sup> hr (120 minutes), whereas hyperglycemia was reduced significantly by GLC at the1
 <sup>st</sup> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and 2
 <sup>nd</sup> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) hours. However, AIRE 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg reduced fasting BGL approximately close to baseline and virtually similar to the GLC treated group at 120 minutes. This way modulation of blood glucose is consistent with the reports by Belayneh and Birru [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Anitha et al. [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It was evident that the BGL of mice reached its climax after 30 minutes of administration, and then, it decreased mildly at 60 minutes and reduced nearly to the normal level after 2 hours of glucose administration. The elevation of blood glucose in this pattern and its reduction at these times is consistent with the one reported by Belayneh and Birru [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This blood glucose reduction after 2 hours may be due to the glucose lowering activity of AIRE augmented by metabolic utilization of the already consumed glucose. The increased fasting BGL at 30 minutes can be explained that the glucose oral load was absorbed and reached systemic circulation by this time.
