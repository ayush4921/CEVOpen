<p>Compared to repeated daily doses at 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day, single dose 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg AIRE showed lesser reduction of fasting BGL at 6
 <sup>th</sup> hr and 8
 <sup>th</sup> hr supporting that the repeated daily doses of AIRE have better antidiabetic activity than the single dose. Significant reduction of fasting BGL was noticed following the repeated daily doses of AIRE after the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment compared to both diabetic control and baseline. This finding is almost similar to the antidiabetic activity study reports by Belayneh and Birru [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Variation in fasting BGL was significant in normoglycemic mice at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of the study procedure, but a significant increase in fasting BGL was seen in the diabetic control group compared to normal control and repeated daily extract doses treated groups. Compared to baseline, fasting BGL was reduced by GLC, with percentage reduction of 60.8% and 65.2% after 7
 <sup>th</sup> day and 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of treatment, respectively.
