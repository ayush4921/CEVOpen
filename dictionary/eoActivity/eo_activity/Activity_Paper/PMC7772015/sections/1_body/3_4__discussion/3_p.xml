<p>GLC showed the antihyperglycemic effect in diabetic mice, and literature acknowledged that GLC exerts its effect by selectively blocking the ATP sensitive K
 <sup>+</sup> channels (K
 <sub>ATP</sub>) in the 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells of the pancreas. Then, blockage of KATP results in the influx of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> to cells which, in turn, cause depolarization in the cytosol with subsequent insulin secretion [

 <italic>β</italic>-cells; this indicates that a single dose of STZ at 150 mg/kg could not cause absolute destruction of 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells.
