<p id="Par21">The antibacterial effect of the methanol and chloroform extracts of the samples was assessed with the disk diffusion method utilizing Mueller–Hinton agar [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and investigation of inhibition zones of the extracts. The filter paper discs of 6 mm diameter (Padtan, Iran) were sterilized then impregnated with 25 µL of methanol and chloroform extracts, separately. The sterile impregnated discs were put on the agar surface by the flamed forceps and softly compressed down to ensure perfect contact of the discs with the agar surface. The incubation condition was 37 °C for quality control strains and 27 °C for plant bacteria for 24 h. All trials were performed in triplicate and the results were stated as mean ± SD.
