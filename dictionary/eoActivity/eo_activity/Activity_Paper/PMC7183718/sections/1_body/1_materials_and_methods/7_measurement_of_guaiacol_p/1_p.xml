<p id="Par14">Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activity was studied according to the Upadhyaya et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] method. The reaction combination included phosphate buffer (2.5 mL, 50 mM, pH = 7), H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (1 mL, 1%), guaiacol (1 mL, 1%), and enzyme extracts (20 µL). The absorbance of the reaction mixtures was recorded at 470 nm via spectrophotometer (Biochrom WPA Biowave II UV/Visible), and the increment in absorbance at 470 nm was followed for 1 min. The activity was stated as mmole activity mg
 <sup>−1</sup> protein.
