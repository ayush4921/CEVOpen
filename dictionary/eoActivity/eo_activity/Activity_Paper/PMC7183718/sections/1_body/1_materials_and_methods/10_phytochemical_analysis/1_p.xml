<p id="Par18">Total Phenolic Content (TPC) of the test samples was assayed using Yu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] Folin–Ciocalteu method, utilizing gallic acid as the standard. Briefly, double distilled water (900 µL) was added to the methanolic solution of test samples (100 µL, 100 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). Then, Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (500 µL) was added, followed by the addition of sodium carbonate (1.5 mL, 20%). The volume of the mixture was reached to 10 mL by the distilled water. The mixture was afterward incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After that, the absorbance was assayed via spectrophotometer (Biochrom WPA Biowave II UV/Visible) at 725 nm. The same method was used for the standard solutions of gallic acid. Based on the evaluated absorbance, the concentration of phenolic content was determined from the calibration line. Finally, the total phenolic content of methanol extracts was stated as mg Gallic Acid Equivalents (GAE) g
 <sup>−1</sup> dry matter.
