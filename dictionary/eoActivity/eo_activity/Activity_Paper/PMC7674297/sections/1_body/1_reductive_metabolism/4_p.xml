 <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, used LC-MS/MS method to study pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of curcumin and its metabolites in mice after intravenous administration of curcumin. Reduced metabolite THC (Tetrahydrocurcumin) and DHC (Dihydrocurcumin) were detected in plasma, and THC was present as a major metabolite. Curcumin was present in the Liver, Kidney, and brain, and DHC and THC were detected in the liver and kidney, respectively. This study concluded that only curcumin could cross the blood-brain barrier and may become a worthy prodrug molecule in the research studies related to neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Further, the distribution of curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin in the liver might be playing the role of hepatoprotection, but this needs further studies to get a clearer picture [
