<p id="p0165">The findings mentioned in this review have given a summary of how the polyphenol, curcumin derived from 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> plant gets reduced to several metabolites and their respective therapeutic functions. Metabolites of curcumin exhibit diverse biological and pharmacological activities, many of which are distinct from curcumin. In several cases curcumin metabolites have shown more potency than the bioactivities of curcumin, one recently studied example is of octahydrocurcumin, which has higher antitumor activity than the parent compound curcumin.
