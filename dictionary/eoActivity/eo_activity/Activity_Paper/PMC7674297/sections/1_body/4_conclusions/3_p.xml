<p id="p0170">Reduction of curcumin generates multiple products of curcumin and these products show differential affinity towards number of enzymes and kinases which may be responsible for various pleiotropic effects of curcumin. Reduced metabolites of curcumin have presented therapeutic potential such as antioxidative, anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and antiseptic in diseases like liver disorders, neurological, cancer, cardiovascular and lung diseases. More studies are underway to perform the evaluation of preclinical and clinical effectiveness of the curcumin metabolites against human diseases. In comparison to tetrahydrocurcumin, there have been less research on the dihydrocurcumin, hexahydrocurcumin, octahydrocurcumin detail study of which still need to be explored further for their other therapeutic functions. Curcumin forms oxidized and reduced metabolites both, but in this study we have focused about reduced metabolites of curcumin. While there are preclinical studies relating to therapeutic potential of reductive metabolites of curcumin, these need further validations in animal model followed by clinical trials to develop curcumin derived medicinal agents. This review may provide additional insights for researchers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders to understand pleiotropic effects, molecular targets and their regulatory functions of multicomponent curcumin and their metabolites.</p>
