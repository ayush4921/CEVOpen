<p id="p0085">THC was shown to suppress the oxidative-stress induced renal damage by acting as a more potent antioxidant agent than curcumin

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug used in organ transplantation [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. THC exhibited beneficial effects against tacrolimus induced renal cell damage. Similarly, studies with THC suggested a protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Oxidative renal damage was ameliorated through the attenuation of cyclooxygenase-2 and caspase-3 activation in Rat [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These were associated with antioxidant and anti-apoptosis effects of THC, indicating that THC could act as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in the treatment of renal damage [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The therapeutic potential of THC as a dietary supplement following heavy metal exposure has been summarized by Kukonviriyapan 
 <italic>etÂ al.</italic>, 2016. THC may act as the complimentary chelating agent to enhance the potency of chelators in order to minimize the toxicity of metals. This property of THC may be useful in the treatment of metal induced hypertension and vascular dysfunction [
