<p id="p0145">Potential mechanism of action of OHC as a prodrug molecule has been studied in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. OHC exhibited better hepato-protection and antioxidant activities than curcumin. The keap1-nrf2 antioxidant pathway was upregulated by suppressing Keap1 expression and blocking the interaction between Keap1-Nrf2. Molecular Docking study indicated that OHC (THC and curcumin also) could bind with Keap1 and to some extent, occupy the Nrf2 binding site and made Nrf2 available to perform its antioxidant activities [
