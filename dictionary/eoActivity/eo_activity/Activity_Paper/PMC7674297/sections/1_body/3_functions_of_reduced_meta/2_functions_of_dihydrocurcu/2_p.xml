<p id="p0070">The function of the DHC has been less studied. The effect of DHC has been investigated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in a human liver cancer cell model for the study of non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Hallmarks of NAFLD are oxidative stress, insulin resistance, inflammation andhyperlipidaemia. DHC upregulated Nrf2 to reduce oxidative stress and, may alsoovercome the insulin resistance by increasing the glucose uptake by positively regulating of PI3K/AKT pathway. Moreover, DHC inhibits lipid biosynthesis and increased lipid oxidation in both HepG2 and L02 cells [
