<p id="p0100">Recently, THC has been found to have more potentiality in ameliorating allergic asthma in comparison to curcumin. To be more specific, THC exhibited better inhibitory action against tissue eosinophilia, mucus production, and IL-4RÎ±/Jak1/STAT6 pathway. Also, only THC and not curcumin attenuated Th cell polarization as Th2 cell subpopulation, Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5), and peripheral eosinophilia. The increased activity of THC attributed to the higher bioavailability of THC in plasma and tissue in comparison to curcumin [

Increased bioavailability is associated with enhanced antioxidant activity in the ocular epithelial cells, which is responsible for oxidative stress-protective effects in rabbit cornea tissues [
