<p>In conclusion, for copper nanoparticles mediated by the telmisartan drug, the Cu-Nsp was characterized by UV and FT-IR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray, EDX, AFM (atomic force microscopy), profile, waviness, roughness analysis, TGA studies and particle size analyzer. Synthesized Cu-Nps were used as catalysis for preparation of pyrimidinamine via the Biginelli multicomponent cyclocondensation reaction. The Cu-Nsp was a significantly active catalyst and gave excellent yields, and also recycling of the catalyst is very easy in this process. Bioactivity of 2-pyrimidinamine was a significant activity against performance of ABTS
 <sup>·+</sup> and linoleic acid peroxidation, while Cu-Nsp was moderately active in antioxidant screening; therefore, designed 2-pyrimidinamine with Cu-Nsp gave a noble result when compared with commercial drugs. Particularly, Cu-Nps-Pyr-1b was a potential activity (&gt;90%) against ABTS
 <sup>·+</sup> and AAPH assays, as compared with the Trolox standard. In cytotoxicity activity, the compound Cu-Nps-Pyr-1a was perceived for (GI
