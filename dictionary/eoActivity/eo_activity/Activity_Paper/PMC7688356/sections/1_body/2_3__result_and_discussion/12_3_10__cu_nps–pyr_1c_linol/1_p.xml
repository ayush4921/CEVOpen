<p>The Cu-Nsp with 2-pyrimidinamine combination was highly responsive to oxidative changes and inhibition in linoleic acid peroxidation screening. The hydrophilic AAPH initiator was used to measure the conjugated diene hydroperoxide formation at 234 nm by spectrophotometric analysis. Indeed, AAPH produced the free radicals at 37°C, which was an act of spontaneous decomposition. Here, R–N=N–R indicates the radical initiator, and LOO
 <sup>·</sup> denotes a linoleic peroxy radical, and LH stands for linoleic acid. The radicals R
 <sup>·</sup> was produced via immediately reacting with oxygen and causing the oxidation of lipids. The mechanism of reaction is represented in
