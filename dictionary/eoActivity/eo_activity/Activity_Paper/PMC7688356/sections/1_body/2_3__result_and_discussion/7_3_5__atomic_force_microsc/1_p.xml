 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> shows AFM images of Cu-Nsp. AFM image indicates the filtering procedure at cut-off frequency values at 4 
 <italic>μ</italic>m and Cu-Nsp profile particle size; performance is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8(b)</xref>, which obtained a value of 253 nm for the unfiltered profile. Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8(d)</xref> indicated the Cu-Np waviness and roughness, which were 234 nm for waviness and 14 nm for the roughness profile. Therefore, such values indicate that the unfiltered roughness parameter of shape and binding dominate Cu nanoparticles.
