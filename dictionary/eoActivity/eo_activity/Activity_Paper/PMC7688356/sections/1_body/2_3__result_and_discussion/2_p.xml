<p>A series of compounds were prepared via optimizing the reaction conditions, for instance of reaction involved among benzaldehyde, ethyl acetoacetate, substituted amine, and urea using Cu-Nps as a catalyst in a suitable solvent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch1">Scheme 1</xref>). The amount of Cu-Nps was changed subsequently from 0 mol% to 5 mol% under solvent-free conditions, as a result of the optimized mole percentage and the 88% yield performance obtained at 1 mol% concentration. Therefore, the results directed that 1 mol% of Cu-Nps is enough for the synthesis of the 2-pyrimidinamine compound. The synthesized Cu-Nps were characterized by UV, FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, XRD, EDX, AFM (atomic force microscopy), profile, waviness, and roughness analyses.
