<p>The intermediate of acyl imine formed between urea reacts with primary amine; for the next step, acyl imine reacted with aldehyde to give the guanidine core, which is actuated by copper catalysis. Step 3 was addition reaction between 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-dicarbonyl with 1-benzylidene-2-R-guanidine, then cyclized to afford the 2-aminopyrimidine derivatives. In conclusion, the simple and efficient synthesis of 2-aminopyrimidine uses Cu-Nps under solvent-free conditions. We developed the methodology and environmentally safe synthesis of the 2-aminopyrimidine derivative with good yields.
