    "Oxidative stress and excitotoxicity are some of the pathophysiological abnormalities in hypoxia-induced brain injury. This study evaluated the intrinsic antioxidant property of methanol fruit extract of <i>Tetrapleura tetraptera</i> (TT), traditionally used for managing brain diseases such as cerebral infarction in West Africa, and its ability to protect primary astrocytes from anoxia-induced cell death. The effect of the phytochemicals present in TT on excitotoxicity was assessed <i>in silico</i>, through docking with human glutamate synthetase (hGS). Chromatographic and spectrophotometric analyses of TT were performed. Primary astrocytes derived from neural stem cells were treated with TT and its effect on astrocyte viability was assessed. TT-treated astrocytes were then subjected to anoxic insult and, cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential were evaluated. Molecular docking of hGS with detected phytochemicals in TT (aridanin, naringenin, ferulic acid, and scopoletin) was performed and the number of interactions with the lead compounds, aridanin, analyzed. HPLC-DAD analysis of TT revealed the presence of various bioactive phytochemicals. TT demonstrated notable antioxidant and radical scavenging activities. TT also protected astrocytes from anoxic insult by restoring cell viability and preventing alteration to mitochondrial membrane integrity. Aridanin, naringenin, ferulic acid, and scopoletin demonstrated good binding affinities with hGS indicating that <i>Tetrapleura tetraptera</i> is a potential source of new plant-based bioactives relevant in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases."
