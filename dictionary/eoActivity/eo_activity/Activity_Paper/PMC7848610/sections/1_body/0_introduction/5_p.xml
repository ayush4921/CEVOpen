<p id="par0045">Astrocytes are vital housekeeping non-neuronal cells of the central nervous system [
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. They perform a plethora of functions to maintain brain homeostasis. They scavenge the release of neurotransmitters during synaptic action, control the homeostasis of ions and water, release neurotrophic factors, transport metabolite and waste products, and participate in blood-brain barrier formation [

 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Breakdown of one or more of these astrocytes functions will either alone or in combination with other cell dysfunction, constitute a threat to neuronal survival [
