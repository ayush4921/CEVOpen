<p id="par0205">JC-1 is a ljipophilic and cationic dye that exhibits a fluorescence emission shift upon aggregation from 530 nm (green monomer) to 590 nm (red “J-aggregates’’ monomer). In healthy cells with high MMP, JC-1enters the mitochondrial matrix in a potential-dependent manner and forms aggregates.</p>
