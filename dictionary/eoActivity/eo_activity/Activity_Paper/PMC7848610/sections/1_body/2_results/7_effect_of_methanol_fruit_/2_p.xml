<p id="par0270">There was a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in MMP of cells subjected to 3 h anoxia (severe hypoxia) compared to normoxia. This was characterized by marked staining of the “J-aggregate” form of JC- 1 (red fluorescence) with few monomer forms (green fluorescence) of normoxia-exposed cells compared to anoxia-exposed cells (
