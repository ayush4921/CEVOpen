 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> showed the antioxidant activity, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and inhibition of heat-induced denaturation of protein albumin of TT in the tests in terms of its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) in comparison with reference standards. TT demonstrated appreciable antioxidant activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 20.96 ± 0.65, 47.03 ± 0.97, 20.63 ± 0.68 and 47.36 ± 0.67 for DPPH radical scavenging activity, ABTS radical scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical, and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity, respectively, compared with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of reference standards ascorbic acid (15.36 ± 0.29), Trolox (39.88 ± 0.52), mannitol (11.06 ± 0.87) and quercetin (45.61 ± 0.56), respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of TT in the CUPRAC and anti-denaturation assays were 32.08 ± 1.22 and 26.76 ± 0.21, respectively, compared with the value of trolox (9.7553 ± 0.89) and ascorbic acid (12.15 ± 0.21), respectively, which were still appreciable. The FRAP value of the extract was 117.81 ± 4.066 mM Fe/mg dry weight while the TEAC value was 2.89 ± 0.451 mM Trolox/mg dry weight.
