<p id="par0305">Astrocytes death recorded in this study may be as a result of severe hypoxia and acidosis [
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. No cytotoxicity was observed after astrocytes were treated with TT suggesting that TT is not toxic to the cells at the employed concentrations. Protection of the viability and metabolic activity of astrocytes after treatment with TT and subjecting them to the anoxic condition may be due to the protective action of its bioactive components. This suggests that TT treatment may restore the function of astrocytes to provide trophic and metabolic support for neurons during metabolic brain injury.
