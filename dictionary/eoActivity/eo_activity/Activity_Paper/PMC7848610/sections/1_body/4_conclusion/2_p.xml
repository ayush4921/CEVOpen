This study revealed that TT has the potential to assuage excitotoxicity, restore astrocytic viability, and reduce bioenergetic dysfunction/disturbance 
 <italic>via</italic> its antioxidative properties in treating cerebral hypoxic conditions. This study also demonstrated that aridanin from TT could help in optimization of the activity of glutamine synthetase in order to attenuate the severity of excitotoxicity in neurological diseases. Therefore, 
 <italic>Tetrapleura tetraptera</italic> could potentially be employed as a plant-based agent for the treatment of cerebral astrocytic hypoxia. The findings from the

 <italic>in silico</italic> results in this study could be employed for further experiment in translational research.
