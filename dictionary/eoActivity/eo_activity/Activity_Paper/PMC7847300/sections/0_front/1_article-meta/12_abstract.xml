 <p id="Par1">Azulene is an aromatic hydrocarbon that possesses a unique chemical structure and interesting biological properties. Azulene derivatives, including guaiazulene or chamazulene, occur in nature as components of many plants and mushrooms, such as 
  <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>, 
  <italic>Artemisia absinthium</italic>, 
  <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic>, and 
  <italic>Lactarius indigo</italic>. Due to physicochemical properties, azulene and its derivatives have found many potential applications in technology, especially in optoelectronic devices. In medicine, the ingredients of these plants have been widely used for hundreds of years in antiallergic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory therapies. Herein, the applications of azulene, its derivatives and their conjugates with biologically active compounds are presented. The potential use of these compounds concerns various areas of medicine, including anti-inflammatory with peptic ulcers, antineoplastic with leukemia, antidiabetes, antiretroviral with HIV-1, antimicrobial, including antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, and antifungal.
