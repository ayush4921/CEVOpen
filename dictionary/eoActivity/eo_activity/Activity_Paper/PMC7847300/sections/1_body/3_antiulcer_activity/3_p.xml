<p id="Par52">Fujio et al. obtained a very similar compound 
 <bold>30</bold> to the series obtained in the above-discussed study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The difference was the length of the carbon chain in the 3rd position. Afterward, they assessed the surface and antipeptic activity of 
 <bold>30</bold> in comparison to reference molecule 
 <bold>29.</bold> Results of surface properties included the following parameters: critical micelle concentration (CMC), surface tension at CMC (γ
 <sub>CMC</sub>), efficiency in surface tension reduction (pC
 <sub>20</sub>, the negative logarithm of the surfactant concentration required to reduce the surface tension of solvent by 20 nN;m
 <sup>−1</sup>). It was found that 
 <bold>30</bold> exhibits higher antipeptic activity than a reference compound 
 <bold>29</bold>, considering the CMC and IC
 <sub>50</sub> (concentration which inhibits peptic activity by 50%) parameters with values such as 0.31 and 0.91 mmol kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The observed activity can be explained as the hydrophobic binding of the amphiphilic molecule 
 <bold>30</bold> to the pepsin’s hydrophobic active pocket. To sum up, the new compound 
 <bold>30</bold> presented slightly less surface activity than its structural isomer 4-decyl-1-naphthalenesulfonate 
 <bold>31</bold>, probably due to the dipole moment within the azulene moiety. Moreover, 
 <bold>30</bold> exhibited higher antipeptic activity than 
 <bold>29</bold>, below half of the CMC, above which level the antipeptic activity of 
 <bold>30</bold> was weakened, probably as a result of the unfolding of bovine serum albumin, which promotes its digestion by pepsin.
