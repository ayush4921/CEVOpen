<p id="Par51">Yanagisawa et al. studied the anti-peptic activity of compounds related to the metabolites of known API—sodium 3-ethyl-7-isopropyl-1-azulenesulfonate (
 <bold>22</bold>, KT1-32, egualen sodium) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. They synthesized six compounds (
 <bold>23–28</bold>), of which five molecules 
 <bold>24–28</bold> containing 3-alkyl-1-azulenesulfonate moiety are the metabolites of 
 <bold>22</bold> and assessed their antiulcer activity. Compounds 
 <bold>22</bold> and 
 <bold>23</bold> were treated as reference compounds in the study. Metabolites 
 <bold>24–28</bold> showed lower anti-peptic activity than 
 <bold>22</bold>, whereas the lowest activity was revealed by compounds 
 <bold>27</bold> and 
 <bold>28</bold>.
