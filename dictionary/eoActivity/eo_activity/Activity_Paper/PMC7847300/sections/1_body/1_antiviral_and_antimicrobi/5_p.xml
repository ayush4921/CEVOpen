<p id="Par44">The antimicrobial study was based on selected fungi and bacteria. Especially interesting was the study on the antifungal potential of azulene-organobismuth(III) carboxylates. Murafuji et al. synthesized a series of heterocyclic organobismuth(III) carboxylates, including azulene derivatives, and conducted qualitative antifungal assay on the yeast

 <bold>8â€“12</bold>, exhibited a satisfactory level of inhibition of fungal growth (Fig.
