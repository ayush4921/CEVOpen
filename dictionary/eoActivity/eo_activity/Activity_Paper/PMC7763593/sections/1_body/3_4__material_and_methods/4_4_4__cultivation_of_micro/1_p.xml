<p>In order to compare the phytochemical profile of calli with that of plants grown in a greenhouse, GC-MS analyses were also performed on approximately 50 plants obtained from in vitro cultivation, on MS Â½ medium without the addition of BA, with the objective of rooting and elongating in vitro, followed by acclimatization to substrate (peat + vermiculite + carbonized rice husk) in polypropylene trays. Plants were kept for 30 days in these conditions, planted in a plastic pot with 10 cm diameter, and fertigated weekly for the production of shoot biomass, aiming at the identification of compounds present in the aerial part of the plant.</p>
