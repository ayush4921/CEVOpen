<p>Interestingly, calli grown in vitro produced other molecules not observed in plants grown in a greenhouse. In dark conditions, in a medium containing 2,4-D combined with the treatment with the salicylic acid (SA) elicitor, the GC-MS database was able to find 10 molecules, with the identification of squalene (410 g/mol), stigmasterol (412 g/mol), and Î³-sitosterol (414 g/mol) (
