<p>This demonstrates that the isolated use of 2,4-D in concentrations of 0.50–0.75 mg/L, with calli grown in dark conditions, or BA applied at 2.0 mg/L in the presence of light may result in an expressive gain in fresh weight or productivity of calli obtained in in vitro conditions in 
 <italic>P. amarus.</italic> The proliferation rates in darkness with 0.75 mg/L and in light with 2.0 mg/L of BA were 22.1× and 12.0×, respectively.
