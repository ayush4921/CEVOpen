<p>Moreover, there were identified molecules of differential occurrence between the types of callus observed in 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic>. The presence of the ni molecules at 298, 314, 316, 392, and 394 g/mol and squalene (410 g/mL) was also verified in calli obtained in the dark + 2,4-D, while α-muurulen, β-amyrin, and other ni molecules were only observed in green calli, but not observed in calli obtained in the dark. The highest abundance of the molecules with molecular weights of 298, 300, and 422 g/mol was observed in calli in dark conditions with 2,4-D, while betulin-aldehyde or betulone (440 g/mol) showed the highest abundance presented in green calli derived from the BA treatment in light conditions.
