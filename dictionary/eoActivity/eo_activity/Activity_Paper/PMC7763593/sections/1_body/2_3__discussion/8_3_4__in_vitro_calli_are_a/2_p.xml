<p>Quantitative and qualitative differences in metabolites produced in different parts of plants, calli, and cell suspension cultures were also observed in 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic>, and in vitro cultures resulted in the identification of molecules not present in extracts collected directly from plants [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Anuar et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also detected the molecules quercetin and (+)-catechin in calli obtained in vitro from 
 <italic>P. niruri</italic>, and the concentration of these molecules in the calli varied according to treatments with the phytoregulators Kinetin, 2,4-D, and 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid added to the culture medium.
