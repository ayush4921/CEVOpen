<p>Calli obtained from nodal segments with the addition of 2,4-D (without BA) in the culture medium had a beige color and a friable appearance, regardless of the concentration used in the culture medium (

However, the largest amount of fresh weight and diameter of the calli were obtained at a concentration of 0.25 mg/L, and the addition of BA, in combination with 2,4-D, did not result in benefits in the induction phase. In the callus proliferation phase, the addition of BA (1 or 2 mg/L) was beneficial only at the concentration of 0.25 mg/L 2,4-D (
