<p>From the molecules identified by GC–MS, some of these observed in the calli were not identified (ni) by GC-MS and (National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) databases (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05895-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). An exhaustive and broad comparative search between these molecules of known molecular masses obtained from the calli was compared with those observed by different authors in other studies with 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05895" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Molecules with the same molecular mass in these libraries were compared with the same molar weight of the metabolites observed in calli of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic>, and only the molecules betulin-aldehyde or betulone and β-amiiryn (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05895-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) were identified via this method. This demonstrates that the calli are capable of synthesizing molecules very different from those already reported in the differentiated tissues of this species, as reported for the same genotype of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> in this paper, some of which were reported for the first time in 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and in the genus 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic>.
