<p>The beneficial effects of EAP on reducing CAs caused by CPA are presented in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The lymphocyte cultures which had 48 h continuous exposures to 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> extract (50∼250 mg/mL) did not show any changes in CAs, when compared to normal control. This indicated the non-mutagenic nature of the plant extract. The CPA alone at a concentration of 100 μg/mL significantly increased the number of abnormal metaphases and the total number of structural CAs in lymphocytes, when compared to normal control (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01). In contrast, the cells co-treated with CPA+EAP showed a significant reduction (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 or 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) in SCAs per cell and the % of abnormal cells, when compared to CPA alone treated cells. This indicates the antigenotoxic potential of the extract against CPA.
