<p id="par0075">The colorimetric aluminum chloride method as described by Karthikeyan and Vidya [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] was carried out to quantify the total flavonoids of the crude juices. The absorbance was performed at a wavelength of 415 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UVmini-1240, Japan). The flavonoid content in the crude juices was calculated from the regression equation of calibration plot (Y = 0.0125x-0.0447, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9857) and displayed as milligrams quercetin equivalent /gram dry weight sample (mg QE/g DW).
