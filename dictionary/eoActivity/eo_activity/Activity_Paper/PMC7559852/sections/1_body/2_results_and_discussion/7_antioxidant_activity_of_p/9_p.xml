<p id="par0310">Akila et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] mentioned that total antioxidant capability of fresh guava leaves determined by DPPH method was 71.16 % radical scavenging activity. Olatunde et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] found that guava leaf powder extract from dechlorophyllized chloroform was the highest antioxidant activity (240.78, 2598.41 μmol TE/g and 2327.42, for DPPH, FRAP and ABTS methods, respectively). Simamora et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] mentioned that guava aqueous leaf extract exhibited more effective scavenging activity than fruit extract with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 843.84 and 74.77 μg/mL for fruit and leaves aqueous extracts, respectively.
