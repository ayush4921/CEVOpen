<p>The content of total polyphenols in plant extracts were measured spectrophotometrically using the Folin–Ciocalteu phenol reagent and gallic acid was used as the standard. The experiment was performed according to the procedures described by Singleton et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05546" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, optimized concentrations of 25 μL of gallic acid standards and samples were mixed with 125 μL of Folin–Ciocalteu in the crystal clear 96-well plates. After 5 min incubation, 100 μL of sodium carbonate was added. The reaction mixtures were allowed to incubate for 2 h at room temperature. Thereafter, the plates were read at 765 nm using a multiskan plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Total polyphenol concentrations in samples were extrapolated from a standard curve of gallic acid and were reported as milligram gallic acid equivalents per gram of extract (mg GAE/g).
