<p>The formation of ROS inside the cells was determined using 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, acetyl ester (CMH2DCFDA; Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). In this reaction, when CM-H2DCFDA is added to the cells, it diffuses into the intracellular environment of the cells where it is converted by esterases to a non-fluorescent product CM-H2DCF [

If the cell contains oxidants like singlet oxygen, superoxide, hydroxyl radical and various peroxide and hydroperoxides, CM-H2DCF will consequently be oxidized to form CM-DCF-a highly fluorescent molecule hence making the intensity of the fluorescence to be proportional to the amount of ROS/RNS present inside the cells [

 <sup>5</sup> cells per well in 24 well plates and were left to attach for 24 h in the 37 °C incubator. After 24 h, the attached cells were exposed to the stressors for another 24 h and then eventually treated with vindoline, CR-Aq, CR-DCM and CR-Meth for 24 h. The utilized media together with cells were recovered by trypsinization. CM-H2DCFDA dye solution was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Stained cells were centrifuged, resuspended in media and analyzed using a BD AccuriTM C6 flow cytometer.
