To prepare the aqueous extract, 1 L of boiling water was added to 100 g of the powder and the mixture was left for 24 h on magnetic stirrer. The organic extracts were prepared by adding 500 mL of solvents (100% methanol and dichlromethane) to 50 g of the plant powder and were left on a magnetic stirrer for 24 h. The organic solvents were removed from the extracts by the use of a vacuum rotary evaporator at low pressure. The aqueous extract was filtered using the Whatman 1 filter paper, thereafter it was freeze-dried and stored at âˆ’20
