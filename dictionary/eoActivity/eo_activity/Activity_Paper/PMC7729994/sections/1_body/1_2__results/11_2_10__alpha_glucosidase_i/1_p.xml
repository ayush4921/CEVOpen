<p>The in vitro alpha glucosidase inhibitory activities of the different extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05546-f008">Figure 8</xref>. Various concentrations of the plant extract (50, 25, 12.5 and 6.25 mg/mL) were assessed with the inhibitory activities of similar concentrations compared to each other. At a concentration of 50 mg/mL and 25 mg/mL, the CR-Aq, CR-Meth and CR-DCM showed significant inhibitory activities when compared to the control, which was uninhibited. However, at a lower concentration of 6.25 and 12.5 mg/mL, the CR-DCM (13%) showed significantly reduced inhibitory activity when compared to the CR-Aq, which showed 22% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). At 12.5 and 6.25 mg/mL concentrations, the CR-DCM showed lower inhibitory (6.46% and 5.14% respectively) activities, which were not significantly different when compared to the control at
