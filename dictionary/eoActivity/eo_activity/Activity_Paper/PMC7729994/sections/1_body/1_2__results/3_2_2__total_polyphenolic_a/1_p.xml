<p>The total polyphenolic (TP) content and the in vitro antioxidant capacity of the aqueous, methanolic, dichloromethane and the ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05546-f001">Figure 1</xref> below. The CR-Meth extract (10.913 ± 0.24 mg GAE/L) showed a significantly high concentration of TP when compared to the other three extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The CR-DCM (6.3 ± 0.0.123 mg GAE/L) extract showed higher TP when compared to the CR-Aq (4.06 ± 0.08 mg GAE/L) and CR-Ethyl (2.89 ± 0.107 mg GAE/L). The antioxidant activity measured as ORAC revealed high antioxidant capacity in the following order CR-Meth (64076.4 ± 1232 µmol TE/L), CR-DCM (27827.2 ± 1151µmol TE/L), CR-Ethyl (16808.8 ± 1646 µmol TE/L) and CR-Aq (13521.1 ± 290.5 µmol TE/L). The same trend was observed in the DPPH activities of these extracts however, the DPPH reading of the CR-Ethyl exhibited lower activity.
