<p>We further investigated the effects of the extracts and vindoline on the functionality of RIN-5F cells after exposure to high/low glucose concentrations or in the absence of glucose. Our results revealed that vindoline can increase insulin secretion in response to glucose concentrations; suggesting that vindoline promotes the sensitivity of RIN-5F cells to exogenous glucose by increasing the release of insulin [

The mechanism of action of vindoline is suggested to be identical to that of sulfonylureas, which also promote insulin secretion in response to glucose levels. When compared to the methanolic extract, vindoline showed better insulin secretion in cells that were exposed to high glucose levels. This result may imply that the reported antidiabetic effect of 
 <italic>C. roseus</italic> is not only associated with the phenolic compounds as previously reported but also to its alkaloid content [

Whereas no significant difference was observed in cells that were treated with vindoline and the dichloromethane extract, our findings were consistent with our vindoline HPLC quantification results, which demonstrated high vindoline content in the dichloromethane extract; hence it is logical to suggest that vindoline might be the compound responsible for the antidiabetic activities of the dichloromethane extract. Interestingly, in cells that were not exposed to glucose, vindoline did not exhibit any stimulation on beta cells leading to the proposal that vindoline only stimulates the beta cells in a hyperglycemic environment. This finding agrees with the results reported by Yao and colleagues [
