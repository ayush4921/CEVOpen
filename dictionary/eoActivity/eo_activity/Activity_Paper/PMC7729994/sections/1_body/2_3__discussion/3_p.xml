<p>Abnormally high levels of free radicals cause oxidative stress in tissue leading to pathophysiology of chronic diseases like diabetes. Antioxidants are molecules that prevent or slow down tissue damage by scavenging ROS/RNS or by obstructing free radical oxidation [

The methanolic extract exhibited significantly high ORAC and DPPH scavenging activities suggesting the potent antioxidant effect of the extract thereby preventing oxidative tissue damage slowing down the progression of diseases such as DM and cancer [

The high antioxidant capacity observed in the methanolic extract in this study may be attributed to the high levels of polyphenolic compounds. Polyphenols are bioactive compounds that act as antioxidants by donating hydrogen atoms to free radicals thereby getting rid of the unstable unpaired electrons [

Our results also confirmed that dichloromethane extract was able to significantly reduce DPPH and AAPH radicals in the DPPH and ORAC assays respectively when compared to the ethyl acetate extract. These findings propose that the compounds such as polyphenols and alkaloids with a high concentration in the CR-DCM extract contributed to the significant antioxidant potency. However, some studies in the literature do not support the beneficial relationship between the phenolic content and antioxidant activities of plants [
