<p>Although herbal remedies are believed by the general public to be safe [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], some research findings suggested otherwise. For instance, traditionally used Thai anticancer plants 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (Fr.) Karst., 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> Thunb., and 
 <italic>Saussurea involucrata</italic> Matsum. &amp; Koidz. were reported to cause side effects such as headache, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Similarly, side effects such as vomiting, diarrhea, and skin necrosis, associated with the use of traditional herbal remedies, were reported in this and other ethnobotanical studies conducted in Ethiopia [
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Few side effects reported in this study, as compared to other ethnobotanical studies conducted in Ethiopia, could be attributed to the frequent use of the topical route of administration. Nevertheless, considering the probability of underreporting adverse effects, extensive toxicological investigations should be conducted to protect the public.
