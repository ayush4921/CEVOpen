<p>The present study showed that traditional healers in eleven districts of Ethiopia use different medicinal plants to manage cancer-like symptoms. Frequency of citation value ranked 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> Del., 
 <italic>Clematis simensis</italic> Fresen., 
 <italic>Dorstenia barnimiana</italic> Schweinf, 
 <italic>Vernonia auriculifera</italic> Hiern, and 
 <italic>Acmella caulirhiza</italic> Del. as most cited plant species in study areas. Hence, based on these findings, we are currently evaluating the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative activities of reported medicinal plant species with a higher frequency of citation against human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), human uterine cervical adenocarcinoma (SiSo), human lung carcinoma (A-427), and human bladder cancer (RT-4) cell lines using crystal violate assay. However, considering the rapid disappearance of the traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and an urgent need for new anticancer agents, additional studies have to be conducted to document and scientifically validate traditionally used Ethiopian anticancer plants.
