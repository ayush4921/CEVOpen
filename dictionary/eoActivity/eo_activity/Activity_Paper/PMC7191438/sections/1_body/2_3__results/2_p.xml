 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The result of this study showed that shrubs (49.1%), herbs (33.9%), trees (13.2%), and climbers (3.8%) were the main sources of potential anticancer medicinal plants. This study also indicated that leaves (56.7%) were the most commonly used plant parts followed by roots (21.7%), bark (6.7%), stem (1.7%), seeds (1.7%), whole plant (1.7%), leaves and roots (5%), leaves or stem (1.7%), and leaves or seeds (1.7%) (
