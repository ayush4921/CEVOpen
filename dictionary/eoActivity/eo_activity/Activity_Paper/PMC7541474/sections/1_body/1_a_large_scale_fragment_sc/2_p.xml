 </sup>. Rather than starting from a larger, substrate-based molecule as with the peptidomimetics, or screening hundreds of thousands of drug-sized molecules, FBDD starts with more limited libraries of smaller molecules, or fragments. Because there are fewer possible small fragments than drug-sized molecules, FBDD can survey chemical space more comprehensively to find the most attractive starting points for medicinal chemistry. Also, because fragments are so small, they tend to bind to more sites on proteins, which facilitates lead identification. Nearly 50 FBDD-derived drugs have entered clinical
