<p>Transversely cut surface of young stem is rectangular in outline with discontinuous rings of vascular bundles. This is parallel to the under surface of the epidermis with 3 to 4 vascular bundles under the wings that is more developed than the ones at the flat sides. This is conjoint, collateral with a cap of bast fibres encircled by idio-blast containing cluster crystals of calcium oxalate, with numerous air cavities throughout the section. A complete ring of vascular strand with well-developed cambium ring is seen except at the flat broad side of the stem in old stem.</p>
