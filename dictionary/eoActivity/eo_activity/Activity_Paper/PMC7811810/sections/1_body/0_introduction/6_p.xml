<p>The wild plant resource may be in short supply due to the over-collection for bioactive metabolites. Our study was therefore conducted to isolate endophytic fungi from 
 <italic>F. ovina</italic> and get candidate endophytic fungal strains that produce the same bioactive compounds as the plant. For this purpose, ethyl acetate extract of these plant endophytic fungi was examined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
