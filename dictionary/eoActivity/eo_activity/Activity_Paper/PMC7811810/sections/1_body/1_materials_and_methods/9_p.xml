<p>The dried extract was then resolved in methanol for further LC-MS analysis and was filtered through a 0.22-μm filtration membrane. LC-MS analysis was performed in an AB SCIEX QTRAP (Shimadzu) liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Liquid chromatography separation was performed on a Supelco C18 (15 mm×2.1 mm×3 μm) column. The analysis was done at a flow-rate of 0.2 ml/min with a mixture of methanol and water (90:10), and the mass spectra were acquired in a range of 100 to 700 within the 20 min scan time. The detection was monitored at the MS-ESI (+) spectroscopy at a probe temperature of 300 
 <sup>°</sup>C and probe voltage of 3 kV.
