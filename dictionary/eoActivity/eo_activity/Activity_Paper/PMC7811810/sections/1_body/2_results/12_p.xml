<p>After 2 weeks in darkness, on malt extract agar (MEA) medium at 24 
 <sup>°</sup>C, colonies were velvety to floccose with some shallow radial fissures, dark olive-brown to blackish brown with a submerged irregular margin and grew slowly to attain a diameter of 8 mm [

There was no detection of hyphal coils. Conidiophores were dark brown, bearing one or more conidia, with a sympodial proliferating conidiogenous locus, arising individually from vegetative hyphae with right angles, erect, cylindrical with 1-2 septa, 25-30×2-2.5 μm. Conidia were pale brown, mostly 2-celled, rarely single, 3-celled and 4-celled, sometimes slightly apiculate ellipsoidal, 8-10.5 × 6-7.5 μm, not or slightly restricted at the septa, rough-walled, with a thick median septum [
