<p id="Par24">CME doses in Groups 2 and 3 did not induce any genotoxic effects on 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> bulbs when applied alone, similar to the control group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). On the other hand, a series of genotoxic malformations occurred in Group 4 following the diniconazole treatment. Genotoxic potential of diniconazole in cells was evidenced by a reduction in MI and increased amounts of CAs when compared to the control group. Chromosomal disorders occurred due to the administration of diniconazole were micronucleus, fragment, sticky chromosome, unequal distribution of chromatin and vacuole nucleus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). MN frequencies of Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 were 0.56 ± 0.64, 0.42 ± 0.54 and 0.24 ± 0.38, respectively. On the other hand, Group 4 had an extremely higher MN score than those of the first three groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). MN formation is a commonly preferred reflector in order to detect the clastogenic and aneugenic consequences of toxic compounds

 </sup> noted that failures in cell cycle could lead to the emergence of acentric fragments or disintegration of complete chromosomes to the main nucleus, which in turn resulted in MN formation. Here, we demonstrate that diniconazole treatment resulted in a terrific leap in fragment abundancy in Group 4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Fragment was more intense than MN in diniconazole-treated roots. It can be considered that MN frequency can usually be found at lower amounts than the other CAs due to the fact that all of the fragments do not become a distinct micronucleus. Other CAs observed abundantly in Group 4 was sticky chromosomes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Stickiness, a chromatid type abnormality, is arisen from the inappropriate folding of inner chromatins into chromatids or depolymerization of chromosomes

 </sup>. It is considered to be an irreversible chromosomal abnormality and usually result in death of the cells
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. As it causes unequal separation of chromosomes into the daughter cells
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>, this deviation type is a sign of the aneugenic action of diniconazole. Unequal distribution of chromatin occurrence was induced following diniconazole treatment in Group 4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Auti et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup> reported that unequal distribution of chromatin occurs when cells encounter chemicals during the latter anaphase stage of the mitosis. In our study, bridge was other CAs recorded in large quantities as a result of fungicide treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Bridge formation and stickiness are closely related to each other since the previous one might be a consequence of sticky chromosome formation during the metaphase
 <sup>

 </sup>. The least frequent CAs in diniconazole-treated group was vacuole nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). According to Sutan et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup>, this kind of anomaly is not only a reflector of a toxic compound that directly targets the cell nucleus, but also evidence of damage on DNA replication during S step of the cell division. Our results on CAs-formative potential of diniconazole in 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> roots cells were in agreement with those obtained from Demirtaş et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. They described the CAs types formed as a result of dicinonazole treatment in 
 <italic>Allium</italic> roots as fragment, bridge, binucleus cell, C-mitosis, polarization abnormality, stickiness and unequally exchange of chromatins. So far, many researchers were focused on the chromosomal anomalies caused by other triazole compounds in the literature

 </sup> and our data showed great harmony with the results of their studies. MI is calculated to quantify the mitotic proliferation performance of the cells and estimate the cytotoxic potency of the compounds

 </sup>. Khan et al.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup> stated that the decrease in MI can be caused by halting of G2 stage of the cell cycle, failure of removing free radicals or inhibition of DNA replication. MI reduction in fungicide treated-Group 4 should suggest that diniconazole is a mitodepressive compound. Also, it should be noted that the decrease of the mitotoic index with the increase in chromosomal abnormalities clearly demonstrates that the dinoconazole is cytotoxic. MI decline in 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> roots following diniconazole application was consistent with the other studies showing that triazoles are suppressive agents for mitotic division
