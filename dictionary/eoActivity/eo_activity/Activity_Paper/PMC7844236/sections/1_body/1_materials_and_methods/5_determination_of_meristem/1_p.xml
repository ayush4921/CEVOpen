<p id="Par21">Cross sections of the roots treated with water and diniconazole solution were used to investigate meristematic damages of the fungicide. After the root tips were washed thoroughly with distilled water for 3 min, the root caps were removed. Decapitated roots were cross-sectioned manually using a razor. 5% methylene blue was dropped onto the root slices in order to stain the cells. Microscope slides were examined under × 500 zoom for meristematic disintegration.</p>
