<p>Distinguishable differences among cereal species were proved based on the results of inhibitory activities of the cereal crude extracts against these two starch digestive enzymes (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Kim et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) studied the inhibition of α‐glucosidase and α‐amylase by 70% ethanol extracts of different varieties of sorghum, foxtail millet, and proso millet. The results showed that in 6 sorghum varieties, compared with the existing α‐glucosidase inhibitor anti‐diabetic acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.1 μg/ml), Mongdang‐susu (SS‐1), Me‐susu (SS‐2), Susongsaengi‐Susu (SS‐3), and Sikyung‐Susu (SS‐4) extracts had significantly higher inhibitory activity against α‐glucosidase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.1–1.4 μg/ml). Moreover, these extracts have a strong inhibitory effect on α‐amylase in pancreas and saliva, while foxtail and proso millets extracts have no significant inhibitory effect on α‐amylase or α‐glucosidase activity. Ramakrishna et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) screened the antihyperglycemic function of 13 barley varieties and evaluated the α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase inhibitory activities of barley extracts (hot water, cold water, and 12% ethanol). The results showed that the cold water and ethanol extracts of most barley varieties had significant inhibitory effects on α‐amylase, but the differences among most varieties were not significant. Additionally, it was observed that for all extraction methods, the black barley variety had the highest α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity (34%) and exhibited a dose‐dependent pattern among all barley varieties. Ranilla et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0050" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) used in vitro enzyme assays to determine the α‐glucosidase and α‐amylase inhibition associated with early type 2 diabetes in 10 kinds of Peruvian Andean hot‐processed cereals (five cereals, three pseudocereals, and two legumes). The results showed that the purple corn (Zea mays L.) water extract had the highest α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity (51%, 5 mg sample weight). No α‐amylase inhibitory activity was observed in all of the evaluated Andean grains.
