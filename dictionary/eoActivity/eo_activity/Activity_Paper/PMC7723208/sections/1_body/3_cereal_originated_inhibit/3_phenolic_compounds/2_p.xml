<p>Starch hydrolase inhibitors from cereals have been reported for phenolic acids, tannins, anthocyanins, and flavonoids (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Most of the reported studies used crude phenolic extracts, including soluble and bound forms. The phenolic compounds from corn, rice, barley, sorghum, millet, and quinoa (Pradeep &amp; Sreerama, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Rosén &amp; Björck, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Shukla &amp; Srivastava, 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) were reported to be potent inhibitors of α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase. The soluble and bound phenolic extracts of whole cereals and their milled fraction inhibited the activities of α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase in a dose‐dependent manner (Qin et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The enzyme inhibitory activities of cereal phenolic extracts depend on the cereal types and processing methods. For example, the phenolic extracts of little millet cultivars had superior inhibition of both α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase than those of foxtail millet cultivars. Among the evaluated cultivars, the soluble and bound fractions of foxtail millet cultivar CO7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 22.37 and 57.26 μg/ml) and the little millet cultivar CO4 of (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 18.97 and 55.69 μg/ml) showed strong inhibition of α‐glucosidase (Pradeep et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). HPLC analysis of phenolic extracts revealed variations in individual phenolic acid composition among the evaluated samples. Naringenin, kaempferol, luteolin glycoside, apigenin, (+)‐catechin/(−)‐epicatechin, daidzein, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and syringic acid from cereals are considered as the enzyme inhibitors (Shobana et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids were found as the predominant phenolic acids in soluble fractions, while ferulic and 
 <italic>p</italic>‐coumaric acids were abundant in bound fractions. Quercetin was the most abundant flavonoid presented in all the fractions. Quercetin, and ferulic and p‐coumaric acids are reported to have high α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity by mixed noncompetitive inhibition (Adisakwattana et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). The results of Mishra et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) had shown that organic rye varieties have higher ferulic acid content and α‐amylase inhibitory activity, while traditional rye varieties have higher catechin content and α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity.
