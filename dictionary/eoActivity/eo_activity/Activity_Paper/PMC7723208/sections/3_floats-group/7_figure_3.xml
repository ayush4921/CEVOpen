  <p>Potential mechanisms under the whole cereals on the prevention of hyperglycemia. The α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase inhibitors in whole cereal foods are released during digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. α‐Amylase inhibitors may limit the hydrolysis of starch by block the active centers of the enzymes. α‐Glucosidase inhibitors reduce shorter oligomer by occupying enzyme and sugar‐binding sites, thereby delaying intestinal absorption of glucose</p>
