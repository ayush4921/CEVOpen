<p>The phytochemical screening and qualitative estimation of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> seeds and leaves showed that the leaves were rich in flavones and polyphenols than the seeds, yet the seeds are rich in alkaloids and tannins than the leaves of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Adedapo et al. [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in their investigations showed that 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> has resulted in the isolation of a series of alkaloids, phenolic compounds, flavonoids, flavanols, and proanthocyanins from leaves, barks, and roots. The present finding was also in line with the report of Dula and Zelalem [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] which showed that the C. 
 <italic>aurea</italic> root extract contains cardiac glycosides, tannins, flavonoids, terpenoids, saponins, steroids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds by using ethanol, chloroform, methanol, and n-hexane extracts. Even if a standardized extraction protocol has not been developed for herbal extracts, 20â€“95% of the ethanol-aqueous mixture is frequently used by the herbal medicine industry to prepare ethanolic extracts [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, ethanol is widely used to obtain crude extracts of phytochemicals from plant materials in the herbal medicine industry for medication purposes. Due to the variation in the composition of active compounds, a given plant may require different concentrations of ethanol to achieve the maximum recovery of bioactive components. Moreover, the variation of secondary compounds may also exist within species and breed mainly due to plant genotypes, developmental stages, biotic factors (natural enemies, competitors, or mutualists), soil type and ingredients, the season of collection, and geographical locations [
