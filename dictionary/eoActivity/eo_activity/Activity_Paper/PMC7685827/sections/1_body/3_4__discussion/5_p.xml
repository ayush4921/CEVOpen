<p>Kulthe et al. and Tahera et al. [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] reported the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Calpurnia</italic> leaf extracts against nine enteric pathogens tested including 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 H:7, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, and other species. Likewise, Romha et al. and Kalayou et al. [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] reported the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>Calpurnia</italic> leaf extracts against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi, S. pyogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> clinical isolates. 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> shows MIC on the leaf, bark, and root, while 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> shows on leaf (3.125 mg/ml) ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>C. aurea</italic> which is in line with the finding of Elisha et al. [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As commonly known, the Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant than the Gram-positive ones [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; however, the current study showed that 3 of the Gram-negative bacteria used in this study were sensitive to this extract even at a high MIC of 3.125 mg/ml. Among the positive controls, antibiotic treatment with penicillin showed resistance to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157 H:7 and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> at 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ml. This suggests that the 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>aurea</italic> ethanol extract compound might be used instead of penicillin treatment of these disease-causing pathogens.
