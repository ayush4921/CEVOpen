<p>All bacterial cultures were first grown on 5% sheep red blood agar plates at 37°C for 18–24 hrs before inoculation onto the nutrient agar. Four up to five colonies of bacteria were selected and transferred with a sterile inoculating loop to a liquid medium and incubated until adequate growth equivalent to McFarland 0.5 turbidity units (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) standard was obtained. The inocula of the respective bacteria were streaked onto Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) plates using a sterile swab in such a way as to ensure thorough coverage of the plates, and a uniform thick lawn of growth was obtained following incubation. The inoculated plates were left at room temperature for 3–5 min to allow for any surface moisture to be absorbed before applying the extract. Wells of 6 mm in diameter were formed onto MHA plates using a sterile cork borer. The wells were filled with the test agents (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l each), and the plates were then allowed to stay for 1-2 hrs at room temperature for proper diffusion. Finally, the plates were incubated at 37°C for 18–24 hrs, and the resulting diameters of zones of inhibition were measured using a sliding caliper [
