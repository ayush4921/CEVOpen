<p id="p0010">Honey is a natural substance that is sweet sticky and viscous solution produced by different bee species either from the juice of blossoms or from exudations of living parts of plants or excretions of insects those sucking plant juices from the living parts of plants (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Alimentarius, 2001</xref>). With its composition and constituents, honey is known globally to have a wide variety of uses and applications, such as for nutritional, medicinal and industrial purposes. Honey is composed of sugars, mainly monosaccharide, with constituting about 95–97% of carbohydrates of its dry weight (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Bastos and Alves (2003)</xref> stated that honey flavor and aroma is determined by volatile compounds includes alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and acids. Nevertheless, depending on the source(s) of nectar, geographical origin, seasonal and environmental factors and handling techniques, honey can have a variable chemical composition (
