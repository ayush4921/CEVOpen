 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Bogdanov, 2009</xref>). The honey samples analyzed in the present study showed a water-insoluble solids content ranging from 0.56% to 0.87% with a mean value of 0.69 Â± 0.06%. The results show that the honey samples used in the present study were clean suggesting good harvesting techniques. In overall, good manufacturing practices in production and processing are generally effective to ensure the low limits of insoluble matters in honey.
