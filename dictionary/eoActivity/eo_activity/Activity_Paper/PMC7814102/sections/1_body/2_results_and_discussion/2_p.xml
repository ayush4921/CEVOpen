<p id="p0165">The study result was revealed that average volume of stingless bee honey collected from each nest ranged from 350 ml-1.5 l, which varied among districts (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>). The highest volume of honey (2.3 l) was harvested from Chaliya district, while the lowest honey volume (250 ml) was recorded from Toke Kutaye district. The variations in volumes of honey yield among districts might be affected by several factors such as the nest size, colony population size, vegetation type and longevity of established colony harbored in the specific nest. Traditionally, the year of colony established is estimated by counting the number of guard bees on their nest entrance, which can be related to amount of honey production.
