<p id="p0035">The botanical origin of stingless bee honey was determined using harmonized methods of melissopalynology (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Von Der Ohe et al., 2004</xref>), with little modification. Dominant stingless bee honey plants were determined through pollen analysis. Each 10 g sample of honey was weighed in a glass centrifuge tube with 50 mL capacity and dissolved in distilled water (20 mL). The solution was then centrifuged for 10 min at temperature of 20–40 °C and the supernatant was descanted. To fully dissolve the remaining sugar crystals in a solution, another 20 mL distilled water was added and centrifuged for 5 min at the same temperature, then the supernatant was again descanted. The remaining residue was uniformly spread on a microscopic slide using a micro spatula and allowed to dry and fix. Finally, one drop of glycerin jelly was added to the cover slip and the sample was observed under Zeiss AxioVert A.1 light microscope (Mg. Power 40X). Selected pictures of pollen finger prints were taken from each slide (
