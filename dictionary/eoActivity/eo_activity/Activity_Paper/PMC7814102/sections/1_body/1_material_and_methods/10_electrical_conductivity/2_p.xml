<p id="p0110">The electrical conductivity of stingless bee honey samples was measured using a conductivity meter (LF 90, Astute Tech. Werkstatten D821 Weilheim, Germany). 20 g of an anhydrous honey sample was diluted in 100 mL distilled water and from the dissolved solution, 40 mL was poured into a measuring beaker and placed in a thermostat-controlled water bath (GFL Labortechnikmbh D3006 Burgwedel) at 20 °C. Then, the measurements of electrical conductivity were acquired by conductivity meter (low range, 4310 Wagtech, England) with 1.03 cell constant. After the conductivity cell was immersed in to the honey solution, the conductance read was recorded in mS at an equilibrium temperature. Finally, the value of electrical conductivity was calculated by the following equation
