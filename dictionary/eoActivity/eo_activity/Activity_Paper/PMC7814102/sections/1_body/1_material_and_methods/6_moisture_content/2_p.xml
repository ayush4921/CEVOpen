<p id="p0050">The honey sample moisture content was analyzed using a portable digital, professional hand held refractometer (Bellingham RFM 330, SER. No.016468, made of UK) with the range expressed in percentage (%) and with the refractive index for water (n
 <sub>D</sub>) at 20 Â°C waiting for 6 min to reach at equilibration point. This technique was assumed according to the rules that the honey refractive index rises with the amount of solid substances contained in the honey sample. Then the moisture contents of each sample were recorded three times, and the mean value was recorded as described elsewhere in (
