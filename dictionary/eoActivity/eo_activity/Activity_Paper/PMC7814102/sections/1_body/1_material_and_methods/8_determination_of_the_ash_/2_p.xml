 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Marchini et al., 2007</xref>). First, the selected crucibles were heated in a furnace for about 25 min at a temperature of 300 °C. Then they were transferred to the desiccators for 20 min to cool down and were weighed separately to 0.001g (M
 <sub>1</sub>). Then, 10 g of stingless bee honey sample was accurately measured and put into an ignited and pre-weighed crucible. In each sample, two droplets of olive oil were added to prevent frothing, and then the samples were gently heated on an electric hot plate until the samples were completely carbonized. The honey samples were incinerated in an electric muffle furnace (CFS 11/B, England) (600 °C) for about 5 h until complete incineration (white to light gray color) to reach the constant weight. The crucibles were then taken out and cooled in the desiccators and weighted for constant weight (M
 <sub>2</sub>). Finally, the ash content was calculated in percent in g/100g mass using the formula
