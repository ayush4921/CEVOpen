    "The study was investigated to characterize the physico-chemical properties of honey produced from stingless bees (<i>Meliponula beccarii</i>) in Oromia Region of Ethiopia. Honey samples were collected from underground soils through an excavation of natural nests from four representative districts (Wolmera, Jeldu, Toke Kutaye and Chalyia). About 120 honey samples (0.35-1.5 lit volumes) were collected and pooled for each respective area (district) for analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) of pollen data and GPS were used to categorize the botanical origin and geographical location of honey sample sources, respectively. Consecutively, the physico-chemical characters were evaluated for the moisture content (MC), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, ash, total acidity (TA), hydroxyl methyl furfuraldhyde (HMF), insoluble materials (IM), and proline. The study results showed that the mean values of parameters for honey samples were: MC (29 ± 1.45), EC (0.22 ± 0.03), pH (3.73 ± 0.13), Ash (0.41 ± 1.1), TA (7.3 ± 0.36), HMF (18 ± 3.45), IM (0.70 ± 0.3) and proline (214.5 ± 15). There was no mean significance differences <i>(P > 0.05)</i> observed among the sampled districts for the analyzed parameters, except for proline. The values were compared against the standard physico-chemical parameters of <i>Apis mellifera</i> honey of Ethiopia and these values significantly varied for moisture content, total acidity and HMF. This is the first study investigated on composition property of stingless bee honey in Ethiopia and recall for further study on its nutritional and medicinal values so as to create a specific standardization."
