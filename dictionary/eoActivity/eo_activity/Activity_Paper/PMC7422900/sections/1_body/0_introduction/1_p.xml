<p>Multiple countries use indigenous plants as traditional remedies for treatment of injury or disease. In the Indian traditional medicinal system of Ayurveda and other similar practices, leaves, roots, seeds and fruits are commonly used as alternative medicines.

 <italic>Salacia chinensis</italic> (Deokate and Khadabadi

 <italic>Garcinia indica</italic>, commonly known as the kokum tree, produces fruits which are used in Ayurvedic medicine for its antimicrobial, antiulcer, anticancer and antiobesity properties, as well as being able to ease inflammatory and pain-related issues (Baliga 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The roots of the 
 <italic>Salacia chinensis</italic> herb tree have also been exploited for beneficial properties in treating tooth decay, ulcers, obesity and skin conditions (Deokate and Khadabadi 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Multiple parts of the Indian devil tree, 
 <italic>Alstonia scholaris</italic>, such as leaves, follicles and latex show extensive antimicrobial and antioxidant properties (Ganjewala and Gupta 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Recently, the medicinal plant-associated microbiome, and especially the interaction between the complex community of endophytic microorganisms (endomicrobiome; Köberl 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) have been attributed to these antimicrobial (Martinez-Klimova, Rodríguez-Peña and Sánchez 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and bioactive properties through the metabolites they produce (Gouda 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Ek-Ramos 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Endophytic bacteria isolated from traditional Chinese medicinal plants used as anticancer therapy were screened for bioactivity and all isolates exhibited either cytotoxic, antibacterial or antifungal activities in at least one assay (Miller
