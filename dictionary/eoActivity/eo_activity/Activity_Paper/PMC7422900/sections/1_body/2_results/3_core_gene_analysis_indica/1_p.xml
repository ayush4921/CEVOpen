<p>To increase the resolution of genomic taxonomy applied to the endophytic bacterial collection phylogenomic approaches were also applied on selected genera as follows. Core-gene phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) revealed three genera of interest, due to either the high degree of similarity between one or more sequenced endophytes (
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> and 
 <italic>Serratia</italic>) or unique phylogenetic placement supported by ANI, indicating a novel species group (
 <italic>Aureimonas</italic>). The analysis of 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> genomes revealed that endophyte ME13, isolated from 
 <italic>Terminalia paniculata</italic> in the Bisle Ghat region possessed the same core-genes as endophyte ME34, isolated from 
 <italic>Ventilago</italic> sp. in the same region (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). The nearest neighbour of these isolates was the genome of 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> 153_ECLO. This isolate, and both ME13 and ME34, were however distinct from the 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> type strain, ATCC 13047
 <sup>T</sup>, both phylogenetically and in terms of ANI. Core-gene analysis of 
 <italic>Serratia</italic> genomes revealed that endophytes ME43 and ME47, both of which were isolated from 
 <italic>Coscinium fenestratum</italic> in the Mangalaru region were identical in terms of core-gene content (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). Additionally, both ME43 and ME47 possessed ≥95% identity in comparison to the 
 <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> type strain, ATCC 13880
 <sup>T</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>).
