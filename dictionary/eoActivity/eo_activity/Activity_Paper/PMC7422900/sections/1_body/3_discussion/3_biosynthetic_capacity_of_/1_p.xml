<p>Previous studies have investigated the NRPS and PKS diversity of medicinal plant bacterial and fungal endophytes through culture-independent PCR-based methods (Miller 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">2012a</xref>). The benefits of this culture-independent approach included a lack of culture-bias and the ability to detect both fungal and bacterial NRPS and PKS potential. However, as noted, the limitations of a PCR screen were the inability to detect low level target DNA, and divergent sequence domains. Additional studies by Miller 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>) on Chinese medicinal plants obtained pure bacterial and fungal isolates that permitted cytotoxicity and antimicrobial phenotypic testing (Miller 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>). Although our culture-dependent isolation of endophytes was biased towards bacteria capable of growth on LB agar, the output of this study included draft whole-genome sequences and pure cultures of the isolated bacterial endophytes. This enabled both phenotypic testing of antimicrobial activity and genome mining for a multitude of biosynthetic gene clusters. A high proportion of the sequenced ME isolates possessed BGCs with NRPS and PKS-predictions (73% and 54%, respectively). This represents a significantly larger proportion than previously described endophyte collections (Miller 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>). However, this is partly biased by only examining the genome-sequenced portion of the collection, and the ability to predict type 3 polyketide synthase (T3PKS) and hybrid NRPS-PKS BGCs. The draft genomes described in our study enabled accurate taxonomic identification and resulted in the prediction of BGCs representing multiple metabolite classes, a contrast to existing work on medicinal plant endophytes.
