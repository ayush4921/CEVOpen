<p>A number of nearest phylogenomic neighbours to 
 <italic>Serratia</italic> endophytes ME43 and ME47, including 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> AR_0130, BIDMC 81 and UMH6 (Anderson 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), originate from the nosocomial environment, whilst 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> sicaria Ss1 was isolated from the haemolymph of worker bees suffering from sepsis and implicated as a new pathogen of honey bees (Burritt 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). However, isolates of 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> are known to fix nitrogen and act as plant growth promoting endophytic colonisers of rice roots and stems (Gyaneshwar 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Nonclinical isolates of 
 <italic>S. marcescens</italic> have also been used as biocontrol agents (Hallmann 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>) and induce systemic resistance to fungal and viral pathogens (Press 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), as well as the production of the biologically active compound prodigiosin (Khanam and Chandra
