<p>All 16S rRNA gene sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7 online (Katoh, Rozewicki and Yamada 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) with sequences retrieved from the database. Alignments were edited manually using BioEdit (Hall 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) and phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA7 (Kumar, Stecher and Tamura 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) by using the Maximum Likelihood method with the General Time Reversible model and Gamma distribution. Congruent trees were also obtained using other methods, including minimum evolution and LogDet distance, neighbour-joining with Jukes-Cantor algorithm.
