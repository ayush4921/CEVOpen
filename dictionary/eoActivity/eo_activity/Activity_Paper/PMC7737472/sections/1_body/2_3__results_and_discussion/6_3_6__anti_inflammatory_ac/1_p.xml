<p>The carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model is a suitable test for evaluating anti-inflammatory activity. Carrageenan is a high-molecular weight linear polysaccharide that releases inflammatory and proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, histamine, and bradykinin [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The inflammation induced by carrageenan consists of two phases. In the first phase of inflammation (0-1 h), inflammatory mediators such as histamine, bradykinin, and serotonin are released, while in the second phase of inflammation (1–6 h), biologically active inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and various cytokines such as IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> are released [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study, ADBB showed an inhibitory effect on rat hind paw edema in both phases of inflammation with a pronounced inhibitory effect in the second phase, which suggests that ADBB may have inhibited the inflammatory mediators that are released in various phases of inflammation. The anti-inflammatory activity of ADBB and the standard drug diclofenac is summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The extracts displayed significant dose-dependent inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw edema. The ADBB at a dose of 200 mg/kg shows a similar effect to that of the standard drug diclofenac.
