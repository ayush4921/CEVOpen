<p>The anti-inflammatory activity of the plant extract was evaluated using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema model as described by Winter et al. [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] with slight modifications. Wistar rats of different groups were treated orally with standard drug diclofenac and plant extract, as mentioned in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. After 60 min of drug/extract administration, edema was induced in the right hind paw of each rat by subplantar injection of 0.1 mL of freshly prepared carrageenan (1% (w/v) in normal saline). The volume of the right hind paw was measured by using a plethysmometer (UGO Basile 7140, Italy) before the injection and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 h of injection. The differences between the initial and final paw volume readings gave the measurement of inflammation index (
