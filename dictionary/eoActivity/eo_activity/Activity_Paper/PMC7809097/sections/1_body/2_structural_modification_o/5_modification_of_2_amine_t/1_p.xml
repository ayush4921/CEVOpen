<p id="Par75">A new series of thiazole derivatives (3-((2-(pyridin-2-ylamino) thiazol-5-ylmethyl)—amino) benzamides) were discovered by Borzilleri et al., as selective and potent VEGFR-2 kinase inhibitors. Optimization of the discovered compounds led to the exploration of 
 <bold>85</bold> (BMS-605541). In the SAR studies, insertion of a cyclopropyl substituent on amide group was well tolerated. In aqueous acidic conditions, presence of the fluorine in the position 4 of benzamide led to low chemical stability. In case of increasing the electron-deficiency of the benzamide ring, second fluorine was inserted. It was postulated that minimizing the potential of acid-catalyzed hydrolysis will occur in resulting decrease in basicity of the aniline nitrogen. Therefore, enhancing in solution stability at low pH was obtained. Compound 
 <bold>85</bold> was an ATP-competitive inhibitor against VEGFR-2 kinase with

 <sub>i</sub> = 49 ± 9 nM and IC

 <bold>85</bold> illustrated favorable pharmacokinetic profile; a moderate steady-state volume of distribution, low systemic clearance, favorable half-life and mean residence times and 100 and 52% oral bioavailabilities in mouse and monkey, respectively (Fig.
