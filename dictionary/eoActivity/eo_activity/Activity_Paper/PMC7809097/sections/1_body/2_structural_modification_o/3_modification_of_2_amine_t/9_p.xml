<p id="Par48">Several new derivatives of 2-metylamino-4-substituted-1,3-thiazoles were designed and synthesized by Balanean et al. Antiproliferative activity of these compounds were evaluated in three cancer cell lines namely, Hs578T, HeLa, and HepG2. According to the in vitro assay result, compound 
 <bold>51a</bold> showed remarkable antiproliferative against all cell lines that IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for HeLa, Hep2G and Hs578T cell lines obtained 0.823, 5.077 and 4.950 µM, respectively. Structure of this compound consisted of the thiazolic hydrazide-hydrazones and a chromone. Also, the excellent results of compounds 
 <bold>51a</bold> and 
 <bold>51b</bold> on the triple negative breast cancer cell line Hs578T deserved special mention. C-6 substitution of 3-formylchromone caused to exhibit a better antiproliferative effects than parent compound (unsubstitution formylchromone has been the least effective compound), because enhancement of lipophilicity by methyl (
 <bold>51a</bold>) or chloro group increases the compound entry into the cancer cell. Replacing methyl (
 <bold>51a</bold>) with chlorine on C-6 position of chromone scaffold reduced potency except for Hep2G cell lines. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the compound bearing thiophene moiety (
 <bold>51b</bold>) ranged from 7.451 to 16.439 µM. Thence, the better antiproliferative results in case of 
 <bold>51b</bold> on a more invasive breast-cancer cell line (Hs578T) could account for the two biologically active moieties acting synergistically, 2-aminothiazole core and thiophene (Fig.
