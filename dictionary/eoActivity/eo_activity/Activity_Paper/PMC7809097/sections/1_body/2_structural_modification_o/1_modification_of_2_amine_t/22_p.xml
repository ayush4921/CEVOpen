<p id="Par30">A number of 5-arylazoaminothiazole analogues were efficiently synthesized in good yields by Al-Anazi and coworkers. Afterward, the synthesized derivatives were tested against four cell lines HepG2, HEp-2, PC3, and MCF-7 as cytotoxic agents. Analogues 
 <bold>31a-c</bold> displayed high cytotoxicity. Compound 
 <bold>31c</bold> exhibited the similar cytotoxicity to 5-fluorouracil against PC3 cell line and showed lower cytotoxicity against other cells compared to 5-fluorouracil. According to SAR studies, the introduction of methoxy unit as an electron donating group may improve the cytotoxicity compared to presence of nitro unit as an electron withdrawing group. The incorporation of chloroacetyl substituent may enhance the cytotoxicity compared to the insertion of benzoyl or acetyl group (Fig.
