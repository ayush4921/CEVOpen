<p id="Par78">In order to find new entity of Src family kinase inhibitors containing 2-aminothiazole, Das et al. introduced a lead with weak biochemical potency on Lck and low cellular activity through their broad screening. Optimization through SAR iteractions distinguished analogues 
 <bold>5</bold> (Dasatinib, BMS-354825) and 
 <bold>88</bold> that were as very potent 
 <italic>pan</italic>-Src kinase inhibitors in biochemical and cellular assays. Compound 
 <bold>88</bold> (2′′,6′′-di-Me-4′′-pyrimidinyl-substituted) exhibited Lck 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 130 pM, hLck IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1 nM, T-cell IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 80 nM but Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was nearly 30-fold more potent than the lead on T-cells (hLck IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.4 nM and T-cell IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3 nM). Selectivity evaluation on a panel of in-house kinases was determined for compound 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>88</bold>. Compound 
 <bold>88</bold> indicated a potential inhibitory on Src family kinases and Bcr-Abl kinase and showed highly selectivity on other tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases. Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> significantly inhibited the Src family kinases and Bcr-Abl kinase with below nanomolar IC
 <sub>50</sub> and also highly selective on other tested kinases. Using molecular modeling, a putative binding model was determined for Lck inhibition by synthesized compounds. The aniline NH created one H-bond interaction with the Thr316 hydroxyl. Both thiazole nitrogen and amino group in 2-aminothiazole scaffold engaged in H-bond interaction with the NH and carbonyl of Met319. There was a relatively narrow hydrophobic pocket containing Leu251, Tyr318, and Gly322 that interacted with the 2-amino pyrimidine. The 4-hydroxyethylpiperazine residue in compound 
 <bold>5</bold> did not engage in H-bond interactions and approaches the solvent front. The oral efficacy of 
 <bold>88</bold> was further determined in an adjuvant arthritis model in rats. The oral efficacy of these inhibitors was evaluated with compound 
 <bold>88</bold> in inhibiting cytokine IL-2 ex vivo in mice and in reducing TNF levels in vivo in an acute murine model inflammation. Dasatinib (
 <bold>5</bold>) was used currently for the treatment of CML in clinical trials (Fig.
