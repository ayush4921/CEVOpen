<p id="Par72">The research group of Bestgen, have recognized aryl 2-aminothiazoles 
 <bold>81</bold> as a new class of CK2 (Ser/Thr protein kinase) inhibitors. The compounds binding in allosteric site outside the ATP pocket was confirmed by Enzyme kinetics, STD-NMR, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and native mass spectrometry. This new binding site was identified at the interface between the αC helix and the flexible glycine-rich loop through combination of the data and molecular docking studies. SAR studies revealed that the insertion of a carboxylic acid group turned out to be important that probably involve with ionic interactions in active site, as it could not be removed or replaced by the methyl ester. The lack of an aryl group at position 4 of the aminothiazole scaffold led to inactive analogue. Therefore, the aryl group plays a crucial role in inhibitory activity. Modulation of the electron density of this aromatic ring did not substantially change the inhibitory activity compared with that of the unsubstituted congener, while insertion of a bromo-substituent remarkably enhanced the affinity (

 <bold>82</bold>) obtained from the first hit optimization, showed a favorable selectivity profile with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.4 µM against purified CK2α. As a result, identification of a new class of CK2 inhibitors with targeting an allosteric site offer good potencies for further optimization into selective and drug-like leads (Fig.
