<p id="Par10">In a study by El-Messery et al. a novel series of 2-acetamido- and 2 or 3-propanamido-thiazole analogs was designed and synthesized. At a single dose of 10 µM, these aminothiazoles bearing straight and branched substituent with different carbon chain length were subjected to NCI in vitro assessment for their antitumor activity. Among tested compounds, 
 <bold>8a</bold>, 
 <bold>8b</bold>, and 
 <bold>8c</bold> showed better antitumor activity with broad spectrum. Compound 
 <bold>8a</bold> is the most active one and exhibited moderate activity on colon, melanoma, renal, and breast cancer cell lines. Compounds 
 <bold>8d</bold>, 
 <bold>8e</bold>, 
 <bold>8f</bold>, and 
 <bold>8a</bold> exhibited considerable GI values; 75.5, 69.3, 96.2, and 92.7% against the Leukemia cell line, respectively. The obtained results showed that the introduction of 3-propanamido function (acyl chain of three carbon length) to the 2-aminothiazole core improved activity more than 2-acetamido moiety (acyl chain of two carbon length). Also, antitumor results of the aliphatic substituted thiazoles and the aromatic congeners comparison showed that the aromatic substitution improved the antitumor activity more than 4- or 5-methyl; 4-methyl and 5-ethyl carboxylate derivatives, as exemplified in compound 
 <bold>8a</bold> with its broad-spectrum antitumor activity against nearly all 60 cell lines used in this study (Fig.
