<p id="Par80">Src family kinases (SFKs) are a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes. Considering the aberrant activity of these tyrosine kinases has been motivated Francini et al. to synthesis 2-aminothiazole analogues of dasatinib (
 <bold>5</bold>) and evaluation of their in vitro biological potential use as SFK inhibitors. For this purpose, linker between the 2-aminothiazole moiety and the aromatic ring of dasatinib has been considered as a constraint in terms of exploring the distance between the hinge region and the hydrophobic pocket. They decided to substitute the amidic linker between the thiazole and the phenyl groups with alkyl chains (methyl or ethyl) or to remove it completely. Most of the tested compounds against the SFKs Src, Fyn, Lyn, and Yes were identified as the promising derivatives with K
 <sub>i</sub> values in the range of 90–480 nM. For compound 
 <bold>90</bold> which the thiazole moiety is directly linked to the phenylring, IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for the inhibition of c-Src obtained 97 nM. This derivative also inhibited Yes, Lyn, and Fyn with IC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 220–433 nM. In vitro assays, representative compound exhibited a significant antiproliferative activity on two cancer cell lines (SHSY5Y and K562). The modeling studies were used to find the possible and rational binding mode of designed compounds within the ATP binding site of the enzymes. These derivatives displayed an interaction pathway similar to dasatinib. Because of the absence of amide group in the thiazole family in compared with dasatinib, two H-bonds were found despite three H-bonds in dasatinib. Compounds with a small and flexible R on the pyrimidine ring, could not stabilize their binding to the active site of c-Src enzyme. In both series of synthesized compounds, the best R group with good inhibitory profile was the (2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl group that is present in dasatinib. Compound 
 <bold>90</bold> caused a significant and dose-dependent accumulation of both cell lines in the G
 <sub>1</sub> phase (Fig.
