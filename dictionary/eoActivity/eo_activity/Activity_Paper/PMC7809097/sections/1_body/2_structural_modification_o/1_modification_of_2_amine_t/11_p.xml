<p id="Par19">A new series of 2-arylamido and 2-alkylamido derivatives of 2-amino-4 (isothiocyanatomethy1) thiazole were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro antiproliferative activity using L1210 cells. The 2-(alky1amido) thiazole analogues exhibited moderately antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4-8 µM and for the arylamido derivatives were obtained a remarkable increase in antiproliferative activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.2-1 µM. Compound 
 <bold>18</bold> (2-Benzamido-4-(isothiocyanatornethyl)- thiazole) showed a potential inhibitory against GMP synthetase. Introducing both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating on the benzene ring in due to explore the possibility of further enhancing the activity of this lead compound (
 <bold>18</bold>), was showed that electronic impacts in the benzene ring were not an important determinative of antiproliferative activity for this compound. To seek the importance of the 4-(isothiocyanatomethyl) substituent in compound 
 <bold>18</bold>, the mentioned group was replaced with a 4-chloromethyl moiety on 2-acetamidothiazole and the 2-benzamidothiazole. None of these compounds showed an increase in activity. Thus, it revealed that the isothiocyanatomethyl role was important for the antiproliferative activity of this compound (Fig.
