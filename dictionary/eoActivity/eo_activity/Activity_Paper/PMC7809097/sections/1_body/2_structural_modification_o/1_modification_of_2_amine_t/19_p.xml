<p id="Par27">The research group of Zhang designed and prepared a number of new 2,4-disubstituted thiazole amide derivatives according to crizotinib as a c-Met/ALK inhibitor. These derivatives were evaluated their antiproliferative activities. Several tested compounds showed medium to good antiproliferative activity against four cancerous cell lines A549, HeLa, HT29, and Karpas299 cells. Among these derivatives, compound 
 <bold>28</bold> indicated inhibitory against A549, HeLa, HT29, and Karpas299 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 8.64, 6.05, 0.63 and 13.87 μM, respectively. According to the SAR studies on R group, in terms of cellular activities, the 
 <italic>meta</italic>-halogen showed better antitumor activity to the 
 <italic>meta</italic>-methyl on phenyl ring. The activity of different chloro-substitution positions on the phenyl ring order was 
 <italic>m</italic>-Cl &gt; 3,4-Cl
 <sub>2</sub> &gt; 2,4- Cl
 <sub>2</sub>. A moderate polar function on the phenyl ring was harmful for anticancer activities. When the phenyl ring was replaced by furan ring, the activity was obtained worse than compound 
 <bold>28</bold>. Introduction of the alkyl group on the phenyl ring decreased activity against tested cell lines. In the binding mode, compound 
 <bold>28</bold> was incorporated in binding pocket of the crizotinib. A hydrogen bond was formed by the 2-morpholinoacetamido fragment and Asp1164 and a π–π interaction was formed between the thiazole ring and Met1160. The 2-morpholinoacetamido in derivative 
 <bold>28</bold> and the substituted phenyl ring in crizotinib occupied a similar position of binding pocket. These results provide important clues for further optimization of compound 
 <bold>28</bold> as a potential c-Met inhibitor (Fig.
