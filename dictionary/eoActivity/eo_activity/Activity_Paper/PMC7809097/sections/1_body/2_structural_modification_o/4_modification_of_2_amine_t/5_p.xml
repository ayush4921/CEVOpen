<p id="Par63">To date, few examples of selective SphK2 inhibitors or dual SphK1/SphK2 inhibitors have been reported. Therefore, in a similar study and in related to the previous work, Rex and coworkers, designed and synthesized the potent SphK1/2 inhibitors 
 <bold>72</bold> by using structure-guided design approach. Production of intracellular S1P in human cells and extenuation of vascular permeability in mice were inhibited by synthesized compound but this compound did not decreased tumor cell viability in vitro and in vivo. Determination of human and murine SphK activity was performed in biochemical assays for compound 
 <bold>72</bold>. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of compound 
 <bold>72</bold> for hSphK1, hSphK2, mSphK1 and mSphK2 gained 0.008, 0.060, 0.055, and &gt;5 µM. This compound was inhibited human SphK1, SphK2, and murine SphK1 but displayed a lake of inhibition in murine SphK2. Compound 
 <bold>72</bold> in concentrations less than one micromolar, thoroughly inhibited S1P formation in tumor cells. In 72 h proliferation assays with the same concentration, mentioned compounds did not exhibit effect on viability in a panel with ten tumor cell lines. At concentrations 3 to 30 µM were observed cell death that was probably created by physicochemical properties of this compound. Evaluation of siRNA experiments for SphK1/2 in different cell lines failed to display any statistically remarkable effects on tumor cell viability. As a result, the SphK rheostat do not lead to an important effect on cell viability (Fig.
