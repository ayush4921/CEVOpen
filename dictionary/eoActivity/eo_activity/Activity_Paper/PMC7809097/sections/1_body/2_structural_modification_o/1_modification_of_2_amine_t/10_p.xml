<p id="Par18">Considering 2-aminothiazole as a key building block, Kim et al. found that (E)-N-(5-benzylthiazol2-yl)-3-(furan-2-yl)acrylamide 
 <bold>17</bold> showed potent anticancer activity and proteomics approaches were assumed to recognize the target protein of compound 
 <bold>17</bold>, importin b1 (KPNB1). According to a competitive binding assay by fluorescein-labeled 
 <bold>17</bold>, compound 
 <bold>17</bold> exhibited high binding affinity for KPNB1 with

 <sub>d</sub> value of ~20 nm. Compound 
 <bold>17</bold> displayed inhibitory activity on the importin pathway that was confirmed by western blotting assays for KPNB1, KPNA2, EGFR, ErbB2, and STAT3. Some inhibitors have not penetrated in the cells and a wide range of 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> were obtained for these inhibitors (single-digit micromolar to many hundred micromolar). Overexpression of KPBN1 occurred in many cancer cells whereas siRNA-induced inhibition of KPNB1 significantly inhibited proliferation of cancer cells, while did not affect normal cells. A pyrrole compound, importazole, karyostatin 1 A, peptides, and small protein-like peptidomimetics with binding to KPNB1 inhibited the classical importin pathway. Consequently, compound 
 <bold>17</bold> as a potent and promising lead could be used for the development of KPNB1-targeted anticancer compounds. Fluorescein-labeled 
 <bold>17</bold> as a useful quantitative probe could be applied for the identification and development of new KPNB1 inhibitors (Fig.
