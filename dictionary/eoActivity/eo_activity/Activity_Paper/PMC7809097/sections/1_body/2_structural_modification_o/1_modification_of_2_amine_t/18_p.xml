<p id="Par26">Wu and coworkers designed and prepared a number of new N-(5-benzyl-4-(tert-butyl) thiazol-2-yl)-2-(piperazin-1- yl)acetamides. These derivatives were evaluated for their in vitro antitumor activities against three cell lines the A549, HeLa, and MCF-7 cell lines. Among tested compounds, compound 
 <bold>27</bold> indicated strong antiproliferative activity against two cancer cell lines HeLa and A549. Compound 
 <bold>27</bold> exhibited most inhibitory activity on HeLa cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.6 ± 0.8 µM. Compound 
 <bold>27</bold> was selected for investigation of morphological analysis in the HeLa cell line using acridine orange (AO)/ethidium bromide (EB) double staining and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry on the HeLa cell line. According to the results, compound 
 <bold>27</bold> could cause cell apoptosis induction and G1-phase arrest in the cell cycle of HeLa cells. The SAR studies revealed that R significantly effects on antitumor activities of compounds. When R replaced with C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>, 4-C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>OH and C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub> groups exhibited the best activity against A549 cells, HeLa cells, and MCF-7 cells, respectively. The introduction of piperazine in the structure remarkably increased antitumor activity. Replacement of X with Cl in the 
 <italic>para</italic>-position of phenyl created most activity against three A549 cells, HeLa cells, and MCF-7cell lines (Fig.
