<p id="Par51">A number of aminothiazoles derivatives were prepared and assessed against eight cancer cells and two non-cancer fibroblasts. Some of compounds exhibited the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value below 5 µM in CCRF-CEM cells. Compound 
 <bold>55</bold> was identified as the best candidate for new anticancer drug exploration with therapeutic index &gt; 21. Its cytotoxicity on both fibroblasts was higher than 50 µM resulting in interesting therapeutic index values. This derivative with the free amino and the free C-28 carboxylic units exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.4 µM against CCRF-CEM cells. More importantly, aminothiazoles containing unsubstituted amino moiety 
 <bold>55</bold> (derivatives of betulonic acid) had better activity in CCRF-CEM cell line than most of the aminothiazoles containing the substituted amino group. It was demonstrated quite a high stability in human plasma (after incubation for 2 h, 85–100% of the original quantity of substance is remaining). Microsomal stability was the main mechanism of plasma clearance and showed sufficient stability in hepatic microsomes with low or medium category of intrinsic clearance. Compounds 
 <bold>55</bold> proved the strongest apoptotic activity. Protein expression analysis showed caspase 3 and 7 activation, as well as PARP cleavage in cells treated by 
 <bold>55</bold> (Fig.
