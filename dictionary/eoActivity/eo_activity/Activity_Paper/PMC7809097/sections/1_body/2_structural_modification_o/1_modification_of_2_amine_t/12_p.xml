<p id="Par20">Tubulin polymerization inhibitors had emerged as one of promising anticancer therapeutics because of their dual mechanism of action, i.e. apoptosis by cell-cycle arrest and vascular disrupting agent. In a study in 2010, Lee and coworkers have used benzophenone core to identify new tubulin inhibitors with potent cytotoxicity and strong tubulin polymerization inhibition as strong in vivo antitumor activity. A number of derivatives were synthesized by introduction of small heterocycles in B-ring of the structure and were assessed for their in vitro cytotoxicity, inhibition of tubulin polymerization, and in vivo antitumor activity. According to the results, compound 
 <bold>19</bold> (a valine prodrug) indicated potential cytotoxicity against some cancer cells such as P-gp overexpressing MDR positive cell line (HCT15). Inhibitory activity of compound 
 <bold>19</bold> on tubulin polymerization significantly induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase of HL60 cells. Therefore, Compound 
 <bold>19</bold> with improved aqueous solubility displayed significant antitumor activity against murine tumors and human xenogratfs in mice dose-dependently. This analogue (
 <bold>19</bold>) with good profiles was assessed in preclinical toxicology studies and improved to phase 1 clinical trial. The SAR studies indicated that trimethoxy groups in the A-ring of structure are critical for in vitro activity (Fig.
