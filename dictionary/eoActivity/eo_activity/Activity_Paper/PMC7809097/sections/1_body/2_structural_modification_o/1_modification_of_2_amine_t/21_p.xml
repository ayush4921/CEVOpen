<p id="Par29">Sirtuins are NAD
 <sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacylases that cleave off acetyl, but also other acyl groups from the ε-amino group of lysines in histones and other substrate proteins. Disregulation of human Sirt2 (hSirt2) activity has been associated with the pathogenesis of cancer, which makes the modulation of hSirt2 activity a promising strategy for pharmaceutical intervention. In continuation the previous work, Schiedel et al. recently discovered the Sirtuin Rearranging Ligand (
 <bold>30)</bold> as very potent and selective hSirt2 inhibitors. In this work, they investigated structure-activity relationship of SirReals (the sirtuin rearranging ligands) that rationalizes the unique features of this compound and search the modifications limits on this scaffold. As specified in the structure, the 4,6-dimethylpyrimidine moiety was important for the binding of the ligand to formed ‘selectivity pocket’. However, a switch from the aminothiazole to the aminothiadiazole scaffold was shown to lead to a loss in potency. In the absence of the methyl groups at the 4 and/or 6 position of pyrimidine ring, led to lose its affinity. Presence of bulky groups or high degree of methylation decreased potency and presence of polar substituents at the pyrimidine ring such as −OH or −NH
 <sub>2</sub>, did not improved potency. The ligands with 1- naphthyl substituted showed the superiority to substituted phenyl moieties or 2-naphthyl, biphenyl. Insertion of a substituent at the 4- position of the phenyl was unfavorable because of the proximity of Phe234, but the substituent in the 3-position of the phenyl was tolerated within the acyl-lysine channel. Most importantly, chlorination or bromination of the naphthyl in position 7 improved the in vitro activity. The 7-halonaphthyl substituent fills the lipophilic naphthyl binding site more efficiently than the unsubstituted naphthyl moiety, and thereby allows further hydrophobic interactions. The carbonyl-O of the amide also forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl-O of Pro94. Also, an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the amide N-H and one of the nitrogen atoms of the dimethylpyrimidine ring has formed. It is clearly demonstrated that the presence of all three functional elements, namely: arylmethyl, aminothiazole, and 4,6-dimethylpyrimidine are crucial for efficient inhibition of hSirt2 activity (Fig.
