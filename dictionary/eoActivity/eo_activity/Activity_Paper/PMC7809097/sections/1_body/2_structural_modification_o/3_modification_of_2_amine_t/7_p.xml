<p id="Par46">Hopping to investigate novel 2-aminothiazole compounds incorporating different heterocycles to possess great antitumor activity, directed El-serwy et al. to synthesize a number of 4-(5-methylisoxazol-3-ylamino) thiazole derivatives and evaluate anticancer activity on HCT-116, HePG-2, and MCF-7 cell lines. Compound 
 <bold>49a</bold> showed the most cytotoxic effects against HePG-2 and moderate against MCF-7 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.2 µg/ mL and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 60.9 µg/ mL, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>49b</bold> exhibited the highest antitumor activity against MCF7 cell line (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.2 µg/ mL) in comparison with doxorubicin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.3 µg/ mL). In addition to, compound 
 <bold>49a</bold> inhibited EGFR, PI3K and p38α kinases and identified as multi-targeted. Performing the docking studies for binding modes of compound 
 <bold>49a</bold> investigated that in EGFR kinase, three H-bonds donors formed between NH
 <sub>2</sub> linked to thiazole ring and Ala719, Leu764 and Thr766. One H-bond acceptor established between Thr766 and the nitrogen of thiazole ring and other hydrogen bond acceptor made between the nitrogen of isoxazole ring with Thr830. In P13Kβ kinase, there were three hydrogen bonds between compound 
 <bold>49a</bold> with receptor. Two H-bonds donors formed between hydrogens of NH
 <sub>2</sub> and Asp807 and Tyr833 and other H-bond was as H-bond acceptor that Tyr833 interacted with nitrogen of thiazole. Two H-bond donors established between NH
 <sub>2</sub> group with Ala51 and Leu104. In addition, one H-bond acceptor formed between nitrogen of isoxazole and Lys 53 (Fig.
