<p id="Par88">In the study by Altintop et al. various thiazolyl hydrazone derivatives designed and synthesized. These derivatives evaluated for anticancer activity with targeting Akt on A549, C6 rat glioma, and NIH/3T3 cell lines. Compound 
 <bold>99</bold> was the most potent and selective inhibitor than other derivatives against A549 and C6 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12 ± 1.73 µM and 3.83 ± 0.76 µM, respectively and Akt inhibitory percentage of compound 
 <bold>99</bold> on C6 Cell line was 71.66 ± 4.09% and on A549 Cell Line was 45.77 ± 10.58%. In addition, early and late apoptotic cell population (32.8%) were increased in C6 cell line by compound 
 <bold>99</bold> more than cisplatin (28.8%) and notably inhibited the Akt enzyme. They studied the Akt active site and binding mode of compound 
 <bold>99</bold> by performing molecular docking analysis. The phenyl ring of compound 
 <bold>99</bold> formed π–π stacking interaction and a direct hydrophobic interaction with phenyl ring in the Tyr272 residue of the active site of Akt. Based on Lipinski’s rule of five, compound 
 <bold>99</bold> was predicted as a potential orally bioavailable agent (Fig.
