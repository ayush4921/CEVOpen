<p id="Par86">Zhou and coworkers designed and prepared a number of new thiazolyl Schiff bases by combination of a novel series of 2-aminothiazole with an arylidene moiety bearing different substituents. These compounds were evaluated for their antitumor activity against three different human tumor cell lines including HL-60; leukemia, BGC-823; stomach and HEP-2; larynx cancer by the MTT method and the SRB method. Among these compounds, compound 
 <bold>97</bold> displayed acceptable antitumor activity and the highest inhibition percentage with 91.97, 98.49, and 91.16% for HL-60, BGC-823, and HEP-2, respectively. These selected compounds can be used for further in vitro assay against a wide panel of human cancer cell lines and the most active compounds were selected for preclinical in vivo studies (Fig.
