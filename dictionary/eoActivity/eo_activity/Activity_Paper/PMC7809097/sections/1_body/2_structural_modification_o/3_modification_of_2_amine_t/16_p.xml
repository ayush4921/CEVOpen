<p id="Par55">In a similar study close to the latter work and taking into consideration above results, Romagnoli et al. have synthesized a new series of 2-substituted-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-5-aryl thiazoles, all of which retain at the C4- and C5-positions of the thiazole ring the same substituents as derivatives 
 <bold>60a-e</bold>, examining the effect on biological activity derived by replacement of the amino group at the C2-position of the thiazole nucleus with different moieties, such as N-methylamine, N,N-dimethylamine and methyl. The potency at the 2-position increased as follows: NHCH
 <sub>3</sub> &gt; CH
 <sub>3</sub> &gt;&gt; N(CH
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub>. Presence of N-methylamino at the 2-position of thiazole remarkably improved antiproliferative effects against MCF-7 cells with respect to C2-amino counterparts and N,N-dimethylamino decrease 1-2 log in activity. The 2N-methylamino thiazole derivatives 
 <bold>61a</bold>-
 <bold>c</bold> were the most active compounds as antiproliferative agents, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from low micromolar to single-digit nanomolar. Among these synthesized compounds, derivative 
 <bold>61c</bold> showed more potency. These compounds also showed activity on multidrug-resistant cell lines over-expressing P-glycoprotein. The compounds interacted with colchicines site of tubulin polymerization and interference with microtubule probably exhibited antiproliferative effect. Its IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for inhibiting tubulin polymerization was 0.89 µM and the percentage of colchicine binding inhibition yielded 83%. Compound 
 <bold>61c</bold> using the activation of caspase 2, 3, and 8 induced apoptosis and did not made mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (Fig.
