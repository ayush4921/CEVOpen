<p id="Par47">Ali et al. were incentive for synthesizing a number of acetamide derivatives including 2-amino-4-arylthiazoles and different piperazines by the potential anticancer activity of them. Some of compounds indicated high anticancer activity in 10
 <sup>-5</sup>M in full of NCI 60 cell panel. In docking studies, some of them exhibited a reasonable docking score. In this study, drug likeness, drug score, ADME properties also were predicted for derivatives. Evaluation of toxicities for synthesized derivatives indicated that compounds 
 <bold>50a</bold> and 
 <bold>50b</bold> were the most active members with mean percentage growth values of 89.88 and 91.67%, respectively. Compounds 
 <bold>50a</bold> and 
 <bold>50b</bold> indicated the lowest mean percentage growth over 60 cell line. Compounds 
 <bold>50b</bold> showed moderate activity against ovarian OVCAR-4 cancer cell line (mean percentage cell growth = 77.23%). The presence of different substituent on phenyl ring affected on their activity, for example, introduction of chloro group in compound 
 <bold>50b</bold> has increased potency towards 
 <italic>Leukemia SR</italic> and 
 <italic>MOLT-4</italic> and the absence of substituent in phenyl ring in 
 <bold>50a</bold> led to increase the potency towards CNS SNB-75 and Renal UO-31 cancer cell lines. Also, unsubstituted phenyl ring showed more enhanced potency towards both these two cell lines with cell promotion percentage of 59.05 and 72.32%, respectively (Fig.
