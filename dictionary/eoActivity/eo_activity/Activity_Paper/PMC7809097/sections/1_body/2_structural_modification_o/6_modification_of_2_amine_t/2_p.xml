<p id="Par79">Dasatinib is an orally active nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also inhibited tumor growth and angiogenesis by inhibiting PDGFR-β and SFKs in tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells. Encouraged by the successful development of dasatinib, several hydrophobic chains have been utilized in order to modification of Dasatinib and reported by Paunescu et al. Derivatives were assessed for their in vitro antiproliferative selectivity and in vivo antiangiogenic activity. Replacing of the hydroxyl group in dasatinib with alkyl and perfluoroalkyl chains led to a change in the selectivity profile by increasing the selectivity along with reducing in sensitivity of the drug. Increasing size of chain in derivatives showed significantly less inhibitory against A2780 cancer cells and a reasonable activity against ECRF24 cells. Moreover, these derivatives were inactive against human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) with IC
