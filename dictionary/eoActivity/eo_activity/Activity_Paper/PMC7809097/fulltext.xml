In a study in 2010, Lee and coworkers have used benzophenone core to identify new tubulin inhibitors with potent cytotoxicity and strong tubulin polymerization inhibition as strong in vivo antitumor activity. A number of derivatives were synthesized by introduction of small heterocycles in B-ring of the structure and were assessed for their in vitro cytotoxicity, inhibition of tubulin polymerization, and in vivo antitumor activity.

Disregulation of human Sirt2 (hSirt2) activity has been associated with the pathogenesis of cancer, which makes the modulation of hSirt2 activity a promising strategy for pharmaceutical intervention. In continuation the previous work, Schiedel et al. recently discovered the Sirtuin Rearranging Ligand (<bold>30)</bold> as very potent and selective hSirt2 inhibitors. In this work, they investigated structure-activity relationship of SirReals (the sirtuin rearranging ligands) that rationalizes the unique features of this compound and search the modifications limits on this scaffold. As specified in the structure, the 4,6-dimethylpyrimidine moiety was important for the binding of the ligand to formed &#x02018;selectivity pocket&#x02019;. However, a switch from the aminothiazole to the aminothiadiazole scaffold was shown to lead to a loss in potency. In the absence of the methyl groups at the 4 and/or 6 position of pyrimidine ring, led to lose its affinity. Presence of bulky groups or high degree of methylation decreased potency and presence of polar substituents at the pyrimidine ring such as &#x02212;OH or &#x02212;NH<sub>2</sub>, did not improved potency. The ligands with 1- naphthyl substituted showed the superiority to substituted phenyl moieties or 2-naphthyl, biphenyl. Insertion of a substituent at the 4- position of the phenyl was unfavorable because of the proximity of Phe234, but the substituent in the 3-position of the phenyl was tolerated within the acyl-lysine channel. Most importantly, chlorination or bromination of the naphthyl in position 7 improved the in vitro activity. The 7-halonaphthyl substituent fills the lipophilic naphthyl binding site more efficiently than the unsubstituted naphthyl moiety, and thereby allows further hydrophobic interactions. The carbonyl-O of the amide also forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl-O of Pro94. Also, an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the amide N-H and one of the nitrogen atoms of the dimethylpyrimidine ring has formed. It is clearly demonstrated that the presence of all three functional elements, namely: arylmethyl, aminothiazole, and 4,6-dimethylpyrimidine are crucial for efficient inhibition of hSirt2 activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">A number of 5-arylazoaminothiazole analogues were efficiently synthesized in good yields by Al-Anazi and coworkers.

FTase inhibitors (FTis) are considered as antiproliferative and actively antineoplastics agents. The use of CAAX as a template is one of the classical approaches to the design of FTis. Valoti et al. have developed the SS stereoisomers of 2-o-tolyl substituted 4-hydroxybenzamide of methionine methyl ester, etherified at the phenolic function with pyridodioxan-2-ylmethyl, which exert a significant antiproliferative effect interfering with Ras farnesylation. Recently in a continuation of their strategy to identify new FTis and based on these preceding findings, they have considered the substitution of 3-pyridyl with other aromatic heterocycles.

Synthesized derivatives were classified to three groups; pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, and tested for their antiproliferative activities on MCF-7, HepG2 and SW480. In SAR studies, presence of various cyclic amine stocks to the thiazole core and substituent on the phenyl were assessed for antiproliferative profile. As a result, more favorable ring for antiproliferative activity was pyrrolidine ring.

The original hit inhibited CDK2/Cyclin A in an ATP-competitive manner with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 808&#x02009;nM. In docking model of original hit, residues Val18, Ala31, Val64, Leu134, Ala144 formed two hydrophobic surfaces that interacted with thiazole ring. A hydrogen bond was formed between the nitrogen of the thiazole ring and the amide nitrogen of Leu83 and other hydrogen bond created between the amide-NH of compound 46 and carbonyl oxygen of Leu83.

The nitrogen-based heterocycles demonstrated significantly active on HCT116 (human colon cancer) cell line such as compounds with imidazole, pyrrole, and pyridine rings. As a result, the existence of special heteroatom and also existence of an additional benzene ring, showed a remarkable effect against MCF-7 and DU-145, and S-heterocycles were more active against these cell lines, whereas, N-heterocycles played an important role against HCT116 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Modification of 2-amine to 2-hydrazone</title><p id="Par88">In the study by Altintop et al. various thiazolyl hydrazone derivatives designed and synthesized.
