 </italic>. Among them only 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> is grown commercially. Recently, two accessions of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum zeylanicum</italic> named as “Sri Wijaya” and “Sri Gemunu” have been developed for commercial cultivation with improved chemical profiles and yields (
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Azad et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, scientific evidence on biological activities and the anti-diabetic properties of these novel Cinnamon varieties have not been explored. This study was conducted with the objective of to evaluate six types of aqueous extracts of SW and SG cinnamon quill varieties and commercially available CC quills for their in vitro anti-diabetic activities and compare them with the standard hypoglycemic drug Acarbose. The study was further extended to explore the phytochemical profiles of different Ceylon cinnamon extracts.
