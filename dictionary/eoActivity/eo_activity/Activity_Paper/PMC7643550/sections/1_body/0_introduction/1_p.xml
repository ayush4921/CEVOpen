<p>Diabetes is a progressive metabolic disorder with multiple health effects and complications (

 </italic>). The inhibitors of these enzymes restrict the digestion of dietary carbohydrates, thus subsequently prevent the absorption of simple sugars leading to low postprandial glucose levels in the blood. In addition, herbal extracts are also rich in natural antioxidants, which may help to reduce the risk of developing DMT2 (
