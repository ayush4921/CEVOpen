<p>The α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzyme inhibitory activities of cinnamon extracts are expressed in terms of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, and the lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> is an indicative of a stronger inhibition. SW, PWE exhibited the highest inhibitory activity (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) for α -glucosidase and α-amylase (42 ± 8 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 78 ± 7 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively) followed by SW, DWE (116 ± 17 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 132 ± 11 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively). The inhibition of these extracts were comparable with the positive control, Acarbose (173 ± 7 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> and 95 ± 4 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively) (
