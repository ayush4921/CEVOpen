<p>The Folin-Ciocalteu method

 </italic> was used to determine the TPC. The plant extract (3.00 mg extract dry weight) was mixed with 10% Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (5.00 mL) and the mixture was incubated at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C) for five minutes. Sodium carbonate (4.00 mL, 7.5% v/w) was added and the mixture was allowed to stand for one hour at room temperature (28 ± 2 °C). The absorbance was measured at 765 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. A calibration curve for Gallic acid in concentrations from 0.02 mg/mL to 1.00 mg/mL (
