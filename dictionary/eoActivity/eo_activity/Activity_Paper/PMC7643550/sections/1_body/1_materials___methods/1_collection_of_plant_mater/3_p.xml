<p>Cinnamon quills (10 g) were pulverized using a 0.50 mm mesh. For the microwave digestion (MD), the sample (10 g) was digested with distilled water (80 mL) for 30 min using a microwave digester (mass 6 instrument, vessel type Mars Xpress). Pulverized Cinnamon quills (10 g) were extracted with pressurized water (200 mL at 0.098 MPa, for 10 min) for the preparation of pressurized water extract (PWE). Quills of Cinnamon (40 g) were extracted by traditional steam distillation (SD) and 10 g were extracted by solvent extraction (SE) using 75% ethanol

 </italic> For the preparation of decoction water extract (DWE), Cinnamon quills (10 g) were boiled with water (200 mL) until the volume was reduced to 1/8. Ten grams of Cinnamon powder was mixed with boiled water (200 mL) and that was allowed to stand for five minutes to obtain the infusion water extract (IWE). The MD, PWE, DWE, and IWE were filtered through Whatman 1 filter paper and concentrated under vacuum at 45 °C and further dried by passing a stream of N
 <sub>2</sub> air. The percentage yield was calculated and stored at −20 °C. The volatile compounds from SD were separated from the aqueous layer three times using hexane (30 mL). The volatiles were concentrated by using rotary evaporator (IKA
 <sup>
  <sup>®</sup>
 </sup> RV 10 basic, Germany). The percentage yield of the resultant oleoresin was calculated and the oleoresin was stored at −20 °C.
