<p id="Par58">Our results showed that the hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves possesses high antioxidant potential, anti-inflammatory property and cytotoxic activity on MCF-7 and Jurkat cancer cell lines. These properties could be attributed to the presence of appreciable amounts of total phenol and flavonoids, as well as to the presence of macro/micro-elements such as magnesium, phosphorus, sulphur, manganese, copper and zinc. However, the presence of heavy metals such as cadmium detected in 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves could explain the toxic effects of the hydro-ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> previously reported in the literature. Altogether, our findings could explain the use of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves in the traditional management of cancer patients and justify the use of this plant as a source for the discovery of new anticancer agents with cytotoxic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
