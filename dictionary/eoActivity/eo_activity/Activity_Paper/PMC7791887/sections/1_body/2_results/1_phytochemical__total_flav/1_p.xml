<p id="Par45">The phytochemical screening of NLE revealed the presence of triterpenoids, saponins, flavonoids, tannins and phenolic compounds and the absence of alkaloids. The total flavonoid content of NLE was expressed as quercetin equivalent and extrapolated from the standard curve of quercetin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.1-A). Concentrations of 0.31 and 0.63 mg/ml of NLE contained 1.8 and 2.2 g of total flavonoid per 100 g of quercetin equivalent, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.1-B). In the other hand, the total phenolic content of NLE, expressed as gallic acid equivalent, was extrapolated from the standard curve of gallic acid (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.2-A). At concentrations of 2.5; 5.0 and 10.0 mg/ml of NLE, the total phenolic contents determined were 10.5; 11.8 and 10.6 g /100 g of gallic acid equivalent, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.2-B).
