<p id="Par51">The effect of NLE on MCF-7, Jurkat and Chang liver cell lines proliferation is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. The extract and curcumin (positive control) exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of MCF-7 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.180 and 155 μg/ml for curcumin and NLE, respectively. The difference between the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of NLE and curcumin were statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Both NLE and curcumin inhibited the growth of Jurkat cells in a concentration-dependent fashion with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.056 and 87.29 μg/ml for curcumin and NLE respectively and the difference was found to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). The extract and curcumin exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition on Chang liver cell growth with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 204.2 and 2.568 μg/ml for NLE and curcumin respectively and this difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001).
