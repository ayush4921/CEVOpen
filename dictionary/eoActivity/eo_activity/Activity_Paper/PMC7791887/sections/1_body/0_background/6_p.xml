 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> is known to possess numerous ethnomedicinal properties and often used in the treatment of rheumatic pains, tumours and cancers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Reports of phytochemical analysis showed that the major bioactive metabolites in 
 <italic>Nymphaea</italic> species are flavonoids and phenolic compounds, and that 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> contains very special macrocyclic flavonoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Based on earlier studies, one can say that 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> would be a good source of new isolates with high antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic potentials.
