<p id="Par54">The elemental content of NLE sample was measured by energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (ED-XRF). It is a fast, reliable and powerful analytical tool for the determination of the elemental composition of diverse materials (particularly for high energy elements) and does not produce waste and requires no chemical reagents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. A total of nine 9 macro and 11 micro-elements were identified and quantified in the NLE sample (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The content of various elements analyzed in 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves decreases in the order: Si &gt; K &gt; Ca &gt; Mg &gt; Al &gt; Fe &gt; S &gt; P &gt; Mn &gt; Ag &gt; Zn &gt; Rb &gt; Sr &gt; Cd &gt; Th &gt; Zr &gt; Cu &gt; Nb &gt; Y. Macro-elements such as magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), sulphur (S) and micro-elements such as manganese (Mn), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) present in NLE sample have been reported to be relevant elements as anti-cancer adjuvants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. These elements are known to play important roles in cellular metabolism, as co-factors in numerous enzymatic activities, or as important components of structural proteins such as hormones involved in cancer therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Copper and zinc have been reported to be involved in the elimination of free radicals through cascading enzyme systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Thus, the presence of these elements in NLE could support the traditional use of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> as an anticancer medicinal plant and also explain the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of NLE reported in this study. Moreover, cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal, was detected in the NLE sample. Lead was below the detectable limit. These findings are almost similar to results reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] using a flame photometer and an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS). This finding proved that results obtained using ED-XRF or AAS methods are not significantly different [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. However, it is important to note that acute or chronic exposure of an organism to these toxic elements (which are usually contaminants from the environment) present in medicinal plants could result in the development of unwanted toxicopathies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of these toxic elements (but not 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> itself) could explain the toxic effects of the hydro-ethanolic and hydro-methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> reported in the literature. These toxic effects were characterised by an induction of a chromosomal aberration in rat lymphocytes, an increase of aberrant sperm cells and somatic genotoxicity [
