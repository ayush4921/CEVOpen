<p id="Par42">Cytotoxic effects of NLE and curcumin on cell lines were determined using an MTT assay as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Briefly, for adherent cells, after 48 h of treatment incubation, 15 μl of MTT [5 mg/ml] in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. MTT was flicked off and the formed formazan crystals solubilised in 100 μl of DMSO. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm, using a microplate spectrophotometer (Tecan Infinite M200 Pro plate reader, Austria). For suspension cells (Jurkat), after 48-h treatment, the medium was discarded and 20 μl/well of MTT solution [5 mg/ml] added. The plate was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Finally, 20 μl of isopropanol was added to each well and the plate read using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 590 nm. The percentage of cell inhibition was determined using the formula:
