<p id="Par34">The lipid peroxidation assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Briefly, 100 μL of different concentrations of NLE extract, obtained by twofold dilutions, were added to 1 ml of egg lecithin [3 mg/ml] in phosphate buffer. 10 μL of FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> [400 mM] and 10 μL of L-ascorbic acid [200 mM] were then added to induce lipid peroxidation. After incubation for 1 h, at 37 °C, 1 ml of 15% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and 1 ml of 0.375% tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) in 20% acetic acid were added to stop the reaction. The mixture was boiled for 15 min, allowed to cool and centrifuged at 300 g. Absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 532 nm.
