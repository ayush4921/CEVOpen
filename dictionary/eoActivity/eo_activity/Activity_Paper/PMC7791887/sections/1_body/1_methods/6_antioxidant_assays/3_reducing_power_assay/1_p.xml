<p id="Par35">The reducing power assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Briefly, 200 μL of NLE extract were added and mixed to 200 μL of potassium ferricyanide. The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min, and a volume of 200 μL of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was then added and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min. Two hundred (200) μL of the supernatant were pipetted into a tube, and 200 μL of distilled water and 40 μL of ferric chloride were added. The blank was a solution with all reagents except the NLE. The resulting solution was incubated for 30 min and pipetted into well plates, after which absorbance was read at 700 nm. Ascorbic acid and BHT were used as positive controls.
