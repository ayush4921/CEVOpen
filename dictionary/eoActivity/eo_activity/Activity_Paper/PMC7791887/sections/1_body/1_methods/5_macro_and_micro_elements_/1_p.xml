<p id="Par32">The screening of macro and micro-elements found in 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> was determined as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Briefly, the powder of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves was kept at 60 °C overnight in an oven before pelletisation and subsequent measurement. Triplicate measured samples (4 g/sample) and 0.9 g of a binder (Fluxana H Elektronic BM-0002-1, Licowax C micro powder PM-Hoechstwax, Germany) were homogenized using the RETSCH Mixer Mill (MM301, Germany) and pressed with a manual hydraulic press (SPECAC, UK) to obtain pellets of 32 mm in diameter and 3 mm thickness. These were used for subsequent XRF measurements. The detection limit for light elements (Si, Al, Mg and Na) was in the range of 25–50 ppm. For heavy metals, 1–5 ppm was the limit of detection. Calibration was factory done using international rock standards. Simultaneous measurement and analysis of the elemental contents of the samples of 
 <italic>N. lotus</italic> leaves were performed using a SPECTRO X-Lab 2000 spectrometer.
