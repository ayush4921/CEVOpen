<p>Carnosol (
 <bold>1</bold>) has been reported to demonstrate significant antidiabetic activities in different models with different mechanisms of action. It increases skeletal muscle cell glucose uptake via 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent GLUT4 glucose transporter translocation, which is targeted for glucose homeostasis, meaning that it could be a potential antidiabetic compound. Furthermore, structural features of the abietane diterpenes reported to have antidiabetic activity contain COOH groups, lactone rings, and steroid type structures [

 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] as well as ameliorating diabetes complications by modulating oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, carnosol can deactivate intracellular de novo triglyceride synthesis by 67.5–90.6% without affecting cell viability [
 <xref rid="B35-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and possesses powerful inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 62.5 µM against rat liver diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1), an enzyme responsible for triglyceride synthesis [

 <italic>O</italic>-methylrosmanol (
 <bold>3</bold>) has been reported to diminish forskolin (FSK)-induced luciferase expression when monitored by cAMP/response element (CRE) [
 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Hence, the suppression of cAMP/protein kinase response of the 
 <italic>PEPCK-C</italic> or 
 <italic>G6Pase</italic> gene may add to the antihyperglycemic activity, which is one of the keys in the management of diabetes [
 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity demonstrated by 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> are in agreement with some published data reporting on different mechanisms of action exhibited by these compounds [
