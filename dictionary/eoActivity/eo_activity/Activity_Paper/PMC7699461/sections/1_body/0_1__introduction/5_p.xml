<p>This is the first scientific study to be carried out on the phytochemical isolation and biological investigation of 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic>. The findings suggest that these compounds might possibly become prominent natural candidates to inhibit alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase as well as oxidative stress related to diabetes with the prospect to be used in the formulation of diabetes drugs upon further biological studies.
