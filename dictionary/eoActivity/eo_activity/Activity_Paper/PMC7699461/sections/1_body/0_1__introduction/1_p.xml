<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most dangerous metabolic diseases with a high rate of mortality worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is characterized either by a shortage in insulin production or by the degradation of produced insulin. Among the well-known existing types of DM, types 1 and 2 are the most predominant. Treatment of type 1 DM demands insulin injection, while type 2 DM requires the usage of diet control, physical exercises, and utilization of synthetic antidiabetic drugs [
 <xref rid="B3-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Type 2 DM, which is mainly provoked by the degradation of produced insulin, affects more people in contrast with other types of diabetes, and patients do not rely on exogenous insulin for the prevention of ketonuria as well as ketosis [

 <xref rid="B4-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which is basically caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, whereby insulin receptors or other intermediates in the insulin signaling pathways inside the cells are not sensitive to insulin [
 <xref rid="B5-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It results in the inability of glucose to go into the tissue, causing hyperglycemia or uplifted level of glucose concentrations in blood [
