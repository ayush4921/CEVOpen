<p>The phytochemical and biological investigations of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic> disclosed that this plant is a rich source of abietane diterpenes with strong alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities as well as excellent antioxidant capacities. This is the first scientific report on the phytochemical isolation and biological evaluation of alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>S. aurita,</italic> and the results possibly suggest that the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. aurita</italic> and/or its individual isolated compounds might become notable natural therapeutic candidates against alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase enzymes and oxidative stress. Therefore, compounds that demonstrate remarkable alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory and antioxidant capacities might be very good candidates for controlling the oxidative stress, plasma glucose level and accompany complications in diabetic patients.
