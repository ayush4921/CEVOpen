<p>The alpha-glucosidase assay of the tested compounds (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>) was conducted according to the standard method with slight modification [
 <xref rid="B22-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Inside the 96-well plate, 50 μL of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH = 6. 8), 10 μL alpha-glucosidase (1 U/mL), 20 µL of samples, and standard (acarbose) of different concentration were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Briefly, 20 μL of 5 mM substrate (4-nitrophenyl β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside) was added to each well and left to incubate for 20 min at 37 °C. The reacting mixture was stopped after incubation by adding 0.1 M sodium carbonate (50 μL). The release of p-nitrophenol of the reacting mixture relating to the activity of the enzyme was read at a wavelength of 405 nm using a multiplate reader (Multiskan, Thermo Scientific). The result represents the mean of three independent experiments and is expressed as percentage inhibition calculated as stated below:
 <disp-formula>Percentage inhibitory activity (%) = (1 − A/B) × 100</disp-formula> where, A is the absorbance in the presence of test substance, and B is the absorbance in the presence of phosphate buffer (control).
