<p>The FRAP assay was assessed according to the method of Benzie and Strain (1996) [
 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. FRAP reagent containing the mixture of acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), tripyridyl triazine (TPTZ) (10 mM in 40 mM HCl), and 20 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>.6H
 <sub>2</sub>O in ratio 10:1:1 (v/v/v) was used. Extract, compounds, or standard (10 µL) was added to 300 µL FRAP reagent, incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. The reacting mixture was read at a wavelength of 593 nm in a multiplate reader. Ascorbic acid was used as standard at varying concentrations of 0 to 1000 µM. The result was presented as a mean of independent triplicate experiments and expressed as µM ascorbic acid equivalents per milligram dry weight (µM AAE/g) of the test samples.
