<p>The TEAC assay was evaluated following the method of Pellegrini et al. (1999) [
 <xref rid="B25-antioxidants-09-01149" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The working solution containing 88 µL of K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> (140 mM) and 5 mL ABTS (7 mM) was kept for at least 16 h in the dark at 25 °C. The working solution was then diluted after 16 h with ethanol until the absorbance read approximately 2.0 (±0.1). The extract, purified compounds, or standard (25 µL) was mixed with 300 µL working solution and allowed to incubate in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Trolox was used as the standard using a concentration range between 0 and 500 µM. The absorbance of the reaction was read at a wavelength of 734 nm using a multiplate reader.
