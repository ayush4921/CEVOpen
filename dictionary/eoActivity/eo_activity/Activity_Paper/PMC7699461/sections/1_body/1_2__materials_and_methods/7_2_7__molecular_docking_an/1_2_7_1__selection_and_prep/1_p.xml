<p>The chemical structures of five pure compounds were obtained from the PubChem compound database (
 <uri xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</uri>). The Molfiles Structure Data File (MOL SDF) formats of these compounds were converted to Protein Data Bank, Partial Charge (Q), and Atom Type (T) (PDBQT) file using the PyRx tool to generate atomic coordinates, and energy was minimized by optimization using the optimization algorithm at force field set at mmff94 (required) on PyRx.
