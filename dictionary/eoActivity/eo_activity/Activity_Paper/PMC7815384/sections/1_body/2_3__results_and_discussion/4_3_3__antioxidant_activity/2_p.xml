<p>DPPH is a molecule containing stable free radicals, whose purple color decreases following actions of proton radical scavengers and which can be monitored by a spectrophotometer. The activity of all the extracts was revealed by the discoloration of DPPH. The percent scavenging of the extracts at different concentrations has been presented in
