<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD), identified in 1907, is the still most devastating degenerative disorder of the elderly people that damages the brain and results in loss of memory and cognition. In 2019, the number of AD patients was estimated to be 50 million worldwide, which is expected to be tripled by 2050 [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One of the major reasons for the increased prevalence of AD is the lack of effective drugs for its complete cure. The development of potent AD drugs is therefore a great challenge to control this devastating disorder. Currently, the most promising approach to prevent and treat AD is to increase the level of acetylcholine in the brain, which gradually becomes deficient during the course of the disease, using cholinesterase inhibitors [

Inhibitors of cholinesterases, the enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of acetylcholine, increase the endogenous level of acetylcholine by reducing the catalysis and enhance the cholinergic transmission in the brain, leading to improvement of memory and cognition in AD patients [

The multifactorial nature of the disease and the toxicities of the currently used drugs necessitate the development of safe and multitargeted drugs from natural sources. Medicinal plants have already proven to be an important source of drugs with diverse biological activities. Recently, natural foods and food-derived components have received much attention, not only because of safety but also for their capacity to modulate the different targets associated with the pathogenesis [
