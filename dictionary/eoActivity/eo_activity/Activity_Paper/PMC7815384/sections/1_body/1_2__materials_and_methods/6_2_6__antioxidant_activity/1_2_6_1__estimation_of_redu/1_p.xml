<p>The reducing ability of the plant extracts of 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>fluctuans</italic> was evaluated by the method as described by Oyaizu [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The extract or standard solutions (1 mL) were added to 2.5 mL each of potassium buffer (0.2 M) and potassium ferricyanide (1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and mixed gently. The reaction mixture was incubated at 50°C for 20 minutes followed by the addition of 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) solution. Centrifugation (3000 rpm, 10 minutes) of the mixture was performed to get the clear supernatant solution. Supernatant solution (2.5 mL) was added to 0.5 mL of ferric chloride (0.1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) solution and distilled water (2.5 mL), and the absorbance of the solution was read by a spectrophotometer at 700 nm. For comparison, catechin was taken as a reference standard.
