 <italic>fluctuans</italic> were first washed properly, then cut into small pieces, shade-dried, and ground into coarse powder by employing a grinder. The cold extraction method was used for the extraction of dried plant powder (280 g) with methanol. The resulting extract was filtered and concentrated by a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 50°C temperature to achieve the crude methanol extract (20.0 g). A definite amount of the resulting methanolic extract was measured, suspended in water, and then partitioned with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and water by the method as described earlier [
