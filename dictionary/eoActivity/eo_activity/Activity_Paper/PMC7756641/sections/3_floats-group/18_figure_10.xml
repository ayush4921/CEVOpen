  <p>Hypothetical mechanism of action of adaptogens in the regulation of the innate antioxidant system and oxidative stress‐induced apoptosis in aging. According to the free radical theory of aging, the organisms are continuously exposed to reactive oxygen species containing molecules/species (ROS), which are produced as by‐products of normal cellular metabolism. When the innate antioxidant system (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) incompletely deactivates ROS, increasing cellular oxidative damage induces irreversible functional changes leading to early senescence and to aging‐associated diseases. Oxidative stress triggers many signaling pathways, including FOXO and Hsp70 mediated pathways. Adaptogens upregulate Hsp70, which directly regulates FOXO signaling and promote translocation of FOXO/DAF‐16 to nucleus triggering activation antioxidant systems and antiaging programs.
