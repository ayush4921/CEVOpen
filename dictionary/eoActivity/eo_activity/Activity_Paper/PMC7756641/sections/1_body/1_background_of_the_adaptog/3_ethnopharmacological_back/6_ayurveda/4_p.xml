<p>In Ayurveda, the plants known as rasayana are used as rejuvenating and for improving the overall health of anyone undergoing this treatment. The word rasayana literally means the path that rasa takes (rasa: the primordial tissue or plasma; ayana: path). According to Ayurveda, the qualities of rasa‚Äêdhatu influence the health of other dhatus (tissues) of the body, as it is the most primary in function and works as the basic unit. Hence any medicinal plant or formulation that improves the quality of rasa (rasayanas), strengthen or promotes the health of all tissues of the body. Apart from promoting good health, increasing the ability to concentrate, improving memory and mood, an important effect of rasayana therapy is increasing resistance to diseases.
