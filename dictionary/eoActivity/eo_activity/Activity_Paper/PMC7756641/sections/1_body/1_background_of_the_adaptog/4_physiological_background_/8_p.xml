 <italic>In conclusion</italic>, the adaptive stress response is a survival mechanism that includes the genetic response to environmental mild stressors. The mild stressors include exercise, calorie restriction, and adaptogens, which activate adaptive signaling pathways of the adaptive stress system to boost the body's cellular maintenance functions into high gear with cells having a more efficient response. Adaptogens trigger the adaptive stress response to reduce chronic inflammation (inflammaging) and promote healthy aging.
