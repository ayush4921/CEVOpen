 <italic>In conclusion</italic>, shanghuo, a state of decreased resistance to stress can be treated with what—first in the Soviet/Russian literature—has been labeled adaptogenic plants. These will and increase the nonspecific resistance to stress; the yin‐yang balance, a synonym of homeostasis (see the next section of this chapter); and vital energy or qi, which has a similar meaning as adaptability or a state of nonspecific resistance. The concept of hozai is very similar to the adaptogenic concept, particularly in the context of their modes of action as eustressors (i.e., good stressors), and as mild stress mimetics or stress‐vaccines that induce a stress‐protective response; its systematic use in gerontology might be very beneficial, as has already been demonstrated in Japan.
