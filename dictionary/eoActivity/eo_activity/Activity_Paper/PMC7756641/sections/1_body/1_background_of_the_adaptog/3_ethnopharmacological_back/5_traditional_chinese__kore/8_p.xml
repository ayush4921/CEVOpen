<p>According to TCM, the onset of disease is due to both external (wind, cold, heat, dampness, dryness, fire) and internal causes—excessive emotional activity induces the yin‐yang imbalance of the following seven emotions: joy, anger, anxiety, concentration, grief, fear, and fright. Bacteria, viruses, and chemicals are not considered to be causes. Most people whose health is not affected by external factors, but in whom excessive emotional activity causes a severe yin‐yang imbalance, experience blockage of qi and impairment of vital organ function. According to TCM theory, “shanghuo” caused by emotional stress can induce insomnia, depression, increase susceptibility to infectious diseases, and promote cardiovascular disease and tumor progression. Therefore, unsurprisingly the idea to prevent and treat stress‐induced disorders caused by a yin‐yang imbalance with prophylactic treatment using medicinal plants trace back to centuries (e.g, Weibing in China, Mibyeong in Korea,
