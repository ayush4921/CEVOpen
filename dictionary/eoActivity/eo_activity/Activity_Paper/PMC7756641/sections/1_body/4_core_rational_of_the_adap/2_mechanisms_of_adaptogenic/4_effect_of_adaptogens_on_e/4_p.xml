<p>Along with CRH, another primary upstream mediator of extracellular communications stimulated by adaptogens is the stress hormone neuropeptide‐Y (NPY).

 </xref> Stimulation and release of NPY into the blood circulatory system are innate defence responses to mild stressors (adaptogens), which increase resistance to stress. This leads to stress‐protective and adaptive effects via various elements of the endocrine, immune, central nervous, sympathetic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Both Hsp72 and NPY play essential roles in stress, and pathogenesis of aging‐related diseases. The antinarcotic effects of adaptogens are mediated by NPY, which is an important intermediate involved in morphine tolerance and opioid dependence.
