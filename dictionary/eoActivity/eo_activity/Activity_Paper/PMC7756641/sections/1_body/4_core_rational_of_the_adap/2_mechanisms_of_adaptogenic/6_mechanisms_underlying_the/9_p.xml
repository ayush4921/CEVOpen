<p>Although adaptogens at high concentrations are potent radical scavengers, in lower amounts, they may activate some intracellular adaptive stress response signaling pathways resulting in the expression of cytoprotective proteins including neurotrophic factors, protein chaperones, antioxidant and phase II enzymes, and antiapoptotic proteins. One of them is transcription factor Nrf2.
