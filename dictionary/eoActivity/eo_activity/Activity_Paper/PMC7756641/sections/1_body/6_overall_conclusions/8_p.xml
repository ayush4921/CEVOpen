<p>Overall, in this review for the first time we compare and analyze common basic principles, concepts, and uses of adaptogenic plants using a cross‐cultural, comparative approach. We demonstrate that the concept of adaptogens provides a scientific rationale for adaptogenic plants traditionally used in stress‐induced and aging‐related diseases. In conclusion, the basic principles of TMS are in line with those of the adaptogenic concept, which uses systems biology and network pharmacology models to understand the fundamentals of TMS.</p>
