 </xref> It might be suggested that such a high tolerance in humans and a low rate of adverse events might be due to their poor absorption and low bioavailability. However, the data available on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the active constituents of adaptogenic plants show that some of these have high bioavailability and are quickly absorbed and widely distributed in all organs and tissues involved in the regulation of the neuroendocrine–immune system. Others are metabolized into more active metabolites or significantly affect gut microbiota, which plays an important role in the maintenance of homeostasis and the development of several chronic diseases, including colitis‐associated colorectal cancer, among others.
