<p>Extracts of Red Korean Ginseng have been tested extensively in mice and isolated cells infected with influenza virus. The antiviral protective effects were observed regardless of influenza virus strains, including various subtypes of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9. Mice inoculated with a lethal dose of virus and ginseng preparations were protected against weight loss with 100% survival rates during primary infection, and they developed immunity against secondary viral infection.

 </xref> The use of various ginseng extracts to treat mice infected with influenza virus decreased the interleukin (IL)‐6 and IL‐8 cytokines and increased antiviral cytokine interferon (IFN) upon influenza virus infection.

 </xref> It was demonstrated that ginsenosides, particularly Rb1, interact with viral hemagglutinin proteins, preventing the virus from binding to host cells and viral entry into the cytoplasm.

 </xref> Meanwhile, ginseng polysaccharide fraction exhibits a strong antiviral effect in mice infected with influenza A virus, predominantly by reducing the accumulation of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF‐α)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)‐producing dendritic cells (tipDCs) in mouse lungs.
