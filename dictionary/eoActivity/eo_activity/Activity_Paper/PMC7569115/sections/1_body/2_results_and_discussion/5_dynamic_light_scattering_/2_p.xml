<p id="p0055">DLS technique makes use of particle size analysis of colloidal solution upon irradiating with the light source. The measurement condition was maintained at temperature 25 °C. From the DLS histogram [
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>], the average particle size is estimated to be 76.4 nm with a polydispersity index 0.325 and diffusion coefficient 6.438 x108 cm2/s, respectively.
