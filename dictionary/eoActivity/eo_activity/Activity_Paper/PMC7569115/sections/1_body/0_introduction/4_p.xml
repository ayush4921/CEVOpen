<p id="p0015">Medicinal plants based synthesis of nanoparticles has various biological benefits since they have no toxic chemicals and biological compounds as capping agents (

The biological and medicinal properties of NPs are mostly determined by various physical properties like particle size, structure, and crystallinity composition. AgNPs are interacting with cells and regulate active and passive cellular responses. AgNPs also cause DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations at a low concentration without toxicity, especially no genotoxicity effects on human cells (
