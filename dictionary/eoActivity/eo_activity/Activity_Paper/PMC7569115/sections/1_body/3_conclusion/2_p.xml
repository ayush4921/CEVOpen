 </div>O) and amine (N—H) groups in the 
 <italic>Z. officinale and C. longa</italic> extracts might be involved in the synthesis of AgNPs. SEM results revealed that AgNPs are in a spherical shape with the size ranging from 42 to 61 nm, and from 20 to 51 nm by TEM analysis. MTT assay reveals that AgNPs had shown good anti-cancer activity against HT29 cells with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 150.8 µg/mL. Based on the study findings, it is concluded that AgNPs synthesized using rhizome of 
 <italic>Z. officinale and C. longa</italic> have potential anti-cancer properties.
