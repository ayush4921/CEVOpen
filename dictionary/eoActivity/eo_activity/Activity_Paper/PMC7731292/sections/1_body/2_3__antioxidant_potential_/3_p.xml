<p>In particular, an in vivo study demonstrated that products extracted from neuroactive endogenous medicinal plants, including ferutinin, are possible neuromodulators, with potential anticonvulsant properties at low doses. Indeed, these compounds, as observed for phenolic acids which in vitro and in vivo modulate the inhibitory action of glycine receptor, proved to be potential scavengers fighting against the range of neurodegenerative diseases by improving body antioxidant potential [
