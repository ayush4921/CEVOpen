<p>At high concentrations, ferutinin triggers the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria, such as superoxide anion, at the level of the respiratory chain subunits I and III, through the opening induction of calcium channels and the subsequent alteration of the trans-membrane potential [
