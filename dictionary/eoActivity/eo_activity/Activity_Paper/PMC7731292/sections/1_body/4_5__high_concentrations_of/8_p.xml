<p>Increasing evidence on the ability of ferutinin to inhibit cell growth and to induce apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-05768" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] has led to a growing of research on ferutinin as an anti-cancer and chemopreventive agent, both alone and in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs [

In particular, ferutinin had shown pro-apoptotic properties on several cell lines mediated by mitochondrial permeabilization and the release of molecules implicated in intrinsic apoptotic induction and progression. Among them, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF), a mitochondrial oxide-reductase, exerted a relevant role as physiologically participates in the electronic transport and, once it has released from the mitochondrion, moves into the nucleus acting as DNAse [
