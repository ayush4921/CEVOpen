<p>This increase seems to have a specific selectivity for the cancer cells compared to healthy cells: indeed, it has been observed a ferutinin-induced biphasic increase in intracellular calcium in T-leukemia cell line Jurkat. The plasma membrane of human lymphocyte expresses non-voltage-gated L-type calcium channels which have a crucial role in the biphasic calcium flux: the initial observed peak through the calcium mobilization from intracellular stores was maintained thanks the entry of extracellular calcium through the L-type calcium channels [
