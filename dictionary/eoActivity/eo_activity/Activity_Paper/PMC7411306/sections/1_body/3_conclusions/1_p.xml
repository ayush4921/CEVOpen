<p>Through the evaluation of the MAMPDB we have highlighted a group of locally available medicinal plants, yielding products with a high inter-cultural consensus of use and track record of traditional use. However, the results from preclinical 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are only a proxy for medical efficacy in humans. Especially for native herbal drugs data about safety and effectiveness is limited. Commonly used cross-culturally salient botanical drugs, which are considered safe but for which data on effectiveness is lacking are ideal candidates for treatment outcome studies. These could be conducted at local health clinics and in collaboration with the respective ministries of health and social security institutes. Retrospective treatment outcome studies constitute a valid tool for a culturally sensitive evaluation of traditional medicines including the psychosocial dimension of healing. Collaborations between the medical staff of local health clinics with local health workers and practitioners of traditional medicine have the potential to close cultural gaps and medical misconceptions that preclude the implementation of intercultural models of healthcare attention. It would facilitate an enhanced acceptance and integration of different medical thoughts and foster communication between traditional health practitioners, patients and health professionals trained in Western biomedicine. A closer collaboration between practitioners of biomedical and traditional medical systems has the potential to increase affordability, accessibility and cultural acceptability of health care.
