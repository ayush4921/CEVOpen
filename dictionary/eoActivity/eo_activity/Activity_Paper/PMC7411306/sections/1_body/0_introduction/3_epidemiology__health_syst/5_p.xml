<p>In Guatemala it is estimated that public investments cover only 40% of the costs for accessing healthcare services, and that most of these funds are centralized in urban and peri-urban areas (

 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">CMMM, 2016</xref>). Comprehension of this situation prompted the development of the Model for Inclusive Health in 2004 (
 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">Fort et al., 2011</xref>). This model implements the parallel coordination of patients between specialists in traditional medicine such as 
 <italic>ajkum</italic> (~ herbalists), 
 <italic>ajiyom</italic> (~ midwives), 
 <italic>ajq’omaneel</italic> (~ physicians) and biomedical staff in the first and second levels of attention those working at community health posts and district health centers. The Inclusive Health Model required the implementation of new protocols of attention including ‘cultural syndromes’ such as 
 <italic>susto</italic> (fright) 
 <italic>ojeado</italic> (evil eye) or 
 <italic>wuqub’ siwan</italic> (disease of the seven ravines; 
 <xref rid="B438" ref-type="bibr">Taquira et al., 2016</xref>), and an understanding of associated botanical drug based therapies, so that the medical staff could be trained in coordinating safe patient care with Maya health specialists. For example, in the Cuilco health district alone, located in the western highlands of Guatemala, 360 traditional medicine practitioners coordinated interventions with 78 medical health staff (

 <xref rid="B327" ref-type="bibr">MSPAS, 2018</xref>, p. 835-863). In spite of this initial effort, the lack of evidence about the safety and efficacy of medicinal plants and associated botanical drugs employed by practitioners of traditional medicine are a limiting factor in the translation of these intercultural protocols.
