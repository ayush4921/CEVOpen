<p>Finally, a growing for-profit private sector offers care to the urban socio-economic elites. Each of these service providers has its own infrastructure and, despite recent efforts to harmonize service provision, the coordination between different health institutions is limited. Within the respective national health systems, the Ministry of Public Health plays the stewardship role, including the formulation of T&amp;CM policies as well as integrating and regulating T&amp;CM products and practitioners in the formal health systems (

Usually they are staffed with recent medical graduates who spend their obligatory year of postgraduate social service as well as with community health workers. This situation is, however, not the best basis for achieving quality, consistency, cultural sensitivity, and ultimately, patients’ confidence (

For marginalized people, experiencing excessive financial, physical, or cultural barriers to care, traditional medicine often presents the only accessible healthcare option. Meanwhile herbal products provide popular treatment alternatives for urban socioeconomic elites and Latin American migrant communities (

Several countries lack national policies and programs on T&amp;CM and Mexico is the only country in MA with a national pharmacopeia (
