<p>In the different ICPC categories herbal medicine and pharmaceuticals are not considered to the same extent appropriate solutions for the treatment of the various health problems. Therefore, the number of taxa and use-records associated with these categories do not directly reflect the epidemiological situation in rural MA but can provide some information. Several categories are poorly recognized in ethnomedical systems such as “B” (blood, blood forming organs and immune mechanism), “K” (Cardiovascular) and “T” (endocrine/metabolic and nutritional) while “Z” (social problems) is unlikely to be treated with medicine. Typically, the broad categories “digestive” (D) and “skin” (S) are among those with the highest number of associated medicinal plants and use-records (

For treating and preventing several ailments of the urological system (U) it is important to drink copiously and flush the urinary tract. This means that ailments and interventions with respect to the categories B, L, K, T, U, W, X, and Z are probably more frequent than suggested by the number of use-records related to botanical drugs.
