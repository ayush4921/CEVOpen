<p>All these contents were added, respectively, in 96-well plate, followed by preincubation at 37°C for 5min. To the aforementioned 96-well plate, 40 μL stock solution of 20mM concentration was added and incubated once again at 37°C for 10min. After incubation, 115 μL of phenol-hyper-chlorite reagent was added in each well, which was freshly prepared by mixing 70 μL alkali with 45 μL phenol. Incubation was done for further 10min to develop color. Absorbance was measured by using 96-well plate reader (Synergy HT, BioTek) at 625nm. For calculation of IC
 <sub>50</sub> and %age inhibition, the same method was followed as mentioned for choline-esterase assay. Thiourea was taken as positive control.[
