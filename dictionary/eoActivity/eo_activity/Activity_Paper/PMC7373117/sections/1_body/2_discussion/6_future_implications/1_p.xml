<p>Alkaloids are widely used for the treatment of various ailments; for example, vincristine and taxols are used as anticancer drugs.[
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Phytochemical analysis suggested that 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) has enough number of these compounds, which can guide us to interesting new lead compounds. Looking at the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of DCM fraction against Î±-glucosidase inhibition assay, it can be concluded that molecules in DCM fraction can be considered against diabetes, which needs further investigation. DCM fraction of methanolic extract has potential to treat ulcer and gout, which needs to investigate molecule(s) responsible for such activity. 
 <italic>Erythrina suberosa</italic> (Roxb) bark showed significant antioxidant activity, which offers potential opportunities for the future anticancer studies of this plant.
