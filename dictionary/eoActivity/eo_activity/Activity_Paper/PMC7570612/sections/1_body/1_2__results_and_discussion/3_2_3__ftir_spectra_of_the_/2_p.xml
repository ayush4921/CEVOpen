<p>Several functional groups, including alkanes, alkene, aromatics, and carbonyl groups, were found. Besides these, hydroxyl and amino groups were identified. The peak found for the bond stretch frequencies for O-H at 3010–3670 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicates alcohol, phenol, and carboxylic acid groups. The C–H stretching vibrations in the alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes, and aromatic groups produced a strong band in the region of 2795–3010 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The peak found at 1666–1730 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicates the existence of the carbonyl group (C=O), which means ester, carboxylic acid, and carbonyl compounds. Besides this, the peaks showed at 1550 to 1660 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and near 1500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, reveal the existence of alkenes (C=C) and secondary aromatic amines (N-H). C-N stretching indicating aromatic amines showed a strong band in the region of 1250–1350 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, and C=C bending, which represents alkene, was observed in the region of 650–1000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The peak found in the area of 430 to 800 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicated alkanes and out-of-plane C-H bending of the aromatic end [
