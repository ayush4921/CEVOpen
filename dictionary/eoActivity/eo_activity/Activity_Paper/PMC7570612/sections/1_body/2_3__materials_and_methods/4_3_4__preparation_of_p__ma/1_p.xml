<p>For extraction, a common technique was adapted with approximately 1 g of plant powder. The extraction process was carried out through the sonication technique. The 1 g of plant powder was immersed in 30 mL of water and methanol at different ratios (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100%

 <sup>®</sup> grade one filter paper. A rotary evaporator was used at the temperature of 40 °C to remove any remaining solvents. Each extract was processed in four replicates, followed by storage at −80 °C before further use. For each of the five different methanol concentrations, a total of four replicates were prepared, resulting in 20 samples in total. Each extract of

 <disp-formula>Extraction yield (%, 
  <italic>w</italic>/
  <italic>w</italic>) = Wt
  <sub>a</sub>/Wt
  <sub>b</sub> × 100%
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Wt
 <sub>a</sub> indicates the final weight of the freeze-dried extract, and Wt
 <sub>b</sub> is the initial weight of the raw plant powder [
