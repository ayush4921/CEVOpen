 <p>The plant 
  <italic>Psychotria malayana</italic> Jack belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is known in Malaysia as “meroyan sakat/salung”. A rapid analytical technique to facilitate the evaluation of the 
  <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaves’ quality has not been well-established yet. This work aimed therefore to develop a validated analytical technique in order to predict the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory action (AGI) of 
  <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaves, applying a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) fingerprint and utilizing an orthogonal partial least square (OPLS). The dried leaf extracts were prepared by sonication of different ratios of methanol-water solvent (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% 
  <italic>v</italic>/
  <italic>v</italic>) prior to the assessment of alpha-glucosidase inhibition (AGI) and the following infrared spectroscopy. The correlation between the biological activity and the spectral data was evaluated using multivariate data analysis (MVDA). The 100% methanol extract possessed the highest inhibitory activity against the alpha-glucosidase (IC
  <sub>50</sub> 2.83 ± 0.32 μg/mL). Different bioactive functional groups, including hydroxyl (O-H), alkenyl (C=C), methylene (C-H), carbonyl (C=O), and secondary amine (N-H) groups, were detected by the multivariate analysis. These functional groups actively induced the alpha-glucosidase inhibition effect. This finding demonstrated the spectrum profile of the FTIR for the natural herb 
  <italic>P. malayana</italic> Jack, further confirming its medicinal value. The developed validated model can be used to predict the AGI of 
  <italic>P. malayana</italic>, which will be useful as a tool in the plant’s quality control.
