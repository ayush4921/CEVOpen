 <italic>Ivy gourd</italic> leaves were collected from Pathum Thani agricultural plot, Thailand. The voucher specimen has been deposited at the Herbarium of Forest Botany Division, Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Thailand. The dried leaves (50 g) were extracted with 95% methanol at room temperature. The solvent was renewed every 48 hours three times. The extract was filtered and concentrated under the reduced pressure rotary evaporator. The dried sample was kept in desiccators until performing further experiments. The methanol leaf extract sample used in cell line treatment was diluted with DMSO (final concentration of 200, 100, and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in 0.1% DMSO). Vehicle control was 0.1% DMSO.
