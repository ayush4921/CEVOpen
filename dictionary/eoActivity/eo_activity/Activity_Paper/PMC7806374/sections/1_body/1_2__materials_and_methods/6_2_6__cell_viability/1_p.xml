<p>To investigate the nontoxic concentrations of the methanol extract and a toxic concentration of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, cells were seeded on 96-well culture plates with a density of 25 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight. The various concentrations of the extract and hydrogen peroxide were treated on cell culture for 24 hours, and cell viability was determined using the MTT assay; the absorbance was measured at 540 nm by a microplate reader. The protective effect of the leaf extract on hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity was performed by treated cell culture with the extract for 2 hours before treatment with hydrogen peroxide. The percentage of cell viability was calculated relative to vehicle control.
