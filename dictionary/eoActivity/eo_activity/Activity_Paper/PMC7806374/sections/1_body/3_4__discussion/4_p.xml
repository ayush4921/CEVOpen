<p>During the wound healing process, fibroblast and keratinocytes are attracted to the site of injury following the chemotactic secretion from inflammatory cells and are responsible for granulation and reepithelization of tissue. They initiate cell proliferation and tissue formation that occur in the late phase of inflammation till the remodeling phase of wound healing [

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Keratinocytes have released numbers of proteins to reconstitute the damaged epidermis and basement membrane, while fibroblasts undergo proliferation and modify their interaction with the extracellular matrix to recreate healthy granulation tissue [

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This reliable method has been described by Lampugnani in 1999 and was used in several previous studies in comparison to in vivo study models [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Upon the scratch wound assay, we showed that the 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract could reduce the scratched area in both keratinocytes and fibroblast cells. This appearance could be either by the induction of cell migration to cover the scratched area or by the increase of cell proliferation, but we found that the 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract did not increase the cell number at all test concentrations. Thus, we believed that the wound healing property of the 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract was related to the modulation of cell migration. Interestingly, the leaf extract could induce the cell migration to a similar level as commercializing wound care product allantoin. The mechanisms of action of allantoin to promote wound healing were related to the modulation of an inflammatory response and the induction of fibroblast proliferation and reepithelization [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>–
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Our finding demonstrated that the potential effect of the 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract on wound healing was related to its antioxidant properties and the induction of cell migration.
