<p>The skin is the largest organ in the body. It is the first barrier to protect the internal organs from external penetration. The injury that breaks the skin that is so-called “wound” can be an acute or chronic injury, depending on the time course of the wound healing process. The physiological pathway of wound healing is characterized by the cascade of associated events including hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These phases are overlapping, continuous, and indistinguishable. Following the hemostatic phase to stop the outflow bleeding, platelets, the key players, release several chemotactic factors to induce the migration of leukocytes to the site of injury [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The inflammation phase continues as leukocytes arrived at the lesion, encountered the invading pathogen, and scavenged cellular debris [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During this phase, the inflammatory cells secrete a number of cytokines and growth factors that lead to fibroblast and keratinocyte migration and initiate the next stages of wound healing: proliferation phase and remodeling phase [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As the inflammatory process continues, multiple cells are attracted to the site of injury and initiate the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protease to get rid of the pathogens. Oxidants such as superoxide anions, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxides are secreted by leukocytes, endothelial cells, and vascular cells [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The low concentration of oxidants acts as secondary messengers that modulate several downstream signaling pathways including inflammation and wound repairing process [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the secretion of oxidants has a protective role, the dysregulation of an inflammatory response such as overproduction of oxidants is cytotoxic and may contribute to a chronic wound [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The prolonged inflammation phase results in a chronic wound, in which the patient encounters pain and may develop an infected wound.
