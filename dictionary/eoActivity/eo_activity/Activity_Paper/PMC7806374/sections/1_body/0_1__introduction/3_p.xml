<p>The 
 <italic>Coccinia grandis</italic> (L.) Voigt, commonly known as 
 <italic>ivy gourd</italic>, is a vegetable grown in subtropical and tropical areas of South East Asia, South Asia, and Africa [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is a climbing and ground-creeping plant that spreads rapidly, requires low maintenance, and is highly naturalized. Its fruits and leaves are edible either fresh or cooked and are used in cooking and as a household remedy from time to time [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In South East Asia, 
 <italic>ivy gourd</italic> leaves are used as antibruises and anti-itching from insect bites by applying the lesion with crushed fresh leaves [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous studies showed that 
 <italic>ivy gourd</italic> leaf extract is a good source of proteins, minerals, vitamins, and other phytochemicals (e.g., polyphenol, flavonoid, saponin, and sterol contents) [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, it was added to meals for their medicinal effects such as antioxidant, antiulcer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and analgesic potential [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, the potential effect on wound healing was recently observed in animal models [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of action related to wound healing have not been determined. In this study, we demonstrated the antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract which reduced oxidative stress injury in human fibroblast and keratinocytes and its potential effect on human fibroblast and keratinocyte cell migration.
