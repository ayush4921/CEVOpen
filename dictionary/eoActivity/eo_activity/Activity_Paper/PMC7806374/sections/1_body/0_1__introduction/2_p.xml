<p>Keratinocytes and fibroblasts are the principal cells that reside in the epidermis and dermis, respectively [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Keratinocytes provide the barrier that prevents water loss and protects the dermis from penetration, while fibroblasts produce an extracellular matrix to provide the structural supportive network for surrounding cells [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Upon skin injury, both of them are recruited to the lesion site then undergo the morphological and functional changes to drive the granulation tissue formation, which ultimately regenerates the damaged tissue [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Previous studies revealed that the function of keratinocytes and fibroblasts can be impaired by excessive oxidative stress during the prolonged inflammation phase, which results in an unhealed wound [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The cost of wound management is rising as it progresses toward being a chronic wound. Thus, several attempts are aimed at limiting the inflammation before it develops toward a chronic, nonhealing wound.
