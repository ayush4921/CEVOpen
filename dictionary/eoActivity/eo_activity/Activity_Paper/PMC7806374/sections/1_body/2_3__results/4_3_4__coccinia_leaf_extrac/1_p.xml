<p>In the attempt to evaluate the wound healing capacity, the scratching on fibroblasts and keratinocytes was employed to determine the effect of 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract. The migration property of the extract was compared with a commercialized wound care drug: allantoin. The coverage area of the scratch was calculated and expressed as the percentage relative to time zero (accounted as 100% scratching area). The scratching area of untreated human fibroblast and human keratinocyte monolayer is shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(e)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(f)</xref>, respectively. We demonstrated that the leaf extract induced human fibroblast and keratinocyte cell migration in a dose-related capability. The lowest test dose, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml extract, was observed to reduce the scratched area up to 13% in keratinocytes and 17% in fibroblasts compared to vehicle control treatment (0.1% DMSO), whereas the maximum dose of 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL leaf extract enhanced the cell migration, which reduced the scratched area by about 19% in keratinocytes and 23% in fibroblasts. We found that the potential effect of the leaf extract on wound healing assay was similar to allantoin at all ranges of test doses. This effect was observed in both cell lines. Together, this indicated that the 
 <italic>Coccinia</italic> leaf extract efficiently enhanced the migratory capacity of cells, which accelerated the wound healing process.
