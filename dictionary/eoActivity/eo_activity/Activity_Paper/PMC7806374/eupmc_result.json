    "The impairment in the regulation of the physiological process in the inflammatory phase of wound healing results in oxidative stress damage, which increases the severity and extends the healing time. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the radical scavenging properties of <i>Coccinia</i> leaf extract and its ability to ameliorate a migration process in vitro. <i>Coccinia</i> is a medicinal plant that was used in ancient times for relieving insect bite itching and swelling. However, the role of <i>Coccinia</i> leaf extract as an antioxidant related to the process of wound healing has never been studied. In this study, we demonstrated that the leaf extract possessed antioxidant properties that acted as a proton donor to neutralize reactive oxygen species with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 4.85 mg/mL of the extract. It could chelate iron with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 21.39 mg/mL of the extract. The leaf extract protected the human fibroblasts and keratinocytes from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress by increasing cell survival rate by more than 20% in all test doses. The protective property was dose-dependently correlated with the decrease in reactive oxygen species formation. In addition, the leaf extract enhanced the cell migration rate of fibroblasts and keratinocytes up to 23% compared with vehicle control. The results suggested that <i>Coccinia</i> leaf extract may be a potential herb for increasing the wound healing process with its antioxidant capacity and can be used as an herbal ingredient for the utilization of skincare products."
