<p id="p0055">Pure colonies of each microorganism were suspended in sterile saline until a turbidity match McFarland tube number 0.5 (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ ml). A loopful from each adjusted organisms were swabbed onto Muller Hinton agar (Difco Laboratories). Sterile paper discs (6 mm in diameter) were impregnated with 100 μl of each 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% diluted extracts then dried at 100 °C for two hours in hot air oven and were dispensed onto the surface of the inoculated agar plate. The plates were then incubated according to growth requirement of each organism. Each sample was tested in triplicates and antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring and recorded the zones of inhibition in mm (including the 6 mm disk). A parallel analysis study with commercial antimicrobial agents included Amoxicillin-Clavulinic (10 μg), Ampicillin (10 μg), Vancomycin (30 μg), Lincomycin (30 μg), Gentamicin (10 μg), Streptomycin (10 μg) and Tetracycline (30 μg) was conducted in order to compare their antimicrobial potency with the plant extracts.
