<p id="p0095">Phytochemical screening revealed exist several classes of secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, polyphenols, flavonoids, anthraguinones, coumarins, saponins, tannins, triterpenes and steroids. Several molecules are active on pathogenic microorganisms (

 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Awouafack et al., 2013</xref>,

 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Erfan and Marouf, 2019</xref>). Exist such metabolites in the tested plant extracts can give a preliminary explanation on their antimicrobial antibacterial activities. Differences were observed in the antibacterial activities of the extracts. These could be due to the differences in their chemical composition as well as in the mechanism of action of their bioactive constituents (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Cowan, 1999</xref>). All the extracts are rich in secondary metabolites; however, activity does not depend only exist secondary metabolites in the plant extracts, but also on their concentration and the possible interaction with other components (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Dzotam et al., 2016</xref>). The antibacterial effect for tannins attributed to its ability to react with proteins to form stable water-insoluble components since bacterial cell wall made from proteins (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Dangoggo et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, it may bind to proline – rich protein and interfere with the protein synthesis (
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">Shimada, 2006</xref>), also the antimicrobial activity of saponins rendered to cause leakage of proteins and certain enzymes from cell (detergent like properties). The antibacterial effect of alkaloids due to its ability to interchelate with DNA of both Gram positive and negative bacteria and interfere with cell division (
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Bukar et al., 2015</xref>), while flavonoids activity is due to their ability to bind with intracellular and soluble proteins and to bind with bacterial cell walls and the antibacterial properties of steroids are due to complex with membrane lipids and exerts its action by causing leakage (
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Marjorie, 1999</xref>). The problem of microbial resistance is growing by time and the outlook for the use of antimicrobial drugs in the future is still uncertain. Therefore, actions must be taken to face this problem and to introduce the antibacterial activity of medicinal plants (

 <italic>Pasteruella multocida</italic> and

 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Concalves et al. (2008)</xref>, who studied guava extracts against food born pathogen and spoilage bacteria that due to the phenolic components which make them effective against the tested microorganisms. This result confirmed by 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Malaviya and Mishra (2011)</xref> and these observations matched also with that of the findings of 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Hogue et al. (2007)</xref> who showed the antibacterial activity of guava leaf extracts based on how the phenolic components act particularly flavonoids. These observations also agreed with 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Ismail et al. (2012)</xref> who exhibited the antibacterial activity of guava against food borne pathogens. According to the study the extracts of 
 <italic>Ziziphusspina christi</italic> of all parts act as antibacterial agent against the tested pathogenic bacterial strains. This activity attributed to exist tannins and leucocyanidin (Rizk et al., 1993), also due to exist other active components like saponins, flavonoids, steroids, glycosides (
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Lee, 2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Lam, 2007</xref>). This result agreed with results recorded by

 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Al-Mutairi et al. (2016)</xref> who recorded that ethanol and methanol leaves extracts also were effective against most tested strains. The antibacterial activity of
