 </xref> Since 9/11, Congress has enacted an additional nine statutes to enhance preparedness for the full gamut of circumstances: emerging infectious diseases; threats stemming from chemical, biological, radiologic, and nuclear sources; and agents of war.

  <sup>27</sup>
 </xref> One of these provisions is the EUA, established as part of the Project Bioshield Act of 2004.

 </xref> With this provision, the secretaries of the US departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services (HHS) are empowered to make a determination of need, that is, that a military/domestic/public health emergency, or a significant potential for an emergency, exists. The secretary of HHS declares that the described circumstance justifies an EUA, and the FDA commissioner evaluates the request using the four criteria necessary for supporting the issuance of an EUA, namely that: (1) there is a serious or life-threatening illness/condition caused by the identified agent(s); (2) there is reasonable belief that the product may be effective in preventing, diagnosing, or treating a serious or life-threatening disease or condition caused by the agent(s); (3) the known or potential benefits outweigh the known or potential risks; and (4) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product.
