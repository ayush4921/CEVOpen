<p id="p0085">To treat patients with acute SARS-CoV-2–induced disease, physicians are generally limited to prescribing off-label, FDA-approved antiviral drugs indicated for use in the treatment of other viral diseases. New antiviral drugs specifically targeting SARS-CoV-2 will have to undergo premarket evaluation under an IND for the generation of data for use in supporting an NDA for submission to the FDA, which will likely take years. New, SARS-CoV-2–targeted drugs will be given a Priority Review designation, and will likely be given the Fast Track designation, which is accompanied by close collaboration between the developer and the FDA to speed development, review, and approval.</p>
