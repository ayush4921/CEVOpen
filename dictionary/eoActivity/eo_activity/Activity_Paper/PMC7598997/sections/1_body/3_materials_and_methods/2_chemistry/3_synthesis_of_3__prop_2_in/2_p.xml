<p>3-Hydroxy-13α-estra-1,3,5(
 <bold>10</bold>)-trien-17-one (
 <bold>1</bold>, 540 mg, 2.0 mmol) was dissolved in acetone (15 ml), then propargyl bromide [0.34 ml (80 wt.% in toluene), 3.0 mmol], and K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (1.94 g, 14 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 24 h, the solvent was then evaporated off, and the residue was purified by flash chromatography with EtOAc/CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub> = 2/98 as eluent. Compound
