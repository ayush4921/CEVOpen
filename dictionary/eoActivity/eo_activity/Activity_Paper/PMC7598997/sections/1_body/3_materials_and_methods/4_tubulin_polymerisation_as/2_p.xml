<p>The effect of brominated triazole (
 <bold>12a</bold>) on tubulin polymerisation was tested with the HTS-Tubulin Polymerisation Assay Biochem Kit (Bio-Kasztel Ltd., Budapest, Hungary) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, 10 µl of a 0.125 or 0.25 mM solution of the test compound (
 <bold>12a</bold>) was placed on a prewarmed (37 °C), UV-transparent microplate. About 10 µl 10 µM paclitaxel and 10 µl General Tubulin Buffer were used as positive and negative control, respectively. 100 µl 3.0 mg/ml tubulin in 80 mM PIPES pH 6.9, 2 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM GTP was added to each sample, and the microplate was immediately placed into a prewarmed (37 °C) UV-spectrophotometer (SpectoStarNano, BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) to start the recording reaction. A 60-min kinetic measurement protocol was applied to determine the absorbance of the reaction solution per minute at 340 nm. For the evaluation of the experimental data, the maximum reaction rate (

 <sub>max</sub>: Δabsorbance/min) was calculated. Moving averages of absorbances determined at three consecutive timepoints were calculated and the highest difference between two succeeding moving averages was taken as the

 <sub>max</sub> of the tested compound in the tubulin polymerisation reaction. Each sample was prepared in two parallels and the measurements were repeated twice. For statistical evaluation,

 <sub>max</sub> data were analysed by the one-way ANOVA test with the Newmann–Keuls post-test by using Prism 4.01 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
