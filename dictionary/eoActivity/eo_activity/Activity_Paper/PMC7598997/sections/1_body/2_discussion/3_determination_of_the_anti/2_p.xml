<p>We described earlier that triazole 
 <bold>4a</bold> exerted outstanding inhibitory activities against A2780 and MCF-7 cell lines in the range of IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.5–0.6 µM. However, 
 <bold>4b</bold>, its 4′-
 <italic>t</italic>-Bu counterpart did not have marked influence on the growth of the tested cell lines. Regarding the substantial difference in the antiproliferative potential of 
 <bold>4a</bold> and 
 <bold>4b</bold>, these two compounds have been selected for further transformations. Besides testing the newly synthesised compounds on A2780 (ovarian carcinoma) and MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma, expressing the oestrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors), an additional cell line, the triple-negative breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231, was also included in our study. Based on the present results obtained for the phosphonates (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it can be stated, that this type of modification did not improve the high potency of parent compound 
 <bold>4a</bold>. The cell growth-inhibitory potential of the phosphonates is far behind to that of unsubstituted 
 <bold>4a</bold>. The low micromolar IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the phosphonates (
 <bold>13b</bold>, 
 <bold>14a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>, and 
 <bold>15a</bold>) reflect their moderate antiproliferative potential. Interestingly, phosphonates influenced the growth of A2780 cells most. Considering the two breast cancer cell lines with different receptorial status, no significant difference in growth-inhibitory activities have been observed. However, two compounds (
 <bold>12a</bold> and 
 <bold>14a</bold>) proved to be more potent against the triple-negative MDA-MB-231 line. The presented pharmacological results are considered preliminary and, therefore, no conclusion can be made concerning the mechanism of the action. However, based on the comparison of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained on the two breast cancer cell lines, a receptor-independent mechanism could be proposed. Results obtained for the 2-bromo compounds (
 <bold>11a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>) reveal that bromination at this position is disadvantageous concerning the antiproliferative potential against the tested cell lines. However, the other regioisomer without the 4′-
 <italic>t</italic>-Bu group (
 <bold>12a</bold>), proved to be highly potent with selective action against A2780 cells. The dependence of the cell growth-inhibitory potential on the regioisomerism is a very important structure–activity result. Interestingly, the empirical rules established earlier proved to be valid for the bromo derivatives (
 <bold>11a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold> and 
 <bold>12a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>) as well. The presence of the 4′-
 <italic>t</italic>-Bu group on the newly introduced benzylic moiety was also detrimental.
