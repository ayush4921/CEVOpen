<p>The determination of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of crude mushroom extracts against FIV-RT was performed with the final concentrations of the extracts ranging from 0.012 μg/mL to 26 mg/mL, and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table-1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure-4</xref>. The ethanol extract of dried fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> showed the strongest anti-FIV-RT activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.80±0.16 μg/mL, while its hexane extract showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.22±0.20 μg/mL. Other crude mushroom extracts, such as ethanol and DW extracts of 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic>, ethanol extract of fresh fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, hexane extract of dried mycelium of 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic>, ethanol extract of fresh fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic>, and hexane extracts of fresh fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>M. esculenta</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> also exhibited strong inhibition against FIV-RT (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table-1</xref>). However, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of these mushroom extracts were lower than that of EFV, which was 0.019±0.002 μg/mL. The hexane extract of fresh fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic> showed the weakest anti-FIV-RT activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.630±251.03 μg/mL.
