<p>The amino acid sequence of FIV-RT from the PDB database under ID no. 5OVN was used for designing its corresponding DNA sequence. Codon optimization was also performed to ensure high-protein expression in the bacterial host. The DNA fragment of p66 was synthesized and cloned into the pET15b expression vector which was then used to generate a DNA fragment of p51. The p51 was also cloned into pColdI. Both subunits were individually transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) and expressed as intracellular His-tagged proteins. Purifications of both subunits were performed by combining IPTG-induced 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells harboring each construct before subjecting to sonication and Ni-Sepharose and Resource S cation chromatography. The final yield of purified recombinant wild-type FIV-RT was 8-10 mg from 1 L of culture medium. Each subunit of purified FIV-RT showed molecular weights of 66 and 51 kDa, respectively, on 12% SDS-PAGE as expected, and more than 90% purity of recombinant FIV-RT was obtained as judged by SDS-PAGE (
