  <p>Purification of recombinant wild-type feline immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase. The enzyme was purified through Ni-Sepharose and determined with 12% SDS-PAGE (Sup=Supernatant, FT=Flow-through, Wash=Washed with buffer A, 5% B=Washed with 5% buffer B, E1-E4=Eluted fraction) (a). Then, resource S cation exchange chromatography was performed to obtained high purity protein and confirmed with 12% SDS-PAGE (FT=Flow-through, P1-P2=Peaks from 0% to 15% gradient buffer B, E1-E3=Elution peaks from 15% to 35% gradient buffer B) (b).</p>
