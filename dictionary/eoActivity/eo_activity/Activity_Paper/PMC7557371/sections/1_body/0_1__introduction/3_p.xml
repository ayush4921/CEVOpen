<p>Under research scenarios, the use of extracts helps to narrow down the direct impact of PSMs on the biological activity and dose of extract without the confounding effects associated with dietary characteristics of plant materials or whole plants. Moreover, some structure of plants like the barks of trees are difficult to feed to animals but also contain valuable phytochemicals. Previous in vitro and in vivo trials have validated the anti-methanogenic effects of MO, JC and AV when used as dietary additives at 50 mg/kg DM of substrate [

 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00601" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To justify this previous in vitro trial as well as make wider recommendations on the beneficial effects of extracts of MO, JC and AV in methane reduction and improvement in feed digestibility, there is a need to evaluate the potential impact of these medicinal plant extracts on the physiology of the animals. This study, therefore, tested the effect of MO, JC and AV extract used as antimethanogenic additives on the haematology and blood chemistry of South African Mutton Merino (SAMM) lambs.
