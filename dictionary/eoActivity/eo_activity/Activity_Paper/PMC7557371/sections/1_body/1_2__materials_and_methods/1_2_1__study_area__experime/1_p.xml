<p>The study was conducted at the University of Pretoria Experimental Farm, Hatfield, South Africa. The annual rainfall in Pretoria is about 573 mm and the city is located at 1700 m above sea level. This study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Pretoria with approval number ECO-030-14. Fresh foliage of MO, JC and AV was collected, freeze-dried and the extract obtained using 100% methanol as reported previously [

Extract solutions were prepared from an equal mass of each plant material by solubilising 100 mg of dried plant extracts in 100 mL of distilled water, stirring with an overhead stirrer and stored as a stock solution. Extracts solutions were administered at a dosage of 50 mg/kg of feed DM consumed while the actual dosage drenched to each animal was adjusted weekly using the previous week’s feed intake. The 50 mg/kg dry matter intake (DMI) dose of extract was based on previous in vitro trials which established the effective dose at which the extracts reduced enteric methane [

Forty 4-month-old SAMM ram lambs with an average live weight of 28.8 ± 0.40 kg were blocked according to their body weight, and from each block randomly allocated into four dietary treatments which include (i) total mixed ration diet (TMR) + distilled water as a control, (ii) TMR + MO extract (50 mg/kg DMI), (iii) TMR + JC extract (50 mg/kg DMI) and, (iv) TMR + AV extract (50 mg/kg DMI). The lambs were housed in open-sided pens with concrete floors and metal roofing. Water was provided ad lib while routine vaccination and prophylactic treatments were carried out prior to the start of the trial. Two lambs from each treatment within a block were housed in a pen with five pens per treatment and a total of ten lambs per treatment.
