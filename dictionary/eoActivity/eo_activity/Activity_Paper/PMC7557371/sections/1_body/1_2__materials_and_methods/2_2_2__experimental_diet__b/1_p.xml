<p>The ingredient and nutrient composition of the experimental diet is shown in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00601-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and contains 42% roughage and 58% concentrate. Lambs were initially adapted to the standard total mixed ration for fourteen days, followed by an additional twelve-day adaptation period, where they received an incremental dosage of the extracts, starting from 10 mg/kg DMI up to 50 mg/kg DMI with 10 mg/kg DMI increment every 3 days to acclimatize lambs to the plant extracts. During this period, lambs were monitored closely to observe any clinical signs of toxicity such as frothing at the mouth, diarrhoea, dehydration, bloody stool or sudden decline in feed consumption. Growth performance of lambs was monitored weekly and feed intake monitored daily for further 75 days after adaptation to feed and extract drenching. Extract drenching did not affect the average daily gain in lambs (average of 270 g/day) while DMI was equally not affected by extract supplementation with lambs consuming 1200 g/day and receiving an average of 60 mg extract solution/animal/day over the study period [
