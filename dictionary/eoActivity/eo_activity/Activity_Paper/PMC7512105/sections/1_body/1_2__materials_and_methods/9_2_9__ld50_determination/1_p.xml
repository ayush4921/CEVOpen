<p>The lethal death fifty (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of plant extracts resulting in 50% mortality of the larvae of 
 <italic>Culex quinefasciatus</italic> LD
 <sub>50</sub> and 95% confidence intervals were determined from the 72-hour counts, and the dose response data were transferred into LD
 <sub>50</sub> analyzed by Finney [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Probit Analysis computer program was used to determine lethal death fifty (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) values. Potassium dichromate (K
 <sup>₂</sup>Cr
 <sup>₂</sup>O
 <sup>₇</sup>) was used as a positive control with an LD50 value 1.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (toxic) and DEMSO (1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) as a negative control in the bioassay experiments (LD50 726129 × 10
 <sup>11</sup>
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) according to the modification by Meyer et al.. LD
 <sub>50</sub> values below 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml were considered as highly toxic, 250–499 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml as moderately toxic, and 500–1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml as lowly toxic. Values above 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml were regarded as safe or nontoxic according to McLaughlin and co-workers [
