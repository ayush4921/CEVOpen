Constituents may be stilbenes or pigments (0.96 with red or pink color). Constituents may be alkaloids with Rf 0.74 (no color) and 0.70 (no color). Constituents may be terpenoids and saponins with Rf 0.62 (dark blue), 0.61 (dark violet blue), 0.48 (dark blue), and 0.42 (dark blue violet). Flavonoids may be with Rf 0.32 (orange), 0.21 (orange), and 0.11 (dark blue orange). The chromatogram revealed a mixture of compounds which exhibited different colored reactions with
