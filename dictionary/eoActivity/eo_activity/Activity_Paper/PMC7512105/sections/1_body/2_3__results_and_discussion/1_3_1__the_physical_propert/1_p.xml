<p>The results of physical properties such as consistency, color, and extractive value percentage yields of successively extracted in an order of nonpolar to polar solvent based on increasing degree of polarity are reported in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. High values were found in polar solvent methanol (MeOH) followed by intermediate polarity ethyl acetate (EtAc) and nonpolar n-hexane (
 <italic>n</italic>-hex), respectively. Low 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extractive value signifies the presences of amounts of fats, lipids, and some steroids in the plant materials and may indicate the addition of exhausted material, adulteration or incorrect processing during drying, or storage or formulating [
