<p>When looking into preclinical comparability, considering the integrated European guidance documents (reflection papers) already formulated in relation to different types of NBDCs and their similarity, common requirements were identified. These commonalities reflect the recognition by European Regulators that, by default, the proof of similarity for NBCDs deviates from that for generic's bioequivalence. The common requirements identified were: (i) Comparability of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>/
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacodynamics; (ii) Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies (multiple time points, comparative); (iii) Biodistribution of the NBCD product in relevant organs (safety and efficacy, comparative); (iv) 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> toxiclogy studies, need, and format (comparative); and (v) Need for validation of relevant and appropriate analytical methods.
