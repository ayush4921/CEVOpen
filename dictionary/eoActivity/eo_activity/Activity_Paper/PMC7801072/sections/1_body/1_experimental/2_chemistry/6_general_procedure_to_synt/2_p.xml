 <sub>3</sub> (700 mg, 4.56 mmol) was added dropwise to DMF (400 mg, 5.42 mmol) while stirring at 0 °C. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 1 h. A solution of 9-substituted carbazole (1.93 mmol) was slowly added to this mixture over 5 min at 45 °C, and then the temperature was raised to 95 °C for 8–18 h to yield compounds
