<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial and antifungal activities of the synthesised compounds were evaluated to obtain the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), using a 96-well microtiter plate and a serial dilution method. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were used as positive controls and DMSO as a negative control. The micro-organisms used in the present study were two Gram-positive strains (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> 4220, 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> 3289), one clinical isolate of multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacterial strain (
 <italic>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus CCARM</italic> 3167), one Gram-negative strain (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 1924) and one fungus (
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> 7535). The bacteria were grown to mid-log phase in Mueller-Hinton broth and diluted 1000-fold in the same medium. Stock solutions of the test compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide were prepared and then poured into 96-well plates. The final concentration of 0.5–64 µg/mL underwent a twofold serial dilution

 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL. These were applied to 96-well plates with a serial dilution and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The bacteria growth was measured from the turbidity at 630 nm using a microplate reader. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Their MBC and MFC values were also determined (only for the compounds with MIC values of &lt; 256 μg/mL).
