<p>Cell viability has been determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT, Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy) assay. Cells have been seeded on 48 well plates and grown in complete medium. Before being treated, cells have been starved in serum-free medium for 24 h for allowing cell cycle synchronisation. 72 h after treatments, fresh MTT, re-suspended in PBS, was added to each well (final concentration (0.5 mg/mL). After 2 h incubation at 37 °C, cells have been lysed with DMSO, and then optical density was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. At least six doses of the studied compounds, solubilised in DMSO (0.1% final concentration), have been evaluated and each experiment has been performed in triplicate. The absorbance values have been used to determine the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for each cell line using GraphPad Prism 5 Software (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA).
