<p>To summarise, our findings revealed that the compounds in series 
 <bold>8</bold> exhibited significantly higher antimicrobial activities compared with the compounds in the other four series. This suggests that the presence of a dihydrotriazine moiety is critical to the potency of these carbazole derivatives. These results therefore provide further evidence to suggest that aryl groups and the dihydrotriazine moiety play critical roles in the activity of these carbazole compounds.
