<p>In a bid to further enhance the utility of the phytomedicinal potential of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> fruits, this study has shown their therapeutic potentials on the basis of their polyphenolic constitution and richness, chief of which are flavonoids and phenol in the compartments (flesh and peel) of the fruits. The bioactivity and therapeutic potential of the plant extracts are also largely inclined to the organic-based extraction solvents, with the acetone extracts being dominantly bioactive and thus suggested to be the most pharmacologically preferred extraction solvent. The biological activity reflects the viability of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> fruits as useful natural antioxidants, against oxidative stress which improves and buttresses the nutritional acceptability and medicinal capacities, respectively, of the flesh and peel components of these fruits. Furthermore, 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> flesh and peel should be incorporated into the human diet due to comparable ferric reducing antioxidant capacity with standard drugs such as rutin. There also portend higher therapeutic benefits upon the combined consumption of the three fruit components.
