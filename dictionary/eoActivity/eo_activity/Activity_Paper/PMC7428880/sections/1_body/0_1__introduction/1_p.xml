<p>The medicinal relevance of plants chiefly lies in their chemistry, and plant secondary metabolites, in particular, are the key natural products that essentially drive the pharmacological activities of plants. Their utility spans industrial production frontiers such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and textiles. Medicinal plants are so regarded because they possess therapeutic properties and have active components useful for drug synthesis and relevant in phytomedicine. Alkaloids, quinones, coumarins, and flavonoid compounds have been implicated in pharmaceutical processes [

Scientific articles report that plant extract used in phytomedicine has paved the way for improved therapeutic scientific insights towards the development of the empirical medicinal system [

Oxidative stress, which in principle alters the physiological dynamics and triggers equilibrium disruption, is linked to series of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, gastric ulcers, vasculitis, and lupus erythematous, including protein and DNA damage. In this regard, antioxidants provide defence mechanism through the prevention of oxidative damage, which is a notorious tendency of free radicals [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These defence mechanisms are expressed through enzymatic and nonenzymatic processes, some of which include the peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and the glutathione in its reduced form [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Antioxidants are peculiar in action because they have the capacity for repair, suppression of free radical formation, and scavenging. In biological systems, antioxidants express their mechanism through chelation of metal ion, regulation of gene expression, and the coantioxidants. Fruits are sources of many nonenzyme antioxidants like vitamins, gallic acid, rutin, and quercetin [
