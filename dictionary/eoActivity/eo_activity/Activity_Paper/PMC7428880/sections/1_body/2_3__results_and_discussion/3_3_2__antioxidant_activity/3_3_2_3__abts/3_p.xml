 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows that the rutin standard (99.10 ± 0.0004%) and acetone and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> flesh and peel had the peak ABTS radical scavenging activity at the highest concentration gradient (0.08 mg/mL). However, amongst the aqueous extracts, all except 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> flesh had peak activity at the highest concentration gradient. 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> flesh had its peak activity at 0.04 mg/mL, while 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> had its own peak activity at 0.01 mg/mL concentration gradient.
