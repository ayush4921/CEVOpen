 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the extraction yield of the solvents from the fruit compartments of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic>. The aqueous and ethanol extracts had the highest and lowest yields, respectively, across the flesh and peel compartments of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic>. In this regard, a consistent yield trend in the order aqueous &gt; ethanol &gt; acetone was observed. On the other hand, boiled peel extracts (Be and Pe) had the lowest yields in their respective aqueous extract groups of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic>.
