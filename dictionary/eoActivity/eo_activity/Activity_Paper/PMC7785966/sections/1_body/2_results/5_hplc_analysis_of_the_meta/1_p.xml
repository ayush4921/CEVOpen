<p>The results of the regression equations and the LODs and LOQs for the six coumarin standards are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS11">Supplementary Table 11</xref>. Precision was evaluated by the relative standard deviation (RSD) values of the peak area of the standard solutions, which were 1.10–1.70%. The RSD repeatability values were 1.39–2.44%, which were indirectly assessed by detecting six samples on the same day. RSD values of stability evaluated in the same sample solution at different time points (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h) were &lt;1.89%. A recovery experiment was conducted in which the standards were added to sample powder with known content to evaluate accuracy of the method, and percent recovery was 96.50–102.41%. The peak times of the target peaks on the chromatogram were appropriate with good resolution and there was no negative interference [50% methanol-dichloromethane solution (v/v) as a negative control] (
