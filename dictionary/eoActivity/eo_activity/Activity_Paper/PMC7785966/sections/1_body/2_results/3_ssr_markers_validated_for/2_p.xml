<p>A total of 132 alleles were obtained for all 17 SSR loci among all population samples, and the number of alleles (
 <italic>Na</italic>) varied from 4 (Abssr107, Abssr128) to 15 (Abssr39) with an average value of 7.76 alleles per locus (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS8">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). The Abssr39 locus revealed the most abundant genetic variation among the 17 loci investigated, followed by the Abssr33 locus. Both loci had high identification efficiency and therefore are valued for applications to identify 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> samples/taxon and closely related species. We further compared the genetic diversity of samples from the three different sampling sites. Although 113 alleles were observed in the Puling population, the overall genetic diversity of the Langping population was the highest among the three sampling sites, suggesting richer genetic variation presented in the 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> samples from Langping (
