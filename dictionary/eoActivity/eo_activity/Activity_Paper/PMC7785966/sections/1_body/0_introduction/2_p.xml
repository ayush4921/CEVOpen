 <italic>Angelica biserrata</italic> naturally occurs in south-central and southeast China, with a central distribution area within and around the Wuling Mountains, including the joining region of Hubei, Chongqing, Hunan, and Guizhou Provinces (

 <italic>A. biserrata</italic>. The Ziqiu town of Changyang is historically known for its role as a local market and circulation terminal for 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic>, which is collected and transported from the surrounding wild and planted areas. Given the good quality and yield of 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> within and around the Changyang region, “
 <italic>ZiqiuDuhuo</italic>” has been developed as a Geographical Indication Product for protection. The wild resource of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> within the Wuling Mountains is rich but has been greatly reduced recently due to severe excavation by local people to meet the increasing market demand. Artificial cultivation of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> has been rapidly developed but the medicinal quality of cultivated 
 <italic>Duhuo</italic> is much poorer than that of wild plants. Moreover, as a member of the Umbelliferae plants, the mating system of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> are thought to be outcrossing by wind or insect pollinations (
