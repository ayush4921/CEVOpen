<p>Our analysis further revealed a relatively higher ratio of genetic variation presented within populations than those between populations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS10">Supplementary Table 10</xref>). This result was similar to those reported from 
 <italic>Angelica sinensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) and 
 <italic>Daucus carota</italic> (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chaitra et al., 2020</xref>), of which most of genetic variation was found to be present within wild populations rather than between populations. Similar to many other Umbelliferae plants, 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> is a cross-pollinated plant, and both the pollen and seeds spread through wind or insects, leading to long-distance dispersal or exchanges of genetic materials between populations is possible. A high level of gene flow therefore possibly occurred across the populations of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> within and around the Changyang region we investigated. Continuously high level of gene flow can strongly weaken population genetic differences and keep a balance of genetic variation between populations in geographically adjacent localities. Further analysis is needed to investigate the population gene flow pattern of this species in future.
