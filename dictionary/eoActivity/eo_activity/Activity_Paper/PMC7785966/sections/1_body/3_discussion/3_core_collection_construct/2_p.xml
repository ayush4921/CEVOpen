<p>To construct a core collection of plants, the sampling strategy, including determining a reasonable sampling ratio is also important for the selection of core materials. Different sampling methods can directly affect the extraction of core materials. Due to the good representativeness and stability during the clustering procedure, the LDSS method is currently frequently used as a clustering procedure for constructing core collections of crops. It makes heterogeneous between core materials through deleting maximum genetic duplication of germplasms. Moreover, similar to the maximization (M) strategy which maintains diverse alleles through retaining maximum number of alleles at each locus (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al., 2017</xref>), the LDSS method also preserve a sufficient number of alleles on the basis of avoiding genetic duplication to the greatest extent. For medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic>, this method can further combine both genetic and metabolic data in the core collection construction. Moreover, the sampling ratio is often adjusted according to the scale of the original population and richness of genetic diversity during construction of core collections (

 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> is valued for selecting materials for conservation and breeding of this plant, and also provides reference for other medicinal plants in terms of core collection construction.
