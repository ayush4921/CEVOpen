<p>Previous studies of 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> mainly focused on its chemical and pharmacological aspects, while there are few reports in relation to molecular and genetic diversity of this medicinal plant. Population genetic diversity plays an irreplaceable role in the survival and evolution of organisms and it is extremely important for genetic innovation and breeding of plants. Here, we found a relatively high level of genetic diversity occurred in the wild 
 <italic>A. biserrata</italic> germplasm (average 
 <italic>PIC</italic> value: 0.67, average Shannon’s information index 
 <italic>I</italic>: 1.52; 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which was comparable to those of other plants within the same 
 <italic>Angelica</italic> genus. For example, using a similar method of ten transcriptome derived SSRs, a genetic analysis of 56 
 <italic>A. dahurica</italic> ecotype samples revealed an average 
 <italic>PIC</italic> value was 0.41 and the Shannon’s information index 
 <italic>I</italic> was 0.85 (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Given the different sample numbers investigated within both analyses, the levels of genetic diversity of these two 
 <italic>Angelica</italic> plants are therefore consistently high.
