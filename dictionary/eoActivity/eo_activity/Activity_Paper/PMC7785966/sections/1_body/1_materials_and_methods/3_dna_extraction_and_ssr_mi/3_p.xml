<p>The forward and reverse primers were synthesized commercially, in which the forward primer was added with an M13 tail sequence (GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT) labeling with FAM (blue), HEX (green), and ROX (red). The genomic DNA was PCR amplified in a 10 μl solution whose reaction system contained: 2 μl genomic DNA, 5 μl 2 × 
 <italic>Taq</italic> PCR MasterMix, 0.04 μl forward primer, 0.25 μl reverse primer, 0.15 μl M13-FAM/M13-HEX/M13-ROX, and 2.6 μl ultrapure water. The mixed PCR amplifications were performed in a BiometraTone 96G (Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany) with a PCR amplification cycle of 94°C pre-denaturation for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 54°C annealing for 30 s, 72°C extension for 30 s, and a 72°C extension for 10 min. The PCR products were detected by automatic fluorescence using an ABI 3730XL Sequence Analyzer. GeneMapper3.0 software was used to analyze the amplified fragment size of the different samples at each SSR locus.
