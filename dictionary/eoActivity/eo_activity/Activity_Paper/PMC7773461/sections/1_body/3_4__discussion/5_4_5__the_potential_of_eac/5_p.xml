<p>The induced-fit docking result of pectolinarin against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was −8.054 [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, the best pose between pectolinarin and S protein was −9.8 and −8.2 with M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Pectolinarin can be found in plume thistles (
 <italic>Cirsium</italic> spp). The morin docking result by Jo et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was −8,930. The best docking scores of morin against S protein and M
 <sup>pro</sup> were −8.8 and −7.8, respectively. Almond, old fustic, and guava contain a high quantity of this compound.
