<p>The results of the interaction between the S protein and the selected ligands show that there are unfavorable donor-donor bonds, which means that this bond shows the repulsive force between the two molecules. The formation of this bond can reduce the stability of other types of bonds so that it can affect the stability of the ligands that will be used as drug candidates [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. The ligands with this type of bond are hesperidin and pectolinarin, located in the residue Arg-A: 1039 and Arg-B: 1039.
