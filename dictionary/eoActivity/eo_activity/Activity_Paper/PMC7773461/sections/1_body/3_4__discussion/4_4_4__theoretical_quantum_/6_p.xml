<p>The molecular electrostatic potential surface (MEPS) [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] is a 3D plot of the electrostatic potential for a respective molecule mapped onto the constant electron density surface. Over the years, MEPS was established as a great and effective interpretive tool for intermolecular interactions [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. With the recent advances in computational technology, it is currently being applied to give detailed information for studies on chemical reactivity (as well as the biological recognition process and hydrogen bonding interaction), crystal behavior, molecular cluster, and zeolite even as the correlation and prediction of a wide range of macroscopic properties [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Besides that, due to the density functional theory contributions, the MEPS is rigorously defined in terms of the electron density, and it explicitly reflects opposing contributions from the nuclei and the electrons [
