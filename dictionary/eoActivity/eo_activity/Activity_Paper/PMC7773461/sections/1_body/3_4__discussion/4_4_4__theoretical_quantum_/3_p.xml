<p>The original basis for the concept of hardness (
 <italic>η</italic>) and softness (
 <italic>S</italic>) lies in observations made by inorganic chemists from the coordination chemistry and is related to a compound's reactivity. Soft ions/molecules are more polarizable species and more reactive since the electrons are farther from the nucleus. In contrast, hard ions/molecules are less polarizable and less reactive, since the electrons are closer to the nucleus. The chemical potential (
 <italic>μ</italic>) is a greatness that defines the flow of matter. In general, a system always tends to shift from greater chemical potential to lower chemical potential, since this is its most stable configuration. The greatness given as the negative of the chemical potential is the electronegativity (
 <italic>χ</italic>). For any system, the value 
 <italic>χ</italic> is called the absolute electronegativity and is related to the power to attract electrons [

 <italic>ω</italic>), a global maximum reactivity index that measures the energy lowering due to charge transfer. The electrophilicity index allows classification of organic molecules as strong with 
 <italic>ω</italic> &gt; 1.5 eV, moderate with 0.8 &lt; 
 <italic>ω</italic> &lt; 1.5 eV, and marginal electrophiles with 
 <italic>ω</italic> &lt; 0.8 eV [
