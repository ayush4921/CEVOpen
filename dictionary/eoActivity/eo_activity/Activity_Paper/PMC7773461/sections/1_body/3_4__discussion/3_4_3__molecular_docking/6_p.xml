<p>According to the research by Tahir ul Qamar et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], the binding site area of M
 <sup>pro</sup> is located on the active sites of Cys-145 and His-41. The ligands that bind to this receptor's active site can significantly inhibit the performance of the receptor. The ligand interactions that have the lowest binding affinity were hesperidin, pectolinarin, and epigallocatechin gallate, which indicated that the ligand was bound exactly to one of the active sites of the Cys-145 amino acid residue in the form of hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions. On the other hand, nabiximol did not bind to the active site of the enzyme.
