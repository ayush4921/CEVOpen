<p>There are three main criteria for carrying out molecular docking: bond intensity, molecular linkages, and bond characterization. Lead compounds have very small bond energies, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions and a good ADME profile [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Therefore, four ligands were selected as suitable lead compounds to inhibit the performance of the M
 <sup>pro</sup> and in further studies based on the abovementioned criteria. These compounds are hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, and epigallocatechin gallate.
