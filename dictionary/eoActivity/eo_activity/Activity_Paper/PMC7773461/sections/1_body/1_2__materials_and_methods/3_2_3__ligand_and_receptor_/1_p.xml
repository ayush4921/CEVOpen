These proteins were served as receptors in the docking process. The files were opened using BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer 2020. Water molecules and ligands that were still attached to the receptors were removed, and the receptors were stored in the pdb format. Using Autodock Tools, polar hydrogen atoms were added to the receptors. Subsequently, the files were saved in the pdbqt format.
