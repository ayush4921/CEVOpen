<p>The selection of plant-derived compounds used as ligands in the docking process in this study was based on in silico and in vitro experiments that we and other researchers have previously conducted on the antiviral activity of these compounds. The information was obtained through digital library search. These compounds were quinine [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], nabiximols (a combination of cannabidiol [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]and tetrahydrocannabinol [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]), hesperidin [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], rhoifolin [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], pectolinarin [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], morin [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], epigallocatechin gallate [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], herbacetin [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], ethyl cholate [
