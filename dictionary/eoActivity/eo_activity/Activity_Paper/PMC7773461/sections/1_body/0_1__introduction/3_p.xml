<p>Several agents are being used in clinical trials and protocols based on in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 or related viruses with limited clinical experience; however, the effectiveness of therapy for any type of drug has not been established [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] examined the effectiveness of tocilizumab (atlizumab, an immunosuppressive drug) in a retrospective analysis with the results such as reduced fever, oxygen demand, radiological features, and decreased C-reactive protein (CRP). Bian et al. [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], in an open-labeled clinical trial (concurrent controlled add-on clinical trial) of meplazumab, found a median virus clearance time, discharge time, and better repair time. In a study based on molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) of a docked protein-ligand compound, nelfinavir was predicted to be a COVID-19 drug candidate as the best potential inhibitor against main protease (M
