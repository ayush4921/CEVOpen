<p>Lai et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] presented a potential protective or restorative action of moscatilin on glycation that could cause various neurodegenerative diseases. Moscatilin could be obtained from orchids of 
 <italic>Dendrobium</italic> species, the famous source of this compound widespread in Southeast Asia. The pathology associated with neurodegeneration involves hyperglycemia accelerating the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). The authors presented the results, which indicated that moscatilin could protect human neuroblastoma cells against AGE-induced injury and mitochondrial dysfunction.
