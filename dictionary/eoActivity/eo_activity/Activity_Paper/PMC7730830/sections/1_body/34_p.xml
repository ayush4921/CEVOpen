<p>One article deals with the use of natural compounds against plant diseases. Sofy et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] proposed natural compounds, glycine betaine (GB) and chitosan (CH), alone or in combination, as natural compounds, which could be an alternative to chemical pesticides in the treatment of cucumber infected with mosaic cucumovirus. The authors underlined that the combined use of (GB) and (CH) evoked the best effect against virus infection. They also highlighted that their study is the first to demonstrate the induction of systemic plant resistance against virus, by using (GB).
