<p>The article by Palla et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] focuses on the antimalarial activity of 35 compounds, synthesized by them as a series of fosmidomycin (FSM) derivatives and conjugates with artemisinin and aminochloroquinoline. The authors evaluated efficacy of the synthesized compounds against the chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. They managed to synthesize four new compounds with higher antimalarial activity than fosmidomycin.
