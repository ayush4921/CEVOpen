<p>Piotrowska-Kempisty et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] evaluated hepatoprotective effect of 
 <italic>Aronia melanocarpa</italic> juice and sylimarin (positive control) in rats chronically treated with CCl
 <sub>4</sub>. The anti-fibrosis effect was expected by the authors. After application of aronia juice, hepatic lipid peroxidation was suppressed. Increased activity of hepatic antioxidant enzymes was not translated into an attenuation of liver fibrosis. On the other hand, histological examination revealed the beneficial effect of aronia juice. In the applied experimental model of fibrosis, the effect of silymarin was also very limited.
