<p>The next work by Imam et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] presents the results concerning the preparation of piperine complexes with better aqueous solubility than piperine alone. The authors managed to prepare stable binary inclusion complex (piperine and hydroxypropyl β-cyclodextrin) and ternary inclusion complex (containing additionally D-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate) with elevated solubility and dissolution. The authors proved an enhanced antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the ternary complex. The results of the authors are supported by molecular docking studies. These results provide a good support for application of the ternary complex as a functional ingredient of drugs and food.
