<p>Elmi et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] concentrated their studies on the chemical composition and biological (antioxidant, antibacterial, and cytotoxic) activity of aqueous and methanolic extracts of the bark of 
 <italic>Acacia seyal</italic>, which is a traditional medicinal plant used by the population of Djibouti in Randa in the form of aqueous extracts as an anti-infectious drug. The bark is rich in tannins, which could be responsible for its documented antioxidant activity (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP tests). Its sterols and oleamide could be responsible for its antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The cytotoxicity of aqueous bark extract against fibroblasts indicated that the safety of the extracts used by the Djibouti population should be verified.
