<p>Anti-inflammatory activity and also antioxidant activity were the focus of the studies performed by Pudziuvelyte et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05769" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The authors investigated ethanolic extracts of various organs of 
 <italic>Elsholtzia ciliata</italic>, a plant species widely distributed in China, Korea, and Europe. The results documented the anti-inflammatory activity of the examined extracts (in mouse peritoneal macrophage cell culture) and their antioxidant activity (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC assays). Additionally, the authors explored for the first time antioxidant efficiency with the use of HPLC-ABTS post-column method, which can be used to identify active compounds, such as avicularin, chlorogenic acid, and rosmarinic acid, in the extracts.
