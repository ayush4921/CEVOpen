<p>In the simulated warehouse experiment, almost all potatoes in the control group were infested by 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> (rate of potato damage: 87.4%). The eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol treatment significantly reduced the potato damage (
 <italic>F</italic> = 42.9; df = 3,11; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The rates of potato damage after the eucarvone and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene treatments were not significantly different at 44.4 and 50.5%, respectively. The rate of potato damage after the methyleugenol treatment was 20.2% and this was significantly lower than the eucarvone and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene treatments (
