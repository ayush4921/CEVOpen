 <italic>Phthorimaea operculella</italic> (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is a worldwide pest of crop plants in the Solanaceae (

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Kwon et al. 2017</xref>). It is a major pest of potato and is present in more than 10 provinces in China. Among those provinces, the infestations of 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> in Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichun, and other southwestern regions are particularly serious and plant damage is increasing yearly (

 <italic>P. operculella</italic> infestations occur in fields and during potato storage. In potato storage facilities, 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> larvae bore into the potato tuber and discharge dark brown feces outside the borehole. This makes the potato inedible and unmarketable and can cause losses as high as 80%. Thus, it is important to prevent and control 
 <italic>P. operculella</italic> during the storage period (

However, most chemical synthetic fumigants have restricted applications because of adverse environmental effects, high mammalian toxicity or reduced efficacy due to pest resistance (

 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Ramadan et al. 2020</xref>). Plant volatiles represent potential fumigants with safer characteristics. The secondary metabolites produced by plants constitute the chemical defense system of plants against herbivores. Among them, the volatile components of plants play an essential role. Many countries, especially developing countries, have used aromatic plants for pest control during the storage period of foods (
