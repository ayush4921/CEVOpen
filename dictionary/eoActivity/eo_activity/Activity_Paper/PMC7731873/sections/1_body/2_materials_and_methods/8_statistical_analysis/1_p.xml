<p>Morality data were corrected using Abbott’s formula. Probit regression analysis was used to estimate the LC
 <sub>50</sub> and LC
 <sub>90</sub> (95% confidence interval). The selective ODI was calculated according to the following formula (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Sinthusiri and Soonwera 2014</xref>): ODI = amount of eggs laid (treatment - control)/amount of eggs laid (treatment + control). The range of ODI was -0.1–+1.0. An ODI ≤−0.3 represents an oviposition deterrent effect, and an ODI ≥+0.3 represents oviposition attraction. An ODI = -0.3–+0.3 indicated no effect on oviposition. Comparison among multiple groups in the simulated warehouse experiment was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s HSD test. The rate of potato damage was calculated using the following formula (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Anfora et al. 2014</xref>): Rate of potato damage (%) = Number of potatoes infested by larvae/total number of potatoes × 100. SPSS 17.0 software (IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis of the data.
