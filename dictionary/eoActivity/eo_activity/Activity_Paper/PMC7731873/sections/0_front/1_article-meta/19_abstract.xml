  <italic>Phthorimaea operculella</italic> (Zeller) is a worldwide pest of potato. Plant-borne chemicals would be potential alternatives of synthetic chemical fumigants against 
  <italic>P. operculella</italic> in the storage. Asari Radix et Rhizoma is derived from the dry roots and rhizomes of 
  <italic>Asarum heterotropoides</italic> Fr. Schmidt var. 
  <italic>mandshuricum</italic>, 
  <italic>A. sieboldii</italic> Miq. var. 
  <italic>seoulense</italic>, or 
  <italic>A. sieboldii</italic>. In this study, fumigant toxicity and oviposition deterrent of volatile constituents from ARR, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol were tested against 
  <italic>P. operculella</italic>. The preliminary verification of preventive and control effects of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene and methyleugenol on 
  <italic>P. operculella</italic> was carried out by simulating warehouse experiments. The results indicated that the six compounds above had fumigation toxic effects on the adults and eggs of 
  <italic>P. operculella</italic>. Among them, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene had weaker fumigation effects than those of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol. The LC
  <sub>50</sub> values of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol against adult 
  <italic>P. operculella</italic> were 1.01, 1.78, 1.51 mg/liter air, respectively. The LC
  <sub>50</sub> values against egg 
  <italic>P. operculella</italic> were 1.09, 0.55, 0.30 mg/liter air, respectively. The oviposition deterrent experiment showed that only methyleugenol (at 5 and 1 mg/ml) and eucarvone (5 mg/ml) had a substantial oviposition deterrent effect. The simulated warehouse experiment verified that methyleugenol, eucarvone, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene protected potatoes from 
  <italic>P. operculella</italic> and demonstrated that methyleugenol had the best preventive and control effects. It was concluded that methyleugenol was the active ingredient with the most potential in the volatiles from ARR on 
  <italic>P. operculella</italic> control and merit further study as botanic fumigant.
