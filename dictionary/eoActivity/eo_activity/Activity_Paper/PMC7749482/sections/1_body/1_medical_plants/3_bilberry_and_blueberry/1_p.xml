<p>Berry extracts containing anthocyanins have become quite popular in recent years among patients with AMD. Bilberry (
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic> L.) and blueberry (
 <italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</italic> L.) from Ericaceae contain a variety of phenolic compounds, including flavonols (quercetin, catechins), tannins, ellagitannins and phenolic acids. However, anthocyanins make by far the largest contribution to their phytochemical mix. Anthocyanins are used for manye age-related ocular disorders, but human data on bilberry for eye disorders are lacking (Gerding, 2009). The mechanisms of action behind berriesâ€™ beneficial effect on the eye are not completely understood. The ability to improve oxygen and blood delivery to the eye, and their potent antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties, suggest a potential benefit for AMD. In addition, as proven a long time ago, anthocyanosides have an affinity for the pigmented epithelium area of the retina, the portion of the retina responsible for vision and adjustments to light and dark (Levy and Glovinsky, 1998). Evidence (Milbury et al., 2007) has also shown that bilberry anthocyanins modulate oxidative stress defence enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferase-pi in human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Recently, Huang et al. (2018) demonstrated that the blueberry anthocyanin extract, and some of its components such as malvidin, malvidin-3-glucoside, and malvidin-3-galactoside, are able to reduce H

 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress by lowering the levels of ROS and malondialdehyde, and by increasing levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase in human retinal pigment epithelial cells. One cause of AMD is the accumulation of lipofuscin A2E (a pyridinium bisretinoid) and damage mediated by blue light illumination. A2E absorbs blue light and forms singlet oxygen through excitation, which can either cause damage to the retinal pigment epithelial cells or the epoxidation of A2E. A2E cannot be enzymatically degraded and accumulates in the RPE with age. Indeed the study of Jang et al. (2007) has shown that anthocyanins from blueberries are capable of reducing A2E-epoxidation by quenching singlet oxygen and protecting RPE cells from A2E cytotoxicity. In turn, treatment time appears to be an important factor in preventing macular degeneration. Fursova et al. (2005) observed that long-term (1.5 to 3 months) supplementation with bilberry extract to OXYS rats, affected by accelerated aging, which is associated with high sensitivity to oxidative stress, was effective in preventing degeneration. After 3 months of treatment, more than 70% of the control OXYS rats had macular degeneration, while bilberry supplementation completely prevented impairments in lenses and the retina. More recently, Osada et al. (2017) demonstrated that bilberry extract attenuates photo-induced apoptosis and visual dysfunction. This is most likely due, at least in part, to ROS reduction, and to subsequent endoplasmic reticulum stress attenuation in a murine model of photo-stressed retina (750 mg/kg body weight). It is important to highlight that the main complication for the clinical diffusion of anthocyanins is the potential slight absorption in cells or the circulatory system as anthocyanins are large highly water-soluble molecules. Kalt et al. (2008) revealed that pigs fed with diets supplemented with 0%, 1%, 2% or 4% (w/w) blueberries for 4 weeks accumulated anthocyanins in tissues beyond the blood-brain barrier (liver, eye, cortex and cerebellum).
