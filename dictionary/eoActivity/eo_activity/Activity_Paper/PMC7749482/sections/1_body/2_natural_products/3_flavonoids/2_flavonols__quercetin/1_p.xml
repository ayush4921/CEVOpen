<p>Quercetin is a flavonol-type flavonoid ubiquitously found in plant-based foods, such as onions, apples and tea, and is probably the most prominent dietary antioxidant (Wang et al., 2017). Like other polyphenols, it is able to decrease oxidative stress caused by exposure to light; this is confirmed by a reduction in 4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine, and 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative DNA damage levels, and up-regulated HO-1. Quercetin is able to lower levels of proapoptotic (BAX) proteins and to increase those of antiapoptotic (BCL2) proteins. In addition, like all polyphenols, this compound reduces the expression of angiogenic factors VEGF and hypoxia-induced factor-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor 1α), as Pawlowska et al. (2019) demonstrated. Quercetin protects against the light-induced reduction of the outer nuclear layer. Wang et al. (2013, 2017) suggests a mechanism for quercentin protective action in the retina that reduces oxidative stress produced by light exposure. Generally, that protective action may be accentuated by a direct scavenging of ROS and anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and antiangiogenic effects, and by an indirect decrease in A2E photooxidation, a lowering of methylglyoxal levels, and the inhibition of the receptor of advanced end glycation product up-egulation. Some polyphenols as quercentin regulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes, including phase II enzymes (Pawlowska et al., 2019). In addition, this flavonoid appears to inhibit CNV induced by laser irradiation in rabbit eyes both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, and increases choroidal blood flow. All those actions suggest that quercentin can be a promising candidate for treating AMD. In consequence, quercentin is considered to improve anti VEGF therapy, and this is the only effective treatment in wet AMD (Zhuang, 2011; Pawlowska et al., 2019). Several experimental reports demonstrate that quercentin reduces oxidative stress, which causes apoptosis in RPE cells. This compound protects retinas subjected to oxidative stress and inflammation, induced by light, which can provide new strategies to impede AMD occurrence and progression (Bungau et al., 2019).
