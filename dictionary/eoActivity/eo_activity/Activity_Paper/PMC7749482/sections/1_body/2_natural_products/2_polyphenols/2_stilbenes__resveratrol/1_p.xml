 <italic>Vaccinum</italic> species, is also presents in cocoa, peanuts, wine, grape juice and other grape products. The study of the therapeutic use of this substance on vision is growing, specifically in disease prevention terms (Abu-Amero et al., 2016). Regarding the activity of RV, Richer et al. (2014) suggest that this compound might contribute to reestablish the retinal architecture, decrease lipofuscin accumulation, increase choroidal thickness (perfusion), cut the glare recovery time, enlarge the macular pigment volume, and improve both contrast sensitivity and visual function, which all apparently improve retinal-RPE-choroidal cellular health. These authors conclude that RV offers long-term efficacy against AMD. The review by Abu-Amero et al. (2016) indicates that RV prevents oxidative stress-induced and sodium iodate-induced apoptosis of human RPE cells in vitro. Moreover, the proliferation of RPE cells has been shown to lower via the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases one and two (ERK1/2) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade. RV has also been reported to protect RPE cells from autoimmune antibodies-induced apoptosis 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (down-regulated pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), which is highly relevant in autoimmune-associated retinopathies. Due to the anti-apoptotic activity RV could be considered a good candidate in the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases like AMD. Although there are many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies that show the antioxidant efficacy of VR, however 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies show moderate efficacy, that could be important to AMD. RV is reported to exhibit a dose-dependent protective effect against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytoxicity in human retinal D407 RPE cells by rising glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities that lower intracellular ROS levels. Pathogenic late-stage AMD is often characterised by choroidal angiogenesis. The anti-oxidative and anti inflammatory effects of RV are knowed to diminish the incidence of CNV. RV produces inhibitory actions on inflammatory cytokine by transforming growth factor-beta and hypoxia-induced VEGF secretion by human RPE cells this confirms RV can be useful as dietary supplement to manage CNV processes in AMD. In addition, RV down-regulates the expression of nuclear factor-kappaB and hypoxia-induced factor-1α transcription factors by thereby inhibiting VEGF secretion. RV can also activate the eukaryotic factor-2 kinase and to reduce endothelial cell proliferation, VEGF secretion and migration by a novel SIRT1 independent pathway to prevent pathologically aberrant injury-induced angiogenesis. RV acts favorably in mitochondrial biogenesis and has demonstrated to protect RPE cells against acrolein-induced oxidative cytotoxicity by increasing mitochondrial bioenergetics. It has a significant protective effect against hydrogen peroxide-induced cytotoxicity in the RPE. RV has been effective in reducing intracellular ROS accumulation induced by hydrogen peroxide in epithelial crystalline cells in humans. It can also be effective for the eye’s microcirculation because of its vascular improvement properties. RV avoids retinal damage produced by light, and in addition, usually prevents damage, dysfunction and apoptosis in eyes with AMD (Fernández-Araque et al., 2017).
