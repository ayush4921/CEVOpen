<p>Alpha Glucosidase Inhibitors (AGIs) acarbose, voglibose, and miglitol are effective oral antidiabetic drugs [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They function by inhibiting the digestive α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzymes that break down starch and other oligosaccharides. [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] They have a better safety profile compared to other drugs such as insulin, sulphonylureas, biguanides, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, and SGLT-2 inhibitors [

 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, they are often accompanied by severe gastrointestinal side effects such as flatulence, diarrhea, and bloating, which limit patient acceptance and compliance [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The side effects are caused by the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates in the large intestine due to excessive AGIs inhibition of α-amylase [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop effective AGIs but without these side effects. Such AGIs should have high selectivity causing high inhibition of α-glucosidase and low inhibition of α-amylase.
