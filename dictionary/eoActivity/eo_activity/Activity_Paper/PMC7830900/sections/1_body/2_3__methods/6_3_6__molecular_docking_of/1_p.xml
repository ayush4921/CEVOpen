<p>The molecular interaction of the CSEs with porcine pancreatic α-amylase was studied using Schrödinger’s Maestro software. The enzyme porcine pancreatic α-amylase (PDB ID: 1OSE) was imported and the structure processed using the Protein Preparation Wizard module. The receptor grid was generated based on the coordinates of the bound acarbose in the crystal structure, known as the primary binding site [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00469" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The Glide suite was used to perform the docking of the CSEs with the Extra Precision (XP) option. Water molecules that are 5 Å away from the primary binding site were retained during the docking. Residues that possess bonds containing hydroxyl and thiol groups as well as single bonds not having a specific chirality in the ligands were considered to be flexible.
