<p>The general inhibitory values of the CSEs 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold> increase in the following order, mono-cinnamoyl moieties &lt; di-cinnamoyl ≤ tri-cinnamoyl &lt; tetra-cinnamoyl. The diisopropylidene bridges and acetyl groups have a modest impact on the inhibition values. In many aspects, the investigated CSEs showed similar trends observed in the case of FSEs but also contrasted in some aspects.
