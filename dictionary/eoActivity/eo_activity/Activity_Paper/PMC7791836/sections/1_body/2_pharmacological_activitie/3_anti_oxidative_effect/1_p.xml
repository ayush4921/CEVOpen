<p id="Par66">Oxidative stress refers to increased levels of intracellular ROS that result in damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]; this is the negative effect associated with the production of free radicals in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Oxidative stress can result from numerous external and endogenous factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], including alcohol, drugs, and environmental pollutants; these factors eventually promote premature aging and the negative sequelae of severe diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that activates antioxidant response elements to regulate the expression of a variety of cytoprotective genes, including detoxifying, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Previous studies revealed that PO exhibits significant antioxidant potential, by actions that promote the elimination of superoxide anion free radicals and hydroxyl free radicals, and that inhibit lipid peroxidation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. In addition to the nonvolatile constituents of 
 <italic>P. cablin</italic>, the administration of pachypodol can attenuate ROS production and thereby protect hepatocytes from oxidative cell death induced by tert-butyl-hydroperoxide. The underlying mechanism of this effect relates to the amplification of the endogenous antioxidant defense system via the ERK1/2-dependent activation of Nrf2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Alcohol intake can also promote oxidative damage to the liver, as it increases the activity of cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and leads to the generation of large quantities of ROS; this ultimately destroys the oxidation/reduction balance maintained by GSH/GSSG [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Ethanol-induced acute liver injury, typically caused by excessive alcohol consumption, has been associated with several serious liver disorders including alcoholic fatty liver, hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, steatosis, and cirrhosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Hepatic steatosis has been widely recognized as an early and reversible consequence of excessive alcohol consumption [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]; pretreatment with PO results in the increased concentration of the hepatic antioxidant, GSH, and a concomitant increase in the GSH/GSSG ratio, as well as the activation of anti-oxidative enzymes glutathione reductase (GR) and SOD. These responses serve to suppress the accumulation of ROS and decrease the expression of protein and mRNA encoding CYP2E1. The administration of PO could also prevent fatty degeneration by its capacity to accelerate adipose metabolism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Similar to what is observed in response to biochemical oxidative stress, heat shock-induced oxidative stress may promote damage to and apoptosis of intestinal epithelial-6 cells (IEC-6) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Pretreatment with PA circumvents the damage to the cellular morphology and results in a decrease in the MDA content that accumulated secondary to heat shock. High doses of PA also resulted in significant increases in the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PA was capable of mitigating cell damage and alleviating the oxidative stress responses of IEC-6 cells by the activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>].
