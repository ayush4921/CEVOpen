<p id="Par78">Secretory otitis media (SOM) includes inflammation of the mucosa of the middle ear, and is characterized by tympanic effusion, ear tightness, and hearing loss; these responses are typically associated with bacterial infection and can eventually lead to auditory tube dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Recent studies revealed that pogostone could reverse the hearing loss typically associated with SOM in experiments performed in a guinea pig model; the administration of pogostone alleviated the thickening of the mucous membrane and neutrophil infiltration by its capacity to inhibit the expression of TNF-α and intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 in the mucous membranes of the ear [

In addition, lung inflammation has been associated with several serious respiratory diseases, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and COPD, among others. The administration of PA serves to protect against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice by the suppression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 synthesis and release, as well as by its capacity to inhibit the phosphorylation of IκB-α and p65 NF-κB. The overall mechanism underlying the PA-mediated inhibition of the inflammatory response could be attributed to the inhibition of the NF-kB signaling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. Moreover, pogostone could exert protective effect with respect to lung injury associated with COPD, also in a mouse model; pogosone suppressed the expression of inflammatory-related proteins (p-IκBα and p-NF-κBp65) and promoted a significant increase in Nrf-2 and HO-1. Overall, these results suggested that the pogostone-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway could be the central mechanism underlying the protection of pulmonary tissue [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>]; the disorder is characterized by lipid deposition and the formation of foam cells in the vessel intima. Recent studies have illustrated that the administration of PA resulted in a significant attenuation of atherosclerotic plaques both in the aorta and at the aortic root; PA also resulted in the elimination of macrophages from the cell contents of lesions in atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE KO) mice. Moreover, PA inhibited the expression of aortic-associated macrophage inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, iNOS, MCP-1, IL-6, and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 11 in mouse model systems; these results demonstrated that PA could promote the attenuation of atherosclerosis, possibly by inhibiting macrophage infiltration and its inflammatory responses [
