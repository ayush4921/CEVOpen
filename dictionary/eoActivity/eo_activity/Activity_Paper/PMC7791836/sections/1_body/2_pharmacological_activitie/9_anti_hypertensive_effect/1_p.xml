<p id="Par74">Hypertension is a chronic and critical factor that promotes disability and can lead to premature death [

 <sup>2+</sup> antagonist in an endothelium-independent pathway. The underlying mechanisms include the blockade of extracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx via the membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells and the release of intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> through IP3R- and RYR-mediated Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels in the sarcolemma [
