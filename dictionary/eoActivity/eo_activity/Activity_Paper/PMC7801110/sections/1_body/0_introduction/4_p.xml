<p>In this scenario, we have applied a recently developed HPLC-MS method

 </xref> to study the degradation of NPFF and NPAF by IDE, identifying cleavage sites and generated cryptic peptides. Afterwards, we have investigated how NPs and insulin degradation by IDE affect each other and the results hint that the control of IDE activity by allosteric mechanisms could represent a possible link between insulin metabolism and neuronal communication.
