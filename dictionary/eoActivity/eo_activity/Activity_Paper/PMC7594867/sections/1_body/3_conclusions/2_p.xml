<p>In the current study, a library of 1302 pyrrolizine derivatives was designed based on the pyrrolizine-5-carboxamide scaffold 
 <bold>10</bold>. The 3D pharmacophore model of the multi-CDKI 
 <bold>3</bold> was used in the virtual screening of this library. The top-scoring hits were synthesised and evaluated for their cytotoxic activities against three cancer (MCF-7, A2780, and HT29) cell lines. The results revealed cytotoxic activities against the three cancer cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 0.16–34.13 μM. Among the new derivatives, compound 
 <bold>18b</bold> was the most active against MCF-7 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.19 μM). In addition, compounds 
 <bold>19a</bold> and 
 <bold>20a</bold> were the most potent in inhibiting the growth of and HT29 and A2780 cell lines, respectively. The results of the MTT assay of the new compounds against normal MRC-5 cells also revealed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 0.10–11.86 µM. Compounds 
 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold> increased the apoptotic events and arrested MCF-7 cells at the G
 <sub>1</sub> phase. Mechanistic study of compounds 
 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold> revealed potent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition in CDK-2 activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.53–115.3 nM). Among the three derivatives, compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against CDK-2. 
 <italic>In silico</italic> ADME study revealed that all new compounds conform to Lipinski’s rule. In addition, the molecular docking analyses indicated that compounds 
 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold> fit snugly into the active sites of CDK-2/6/9. Among the three derivatives, compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> also displayed the highest binding scores and exhibited several hydrogen bonding interactions with the three kinases. These preliminary results suggested that compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> could serve as a promising scaffold in the discovery and development of new potent anticancer agents.
