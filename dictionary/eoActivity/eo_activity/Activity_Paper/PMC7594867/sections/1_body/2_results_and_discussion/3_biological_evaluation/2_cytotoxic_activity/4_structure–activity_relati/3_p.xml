<p>Substitution on the phenyl ring in compound 
 <bold>16a</bold> with 4-CH
 <sub>3</sub> increased the cytotoxic activity against A2780 cells. On the other hand, significant decreases in cytotoxic activities of compound 
 <bold>16a</bold> against both MCF-7 and HT29 cell lines were observed on substitution with either 4-CH
 <sub>3</sub>/Cl groups on the phenyl ring. Moreover, substitution with CH
 <sub>3</sub>/Cl groups at the 
 <italic>para</italic>-position of the phenyl ring in compound 
 <bold>16a</bold> was associated with decrease in selectivity towards the three cancer cell lines,
