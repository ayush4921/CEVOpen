<p>The naphthalenyl urea derivatives 
 <bold>19a–c</bold> exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> in the range of 0.20–5.39 μM. Among these derivatives, compound 
 <bold>19a</bold> displayed the highest cytotoxic activity against HT29 cell line. On the other hand, the thiourea derivatives 
 <bold>20a–c</bold> exhibited higher cytotoxic activities against A2780 cells than their urea analogues 
 <bold>19a–c</bold>. However, they (
 <bold>20a–c</bold>) were less active against MCF-7 and HT29 cells compared to compounds 
 <bold>19a–c</bold>,
