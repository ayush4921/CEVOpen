 </xref>. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of the three compounds to bind to and inhibit these two kinases. Selection of these three compounds was based on their high CDK-2 inhibitory activities, Table 4. In addition, the two CDKs 6/9 were selected based on the results of the cell cycle analysis which revealed G
 <sub>1</sub> to S cell-cycle arrest by the three compounds (
 <bold>18b</bold>, 
 <bold>19a</bold>, and 
 <bold>20a</bold>),
