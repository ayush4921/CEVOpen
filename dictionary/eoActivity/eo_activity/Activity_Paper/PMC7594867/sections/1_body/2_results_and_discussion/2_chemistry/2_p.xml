 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>. Briefly, the lactam derivative 
 <bold>11</bold> was reacted with dimethyl sulphate followed by reaction with malononitrile to give compound 
 <bold>12</bold>. On the other hand, the anilides 
 <bold>14a–c</bold> were prepared form the reaction of (un)substituted-anilines with chloroacetyl chloride. The starting materials 
 <bold>15a–c</bold> were obtained from the reaction of compound 
 <bold>12</bold> with the acetanilides 
 <bold>14a–c</bold> in refluxing acetone
