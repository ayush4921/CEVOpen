<p>In attempt to compare the binding affinities of the three compounds against the CDKs, fold selectivity was calculated, 
 <xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. The three compounds displayed higher affinities towards CDK-6/9 than CDK-2 with fold selectivity in the range of 
 <bold>2.06</bold>â€“3.58. These results suggest that the three compounds could have better inhibitory activities against CDK-6/9 than CDK-2.
