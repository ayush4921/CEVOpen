<p>Based on the above-mentioned data, the current study was performed to optimise the cytotoxic potential, study the structure-activity relationship (SAR), and investigate the mechanism of action of the pyrrolizine-5-carboxamide 
 <bold>10</bold>. In this study, scaffold A (

 <bold>10</bold> and the multi-CDKIs 
 <bold>3</bold>
 <sup>17</sup>. In addition, a small library of 1302 urea/thiourea derivatives was generated through different structural modifications in scaffold A,
