<p>Moreover, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (AT7519) was obtained in an attempt to optimise the anticancer activity compound 
 <bold>3</bold>. However, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> exhibited weaker inhibitory activity against CDK-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 47â€‰nM) compared to the parent compound 
 <bold>3</bold> which indicates that the aromatic 4-fluorophenyl moiety is favoured for CDKs inhibition
