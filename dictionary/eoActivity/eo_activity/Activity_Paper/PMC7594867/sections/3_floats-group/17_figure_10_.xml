  <p>Binding modes and interactions of compounds 
   <bold>18b/20a</bold> into CDK-2 (pdb: 2VTP)): A) 3 D binding mode of compound 
   <bold>18b</bold> into CDK-2, the native ligand LZ9 shown as yellow sticks, receptor shown as hydrogen-bond surface; B) 3 D binding mode of compound 
   <bold>20a</bold> into CDK-2, the native ligand LZ9 shown as yellow sticks; C) 2 D binding mode of compound 
   <bold>18b</bold> into CDK-2 showing three conventional hydrogen bonds and several hydrophobic interactions; (C) 2D binding mode of compound 
   <bold>20a</bold> into CDK-2 showing four conventional hydrogen bonds and one pi-anion, and several hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen atoms were omitted for clarity.
