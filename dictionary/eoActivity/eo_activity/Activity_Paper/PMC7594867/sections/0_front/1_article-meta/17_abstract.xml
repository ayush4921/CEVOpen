 <p>In the current study, virtual screening of a small library of 1302 pyrrolizines bearing urea/thiourea moieties was performed. The top-scoring hits were synthesised and evaluated for their cytotoxicity against three cancer (MCF-7, A2780, and HT29) and one normal (MRC-5) cell lines. The results of the MTT assay revealed potent cytotoxic activities for most of the new compounds (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 0.16–34.13 μM). The drug-likeness study revealed that all the new compounds conform to Lipinski’s rule. Mechanistic studies of compounds 
  <bold>18 b</bold>, 
  <bold>19a</bold>, and 
  <bold>20a</bold> revealed the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G
  <sub>1</sub> phase in MCF-7 cells. The three compounds also displayed potent inhibitory activity against CDK-2 (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 25.53–115.30 nM). Moreover, the docking study revealed a nice fitting of compound 
  <bold>19a</bold> into the active sites of CDK-2/6/9. These preliminary results suggested that compound 
  <bold>19a</bold> could serve as a promising scaffold in the discovery of new potent anticancer agents.
