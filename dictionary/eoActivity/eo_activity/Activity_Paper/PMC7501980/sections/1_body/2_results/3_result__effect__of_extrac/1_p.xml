<p>A noticeable increase in fasting BGL was obtained in chemically (alloxan)-induced diabetic mice compared with the normal control group. According to one-way ANOVA analysis there was significant difference among diabetic control and the group that received the standard drug (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Analysis of post hoc test showed that aqueous (500 mg/kg) and 80% methanol extract (500 mg/kg) showed significant drops in the BGL compared to diabetic control (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) at 14 days. In addition, a similar result was detected at 21 days to that at 14 days, but there was significant decrease in BGL in 80% of methanol extract (500 mg/kg) (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and also significant decrease in BGL for aqueous 250 mg/kg and 80% methanol extract at dose 250 mg/kg (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) compared to diabetic control. However, glibenclamide and 
 <italic>T. Schimperi</italic> treatments failed to bring the blood glucose levels to normal values as in the nondiabetic control mice.
