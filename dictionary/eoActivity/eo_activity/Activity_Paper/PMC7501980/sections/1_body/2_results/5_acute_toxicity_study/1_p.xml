<p>The present study conducted as per the OECD guideline 425 revealed that aqueous and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> did not yield any morbidity during the study period of 14 days at dose of 2 g/kg of body weight. No neurological, behavioral and autonomic changes, physical changes like motor activity alertness, convulsions, restlessness, diarrhea, coma, lacrimation and appearance of the animals and no changes in respiratory circulation, eyes, sleep and the like were observed throughout study period. Moreover, the 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves extract did not lead to death in the mice at a dose of 2 g/kg during the study period time. The finding indicated that a single dose of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> extracts of both solvents had no adverse effect, demonstrating that the LD
 <sub>50</sub> could be greater than 2 g/kg/body weight in mice.
