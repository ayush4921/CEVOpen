<p>Orally 250 and 500 mg/kg of the hydroalcoholic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>T.schimperi</italic> were administered to Alloxan-induced diabetic mice (test groups); 0.66 mg/kg glibenclamide to positive control group; and distilled water (10 mL/kg) to negative control group. Normal control group (none diabetic mice) mice were received distilled water (10 mL/kg) orally. Mice in all groups were administered once daily for 21 days. BGL was measured by draining blood from the tail of each mouse. In the acute experiments samples were collected at 0, 2, and 4 h post administration. In the chronic experiments, BGL was measured at weekly for three weeks. The animal fasting glucose levels were estimated on days 1, 7, 14 and 21.
