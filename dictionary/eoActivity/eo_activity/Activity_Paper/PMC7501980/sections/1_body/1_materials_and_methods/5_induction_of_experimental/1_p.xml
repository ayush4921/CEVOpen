<p>Swiss albino mice of both sexes were fasted overnight and their weight and fasting blood glucose level was recorded. Alloxan was first weighed individually for each animal according to their body weight and then dissolved with 0.9% (w/v) normal saline just prior to injection and injected to overnight fasted mice through IP administration at a dose of 180 mg/kg/body weight to induce experimental diabetic mice. Food and water were presented to the animals 30 minafter drug administration.

Seven days after alloxan injection, plasma glucose level of each animal was determined and animals with a fasting blood glucose range above 200 mg/dL
