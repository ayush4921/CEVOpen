<p>The aqueous extract was prepared by macerating crushed leaves of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> (400 g) by using distilled water for 72 h in an Erlenmeyer conical flask with frequent agitation using a mini orbital shaker adjusting at 170 revolutions per minute for 90 minat room temperature. The first extract was filtered using folded gauze and a nylon cloth. Then, the extract was filtered by Watman filter paper No.1 under pressurized suction filtration system and the marc was again macerated twice with the help of the same volume of water to deeply extract the leaves of plant material. Then filtrates from each extraction were combined. Then the filtrates were frozen overnight using a deep freezer and set water free by using a lyophilizer and the freeze-dried product was kept in desiccators until utilized for the experiment purpose.
