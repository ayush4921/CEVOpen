<p>Six hundred gram powders of 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves were macerated with 1000 mL of 80% methanol for three days in an Erlenmeyer conical flask with frequent agitation using a mini orbital shaker adjusting at 170 revolutions per minute for 90 minat room temperature. First extract was filtered using folded gauze and a nylon cloth. Then, the extract was filtered by Watman filter paperNo. 1 using pressurized suction filtration system and the residual was macerated twice using equal volume of methanol to thoroughly extract the 
 <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves constituents. Then filtrates from each extraction were combined and methanol was removed by evaporation using rotary evaporator at 40°C and the filtrates were frozen overnight by the help of deep freezer and set water free by using a lyophilizer. The final yield found was 57 g (9.5% w/w) it was stored in refrigerator at 2–8°C and fresh stock solution was prepared and used for the experiment.
