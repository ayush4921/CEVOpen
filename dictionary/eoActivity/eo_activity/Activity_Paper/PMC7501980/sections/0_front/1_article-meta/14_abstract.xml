  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Diabetes mellitus disorder characterized by increase in serum glucose level as a result of change in fat, protein metabolism, and carbohydrate. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the aqueous and hydroalcoholic leaf extract of 
   <italic>Thymus. schimperi</italic> on blood glucose levels.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>The aqueous and 80% methanol extracts of 
   <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves were prepared. Swiss albino mice of either sex weighing 20â€“30 g were selected for the experiments. Mice that were made diabetic were divided into seven groups to study the antihyperglycemic effect of the extracts. Diabetes was induced by single intraperitonial injection of alloxan monohydrate (180 mg/kg body weight).

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>After diabetic mice were treated with an extract of solvent at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg for 21 days, there were significant decreases in fasting blood glucose when compared to diabetic controls. The observed antidiabetic activity could be associated with the phytochemicals present in this plant extract. The extract of solvent also prevented body weight loss of diabetic when compared to diabetic mice group. It was also observed that the extracts have shown no acute toxicity at a dose of 2 g/kg.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>The aqueous and 80% methanol extracts of 
   <italic>T. schimperi</italic> leaves have shown blood glucose level lowering effects in diabetic mice. Hence, the present study might support the traditional use of 
   <italic>T. schimperi</italic> for diabetes mellitus treatment.
