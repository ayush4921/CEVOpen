  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>Malaria is an important parasitic disease that affects mostly the African continent. Traditional medicine is very important in Mozambique and traditional healers play a key role in the primary health care services, particularly in rural areas. We aim to report the results of an ethnobotanical survey undertaken in Mogovolas district, northern region of Mozambique. We recorded and identified the medicinal plants used by traditional healers for treatment of malaria, as well as the mode of preparation and administration.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>The study was conducted in 14 villages from Mogovolas between June and August 2015. Sixteen traditional healers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Under their guidance, we collected medicinal plants and prepared herbarium specimens that were sent and kept at Eduardo Mondlane University Herbarium for scientific identification. We searched for information on the 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of the cited plants for antiplasmodial activity.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Traditional healers from Mogovolas district reported the use of 37 plants to treat malaria, belonging to 22 families. The most used species are 
   <italic>Ochna kirkii</italic> Oliv. (5 citations), 
   <italic>Ehretia amoena</italic> Klotzsch and 
   <italic>Pteleopsis myrtifolia</italic> (M.A.Lawson) Engl. &amp; Diels (both with 3 citations). These plants belong to Ochnaceae, Boraginaceae and Combretaceae families, respectively. The herbal remedies are prepared using leaves (22/37), roots (18/37), stem barks (16/37) and stems (3/37). The administration of the herbal remedies was made essentially by oral route and bathing.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>The ethnobotanical data resulted from this study can be the starting point for further chemical and pharmacological studies aiming to identify medicinal species with antimalarial activity, thus, open the insights for the discovery of new antimalarial substances, as well as better integration of the traditional medicine into the national health systems, particularly in developing countries, as the health system coverage is limited.</p>
