<p id="p0120">A semi-structured questionnaire that was developed for this study was individually applied to the traditional healers in order to obtain information about their age, gender, ethnicity, years of experience, knowledge about malaria and its traditional treatment (see Supplementary Material 1). The vernacular names of the plants used by traditional healers to treat malaria, as well as the methods of preparation and administration of the remedies were also registered. The ethnobotanical surveys were conducted by the researchers Leonardo Manuel and Aur√©lio Bechel with support from a translator. Makhuwa language was used whenever required, through the translator that was native of Nampula province.</p>
