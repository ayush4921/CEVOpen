<p>Based on the reports, different heterocyclic rings were combined with the phenol functional group since the phenol is one of the popular CAIs group and promising potential pharmacophore for new AChEIs. This study aimed to report CAs and AChE enzyme inhibitory potencies of the 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-((aryl)thio)ethanones 1â€“6 to find out CAs and AChE enzyme inhibitors for further studies.</p>
