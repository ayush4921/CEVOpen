<p>NMR spectra were recorded by Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) and Varian Mercury Plus Spectrometer 400 MHz (Varianinc., Palo Alto, California, U.S.) in DMSO - 
 <italic>d6</italic> (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). LCMS - IT - TOF system (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) was used for HRMS spectra. Electrothermal 9100 (IA9100, Bibby Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK) device was used to measure melting points (Mp). TLC - Silicagel HF254 (Merck Art 5715) plate was used to check the reaction process under UV lamb (Spectroline, ENF - 240C/ FE, New York, U.S.A). IR spectra of the compounds were recorded as potassium bromide pellets on a Perkin Elmer 100 Fourier transform (FT)-IR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham MA, USA)
