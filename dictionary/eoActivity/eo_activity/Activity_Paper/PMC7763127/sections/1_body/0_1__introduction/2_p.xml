<p>Carbonic anhydrase (CA) isoenzymes are metalloenzymes that catalyze a very easy reaction: the hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate and H+ [15–17]. This key reaction plays a significant role in more pathological and physiological mechanisms associated with ion transport, pH control, and fluid secretion [18]. The inhibition of these isoenzymes is the main goal correlated with the treatment of diverse diseases such as obesity, glaucoma, and epilepsy. More recently, CA inhibition was validated as a novel approach to fighting metastases and tumors. Paraoxonase, which has an important role in living metabolism, is a calcium-dependent enzyme and is also an organophosphate hydrolyzer. These enzymes can hydrolyze aromatic carboxyl esters such as phenylacetate and various lactones. The name “PON” is derived from paraoxon, a common in vitro substrate. Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), which is associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) with 355 amino acids, is the most studied member of the mammalian enzyme family. PON1 is considered an important enzyme for two main reasons in metabolism: (i) it protects the system against the neurotoxicity of organophosphates and (ii) oxidizing lipid levels interfere with the onset of atherosclerosis, thus preventing oxidation of low-density lipoproteins, so the activity of PON 1 is considered a risk for atherosclerosis.</p>
