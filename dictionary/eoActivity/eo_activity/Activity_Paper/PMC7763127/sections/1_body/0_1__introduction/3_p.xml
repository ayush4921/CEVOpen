<p>Taking these properties into consideration, we focused on water-soluble complexes as a strategy to explain Pcs in conjunction with the sulfonic acid group to study enzyme inhibition, chemical interactions, and theoretical properties. In this regard, water-soluble sulfonated zinc and gallium phthalocyanine complexes (1 and 2) were synthesized and their inhibition potential of hCA I and II isoenzymes and paraoxonase enzyme were investigated to give direction for further studies. Also, metal effects on carbonic anhydrase and paraoxonase inhibition activity were examined. To the best of our knowledge, even though there are some studies in the literature in which phthalocyanines are evaluated as carbonic anhydrase and α‐glucosidase enzyme inhibitors [19–22], carbonic anhydrase and paraoxonase inhibition activity of anionic water-soluble phthalocyanines has not been reported. Consequently, this is the first study including the evaluation of anionic water-soluble phthalocyanines bearing Ga and Zn metals and the sulfonic acid group as both potential carbonic anhydrase and paraoxonase enzyme inhibitors. Furthermore, molecular docking studies were also applied for a better understanding of the structural and binding profiles of synthesized complexes at the active sites of target enzymes.</p>
