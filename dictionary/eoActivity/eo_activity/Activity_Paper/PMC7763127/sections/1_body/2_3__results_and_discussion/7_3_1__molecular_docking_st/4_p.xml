<p>Zinc and gallium complexes are in a stronger interaction with the 1V04 target protein, which represents the PON1 enzyme, compared to other enzymes. The types of secondary chemical interactions of the compounds with the 1V04 target protein are greater, as seen in Table 2. In the gallium metal-centered complex, unlike in the zinc complex, the halogen bond with the HIS115, LEU240, LEU267, and ILE291 amino acid residues draws attention. The binding energies obtained from the docking results show that the calculated energy values are in a trend parallel with enzyme activities.</p>
