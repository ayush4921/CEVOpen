<p>The CA I and CA II inhibitory activities of the synthesized complexes were determined by hydratase activity (used carbon dioxide as a substrate) and esterase activity (used 4-nitrophenyl-acetate [NPA] as a substrate) assays to calculate the inhibition constants (Ki). Ki values were calculated from the Lineweaver–Burk graphs (Figure 3). The Ki values of the synthesized compounds 1–2 against PON1, hCA I, and hCA II isoforms are given in Table 1. Complexes 1 and 2 inhibited the cytosolic isoforms hCA I and hCA II in the micromolar range (Ki values of 26.09 µM and 43.11 µM for hCA I and 30.95 µM and 33.19 µM for hCA II, respectively). Complex 1, which included Zn metal, had higher inhibitory activity against both hCA I and hCA II with the Ki of 26.09 µM and 30.95 µM, respectively than complex 2 containing Ga metal (Ki values of 43.11 µM against hCA I and 33.19 µM against hCA II). According to these results, it could be considered that the atomic diameter of the Zn metal is larger than Ga; thus, the Zn complex is bulkier than the Ga complex. Their different steric effects could change the inhibitory activity because of an entrance of the active site cavity and the van der Waals interactions with amino acid residues.</p>
