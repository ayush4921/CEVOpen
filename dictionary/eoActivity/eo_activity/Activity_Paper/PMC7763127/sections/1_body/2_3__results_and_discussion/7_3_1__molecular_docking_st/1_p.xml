<p>Docking calculations were carried out using the HEX 8.0.0 program [40]. This docking simulation program has allowed the calculation of drug candidate molecules for high atomic weight with a metal center. Docking calculation parameters are correlation type, compute device, FFT mode, and sampling method. These parameters are shape only, CPU, 3D, and range angles, respectively. Grid parameters are solution-100 and step size-(5.5, 5.5, 2.8). Docking simulations for investigated complexes were implemented against 4WR7, 5AML, and 1V04 target proteins representing hCA I, hCA II, and PON1 enzymes, respectively. 4WR7 is the crystal structure of human carbonic anhydrase isozyme I with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-(propylthio) benzenesulfonamide. CA is an enzyme that catalyzes reversible carbon dioxide hydration. It is a metalloenzyme that ensures the regulation of acid-base balance and ion transport in all tissues and organs. It is known that increased levels of different CAs are associated with various diseases such as epilepsy and cancer. Since the enthalpy and entropy distribution range of this protein is quite wide, it has a greater entropy contribution to the binding affinity during simulation than enthalpy [41]. 5AML is the three-dimensional structure of human carbonic anhydrase II in complex with 2-(but-2-yn-1-ylsulfamoyl)-4-sulfamoylbenzoic acid. The 5AML target protein has selectivity corresponding to some CA isoforms with medical applications. This protein has a high potential modulus as it contains aliphatic, alkenyl, aralkyl groups, and saccharin derivative substituents [42].</p>
