<p>On the other hand, the in vitro inhibition effects of synthesized complexes on paraoxonase 1 (PON1) were investigated using paraoxon as a substrate. Both complex 1 and 2 inhibited PON1 (associated with HDL) with Ki of 0.37 µM and 0.27 µM, respectively, as noncompetitive inhibitors (Figure 4). These results demonstrated that complex 1 and 2 have a much stronger PON1 inhibitory activity than the reported PON1 inhibitors (Ki or IC50 values ranging between 35 µM and 550 µM) in the literature [37–39]. Besides, the changing metals and their atomic diameters have not shown a significant effect on PON1 inhibition.</p>
