<p>Acetazolamide (AAZ) is one of the best-known CAIs and is also used as a standard in CA assays [27]. Whereas complexes 1 and 2 showed much weaker inhibitory activity against hCA I and hCA II than AAZ (Ki of 250 nM and 12.1 nM against hCA I and hCA II, respectively) [28,29], they exhibited higher hCA I and II inhibitory activity than some synthesized compounds (Ki or IC50 values ranging between 75 µM and 620 µM against hCA I, between 126 µM and 427 µM against hCA II) reported as CAIs in the literature [30–33].</p>
