<p>Since both DSE from centaury roots [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and ISE from leaf explants [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] are asynchronous, collecting embryogenic tissues, specifically somatic embryos at different developmental stages for molecular and biochemical analyses, is very tedious and time-consuming. Unfortunately, the establishment of a synchronized embryogenic culture has not been achieved in 
 <italic>C. erythraea</italic> yet, and it remains one of our goals. A synchronized culture would not only aid the harvest of somatic embryos at a specific stage but would also indicate the exact timing to a specific developmental event under certain conditions. An alternative way to achieve this is documentation of the development of embryogenic structures on selected explants over time. Such documentation system has been established by the combination of photography (using a smartphone camera with a macro lens), image processing of focalstacks from the developing explants automated in Adobe Photoshop and Bridge, and a relational database built using Excel and R [
 <xref rid="B119-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. An example of such a time-lapse documentation video of SE from leaf explants is provided as a Supplement.
