<p>βGlcY has been widely used as a histochemical reagent to detect AGPs int issue sections [
 <xref rid="B107-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. When 
 <italic>C. erythraea</italic> roots are used for SE induction on a hormone-free medium, initially, the whole root explants were stained with βGlcY, but the most intense staining was in the epidermal cells and vascular tissue [

 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. After one week in culture, βGlcY intensively stained AGPs in the surface cell layers of the centaury root explants, where somatic embryos were likely to develop. A similar staining pattern was observed in the outer epidermal cells during SE induction in chicory root culture [
 <xref rid="B99-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Considering that somatic embryos originate directly from the root epidermal cells [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], the accumulation of AGPs in this region is indicative of their involvement in SE initiation. After two weeks in culture, the subepidermal layers of root explants also reacted with βGlcY, but neither developing globular embryos nor adventitious buds (which form alongside the embryos) showed significant precipitation of AGPs with βGlcY [
 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Finally, after 8 weeks in root culture, the epidermal and subepidermal cells were deeply stained with βGlcY, while staining of vascular tissue was less intense. This is shown in the root cross-section (
