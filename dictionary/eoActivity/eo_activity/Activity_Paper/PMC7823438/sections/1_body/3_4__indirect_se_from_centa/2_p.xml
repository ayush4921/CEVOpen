<p>The effect of nutrient media and different PGRs on regeneration possibilities from centaury leaf explants have been investigated in several previous studies [

 <xref rid="B62-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], but in all these reports, only adventitious buds and calli regenerated on the leaf explants. Recent research revealed that centaury leaf explants cultured on hormone-free medium in the light produced only a few shoots, while roots developed in darkness [
