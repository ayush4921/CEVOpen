<p>Since the two main systems for the SE induction in centaury, DSE from root culture [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and ISE from leaf culture [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], differ in their requirements regarding the addition of PGRs for the SE induction, the endogenous contents of different CKs, IAA, salicylic acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) were analyzed in the roots and shoots of the in vitro grown plants as the sources of explants [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It was found that the total amount of endogenous CKs was 1.4 times higher in shoots as compared to shoots, but inactive or weakly active 
 <italic>N</italic>-glucosides were the predominate CK forms in both organs, whereas free bases and O-glucosides represented only a small portion of the total CK pool. The roots were characterized with higher IAA content but lower IAA/free CK bases ratio and lower ABA content in comparison to roots. The most significant difference, however, was a 44-fold higher SA content in the roots as compared to shoots [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It is not clear which of these differences allows spontaneous SE from roots but not from shoots; for example, Quiroz-Figueroa et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] demonstrated that very low concentrations of salicylates could induce cellular growth and enhance somatic embryogenesis in 
 <italic>Coffea arabica.</italic> Planned investigation considering the determination of endogenous levels of phytohormones at different stages of somatic embryo development aims to relate these levels to the embryogenic capacity of centaury root and shoot explants. The processes of SE from centaury root and leaf cultures are presented in
