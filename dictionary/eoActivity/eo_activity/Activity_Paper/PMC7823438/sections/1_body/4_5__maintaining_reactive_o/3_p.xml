<p>To our best knowledge, the only study on the roles of antioxidative enzymes in relation to SE within the Gentianaceae family is the study on the already described system of regeneration and ISE induction from centaury leaf explants [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. FilipoviÄ‡ et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] investigated the activities of SODs, CATs, and POXs in a comprehensive set of samples comprising intact leaves, wounded explants, and explants grown either in light or darkness on three types of media, of which one inductive medium (0.2 mg/L 2,4-D and 0.5 mg/L CPPU) supported ISE. Of these, only the changes in the antioxidative activities in response to wounding and during ISE will be discussed here.
