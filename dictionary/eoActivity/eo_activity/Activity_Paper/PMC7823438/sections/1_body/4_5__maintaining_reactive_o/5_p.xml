<p>Following rapid responses to wounding, ROS homeostasis has to be reestablished, which is crucial for initial cell dedifferentiation and division during callus formation [

Subsequent planting of the centaury leaf explants on inductive medium strongly induced total POX activity, both in light and darkness, suggesting the importance of these enzymes in cell division, growth, and differentiation, probably through their action on cell wall remodeling [
 <xref rid="B82-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. A statistically significant increase in POX activity in comparison to the control intact leaves occurred after seven days of incubation, when the first cell divisions and the formation of meristem centers in the sections of the centaury leaves were observed, with the peaks of POX activity on the 14th or 21st day in culture, which coincidence with the emergence of somatic embryos. Therefore, it could be concluded that POXs play an important role in the development of centaury somatic embryos. Previous reports confirmed the important role of POX during SE induction from leaf explants of

On the contrary, SOD activity decreased in light and remained unchanged during ISE in darkness, while CAT activity decreased during ISE both in light and darkness. The obtained results illustrate that dynamic changes in the antioxidative enzymatic capacity upon wounding and in response to SE induction are required to maintain ROS homeostasis in centaury leaf explants.
