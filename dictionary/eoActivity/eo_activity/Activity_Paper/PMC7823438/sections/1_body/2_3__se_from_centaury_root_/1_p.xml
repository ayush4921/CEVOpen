<p>Both SE and organogenesis in vitro can proceed either spontaneously, on hormone-free media, or be induced by (a combination of) PGRs. PGRs exogenously added to the nutrition medium, as well as the content of endogenous hormones in different plant tissues, affect the induction of SE [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Auxins and cytokinins (CKs) are the main factors that determine the response and direction of SE by controlling the cell cycle, activation of cell divisions, and cell differentiation [
