<p>Subotić et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] achieved the induction of SE from centaury root culture on solid half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium (½MS) without the addition of PGRs in the light. The somatic embryos developed alongside adventitious buds, so somatic embryos and adventitious buds of different developmental stages could be observed on the same root explant. Histological studies revealed that the somatic embryos formed directly from the epidermal cells, without the callusing phase, while adventitious buds developed from root cortex tissue [

In other words, SE from centaury root explants was spontaneous, direct (DSE), asynchronous, and occurred simultaneously with organogenesis. Somatic embryos derived from root explants of in vitro-grown centaury followed a unicellular pathway of DSE. These observations were in accordance with an earlier report describing in vitro morphogenesis from apical segments of primary hairy roots [

 <xref rid="B51-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported the effects of exogenous gibberellic acid (GA
 <sub>3</sub>) and paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of gibberellin synthesis, both added at concentrations 0.01–3.0 µM, on the SE induction in wild type and hairy root centaury culture. It was shown that GA
 <sub>3</sub> had an inhibitory effect on the process of SE, while paclobutrazol in all applied concentrations had a stimulatory effect. The induction of SE in solid centaury root culture is presented in
