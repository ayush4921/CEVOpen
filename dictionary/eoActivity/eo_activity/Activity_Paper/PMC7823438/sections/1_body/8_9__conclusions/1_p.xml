<p>Even after 20 years of research, 
 <italic>Centaurium erythraea</italic> remains an attractive, challenging, and yet rewarding experimental object at our Department. 
 <italic>C. erythraea</italic> is already firmly established as a valued model system at our Department for the studies on alternative ways for the production of secondary metabolites and for the studies on morphogenesis in vitro—both primarily aimed at its conservation and sustainable usage. However, the accumulated data and successful protocols for the centaury propagation in vitro [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have led us to gradually shift our focus from centaury’s potential as a medicinal plant to its possibly even greater potential as a genetic resource for crop improvement. Namely, we believe that centaury’s immense regeneration potential and developmental plasticity, when cultivated in vitro, rely on the presence or high activity of certain genes that may not be present or active in plant species recalcitrant to SE induction or in vitro propagation and manipulations in general. Having a sequenced 
 <italic>C. erythraea</italic> transcriptome [
 <xref rid="B116-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] would allow us, and other research groups interested in centaury development, to mine for genes that are highly active during SE and organogenesis, and hopefully find genes, such as 
 <italic>UN1</italic> [
 <xref rid="B117-plants-10-00070" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], that were not described before. Such novel genes, as well as known genes previously unassociated with morphogenesis, could be considered as sequence resources for the genetic improvement of valuable crops that are recalcitrant to in vitro manipulations. In addition, finding genes that are differentially expressed during DSE and ISE from roots and leaves, respectively, specifically AGP genes and genes associated with auxin and cytokinin signaling or metabolism, as well as differences in the endogenous hormones during these two processes, would probably highlight some factors governing SE via direct or indirect pathway. Thus, unrevealing at least a part of the molecular networks and genes that are at the base of SE induction and other regeneration processes in centaury is the primary focus for our future research.
