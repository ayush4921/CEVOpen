<p>Endophytic fungi were subjected to fermentation process in order to produce the secondary metabolites. Each of the fungal isolate was placed in a 50 mL of malt extract broth, 250 mL of Erlenmeyer flasks. Rotary shaker (Labcon FSVE-Spo8, Gauteng, South Africa) was set at 150 rpm and fungal isolates were incubated (Labcon FSVE-Spo8) for 5 days at 25 °C. The culture broth was filtered through a 0.45 μm sterile Acrodisc syringe filter (Pall Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI). In the dual culture method, the assay was conducted to check the antifungal activity of the endophytic fungi against selected pathogenic fungi. Potato dextrose agar (PDA; Merck Biolab, Gauteng, South Africa) media was used to perform a 3-point inoculation of 6 mm disks of the endophyte with a pathogenic fungus at the center. The plates were inoculated 5–8 days at 28 ± 10 °C. Incubation of the plates can result in the interference of the pathogen in the direction of endophytic fungal growth [
