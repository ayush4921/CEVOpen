<p>From previous study, stem and leaf extracts from 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> were found anticancer effects on human cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer (PC-3 cells), central nervous system tumor (SF-268), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), hepatoma cell (Huh-7), liver hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2), lung cancer (A 549), nonsmall-cell lung carcinoma (NCL-H460) and fibrosarcoma cell (HT1080).[

 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In this study, ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> also possessed cytotoxic activities against all tested cancer cell lines, especially gastric carcinoma (Kato-III) and colon adenocarcinoma (SW 620) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 72.9 and 73.4 μg/ml, respectively. However, its extract also had cytotoxic activities against ductal carcinoma (BT474), bronchogenic carcinoma (Chago K-1), and liver hepatoblastoma (Hep-G2) cell lines at high dose (IC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;100 μg/ml). The anticancer analysis of ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> is shown in
