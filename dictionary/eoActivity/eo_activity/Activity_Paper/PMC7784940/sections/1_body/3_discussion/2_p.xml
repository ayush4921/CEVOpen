<p>Vitamin and mineral analyses are used for estimation of the quantitative of mineral in food. Vitamins are arranged into two groups based on solubility including water-soluble vitamins and fat-soluble vitamins.[

 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In this study, we determined the content of Vitamin A, fat-soluble vitamins, calculated as retinal equivalent (1 μg of retinol = 6 μg of alpha-carotene or 12 μg of mixed carotenoids), according to the WHO.[

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The content was found to be 428.47 ± 3.00 μg/100 g sample. Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2 and Vitamin C, and water-soluble vitamins were determined. Their contents were found to be 0.41 ± 0.01, 0.17 ± 0.00, and 11.95 ± 0.86 mg/100 g sample, respectively. Minerals perform an essential role as a catalyst of biochemical reaction in the plant. Minerals are grouped into two groups based on human diets in amounts. Macroelements or major minerals are required &gt;100 mg, whereas microelements or trace minerals are required &lt;100 mg.[
