<p>The plates containing the agar medium MH and YPG were inoculated with 1 mL of bacterial and fungal suspensions respectively before being dried for 10 min. Afterward, 6 mm sterile discs were impregnated with 10 μL of each tested fraction (ET CE, But CE, Poly CE). The antibiogram discs; 1.67 mg/disc of ampicillin (AMP), 0.02 mg/disc of streptomycin (STR), and the antifungal disc of 5 mg/disc of fluconazole (FLU) were used as standard drugs. Finally, the plates inoculated with bacteria were incubated again at 37 °C and those inoculated with yeasts at 30 °C for 24 h. The growth inhibition zones were determined in mm [
