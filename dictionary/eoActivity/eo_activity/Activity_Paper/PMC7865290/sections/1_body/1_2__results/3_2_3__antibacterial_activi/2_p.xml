 <xref rid="molecules-26-00636-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> represents the results of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs)obtained by using the micro-dilution method. All fractions showed almost equal effects with concentrations ranged from 6.25 to 12.5 mg/mL against Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding Gram-positive bacteria, the MIC of the Poly CE was 3.125 mg/mL against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. The inhibition zone diameter bioassay showed that CE has a significant activity with an inhibition zone diameter of 12 mm against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and
