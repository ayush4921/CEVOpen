<p>The findings obtained in the present work showed that hydroethanol, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions from 
 <italic>C. europaeas</italic> showed an important anti-inflammatory effect. The observed inflammatory effect can be due to benzoic acid and isoparvifuran compounds identified in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fraction chemically characterized by GC-MS (

 <xref rid="molecules-26-00636-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Benzoic acid derivatives were found to have a potent effect to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase activity. Consequently, these chemicals can act as anti-inflammatory agents and can be used to treat various inflammatory disorders [
