<p>Regarding antibacterial activities investigated in the present work, almost all fractions from 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic> were more active on Gram-positive bacteria and yeasts. Our results showed that Gram-positive bacteria were generally more sensitive to plant fractions than Gram-negative bacteria. These results were closely similar to some studies showing the sensitivity of Gram bacteria to plant extracts more than Gram-negative [

 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The structure of the cell envelope may be responsible for this difference since Gram-negative bacteria have additional periplasmic space and a rigid layer between the outer and cytoplasmic membrane, which limits the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds [

 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Gram-negative) was the most resistant bacteria to plant fractions. This result consistent with the previous literature, which showed the resistance of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to conventional antimicrobials [
