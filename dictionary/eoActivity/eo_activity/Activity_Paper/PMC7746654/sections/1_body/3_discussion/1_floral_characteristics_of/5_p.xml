<p>Gynoecium characteristics, such as stylar lobation or stigma number and shape in 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and related genera, are critical for distinguishing between groups and species (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ambrish and Srivastava, 2014</xref>). In particular, the degree of lobation on the style is a key characteristic to discriminate the genera 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and 
 <italic>Huynhia</italic>, as well as 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Coppi et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we detected differences in stylar lobation and stigma shape between the very similar 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> species. All 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> had a consistently 2-fid style with oblong stigmas; whereas 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> had a 2-cleft style with oblate stigmas. Notably, all 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species shared the same tuberculate stigma cell pattern.
