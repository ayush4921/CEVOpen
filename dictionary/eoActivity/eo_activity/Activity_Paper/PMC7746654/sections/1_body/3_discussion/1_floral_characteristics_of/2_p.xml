<p>Based on floral morphology, only 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> had scorpioid cymes and white flowers with faucal appendages (also referred to as “faucal scale”) on the corolla tube, deeply lobed calyx, and indistinct linear-shaped style (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Faucal appendages, which appear in certain species, represent a useful diagnostic tool in Boraginaceae (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Weigend et al., 2016</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that these appendages could be modified through development of specialized epidermal cells to better attract pollinators (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Cohen, 2011</xref>). Accordingly, 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> with faucal appendages and 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> species without faucal appendages may attract different pollinators. In 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic>, 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic> could be easily distinguished from other species based on morphological traits, including corolla color, plant height, root length, and leaf shape (
