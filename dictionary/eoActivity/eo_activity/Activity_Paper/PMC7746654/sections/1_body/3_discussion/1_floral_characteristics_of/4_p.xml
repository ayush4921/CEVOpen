<p>A conical or papillose corolla epidermis is found on various angiosperm species (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Christensen and Hansen, 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">Whitney and Glover, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2020</xref>), where its tactile cues may promote pollination by certain insects (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">Whitney et al., 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). All studied species displayed a papillose cell pattern on the inner corolla. Only 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> had a unique papillose knobby pattern, which resulted in much higher and sharper pointed cells than a papillose conical type, (average papillose knobby cell height, 36.74 μm; papillose conical cell height, 10.70 μm), with non-glandular and glandular trichomes. As with the presence or absence of faucal appendages, inner corolla cellular patterns are also associated with pollinators. More comprehensive studies on differences in pollination position, visiting rate of pollinator, or pollen shape in 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> and 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> will provide better understanding of their reproduction.
