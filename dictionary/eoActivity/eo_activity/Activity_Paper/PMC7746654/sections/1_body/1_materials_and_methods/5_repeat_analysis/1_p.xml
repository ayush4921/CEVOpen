<p>We used REPuter to find forward and reverse repeats with minimal length of 20 bp, identity of 90%, and a Hamming distance of 3 (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Kurtz et al., 2001</xref>). SSRs were detected using MISA (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Beier et al., 2017</xref>), with the minimum number of repeat parameters set to 10, 5, 4, 3, 3, and 3 for mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotides, respectively. Tandem repeats ≥20 bp were identified using Tandem repeats finder (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Benson, 1999</xref>) with minimum alignment score of 50 and maximum period size of 500; the identity of repeats was set to ≥90%.
