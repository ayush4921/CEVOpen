<p>For detailed floral micromorphological observations, fully mature reproductive organs were examined using a stereo microscope (SZX16; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). For scanning electron microscopic observations, the dried samples from voucher specimens were rehydrated overnight in a wetting agent (Agepon: distilled water, 1:200; Agfa Gevaert, Leverkusen, Germany). The floral samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (50, 70, 90, 95, and 100% ethanol) at room temperature for 1 h at each ethanol concentration. The dehydrated material was immersed in liquid CO
 <sub>2</sub> for critical-point drying (SPI-13200JE-AB; SPI Supplies, West Chester, PA, United States) and subsequent mounting on aluminum stubs using a double-sided adhesive conductive carbon disk (05073-BA; SPI Supplies). All samples were coated with gold using an ion-sputtering device (208HR; Cressington Scientific Instruments Ltd., Watford, United Kingdom) and were observed using a low-voltage field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-7600F; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 5–10 kV and working distance of 8–10 mm.
