<p>Primers for indel markers were designed using NCBI Primer-BLAST. Specificity of indel markers was confirmed by PCR with 20 ng of genomic DNA extracted from eight samples of the four species. Reactions were carried out in a 20-μL PCR mixture with 10 pmol of PSY, TCY, and NCTV primers using a ProFlex PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, United States) with the following amplification parameters: initial denaturation at 95
 <sup>°</sup>C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 95
 <sup>°</sup>C for 50 s, 60
 <sup>°</sup>C for 50 s, and 72
 <sup>°</sup>C for 50 s; final extension at 72
 <sup>°</sup>C for 5 min. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel for 40 min at 150 V. The germplasms of the three Arnebia and one Lithospermum species are listed in
