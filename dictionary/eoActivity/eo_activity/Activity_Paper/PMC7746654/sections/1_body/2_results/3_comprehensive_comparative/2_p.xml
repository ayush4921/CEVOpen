<p>We analyzed sequence identity using MAUVE and mVISTA programs, with 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> as reference. Overall, Boraginaceae cp genome structure was well conserved (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), with genic regions being more conserved than IGS regions. Most genic regions were highly convergent; the only divergent regions were detected in 
 <italic>matK</italic>, 
 <italic>rpoC2</italic>, 
 <italic>rpoC1</italic>, 
 <italic>ycf1</italic>, 
 <italic>ycf2</italic>, and 
 <italic>ndhF</italic> genes. The highest divergence was observed in IGS regions, such as 
 <italic>atpH-atpI</italic>, 
 <italic>petN-psbM</italic>, 
 <italic>rbcL-psaI</italic>, 
 <italic>ycf4-cemA</italic>, 
 <italic>ndhF-rpl32</italic>, and 
 <italic>ndhC-trnV-UAC</italic>. The cp genomes of 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> were particularly highly conserved. Mildly divergent regions were identified in 
 <italic>trnS-GCU-trnG-UCC</italic>, 
 <italic>trnC-GCA-petN</italic>, 
 <italic>psaA-ycf3</italic>, 
 <italic>trnI-CAU-ycf2</italic>, 
 <italic>psbE-petL</italic>, 
 <italic>clpP</italic>, and 
 <italic>rps15-ycf1</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Nucleotide diversity (Pi) for the cp genome of the four species was calculated as 0.015 using the DNA SP program. IR regions (Pi = 0.007) were more variable than LSC (Pi = 0.0046) or SSC (Pi = 0.019) regions. Single-copy regions presented higher Pi values than IR regions. In particular, 
 <italic>trnH-psbA</italic> (Pi = 0.078) and 
 <italic>atpB-rbcL</italic> (Pi = 0.038) appeared highly diverse (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). In spite of the morphological and cp genome similarity between 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic>, the 
 <italic>atpB-rbcL</italic> region was more diverse (Pi = 0.048) than the average for the four cp genomes.
