<p>To identify the phylogenic relationships between 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> species within the Boraginaceae family, we aligned the whole chloroplast genomes and 71 conserved protein- CDS (65,155 bp) shared by the three 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> and one 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> accessions examined in this study, with 
 <italic>F. suspensa</italic> from the Oleaceae used as outgroup (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure 8</xref>). ML and BI topologies were highly congruent for both the whole chloroplast genomes and CDS data. All phylogenetic trees except 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> were strongly supported (ML = 100%, BI = 1.0). Seven species within the Boraginaceae clustered consistently with respect to the APG IV classification system. Overall, clustering revealed that 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> shared the closest phylogenetic relationship, with 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic> as their sister group and 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> clearly distinct from 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic>.
