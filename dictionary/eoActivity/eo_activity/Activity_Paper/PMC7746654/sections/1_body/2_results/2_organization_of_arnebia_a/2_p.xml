<p>REPuter-based analysis of repetitive sequences, such as forward and reverse repeats, yielded 39–55 repeats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the three 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> cp genomes, they were located in the intragenic spacer (IGS) region, while in 
 <italic>L. erythrorhizon</italic> they were particularly abundant in exons. MISA software (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Beier et al., 2017</xref>) identified a total of 420–439 SSRs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), mostly in the LSC and particularly within the IGS region. The pentanucleotide motif was the most abundant in all accessions, followed by hexanucleotide motif repeats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>). Tandem repeats finder (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Benson, 1999</xref>) located most tandem repeats in the LSC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). They were generally 31–50 bp long and only 2–5 tandem repeats &gt;71 bp in length were identified in all four accessions.
