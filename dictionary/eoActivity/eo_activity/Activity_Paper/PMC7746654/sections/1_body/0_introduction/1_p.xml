 <italic>Arnebia</italic> Forssk., an economically and medicinally important plant group of the Boraginaceae Juss. (tribe Lithospermeae Dumort.) comprises 25–30 species, distributed across Southwest and Central Asia, the Himalayas, Northeast Africa, and (Southeast) Mediterranean (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Coppi et al., 2015</xref>). Plants in the 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> are distinguishable from other Boraginaceae based on an actinomorphic corolla devoid of appendages, di- or tetra-stigmatic flowers, a style divided in two or four parts, a fruiting calyx often hardened and enclosing the nutlets, and nutlets without stipe (

 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Coppi et al., 2015</xref>). The roots of certain 
 <italic>Arnebia</italic> taxa, which frequently contain a purple-red dye, have been used as a colorant in food and cosmetic preparations. Moreover, anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, wound healing, anti-tumor, cardiotonic, and antineoplastic properties have been reported for 
 <italic>A. benthamii</italic> (Wall. ex G. Don) I.M. Johnst. (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Katoch et al., 2016</xref>), 
 <italic>A. densiflora</italic> Ledeb. (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Garg et al., 2014</xref>). The roots of 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic> L., another genus in the tribe Lithospermeae, also contain a red dye and have been reported to possess various phytomedical activities (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ishida and Sakaguchi, 2007</xref>). The dried roots of 
 <italic>A. euchroma</italic>, 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> Bunge, and 
 <italic>Lithospermum erythrorhizon</italic> Siebold &amp; Zucc. are used as an important herbal remedy, known as Lithospermi Radix or Arnebiae Radix, which is designated as a medicine in the Korean and Chinese Herbal Pharmacopeia (

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine [KIOM], 2020</xref>). Because their morphological, micromorphological, and molecular characteristics have not been compared and described in detail yet, the different species of medicinal borages have been used as a single remedy. Thus, there is a need to conduct comprehensive comparisons of their biological properties. Moreover, revealing the taxonomic identity of 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> Kurz is essential to determine its medicinal properties. The taxonomic status of this species has been controversial. Several authors place 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> as a synonym of 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Kazmi, 1970</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ambrish and Srivastava, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Urgamal et al., 2014</xref>), whereas others consider that the biennial habitat and absence of blackish-purple spots on corolla lobes of 
 <italic>A. tibetana</italic> support its classification as a separate species, independent from 
 <italic>A. guttata</italic> (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>;
