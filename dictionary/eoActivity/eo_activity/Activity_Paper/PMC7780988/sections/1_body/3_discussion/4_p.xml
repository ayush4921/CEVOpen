<p>Moreover, the crude extract ointments of this plant revealed a statistically significant wound healing effect in 
 <italic>S. aurous-</italic>infected mice, in an infected model. A faster wound contraction and epithelialization effects were noticed in mice treated with the 10% w/w extract ointment than the standard drug and 5% w/w extract ointment-treated mice. Likewise, the phlogistic characteristics of the wound that occurred before the initiation of treatment progressively and significantly reduced in all mice treated with the extract ointments in comparison with the negative-control treated groups. The antibacterial properties of triterpenoids isolated from the leaves of
