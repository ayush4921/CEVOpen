<p>The present study investigated that the 80% hydromethanolic extract ointments of leaves of 
 <italic>A. schimperi</italic> possess potential wound healing effects in all three models. The study also suggested that the significant antibacterial and anti-oxidant activities of the extracts are the mechanisms for its wound-healing effects. Thus, the current study strongly supported the traditional claims of the plant for use in the treatment of wounds.
