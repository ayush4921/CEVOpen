<p>The crude extract ointments promoted wound healing effect substantially from the 6th day to the 16th day. Significant wound contraction effect was observed in mice treated with the 10% (w/w) extract ointment starting from the 6th day (p&lt;0.001), as compared to the negative control group. Besides, a significant contraction effect was also noticed in mice treated with the 5% extract (p&lt;0.05) and the standard drug (p&lt;0.01), as compared to the negative control group. Mice treated with the 10% (w/w) and 5% (w/w) extract ointments showed complete healing effect at the 14th and 16th days, respectively (

Furthermore, the study revealed that the 10% (w/w) extract ointment produced maximum wound closure at the 10th (93.52%), 12th (98.99) and 14th (100%) post wounding days whereas the 5% (w/w) extract ointment produced maximum wound closures at the 12th (92.07%), 14th (97.68%) and 16th (99.43%) days notifying the dose-dependent effect of the extract ointments. Conversely, maximum wound closure of the standard drug was found to be 92.09% (on 12th day), 98.35% (14th day) and 100% (16th day) (
