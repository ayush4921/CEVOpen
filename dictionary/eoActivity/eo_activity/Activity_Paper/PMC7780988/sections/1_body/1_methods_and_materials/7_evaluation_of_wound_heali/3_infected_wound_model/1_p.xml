<p>The mice were anesthetized and the wounds were created in a similar fashion to the excision model. The wounds were inoculated with 100 µL of a standard strain of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> suspension containing approximately 5.0 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> Colony-forming units (CFU) and left contaminated over 24 hrs. Then, application of extract ointments commenced on the 2nd day after confirmation of infection. Likewise, wound contraction and epithelialization time were determined. In addition, the presence or absence of the signs and symptoms of established infection such as infiltration, edema, abscess, and exudates were assessed daily throughout the experiment.
