<p>The phytochemical screening of hydromethanolic extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>A. schimperi</italic> was done following the methods described by Trease and Evans, and Debella.
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Briefly, a drop or two of Mayer’s reagent was added to 0.5 mL of the extract, and the formation of white or creamy precipitate indicated the presence of alkaloids. The addition of 2 mL of glacial acetic acid to the extract followed by the mixing of a few drops of ferric chloride solution and 1 mL of conc. sulphuric acid forms a brown ring at the interface which showed the presence of glycosides. The formation of dark green color when a few drops of 2% ferric chloride are added to the extract indicated the presence of phenols. The formation of broth upon vigorous shaking indicates saponins. A reddish-brown layer formation at the junction of two solutions when 2 mL of chloroform and 3 mL of conc. sulphuric acid are added to the extract established terpenoids. Three to five drops of 2% lead acetate solution were added to 2 mL of the extract solution and the formation of orange/yellow color indicated flavonoids. When 2 mL of extract was dissolved in 2 mL of chloroform and followed by the addition of 2 mL concentrated H2SO4 and the formation of red color in the lower chloroform layer showed steroids. Adding 0.1% ferric chloride to the extract and the appearance of brownish-green or blue-black coloration showed the presence of tannins. After adding 10 mL of benzene in the extract and soaked for 10 minutes, further addition of 10 mL of 10% ammonia solution and the formation of pink, violet, or red color upon vigorously shaking for 30 seconds revealed the presence of anthraquinones.
