<p>A 100-ns molecular dynamic simulation was performed to understand the molecular insights involved in binding of 
 <bold>A38</bold> in the active pocket of 5R82. From the obtained trajectory analysis, the RMSD of protein Cα, backbone and heavy atoms was observed in the range of 1.25–2.1 Å and 1.45–2.45 Å, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>). The Cα atoms fluctuated in the range of 1.25–2.1 Å and finally stabilized after 80 ns of simulation with a RMSD value of 1.5 Å. Higher fluctuations (up to 2.1 Å) in RMSD were observed at 39–42 ns and 79 ns. Over the course of simulation, stable hydrophobic interactions were observed with His41 and Met165. The flexibility of residues on ligand binding is analyzed using metrics of root mean square fluctuations (RMSFs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>). High flexibility was observed with RMSF of Ser1 (Cα: 4.67 Å; backbone: 4.77 Å) and Val303 (Cα: 5.95 Å; backbone: 6.02 Å), whereas low RMSF was reported for residues Leu205 (Cα: 0.37 Å; backbone: 0.38 Å) and Thr175 (Cα: 0.43 Å; backbone: 0.46 Å). The stability of ligand with respect to protein was indicated using ligand RMSD where a moderate fluctuation of 1.72 Å was observed (
