<p>Recently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a life-threatening disease, spreads throughout the world. The coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses (De Wit et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Song et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), which contain single positive-stranded RNA. It was affected first in China and quickly spread in most of the countries (Holshue et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Zhou, Hou, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). According to the WHO data, as on third week of May 2020, more than 5 million people in the world are affected by COVID-19; out of these, more than 3.3 lakh people are died. Many of the cases affected by COVID 19 are found to be asymptomatic (Gu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Holshue et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; To et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), it is worthy of consideration, the detail current evidence and understanding of the transmission of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and discuss pathogen inactivation methods on CoVs is very important (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Huang et al.,
