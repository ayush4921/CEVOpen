<p>Main protease and Berberine (an organic heteropentacyclic compound) interaction showed a binding energy of −83.2 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> and a dock score of −103.89. The interaction between ligand with the receptor binding site of Mpro was stabilized by pi-pi T-shaped interaction with His163, Pi-alkyl interaction with Cys145 &amp; His41 and alkyl interaction with His163. The conformation showed van der Waals and H-bond energy of −74.84 and −8.34 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Berberine with spike protein revealed the docking score, binding and interaction energies such as H-bond and van der Waals as −82.48, −69.7, −4.89 and −64.84 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The other stabilizing interactions includes van der Waals (Asn30), amide pi-stacked (Phe59), pi-pi stacked (Thr29) and pi-alkyl (Phe59) interactions. Berberine with ACE2 receptor had a docking score of −95.33, binding energy of −71.5 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup> and H-bond and van der Waals interaction energies of −58.759 and −12.728, respectively. It formed two conventional hydrogen bond interactions with Lys26 and Thr27. Further stabilization occurred with pi-cation (Glu22), pi-anion (Glu22), pi-sulfur (Val93) and alkyl (Val93) interactions.
