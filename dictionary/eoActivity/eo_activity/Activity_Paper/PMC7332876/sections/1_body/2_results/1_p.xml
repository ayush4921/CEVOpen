<p>Crystal structures of main protease, spike protein and human entry receptor (ACE2) were used to define the molecular interactions (Meng et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) with the scrutinized bioactives. The top ten scoring bioactive ligands are represented in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> with binding energy, dock score, van der Waals and H-bond energy. Interestingly, among the bioactives screened, the compounds Orientin, Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid and Magnoflorine were found to interact with all the drug targets of SARS-CoV-2 including the human entry receptor ACE2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Although the aforesaid compounds had interaction with all the drug targets of SARS-CoV-2, interaction with active site residues of main protease was found to be much stronger than the other two drug targets (spike protein and ACE2) used in the study (Hasan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The highest binding affinity between the ligands-receptor complex was confirmed through binding energy and other possible non-covalent interactions. Based on the scoring values it is confirmed that these compounds can significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication by binding strongly with the main protease.
