<p>The present study explored the important bioactive constituents of Siddha medicine, especially NKC through molecular docking and simulation analysis for the prevention and cure of COVID19 infection. The compounds Cucurbitacin E, Orientin, Bis-andrographolide, Cucurbitacin B, Isocucurbitacin B, Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid, Piperine and Magnoflorine were identified as potential lead molecules that have been shown to possess the ability to interact with the components that block the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the immune-enhancing properties of these compounds without any adverse side effects could provide natural immune power to resist COVID-19 infections. However, preclinical studies would provide deep insight into mechanism of actions and also drugability of these bioactives for the treatment of COVID19 infection.</p>
