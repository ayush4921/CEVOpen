 </xref> consists of three features; a zinc‐binding group (ZBG) coordinating the catalytic zinc ion, a linker placed in the hydrophobic substrate‐binding tunnel and the capping group (cap) that interacts with the rim of the pocket. An attempt to search for novel and selective HDAC inhibitors has been to search for a new ZBG that can make a significant contribution to the binding affinity. Amongst the reported HDAC inhibitors from nature are the macrocyclics; romidepsin and largazole, having a thiol ZBG in their activated forms.
