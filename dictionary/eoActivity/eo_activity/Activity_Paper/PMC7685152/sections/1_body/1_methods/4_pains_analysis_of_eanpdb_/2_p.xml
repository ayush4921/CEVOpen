<p>The presence of certain structural features referred to as pan‐assay interference compounds (PAINS) have been established to certain behaviours (such as metal chelation, redox cycling and protein reactivity). that could interfere in assay readouts all the way from target to cell without any common mechanism involved. The compounds of EANPDB were screened to estimate the proportion of molecules that are predicted to be PAINS. PAINS analysis was performed using PAINS1, PAINS2, and PAINS3 filters, as implemented in Schrödinger's Canvas program.
