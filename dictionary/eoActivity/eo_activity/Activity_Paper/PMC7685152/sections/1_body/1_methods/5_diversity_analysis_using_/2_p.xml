<p>Searching for novel compounds from a different chemical space with significant biological importance is currently vital in the field of drug discovery. This could be one approach towards facing the challenges of drug resistance. It is believed that such molecules could act

 </xref> In order to evaluate in the chemical space occupancy of the different datasets, a PCA using the MOE package was performed.

 </xref> Several selected descriptors were computed and transformed linearly using PCA to obtain a new and smaller uncorrelated and normalized table of descriptors (mean=0 and variance=1).

 </xref> The descriptors for this purpose included the number of 
 <italic>donor/accptHB</italic>, number of heavy atoms present, the number rotatable bonds, calculated molecular weight, predicted molar refractivity, the predicted total polar surface area and the computed octanol/water partition coefficient. Percentage variation based on counts as well as 2‐ and 3‐dimensional plots of PCA1, PCA2 and PCA3 (the best three principal components) were used to depict the diversity of molecules.
