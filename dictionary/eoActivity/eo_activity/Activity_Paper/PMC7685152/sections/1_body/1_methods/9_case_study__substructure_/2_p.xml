<p>Post‐translational modification of histone proteins by enzymes such as histone deacetylases (HDACs, which catalyse the deacetylation of lysine residues on histone tails) participate in several physiological processes and are considered potential drug targets for various diseases.

 </xref> Human HDACs are represented in eighteen isoforms which are grouped as zinc‐dependent (Classes I, II and IV) or NAD
 <sup>+</sup>‐dependent (Class III).

 </xref> The zinc‐dependent HDACs comprise of the following isoforms; class I (HDAC1‐3, HDAC8), class II (IIa: HDAC4‐5, HDAC7, HDAC9 and IIb: HDAC6, HDAC10) and class IV (HDAC11). Resolved crystal structures show that the catalytic domain is conserved. Interest in targeting these HDAC isoforms have led to the market approval of several HDAC inhibitors and more are intensively being developed.[
