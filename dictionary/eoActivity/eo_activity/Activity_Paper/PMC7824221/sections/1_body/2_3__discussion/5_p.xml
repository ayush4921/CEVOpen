 <italic>Acinetobacter radiresistens</italic> was previously isolated as an endophytic strain from 
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic> were identified as culturable endophytic bacterial strains isolated from soybean plants [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. On the basis of our online survey, this is the first report for isolation and identification of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium fabrum</italic> from medicinal plant as endophytic strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding the isolation and identification of the supposed bacterial endophytes associated with healthy leaves of 
 <italic>P. incisa,</italic> as well as characterization of these endophytes for used in the future for plant growth promotion.
