<p>Microorganisms, particularly endophytic bacteria isolated from different plants, have the ability to phosphate solubilize [

 <xref rid="B66-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] showed that 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic>, two endophytic bacteria obtained from strawberries, exhibit high phosphate solubilization and then enhance plant growth. Potassium (K) is another important element for metabolic responses because it acts as an activator for different enzymes [
