<p>Osmoprotectants are compounds that do not carry any charge at physiological pH, have high solubility, and are non-toxic in large concentrations. In addition to the osmoprotectants, many compatible solutes can be consumed as a nitrogen and carbon source for bacteria [

The indirect mechanism is through the synthesis of auxin, which enhances the root elongation under the influence of salinity to provide nutrients to the plant. Thus, indole-producing bacteria participate in the plantâ€™s adaptation to salt as was observed in date palm trees [
