<p>Bacterial endophytes can influence plant growth through the availability of nutrients, which has positive impacts on plant growth traits [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In this study, two endophytic bacterial strains and their consortium showed significant improvement in the plant heights and the fresh and dry weight of shoot and roots compared to un-inoculated plants (control). Endophytic microbes that produce phytohormones, e.g., IAA, demonstrated enhanced shoot and root lengths, as well as improved the number of root tips that improved the nutrient uptake, hence improving the plant growth traits [
