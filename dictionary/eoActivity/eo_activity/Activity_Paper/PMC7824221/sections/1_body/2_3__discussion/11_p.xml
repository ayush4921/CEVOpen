<p>In this study, the highest IAA concentration values of 117.3 and 108.3 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> were assigned for bacterial endophytes of 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10, respectively, after 10 days of incubation in the presence of 5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> tryptophan, which produced positive indicators for these endophytes to enhance root development and promote plant growth. As compared with other studies, the obtained endophytic bacterial strains recorded highest IAA production. Hassan [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> isolated from shoot system of 
 <italic>Teucrium polium</italic> L. collected from the same area have the ability to produce IAA with highest values ranging between 4.1.0 and 23.4 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> in the presence of 5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> tryptophan. The obtained data in this study were compatible with the result of AlKahtani et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], who showed that the highest IAA production using bacterial endophytes associated with the two medicinal plants, 
 <italic>Fagonia mollis</italic> and 
 <italic>Achillea fragrantissima</italic>, was attained in the presence of 5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> tryptophan after 10 days of incubation.
