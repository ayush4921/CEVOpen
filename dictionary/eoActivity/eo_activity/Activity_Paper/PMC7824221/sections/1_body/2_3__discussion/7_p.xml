<p>All bacterial isolates had the efficacy to grow in up to 200 mM salt stress, except for 
 <italic>Acinetobacter radiresistens</italic> and 
 <italic>Burkholderia</italic>
 <italic>cepacia,</italic> which could be grown up to 150 mM NaCl. The phenomenon of salt stress can help plants that are sensitive to saltiness if these bacterial endophytes are used as bio-inoculants. The potentiality of these endophytic bacteria to ameliorate salt stress can be attributed to several strategies including osmoprotectant accumulation in their cytoplasm.
