<p>The root growth improvements are considered the main phenotypic characteristics for IAA production [

 <italic>Sphingomonas</italic> sp. obtained from 
 <italic>Tephrosia apollinea</italic> produced gibberellins and IAA, and tomato plants inoculated with this endophyte showed enhanced growth traits (dry weights of root and shoots, the chlorophyll content, and shoot lengths) [
