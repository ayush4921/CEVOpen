<p>The production of different hydrolytic enzymes by endophytic microbes indirectly promotes plant growth and protects from phytopathogens [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In this study, all tested bacterial endophytes obtained from 
 <italic>P. incisa</italic> produced xylanase, cellulase, and catalase, while four bacterial isolates (57% of tested strains) produced amylase, six bacterial strains (85.7% of tested strains) were found to be potent protease producers, and five bacterial isolates (71% of tested strains) showed chitinase activity.
