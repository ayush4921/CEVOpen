<p>Therefore, the inoculation of maize roots with endophytic bacterial isolates enhanced plant growth and improved biomass production compared to uninoculated plants. This study provides evidence of the potentiality of these endophytes to improve plant production and plant health, leading to improved soil quality and fertility in agricultural sectors. Moreover, these endophytic bacteria inoculated into 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> plants under greenhouse experiments and improved plant growth compared to un-inoculated plants.
