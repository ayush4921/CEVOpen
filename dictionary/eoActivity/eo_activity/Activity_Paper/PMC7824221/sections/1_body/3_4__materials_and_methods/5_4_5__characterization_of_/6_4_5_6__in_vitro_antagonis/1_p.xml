<p>The antagonistic activity of identified bacterial endophytes was evaluated against widely prevailing fungal plant pathogens by dual-culture in vitro assay according to [
 <xref rid="B79-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Three fungal plant pathogens represented as 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic> were obtained from the Plant Pathology Department, Faculty of Agriculture, Zagazig University. Briefly, each endophytic bacterial isolate was spotted at 3 equidistant points along the perimeter of the potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate (3 plates per isolate). After 24 h of incubation at 28 °C in the dark, a 5 mm plug from the leading edge of a 7-day-old culture of each plant pathogenic fungus on PDA was placed in the center of the plate. Plates without bacteria were used as the control. Plates were incubated at 28 °C for 5 days, after which the relative growth inhibition percent was calculated according to the following equation:
