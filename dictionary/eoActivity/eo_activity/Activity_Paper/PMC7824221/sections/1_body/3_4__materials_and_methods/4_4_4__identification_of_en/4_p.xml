<p>Sequences were then compared with 16S rRNA sequences in the GenBank database using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). The sequences retrieved from this study were deposited in GeneBank under accession numbers from MT994669 to MT994675. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalX 1.8 software package (

The confidence level of each branch (1000 repeats) was tested by bootstrap analysis.
