<p>The two most potent bacterial isolates PI-8 and PI-10 were selected for their better activities in order to test the effect of their inoculation on root growth performance of maize plants. 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L seeds were surface sterilized by soaking in 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min and 70% ethanol for 1 min, and were then washed by sterile distilled water 5 times. Bacterial pure cultures of PI-8 and PI-10 were grown individually in nutrient broth at 35 ± 2 °C on a shaker at 180 rpm. Bacterial cultures were centrifuged, and cells were suspended in sterilized saline solution to a final concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (Cell Forming Unit mL

Pre-germinated and surface-disinfected seeds were incubated with bacterial suspensions at room temperature for 6 h; the broth without microbial inoculation was used to treat control seeds. Control and treated seeds were placed in sterilized glass Petri dishes (ø = 15 cm) with wet sterilized filter papers and incubated at room temperature for 8 days in the dark to measure the root length and biomass. A total of 10 mL of sterilized distilled water was added to each plate as needed. The experimental treatments were conducted in 5 replications, in which there were 6 seeds per each replicated unit. Seed germination was checked every 24 h for 8 days, and root length, as well as fresh and dry weights, were measured at the end of the experiment.
