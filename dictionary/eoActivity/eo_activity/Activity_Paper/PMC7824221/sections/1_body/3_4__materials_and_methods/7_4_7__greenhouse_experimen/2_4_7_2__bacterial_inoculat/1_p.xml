<p>The two most potent endophytic bacterial isolates were inoculated in nutrient broth media (contain g L
 <sup>−1</sup>: peptone, 5.0; beef extract, 3.0; NaCl, 5.0) for 24 h at 35 ± 2 °C and shaking condition 150 rpm. Seeds of 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L. plant (Cultivar Giza 9) were surface-sterilized as follows. Seeds were soaked in sodium hypochlorite (2.5%) for 3 min and washed thrice with sterilized distilled water. The sterilized seeds were left to pre-germinate, and after that, 4 groups of similar germination seeds were separated and 3 of them were soaked in 100 mL of bacterial inoculated culture (adjusted the optical density (O.D.) at 1.0) individually and in a consortium, while the fourth group was soaked in un-inoculated culture (control). All soaked seeds were incubated at 35 ± 2 °C for 4 h on shaking condition (150 rpm). After incubation periods, the soaked seeds were sown in plastic pots filled with 1000× 
 <italic>g</italic> of sand soil. Each plastic pot received 3 germinated seeds, and the plant was grown in a greenhouse at 25–30 °C and irrigated with tap water as required without adding any fertilizers.
