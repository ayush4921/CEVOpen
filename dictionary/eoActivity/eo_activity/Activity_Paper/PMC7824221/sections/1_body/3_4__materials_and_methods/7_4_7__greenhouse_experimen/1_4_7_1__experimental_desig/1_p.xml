<p>A completely randomized pot experiment with 5 replicates for each treatment was performed to investigate the efficacy of the 2 most potent endophytic bacterial isolates (
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8 and 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10) individually or in a consortium on the growth performance of 
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L. as a model plant. The soil used in the greenhouse experiment was classified as sandy soil containing sand, silt, and clay of 96.25%, 1.50%, and 1.25%, respectively. The chemical characters of soil used, including P, K, Na, Ca, and Cl, were present with values 23.5, 15.75, 184.45, 25.50, and 130.25 mg Kg
