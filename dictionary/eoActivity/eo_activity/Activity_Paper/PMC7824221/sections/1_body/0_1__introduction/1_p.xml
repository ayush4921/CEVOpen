<p>Agricultural activities in the 20th century were largely accomplished using agricultural equipment, high-yielding crop varieties, intensive tillage, irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, and other manufactured inputs [

 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00076" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To reduce these negative impacts due to conventional farming techniques, microbial inoculations such as biofertilizers are gaining more attention. A symbiotic linkage is formed between microorganisms and plants, which is useful for both partners. The coexistence of the microbe in the plant affects the health and growth performance of the plant, which effectively improves the agricultural properties, such as the root length and the fresh and dry weight of the shoot and root, and improves the yield productions, quality of the soils, and the nutrient cycling [
