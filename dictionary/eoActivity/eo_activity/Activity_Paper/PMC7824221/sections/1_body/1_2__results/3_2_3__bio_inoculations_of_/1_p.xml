<p>The efficacy of endophytic bacteria as bio-inoculants to plants was assessed using two representative bacterial strains, PI-8 and PI-10, which were selected according to the previous PGP activities. Analysis of variance indicated that bacterial inoculation significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) increased the root length compared to the controls (not inoculated seeds). Inoculation with PI-8 resulted in longer maize roots compared to PI-10 inoculation. Regarding the biomass weight of inoculated maize roots, multi-comparison analyses showed the bacterial inoculation significantly improved the fresh as well as the dry weight of treated plants compared to the control (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001). However, both inoculants resulted in the promotion of fresh weight with similar values. Maize roots inoculated with PI-8 had higher recorded dry weights compared with those inoculated with PI-10 (
