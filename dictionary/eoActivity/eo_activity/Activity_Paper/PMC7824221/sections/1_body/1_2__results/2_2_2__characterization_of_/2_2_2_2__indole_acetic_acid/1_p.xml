<p>Seven bacterial endophytes, namely, PI-1, PI-3, PI-5, PI-8, PI-10, PI-12, and PI-15, were quantitatively screened to produce IAA after 14 days in the growth medium with the absence and presence of 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> tryptophan as a precursor for IAA. The results, as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00076-f002">Figure 2</xref>, showed that all tested bacterial endophytes possessed the efficacy of synthesis of IAA with or without tryptophan. In the absence of tryptophan, the productivity of IAA significantly differed between the different bacterial endophytes and ranged from 12 ± 0.7 to 23 ± 2 μg mL
