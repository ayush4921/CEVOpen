<p>The identified endophytic strains exhibited varied salt tolerance and their growth was reduced with increasing NaCl concentration in growth media. As seen in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00076-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, γ-negative bacteria, 
 <italic>A. radioresistant</italic> PI-3, and 
 <italic>B. cepacia</italic> PI-15 were more sensitive to NaCl and showed weak growth at 150 mM NaCl. By increasing the salt concentration, their growth was inhibited. α-Proteobacteria (
 <italic>A. fabrum)</italic> and firmicutes species (
 <italic>B. brevis, B. cereus, B. subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. barengoltzii)</italic> exhibited high salt tolerance up to 200 mM, and their growth was inhibited by increasing the NaCl concentration above this level.
