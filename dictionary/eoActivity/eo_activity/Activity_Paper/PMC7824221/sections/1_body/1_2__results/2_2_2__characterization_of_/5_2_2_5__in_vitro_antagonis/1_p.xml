<p>The data represented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00076-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> show the in vitro antagonistic activities of isolated bacterial endophytes against three phytopathogenic fungi, represented by 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum, Alternaria alternata,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pythium ultimum.</italic> Data analysis showed that the average inhibition percentages of fungal growth were 35.8%, 35.7%, and 18.9% for 
 <italic>F. oxysporum, A. alternata,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. ultimum,</italic> respectively. The highest inhibition percentages were accomplished due to treatment with endophytic bacterial strains of 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10 and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00076-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The bacterial isolate 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> PI-10 had a high capacity to inhibit fungal growth with percentages of 52.6%, 50.07%, and 24.4% for 
 <italic>F. oxysporum, A. alternata,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. ultimum,</italic> respectively, as compared with those recorded by 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> PI-8 (48.9%, 46%, and 20%, respectively). 
 <italic>Acinetobacter radioresistant</italic> PI-3 exhibited the lowest activity against 
 <italic>A. alternata,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. ultimum,</italic> with recorded inhibition percentages of 22.5% and 15.9%, respectively. The bacterial isolate 
 <italic>Agrobacterium fabrum</italic> PI-1 exhibited the lowest activity against the phytopathogen 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>, with an inhibition percent of 22.3%.
