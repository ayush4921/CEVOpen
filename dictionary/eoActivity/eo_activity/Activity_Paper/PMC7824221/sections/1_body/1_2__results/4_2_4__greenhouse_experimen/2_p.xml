<p>Data analysis showed that maize plant inoculated with the consortium of two endophytic bacterial strains (PI-8 and PI-10) produced shoot and root fresh weights (718 ± 3.5 and 1918 ± 5.5 mg, respectively) that significantly increased compared with the controls and with plants inoculated with individual strains. The dry weight of the shoots and roots of maize plants inoculated with the bacterial consortium were higher than those recorded for either the control or individual strain (
