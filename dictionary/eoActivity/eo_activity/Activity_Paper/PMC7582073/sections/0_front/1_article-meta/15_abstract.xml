  <p> Acute toxicity test was performed on Swiss albino mice at a single oral dose of 1-10 g/kg for 14 consecutive days. General behavioral adverse effects, mortality, and latency of mortality were determined. In the subacute study, the 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel extract was administered orally at doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg daily for 30 days to Wistar rats. Body weight and selected biochemical and hematological parameters were determined at the end of the experiment. Sections of livers and kidneys were removed for histological studies.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p> Acute toxicity study showed that the oral LD
   <sub>50</sub> value of 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel extract was 5000 mg/kg. The subacute toxicity study of 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel extract at doses 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg did not produce any observable symptoms of toxicity and no significant variation in body weight, organ weights, food, and water consumption or mortality in all treated rats. However, the administration of the 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel extract to rats at 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg showed a significant decrease in platelets. Moreover, only at the highest dose (2000 mg/kg), the extract caused a significant increase in red blood cells and hemoglobin. Our results showed that subacute treatments with 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel extract at doses of 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase and triglycerides. Histological studies showed that the subacute treatments of rats with 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel extracts, at the doses 1000 and 2000 mg/kg, induced some histopathological changes in the livers but a slight changing in kidneys.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p> Our results indicated low acute toxicity of the aqueous extract of 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel. Furthermore, daily oral administration of 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel extract caused some damages to the livers of rats treated with high doses, expressed by an increase in some enzyme activities such as ALP. Regarding the renal function, we did not find remarkable toxicity in the subacute treatment with 
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> Pomel extracts at doses 1000 and 2000 mg/kg. However, further toxicity assessments should be done to ascertain the safety or the toxicity of this valuable plant species “
   <italic>Haloxylon scoparium</italic> pomel” in subchronic treatments.
