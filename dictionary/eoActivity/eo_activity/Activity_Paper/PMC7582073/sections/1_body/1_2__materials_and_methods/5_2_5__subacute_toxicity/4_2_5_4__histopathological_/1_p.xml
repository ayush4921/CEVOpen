<p>Macroscopic examination of vital organs was carried out soon after sacrifice. Liver and kidneys were surgically removed, weighed (absolute organ weight) on an analytical balance, and immediately forwarded to the histopathological processing. The relative organ weight (ROW) of each animal was then calculated as follows: relative organ weight (%) = (organ weight/body weight) × 100 [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The fragments of livers and kidneys were fixed in a 10% buffered formalin solution, included in paraffin wax, cut into 3-4 
 <italic>μ</italic>m sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The histological sections were then visualized under optical microscopy (Optika Microscopes, Italy) and captured by an Infinity 1 camera microscope with ×40 magnification.
