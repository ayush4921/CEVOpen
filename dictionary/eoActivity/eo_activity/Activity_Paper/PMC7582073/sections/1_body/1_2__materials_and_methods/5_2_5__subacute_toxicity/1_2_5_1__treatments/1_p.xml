<p>For the study of subacute toxicity, four experimental groups were established (6 animals/group; 3 males and 3 females), as follows: control group (treated orally with distilled water for a period of 30 days) and test groups (treated by gavage for 30 days with different doses of the aqueous extract: 500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg body weight). The doses for the subacute toxicity test were established taking into account the LD
 <sub>50</sub> and the dose calculation described in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guideline 407 [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Throughout the 30-day treatments, the animals were observed daily for general health and clinical signs of toxicity, whereas body weight changes were recorded on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 of the experiment. At the end of the study period, all animals were fasted overnight before blood sampling. Blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta under anesthesia with ether in two types of tubes: one with EDTA and the other without additives. The anticoagulated blood (tube with EDTA) was analyzed immediately for hematological parameters. The second tube was centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min to obtain the serum for biochemical analysis. Additionally, liver and kidneys were dissected and weighed, and wet sections from these organs were examined histopathologically.
