 <italic>(1) Effect of Subacute Treatment of Rats with HS Extract on AST, ALT, and ALP</italic>. The results of the clinical biochemistry parameters assessed in this work, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), are summarised in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It can be seen that there was a significant increase in ALP observed in groups treated with doses of 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg compared to the control group (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). However, the daily oral administration of HS extract to the rats of all groups provoked a significant decrease in the plasma levels of ALT (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and AST (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared with the rats of the control group.
