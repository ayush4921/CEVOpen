<p>The analysis of hematological parameters, which included WBC, LYM, GRA, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, and MPV in rats treated with HS extract (500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg) did not differ significantly from those of control rats (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). However, the administration of the HS water extract to rats at 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg resulted in a statistically significant decrease in platelets (PLT) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). At the highest dose (2000 mg/kg), the HS extract caused a significant increase in RBC and HGB (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
