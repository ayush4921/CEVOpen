<p>Histology of the liver sections of control rats showed normal hepatocellular architecture along with well-preserved hepatic cells, and visible central veins and no histologic abnormalities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(a)</xref>). Rats treated subacutely with 500 mg/kg of HS extract did not cause any adverse effect on the histoarchitecture of hepatocytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(b)</xref>). By contrast, the sections of livers taken from HS-treated group (1000 mg/kg) showed some histological changes, such as moderate dilation of sinusoids, mild disorganization of hepatic cords, steatosis, and the hepatocytes while some binucleated cells (

Besides, subacute administration of HS extract at the highest dose (2 mg/kg) for 30 days caused a significant alteration in the histoarchitecture of treated rats, showing marked congested dilated central vein, mild disorganization of hepatic cords, and binucleated hepatocytes (
