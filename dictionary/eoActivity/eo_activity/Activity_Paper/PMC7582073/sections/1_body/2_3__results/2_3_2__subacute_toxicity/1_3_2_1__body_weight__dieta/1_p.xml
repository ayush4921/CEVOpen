<p>The subacute toxicity of HS extract at all the doses used did not produce any obvious symptoms of toxicity or mortality in all the treated rats. Besides, no significant changes occurred in food and water consumption in rats treated subacutely with repeated oral doses of the aqueous extract (500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg). Both the control and treated rats appeared healthy at the end and throughout the 30-day period of the study. According to data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> during the whole experiment period, no significant changes occurred in the weight of treated groups with a dose up to the maximum of 2000 mg/kg compared to the control group (
