<p>Several studies on the constituents of HS showed that this plant is mainly formed of alkaloids (isoquinoline types), glycosides, esters, fatty acids, and other compounds [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Two alkaloids (N-methylisosalsoline and carnegine) had been previously described from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Hammada articulata</italic> ssp. scoparia [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A thorough study of this plant material has now led to the isolation of eight minor alkaloids and one flavonoid. The alkaloids include four isoquinolines (isosalsoline, salsolidine, dehydrosalsolidine, and isosalsolidine), one isoquinolone (N-methylcorydaldine), tryptamine, N-omega-methyltryptamine, and one beta-carboline (tetrahydroharman). However, the component(s) of the HS extract which caused toxicity, both in the acute and subacute dose studies, are not known. The acute and subacute toxicities of HS could be explained by the presence in the extract of the alkaloid group. The present study was the first one of its kind that evaluated the short-term subacute toxicity of Haloxylon scoparium aqueous extract; however, it had some limitations. We aimed to assess the possible toxicity effects of HS on major vital organs, such as kidneys and liver, that have more important roles in the detoxification of exogenous chemical substances than other organs; however, in the current study, due to lack of resources, the toxicity of HS was not evaluated in other organs such as nervous, reproductive, and immune systems. Besides, the current study had a shorter duration than typical prechronic toxicity studies recommended by regulatory guidelines. Therefore, it should be taken into account that longer exposure periods (90 days for example) may also yield different results.
