<p>According to the biochemical results, it was reasonable to speculate that the high concentrations of HS extracts may possess toxicity to vital organs in rats. Photomicrographs of the sections of the liver and kidneys of rats treated orally with doses 1000 and 2000 mg/kg of the HS extract for 30 days showed some histological changes, such as moderate dilation of sinusoids, mild disorganization of hepatic cords, binucleated hepatocytes in the liver, slight reduction of glomerulus cells, a loss of tubular cellular components, an expansion of the Bowman space, and distortions in the epithelial membrane of the Bowman capsule in the kidney. Also, the steatosis hepatic was observed only in the treated group with 1000 mg/kg (also proved by biochemical analysis).</p>
