<p>The acute toxicity study is utilized to check the harmful effects of an agent to the organism given as a single or short-term exposure [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Mainly, the study evaluates the mortality, changes in behavior, body weight, and other spontaneous changes in the overall well-being of the mice. In the present study, the acute toxicity evaluation showed that the oral LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of HS extract was 5000 mg/kg. For Hodge and Sterner (2005), with the help of LD
 <sub>50</sub> determination, six classes of toxicity are possible: “Class 1=extreme toxicity, LD
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 1 mg/kg; Class 2=high toxicity, LD
 <sub>50</sub> at 1–50 mg/kg; Class 3=moderate toxicity, LD
 <sub>50</sub> at 50–500 mg/kg; Class 4=low or slight toxicity, LD
 <sub>50</sub> at 500–5000 mg/ kg; Class 5=practically nontoxic, LD
 <sub>50</sub> at 5000-15,000 mg/kg and Class 6=relatively harmless with LD
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 15,000 mg/kg” (Berezovskaya, 2003). According to this classification and taking account of the LD
 <sub>50</sub>, we can note that HS with values of LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 5000 mg/kg could be graded in the slight toxic category.
