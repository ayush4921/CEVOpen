<p>Previous studies have shown that hematological parameters were very sensitive and could be used as reliable indicators for determining the intrusion of toxic substances [

Besides, the significant decline of platelet count in rats at a dose of 500 and 1000 mg/kg of HS as compared to normal control group suggested that HS can induce thrombocytopenia, rather produce perturbations in the coagulation cascade. These perturbations are frequently associated with acute liver toxicity and chronic liver disease [
