<p id="Par51">Although Cobo, Eckmann [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] suggest that their murine model of vaginal trichomonad infections is a valuable approach for investigating in vivo pathogenesis and treatment of trichomoniasis, to our knowledge, the above-mentioned study of emodin is the only one that has used mice to determine the efficacy of a natural product. A murine model was also used by Hopper, Yun [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>] who reported that the oral administration of the synthetic drug auranofin to mice for 4â€‰days cleared 
 <italic>T. foetus</italic> infection without any apparent side effects. Some of the described highly active natural plant extracts and pure compounds merit further evaluation in mice as a possible intermediate test that might help design and guide clinical evaluations in humans.
