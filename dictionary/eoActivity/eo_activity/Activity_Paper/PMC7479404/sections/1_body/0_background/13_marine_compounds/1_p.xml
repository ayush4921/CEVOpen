<p id="Par40">There have been a few limited studies on effects of marine extracts and isolated compounds on 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. A screen by Moo-Puc, Robledo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] of 25 tropical seaweeds from the Yucatan coast of Mexico showed that 44% of the extracts had high to moderate activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>, with 
 <italic>Lobophora variegata</italic> and 
 <italic>Udotea conglutinata</italic> species showing the maximal activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.39 and 1.66 μg/mL, respectively. Cantillo-Ciau, Moo-Puc [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>] reported that an extract from the alga 
 <italic>Lobophora variegata</italic> from the Yucatan coast of Mexico showed high activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.2 μg/mL. Several isolated and chemically characterized compounds were less active with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 8.0 μg/mL. Scopel, dos Santos [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] found that two marine-associated fungal species (
 <italic>Hypocrea lixii</italic> FO2 and 
 <italic>Penicillium citrinum</italic> F40) isolated from 39 different marine organisms, mainly sponges, from the South Brazilian coast showed up to 100% growth-inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> fresh, clinical, and a metronidazole-resistant isolates at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. The negative results of a hemolytic assay show that both samples were compatible with red blood cells, suggesting that these samples are potential candidates against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. The cited studies suggest that the sea algae, seaweed, fungal and other species could serve as a source of highly active anti-trichomonad formulations.
