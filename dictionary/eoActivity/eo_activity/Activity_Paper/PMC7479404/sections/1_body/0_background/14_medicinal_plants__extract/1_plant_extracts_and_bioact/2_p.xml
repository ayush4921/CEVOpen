<p id="Par42">Muelas-Serrano, Nogal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] reported that, of a large number evaluated American plant extracts, nine were active against 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and 
 <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>, with one showing 100% inhibition of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> after exposure for 24 h. A screen by Calzada, Yépez-Mulia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>] of 22 Mexican medicinal plants for anti-trichomonal activity against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> indicated that extracts from 
 <italic>Garica papaya</italic> and 
 <italic>Cocos nucifera</italic> had the best activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.6 and 5.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. All extracts, however, were less active than metronidazole, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.037 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Five of the evaluated plants are used to treat urogenital tract disorders in Mexican traditional medicine.
