<p id="Par73">We do not know if an anti-trichomonad compound that is effective in cell assays might also be effective in farm and domestic animals and in humans. The present study indicates that most of the anti-trichomonad compounds listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> have not been evaluated for their efficacy in vivo. A major objective of the present review is to motivate clinicians and veterinarians to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the most active compounds listed in the table against trichomonad strains that infect humans and animals and described extracts containing multiple bioactive compounds. Such studies should include determination of the ratio the effective to toxic dose levels. The higher the ratio, the safer the compound.
