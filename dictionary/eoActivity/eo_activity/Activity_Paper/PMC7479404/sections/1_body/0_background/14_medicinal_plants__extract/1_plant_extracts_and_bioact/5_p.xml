<p id="Par45">Menezes, Rigo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] evaluated the mechanism of the anti-trichomonad effect of phloroglucinol compounds isolated from a Brazilian 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> plant species. The compound isoaustrobrasilol B (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) significantly inhibited nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NDPDase) and ecto-5’nucleotidase activities as well as immune changes attributed to extracellular nucleotide accumulation, suggesting that the death of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> cells and modulation of electonucleotidases induced by the phloroglucinol derivative may increase the susceptibility of the parasite to host immune cells (neutrophils), thus enhancing cell death. A review of the literature of 26 plant types by Ziaei Hezarjaribi, Nadeali [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] indicates that extracts of medicinal herbs such as 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>, 
 <italic>Zataria multiflora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> are remarkably effective against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>, with the most effective 
 <italic>Artemisia aucheri</italic> extract active at a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL.
