 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>] evaluated the anti-trichomonad activity of lycorine and six aliphatic and aromatic esters at concentrations of 125 μM and 250 μM. About 60% of the parasites remained viable after exposure for 24 h to both concentrations of lycorine. By contrast, with the lauroyl ester, the observed reduction was to 16 and 3% residual activity at the two concentrations, respectively, suggesting that the lipophilicity of the fatty acid ester associated with the lauroyl side chain might facilitate its penetration through the amitochondriated layer of the parasite, resulting in enhanced cytotoxicity. The authors also suggest the data imply that: (a) the free (unprotected) OH groups at the C-1 and C-2 position of the lycorine molecule are not involved in the antiparasitic activity; and (b) esterification of lycorine with other lipophilic fatty acids at one or both OH groups has the potential to improve the inhibition of

 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> activity, lycorine modulates ectonucleotidases and stimulates neutrophils to secrete reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that this mechanism of action exerted by the alkaloid could enhance the susceptibility of 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> to host immune cells, contributing to protozoan clearance [
