<p id="Par72">The cited studies indicate the complexity of the anti-trichomonad mechanisms, where structurally different natural and synthetic compounds seem to act on metabolic pathways of the protozoa that are similar to or different from those observed with metronidazole. Which mechanistic inactivation pathway of anti-trichomonad compounds will be effective against both susceptible and metronidazole-resistant protozoa strains in vivo?</p>
