<p id="Par35">Farias, Kato [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found that essential oils from different 
 <italic>Nectandra</italic> plant species grown in Brazil contained a variety of compounds, including the phenylpropanoid derivative (+)-α-bisabolol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The oil isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Nectandra megapotamica</italic> contained 93.7% (+)-α-bisabolol. This compound inhibited biofilm formation in methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> bacteria and was also active against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 98.7 μg/mL. It also had cytotoxic and hemolytic effects in Vero cells and human erythrocytes. Oliveira, Freitas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] found that (+)-α-bisabolol acted synergistically with the antibiotic drug gentamicin against 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. These results suggest the potential value of 
 <italic>Nectandra</italic> oils and their bioactive compounds in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by clinical and foodborne pathogenic bacteria and by 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>, as well its potential to protect foods against contamination by both microbial and protozoal pathogens.
