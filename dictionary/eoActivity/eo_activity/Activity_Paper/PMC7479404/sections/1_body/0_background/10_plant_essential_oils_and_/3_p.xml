<p id="Par36">The fact that essential oils and oil compounds inactivated both pathogenic bacteria and 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> suggest that oils/oil compounds that have been shown to inactivate foodborne microorganisms in vitro and in contaminated food might also be effective against 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic>. For example, we reported that 27 of the evaluated 96 essential oils and 12 of the 23 essential oil compounds inactivated multiple species of foodborne pathogenic bacteria (
 <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>) in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Essential oils and oil compounds also inactivated pathogenic bacteria in apple juice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], ground pork [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], and on leafy greens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], suggesting that some of the commercially available, food-compatible essential oils/oil compounds might also inhibit the growth of pathogenic protozoa. Will safe, food-compatible oils/oil compounds (e.g. allspice, cinnamon, clove, lemongrass, oregano, and thyme essential oils) and their bioactive compounds (e.g. carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, citral, eugenol, geraniol, thymol) added to liquid and solid foods protect consumers against both microbial infections and trichomoniasis?
