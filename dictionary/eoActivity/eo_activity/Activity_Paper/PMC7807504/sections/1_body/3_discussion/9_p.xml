<p id="Par43">Although many medicinal herbs have transient effects on the male reproductive system, there is a potential risk of impaired spermatogenesis when PADE is used in doses exceeding the recommended therapeutic doses. This study suggests that PADE treatment of reproductive age men should be avoided or recommended with caution. The doses prescribed to these patients should not exceed the therapeutic dose. Treating physicians should consider whether the expected benefits of PADE treatment to the male parent exceed possible risks to male fertility and reproductive health as well as potential effects on fetal and offspring development.</p>
