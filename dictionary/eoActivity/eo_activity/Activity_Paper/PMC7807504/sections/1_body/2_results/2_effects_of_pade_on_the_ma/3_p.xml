 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b demonstrates the structure of testicular tubules of control male rats at various spermatogenic epithelium cycle stages. Histological evaluation of testes of treated and control rats revealed that Leydig cells in the testes of control rats are lighter in color with a larger, more rounded or oval in shape nuclei containing clumps of euchromatin and heterochromatin evenly distributed in the nucleus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d shows the germinal epithelium’s disorganization and reduced tubules with mature sperm in male rats treated with 125 mg/kg of PADE for 60 days. Leydig cells had reduced nucleus diameters and increasing the number of pyknotic nuclei (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>e). Morphometric analysis of histologic slides determined that PADE treatment had a pronounced dose-dependent effect on Leydig cell nuclei (Table
