<p id="Par15">Standardized 
 <italic>Potentilla alba</italic> Dry Extract was developed by the All-Russian Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (VILAR), Moscow, Russian Federation. The dry extract was prepared from the rhizomes of cultivated white cinquefoil (
 <italic>Potentilla alba</italic> L.) plants. PADE appeared as a light brown, amorphous, hygroscopic powder. PADE was soluble in 40% ethanol and formed a turbid solution in hot water. PADE preparation consists of (+)-catechin, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, β-sitosterol, β-sitosterol-3-O-β-D- glucopyranoside, and others [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The dry extract was standardized by the sum of phenolic compounds (e.g., catechins, gallic, and coumaric acids). The composition of PADE used in these experiments comprised of 61.29% phenolic compounds, 25% polysaccharides, and 2% phytosterols. In addition, the PADE also contained polymeric proanthocyanidins of unknown structure.
