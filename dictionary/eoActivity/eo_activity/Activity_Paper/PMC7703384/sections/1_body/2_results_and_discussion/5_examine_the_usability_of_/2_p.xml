<p>We also examined the effect of 288 fungal extracts on non-methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The results showed that 22 prevented the growth of non-methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (hit rate of 7.6%). Besides, we analyzed another two featured bacteria, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic>, which is gram-positive and has acid-fast dye staining cell wall, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>-AS17tolc, which has gram-negative cell wall, but more permeable than the wild type 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. We obtained eight candidates against 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> and three candidates against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>-AS17tolc. The results showed 10.8% and 1% hit rates to 
 <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>-AS17tolc, respectively (
 <xref rid="table-6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplemental-information">File S3</xref>). The results show that the secondary metabolites produced by different types of fungi in the GFEL contained biologically active compounds against drug-resistant and pathogenic strains of bacteria.
