<p>Our fungal library includes many endophytic fungi. Since endophytic fungi produce many plant metabolites with medical functions, we collected plant samples from the three most extensive tropical botanic gardens in China, including South China, Hainan Xinglong, and Yunnan Tropical. There are many diverse plants in these gardens. We collected 27 well-known Chinese medicinal plants, such as Chinese black olive (

Following grinding masses and culturing on Malt Extract Agar (MEA) plates, more than 50 endophytic fungi were isolated on MEA plates. The colors and morphology of these endophytic fungi and their corresponding plants look strikingly different (
