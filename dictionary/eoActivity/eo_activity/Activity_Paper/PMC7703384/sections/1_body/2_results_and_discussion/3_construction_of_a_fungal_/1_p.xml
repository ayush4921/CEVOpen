<p>To generate a fungal metabolite library, we used the cereal-based medium to produce the secondary metabolites as reported (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2015</xref>). Each fungus was cultured in a test tube with six small pieces of cereals. After culturing for one month, we used ethyl acetate to extract the secondary metabolites. We obtained 9,053 crude extracts in total, each of which corresponds to a specific fungal isolate. As anticipated, different fungal strains produced different amounts of secondary metabolites from 1 mg to 20 mg per gram culture, and have various physical features such as stickiness, odors, and solubility. More than 90% of the extracts have colors, including green, orange, red, yellow, purple, and others. The crude extracts were dissolved in DMSO to generate 2 mg/mL solution. For future reference, we named this library “Global Fungal Extract Library” or GFEL in brief.
