<p>Cereal based medium was used to grow fungi to produce secondary metabolites (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Niu et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, six pieces of Cheerios Breakfast cereals (General Mills, Minneapolis, MN) were placed in a glass test tube, capped with a plastic lid and autoclaved for 20 min, and then two mL sterile sucrose water (3 g of sucrose and 50 mg chloramphenicol in 1 L distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O) was added into the tube. Later, the fungal colony grown on the MEA plate was inoculated into the cereal medium and incubated at RT for one month to produce sufficient metabolites. A month late, two mL ethyl acetate was added into a tube to extract the fungal metabolites, mixed with a glass stirring rod, and placed overnight in a chemical hood with gentle shaking. The next day, one mL upper layer of supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 mL tube. After centrifugation (2,000 g for 2 min), around 950 µL clear supernatant was transferred to a pre-weighed 1.5 mL plastic tube and dried with SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Finally, the dry extracts were weighed and dissolved in an appropriate amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to prepare 10 mg/mL stock solution and stored in a −20 °C freezer for future screening assays.
