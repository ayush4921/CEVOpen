<p>The LD
 <sub>50</sub> (i.p.) value of 3,100 mg/kg for the methanol extract obtained in mice, indicated high safety profile. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of a sample is the dose that kills 50% of the animals in each group. Before death, the animals exhibited decreased locomotion, tremor, uncoordinated body movement and convulsion. In general, the smaller the LD
 <sub>50</sub> value, the more toxic the sample is and the larger the LD
 <sub>50 </sub>value, the lower the toxicity with respect to the same route of administration. It therefore means that a large quantity of the material will be required to bring about a toxic response.
