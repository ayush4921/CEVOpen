<p>The effect of extract on hot plate-induced pain was studied in adult mice. The hot plate was used to measure the response latencies according to the method earlier put forward by Vaz et al. (1996)

The animals were placed into a glass beaker of 50 cm diameter on a heated surface, and the time(s) between placement and shaking or licking of the paws or jumping was recorded as the index of response latency. An automatic 40 sec cut-off was used to prevent tissue damage. The animals were randomly divided into five groups of six mice each and fasted for 24 hr but allowed access to water. Group 1 animal served as negative control and was given 10 ml/kg of distilled water. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were pretreated i.p. with 310, 620 and 930 mg/kg doses of 
 <italic>LS</italic> extract, respectively, while group 5 was given 100 mg/kg of acetyl salicylic acid i.p., 30 min before the placement on the hot plate.
