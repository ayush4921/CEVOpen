    "<h4>Objective</h4><i>Lonchocarpus sericeus</i> stembark decoction has been extensively employed in folkloric medicine in many parts of Nigeria as a remedy for pain as well as inflammation. The plant was studied for its anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic potency using standard biological models.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The stembark of <i>L. sericeus</i> was evaluated for anti-inflammatory properties using egg albumin and xylene-induced oedema models. The pain-relieving property was evaluated using acetic acid-induced writhing and thermally-induced pain models. Median lethal dose determination (intraperitoneal LD<sub>50</sub>), quantification of some phytochemicals as well as phytochemical screening were also performed.<h4>Results</h4>The LD<sub>50</sub> of stembark extract of <i>L. sericeus</i> was found to be 3,100 mg/kg (i. p). The crude extract and fractions (310-930 mg/kg) effectively reduced oedema caused by egg albumin and xylene and exhibited high analgesic properties in inhibiting pain induced by acetic acid and heat. These reductions were dose-dependent and statistically significant (p<0.05-0.001) when compared to distilled water and similar to prototype drugs employed. Quantitative determinations of some bio-active constituents of the plant showed a higher flavonoid content (0.52±0.02 mg/100 g) compared to alkaloids (0.36±0.02 mg/100 g) and flavonoids (0.49±0.03 mg/100 g). Phytochemical screening of the stembark showed the presence of alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids terpenes, tannins and saponins.<h4>Conclusion</h4>These results imply that the stembark extract of <i>L. sericeus</i> possesses anti-inflammatory and analgesic potency and these data validate its wide use in folkloric medicine for inflammation and pain management."
