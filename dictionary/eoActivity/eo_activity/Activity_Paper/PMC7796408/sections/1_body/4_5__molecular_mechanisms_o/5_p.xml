<p>Several studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory activity of some polyphenols depends on their ability to suppress pro-inflammatory signaling pathways such as MAPK, AP1, and NFκB, and in turn, this ability is associated with the ability to restore a suitable redox environment [

 <xref rid="B107-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Among the members of the MAPK cascades, apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1) is an upstream MAPKKK that regulates the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways. ASK1 is activated under various stress conditions including oxidative stress. ASK1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts were decreased JNK and p38 MAPK activation. ROS-activated ASK1 mediates p38 signaling pathway leading to nonapoptotic outcomes that probably favor the increase of pro-inflammatory cells [

Although the mechanisms that participate in these processes have not been studied in depth. The possible mechanisms may be related to effects on intracellular and intercellular signaling pathways, regulation of nuclear transcription factors, fat metabolism, and modulation in the synthesis of inflammatory [

Since the inhibition of pro-inflammatory enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), lipoxygenase (LOX) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been demonstrated. Pretreatment of primary chondrocytes and cartilage explants with Imperatorin, a plant secondary metabolite belonging to the family of furanocoumarins, suppressed the production of iNOS and NO, blocking IL-1β-induced phosphorylation of the ERK-MAPK/AP1 signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B106-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Inhibition of protein kinases such as phosphoinositol kinase, protein kinase C, phosphatidylinositol kinase has been documented, tyrosine kinase, or cyclin-dependent kinase-4. As well as the activation of phase II detoxifying pathways through the activation of factor 2 related to erythroid nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2). Additionally. Additionally, several flavonoids can decrease the expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), in different types of cells, such as RAW macrophages, Jurkat T cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [

 <italic>E. neillii</italic> exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, principally 2″-O-galloyl orientin, followed by 2″-O-galloyl vitexin. Additionally. Additionally, flexible molecular docking on heme oxygenase (HO-1), an important stress protein that is involved in cellular protection, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, justified the antioxidant activity of the isolated compounds [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. One of the pathways implicated in the control of inflammation Nrf2 that controls the expression of antioxidant response element-regulated antioxidant and cyto-protective genes, such as NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase catalytic subunit (GCLC), and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 [
 <xref rid="B113-ijms-22-00248" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. From what can be suggested, 2″-O-galloyl orientin, maybe a potential activator of Nrf2 and therefore play a fundamental role in the treatment of inflammatory pain.
