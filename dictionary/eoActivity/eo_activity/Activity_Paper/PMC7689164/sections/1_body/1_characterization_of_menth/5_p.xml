<p id="p0055">Two new heterocyclic compounds are synthesized by chemical reaction of hydroxylamine and hydrazine with piperitone oxide, the major compound of 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> essential oil [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Other researchers demonstrated that low dose gamma irradiation is efficient to decontaminate 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> contaminated with 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The amount of phenolic material in the plant increases after the irradiation. Saline stress simulated by different NaCl concentrations (50–150 mM) affects growth, mineral content and essential oil yield and composition for 
 <italic>M. suaveolens</italic> subsp. Timija [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The results show that increasing NaCl concentration up to 150 mM significantly reduces the fresh and dry plant biomass by 47.55% and 69.32%, respectively. The Essential oil yield decreases by 38.90% and 50.60% at 100 and 150 mM of NaCl, respectively. Abundance of menthone in the essential oil was affected by salt stress.
