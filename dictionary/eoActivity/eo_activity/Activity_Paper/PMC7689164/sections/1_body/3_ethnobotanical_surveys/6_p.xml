 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the highest degree of similarity was found between Tafilalet, Rabat, and Oujda regions where 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> and 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> are the plants of the genus Mentha the most used by the population. This could be explained by similarities in ethnobotanical habits and the profile of medicinal plants cultivated in the three zones. Overall, the different zones presented an index of similarity close to each other. This result demonstrates a homogeneity in the use of Mentha species in Morocco and highlights the ethnobotanical value of the genus. By calculating the Jaccard similarity index, it was reported that the ethnobotanical use of medicinal plants belonging to multiple genera is different amongst Moroccan zones, and in comparison, with the neighboring countries, Mauritania, Algeria and Spain [
