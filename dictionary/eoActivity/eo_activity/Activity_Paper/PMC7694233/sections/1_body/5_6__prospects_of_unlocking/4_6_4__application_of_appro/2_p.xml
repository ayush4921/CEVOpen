<p>In southern Africa, the genetic diversity of 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> remains anecdotal despite the biodiversity potential of the region. This may be due to the poor documentation of the genetic diversity of indigenous resources in the region and the continent at large [

 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01486" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. There is a need to assess the current genetic diversity for 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> to facilitate its conservation and development. Even though 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> possesses several attributes that could drive rural communities and agricultural development, the lack of adequate information and research has created a disincentive for possible interventions [
