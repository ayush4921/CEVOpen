<p>Furthermore, the genetic variations within 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> accessions can potentially create a problem of heterogeneity. Hence, biotechnological tools together with conventional crop genetics, breeding techniques as well as 
 <italic>de novo</italic> domestication can be employed for the rapid genetic improvement of 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic>. Agricultural biosciences and innovation need to be strengthened to ensure food security, enhance nutrition, and improve health in developing countries. Therefore, unlocking the resource value of 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> to meet the needs of potential consumers remains pertinent. The need for cheap, affordable, and accessible fruits presents opportunities for developing countries to capitalize on their biodiversity by exploring the resource value of their indigenous fruit trees including 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> to capture niche markets.
