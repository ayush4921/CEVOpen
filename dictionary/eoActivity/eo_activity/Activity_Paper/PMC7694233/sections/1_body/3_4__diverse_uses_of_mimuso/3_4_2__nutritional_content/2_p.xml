 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01486" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] identified 17 amino acids in the seeds of 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic>, which accounted for an estimated 97% of the crude protein content (9.3%). Glutamic acid, which was the major amino acid constituted approximately 13.8% of the crude protein. Furthermore, oleic and palmitic acids were the only lipids that were detected. Neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber constituted 33.2% and 15.3%, respectively [
