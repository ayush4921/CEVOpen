<p>The lipid in 
 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> seeds is similar to that found in soybean (
 <italic>Glycine max</italic>). The lipid content of 21.3% is comparable to that of soybean, which has between 15 and 25% lipid content [

 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> seeds is lower than that of the cottonseed (
 <italic>Gossipium hirstum</italic>), which has 35–40% oil content [

 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> seed oil (85% of lipid yield (84.59) is high when compared to the 70–78% oleic acid in Marula tree (
 <italic>Sclerocarya birrea</italic>) kernel oil and 63% oleic acid in red sour plum (

 <italic>Mimusops zeyheri</italic> fruit range from 50–80 mg/g fresh fruit and this content is relatively higher when compared to guava, which is an exotic fruit with 20 mg/g vitamin C [
