 <p>A tyrosinase inhibitor was separated from camellia pollen with the aid of solvent fraction, macroporous adsorptive resin chromatography, and high‐speed countercurrent chromatography. The inhibitor was identified to be 
  <italic>p</italic>‐coumaric acid ethyl ester (
  <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE) by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrum. Its inhibitory activity (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 4.89 μg/ml) was about 10‐fold stronger than arbutin (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 51.54 μg/ml). The 
  <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE inhibited tyrosinase in a noncompetitive model with the 
  <italic>K</italic>
  <sub>I</sub> and 
  <italic>K</italic>
  <sub>m</sub> of 1.83 μg/ml and 0.52 mM, respectively. Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis showed the 
  <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE quenched an intrinsic fluorescence tyrosinase. UV‐Vis spectroscopy analysis showed the 
  <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE did not interact with copper ions of the enzyme. Docking simulation implied the 
  <italic>p‐</italic>CAEE induced a conformational change in the catalytic region and thus changed binding forces of L‐tyrosine. Our findings suggest that 
  <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE plays an important role in inhibiting tyrosinase and provides a reference for developing pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and fruit preservation products using pollen.
