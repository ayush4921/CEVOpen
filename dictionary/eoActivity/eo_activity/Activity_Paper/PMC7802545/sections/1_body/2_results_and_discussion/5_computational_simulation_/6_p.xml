 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7c,d</xref> shows the interaction between inhibitor 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE and tyrosinase. 
 <italic>p</italic>‐CAEE bonded with tyrosinase via Phe 367, Lys 378, Thr 307, Val 312, Tys 313, Asn 309, Asp 356, and Glu 358 through Van der Waals forces, then bonded with Trp 357 and Trp 305 through hydrophobic interactions, furthermore bonded with Tyr 310, Glu 355 and Asp 311 by carbon‐hydrogen bonds, last bonded with Gln306 through hydrophobic interactions.
