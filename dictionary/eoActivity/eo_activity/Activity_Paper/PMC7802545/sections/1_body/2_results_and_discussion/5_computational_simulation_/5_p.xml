 <xref rid="fsn32004-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7a,b</xref> shows the interaction between substrate L‐tyrosine and tyrosinase. L‐tyrosine bonded with His 85 and Gly 86 via hydrogen bonds, then bonded with Val 283, His 259, His 244, Glu 256, Pro 284, Asn 243, His 94, Phe 90, His 61, Leu 63, His 85, and Gly 86 via Van der Waals forces, furthermore, bonded with Cu 400 via metal interactions, last bonded with Phe 90 and His 244 through hydrophobic interactions.
