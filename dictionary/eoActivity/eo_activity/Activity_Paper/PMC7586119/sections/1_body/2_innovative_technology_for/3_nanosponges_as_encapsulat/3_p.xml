<p id="p0115">Nanosponges can be used to mitigate challenges within the agricultural industry. For example, they can be used as biofungicides to replace synthetic pesticides currently used in agriculture to protect plants against pests and diseases for increased yield and quality of the agricultural products (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Asghari et al., 2016</xref>). Nanosponges can be encapsulated with herbs that can be used for phytotoxicity problems on agricultural products. 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Asghari et al. (2016)</xref> reported the effects of nano-encapsulated herbicides against parasitic weeds. The herbicide encapsulated configuration allowed for the use of herbicides in different modes to selected areas since they were not affected (i.e. degraded) by the crop. The herbicides were applied in low doses and accumulated in the parasitic weed via the sink effect (

Despite the beneficial properties of nanosponges and their wide applicability, very limited studies have investigated their use in mycotoxicology. 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Appell and Jackson (2012)</xref> investigated OTA sorption ability and characteristics of a β-cyclodextrin-based nanosponge (cyclodextrin-polyurethane polymer) in aqueous solutions. The results revealed that cyclodextrin nanosponge materials were effective at reducing OTA levels (between 1–10 μg/L) in spiked aqueous solutions. In fact, it was possible to reduce OTA levels from up to 10 μg/L in spiked red wine to within the recommended levels of 2 μg/L. Furthermore, inference from Langmuir isotherm of sorption data revealed that nanosponge has maximum binding capacity of 220 μg OTA per g of polymer. Elsewhere, solid phase extraction sorbent material based on a nanosponge was developed with β-cyclodextrin and methylene bis-diphenyl diisocyanate in the ratio of 1:5 (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Appell et al., 2018</xref>). The novel polymer (i.e. β-cyclodextrin polyurethane polymer) was used to extract and clean-up OTA from wine and grape juice. Recoveries of OTA in the spiked beverages (0.5–20 ng/mL) as found, ranged from 69.1–86.5% in grape juice and 77.0–89.4% in wine (

In another study, polyurethane-β-cyclodextrin polymers, in particular, polymer cross-linked with tolylene 2,4-diisocyanate were synthesized and the complex presented populations of binding sites which was able to extract patulin from apple juice (
