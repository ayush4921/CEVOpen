<p id="p0080">The high frequency of toxigenic fungal manifestation warrants the consistent evaluation of bioactive phytochemicals and their derivatives that exhibit high antifungal and anti-mycotoxigenic activities as alternatives to conventional fungicides. 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> briefly presents phytochemicals that have shown antifungal activities and their mode of action, thus inhibiting their respective mycotoxin biosynthesis. Moreover, nanoencapsulation formulations are also presented, exhibiting a synergistic effect between encapsulate and phytochemical with low side effects. The use of natural formulations antifungal agents for safe, effective, and eco-friendly features against fungi and mycotoxins is ideal for agricultural practices compared to standard antifungal agents (
