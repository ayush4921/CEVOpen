<p>For separation and purification flash column chromatography was practiced through silica gel (60-mesh; Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in thick-walled glass columns. The monitoring of the reactions was performed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using analytical aluminum plates with brand Merck 0.2-m silica gel 60 F254 and visualization was done with UV-lamp. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was used to dry over all the extracts and solvents were removed under low temperature and reduced pressure by using a Heidolph brand rotary evaporator.</p>
