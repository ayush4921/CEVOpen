<p>The metal chelating property of the compounds was performed by following the method described in the literature by Dundar et al. [41]. The compounds of different concentrations (25â€“200 /g/mL) in 0.5 mL DMSO were prepared. To the compounds were added 1.85 mL of methanol followed by 0.1 mL of 2 mmol/L of iron chloride. Addition of ferrozine (0.2 mL of 5 mmol/L) to the solution mixture started the reaction. At last, the absorbance was measured at 562 nm, after the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The results were given in terms of percent inhibition of ferrozine-Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> complex formation. Positive control was done using EDTA.
