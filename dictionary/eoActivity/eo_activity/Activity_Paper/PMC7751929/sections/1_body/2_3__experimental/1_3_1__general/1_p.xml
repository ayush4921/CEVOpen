<p>Predried glassware was used to carry out all experiments in argon atmosphere. Chemicals for in the biological assay studies were bought from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Sternheim, Germany). The blank antimicrobial test discs were obtained from Oxoid (7.0 mm, Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, Hants, UK). 
 <sup>1</sup>HNMR and 13 CNMR spectra were measured in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> on an Agilent NMR spectrometer (400 MHz). 
 <sup>1</sup>H (400 MHz) and 13 CNMR (100 MHz). Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm relative to CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> (Î´ 7.26 and 77.0 for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>CNMR, respectively). Thermo Scientific Q Exactive instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was used to get mass spectra for the final products. Melting point data was obtained from Stuart SMP3 instrument.
