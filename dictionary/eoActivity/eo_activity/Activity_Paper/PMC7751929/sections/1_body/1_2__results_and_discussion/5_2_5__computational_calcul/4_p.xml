<p>When the electrostatic potential maps of the structures are examined, we see that the region where coordination is expected is rich in electron. Therefore, the potential of cations to approach this region and form a coordination complex is high. Following metal coordination, it was seen that the electron distribution in the structure was more positive with the dispersion of +2 charge from the metal ion. The direct effect of metal insertion on the electronic structure is a proof of metal coordination.</p>
