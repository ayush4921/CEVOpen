<p>Three types of gram-positive and 3 types of gram-negative bacteria were considered to investigate the antimicrobial effect of the compounds. The inhibition zones of the compounds studied here against the gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are listed in Table 2. The results indicate that the compounds formed inhibition zones in the range of 0â€“16 mm. According to results, compounds 
 <bold>A6</bold> , 
 <bold>P3</bold> and 
 <bold>P6</bold> showed activity against all bacteria tested. On the other hand, 
 <bold>A4</bold> , 
 <bold>A5</bold> , 
 <bold>P4</bold> and 
 <bold>P5</bold> did not showed antibacterial activity against any bacteria. 
 <bold>P3</bold> showed 16, 14 and 13 millimeter inhibition zones against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> , 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeriginosa</italic> , respectively. However, standard antibiotics (tetracycline and streptomycin) were found to be more effective than the new compounds tested against bacteria.
