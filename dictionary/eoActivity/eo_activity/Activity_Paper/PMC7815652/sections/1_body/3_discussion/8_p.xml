<p id="p0195">TLC of active fraction showed different colour bands representing the different compound found in these extract. Bands clearly indicate the presence of secondary metabolites which showed characteristics colour of band i.e. light blue, dark blue, colours characteristics of triterpenoids and pink and red colour bands indicates the presence of flavonoids and tannins respectively. Bouyahya et al. [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] also described that chromatogram preparation via TLC is best for initial understanding of secondary metabolites, Banu &amp; Nagarajan [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] also confirmed that obtained bands after TLC fingerprinting corresponds to specific class of secondary metabolites and are accountable for antimicrobial activity. This was confirmed for leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> (Osbeck) Merrill. Subsequently elution via column chromatography of active fraction i.e. alcoholic fraction of leaf was completed utilizing solvent system develops during TLC chromatogram study. After column chromatography 9 fractions were obtained from active alcoholic fraction of leaf. Each fraction comprised of different set of active compounds with antimicrobial characteristics. Presence of different active metabolites confirmed by the TLC chromatogram prepared from all the fractions obtained which showed characteristics Rf value and colour bands corresponding to active secondary metabolites or compound [

Extraction processes usually used to extract active ingredients are crude extraction and partially purified extraction process [

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The principle of series of extraction process is to isolate the soluble plant metabolites, and left behind the insoluble cellular mass (residue). Initial crude extraction procedure i.e. cold extraction of plant parts, able to extract compound mix of many plant metabolites, such as alkaloids, glycosides, phenolics, terpenoids and flavonoids.
