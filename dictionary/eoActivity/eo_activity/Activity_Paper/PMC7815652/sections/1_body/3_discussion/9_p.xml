<p id="p0200">GC-MS is the best technique to identify the bioactive constituents of long chain hydrocarbons, alcohols, acids, esters, alkaloids, steroids, amino and nitro compounds etc. Hence, Gas chromatography (GC) and Mass spectroscopy (MS) associated with particular detection techniques have become a sophisticated means for analysis of various active compounds from plant extract [

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Identified eighteen phytochemical constituents from the ethanolic extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>Desmodium gyrans</italic> by Gas chromatogram Mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Nanadagopalan et al. [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported the presence of Phytol in the leaves of 
 <italic>Kirganelia reticulata</italic> aerial parts, which was found to be effective in different stages of arthritis. Aja et al. [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] GC/MS analysis of 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaf and seed which revealed that 9-octadecenoic acid (20.89%) constitutes the major constituent of the leaf extract while oleic acid (84%) is the major component of the seed extract.
