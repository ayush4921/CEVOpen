<p id="p0180">Preliminary phytochemical studies and literature reveal that the leaves of 
 <italic>T. peruviana</italic> contain iridoid glycosides, flavonoids [

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], monoterpenes [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and cardiac glycosides [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These compounds are known to cause structural and functional damage of cellular membrane. Impairment in membrane results in dissipation of two components of proton motive force, the pH gradients (ΔpH) and electrical potential (Δψ) [

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Detrimental effects on proton motive force are strongly correlated with leakage of specific ions [
