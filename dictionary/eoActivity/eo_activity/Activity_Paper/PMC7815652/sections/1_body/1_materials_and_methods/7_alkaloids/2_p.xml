<p id="p0070">Alkaloids are heterocyclic nitrogenous compounds which are found naturally in plants. Structurally have one or more nitrogen which hold heterocyclic ring. Mayer's test or Wagner's test or Hager's test used to find out the occurrence of alkaloids in the partially purified fractions. A cream coloured precipitate is produced in the reaction with Mayor's reagent; Wagner's reagent results in formation of reddish brown precipitate whereas Hager's reagent gives yellow precipitate. After adding few drops of diluted HCL in the little quantity of extract it was stirred and filtered. Various alkaloid reagents were tested on the filtrate and development of coloured precipitate was observed.</p>
