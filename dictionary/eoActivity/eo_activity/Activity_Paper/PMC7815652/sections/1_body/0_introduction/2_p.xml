<p id="p0030">Plants have capability to produce a great number of various bioactive compounds like essential oils, gums and resins etc. that have been revealed to possess biological activity against plant fungal pathogens 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and can be used as bio-fungicidal products [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These plants derived bioactive compounds are produced as secondary metabolites and remain accumulated in different plant parts. The presence of such phytochemicals is a marker that the plant can be a prospective store of these precursors in the development of herbal formulation [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These phytochemicals are usually supposed to be more satisfactory and less unsafe for the ecosystems and could be used as substitute remedies for treatment of plant diseases [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the recent years, research work on decoction of biologically active compounds from plant parts and their utilization for therapeutic purposes has increased intensively (

Screening of plant parts for the presence of antimicrobial activity is usually done by first preparing plant extract using cold and hot extraction methods. Primary evaluation of antifungal activity commonly done with 100% alcohol, 50% alcohol and 100% aqueous extracts. The secondary metabolites which could be present in the extracts can be isolated in various solvents on the basis of their solubility in the solvents used. Various organic solvents are used on the basis of their polarity in hot extraction using soxhlet assembly for successive extraction.
