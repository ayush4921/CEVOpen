 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A, total 7 bands were observed after TLC of active fraction of 
 <italic>T. peruviana</italic> leaf extract. Every band showed its characteristics Rf value calculated using the formulae. Active fraction (alcoholic fraction) of leaf extract of 
 <italic>T. peruviana</italic> was also subjected to column chromatography. In column fractionation of alcoholic leaf extract of 
 <italic>T. peruviana</italic>, total 9 fractions were collected. Each of 9 fractions was further fractionized via TLC. Different colour bands from one to three were observed for different column fractions. The TLC plate was observed under UV light at 254Â nm before and after derivatization (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). 
 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> shows the results of TLC of different column fractions. Different bands showed characteristics Rf value and colour after derivatization using anis-aldehyde reagent on the TLC plates. Rf value of different bands observed were ranges from 0.62 to 0.94.
