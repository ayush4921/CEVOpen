<p id="p0160">GC-MS Analysis Fractions obtained from column chromatography was subjected to determine antifungal activity against plant pathogenic fungus 
 <italic>A. Solani</italic>. 
 <xref rid="tbl8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> depicted the results of antifungal activity of column fractions. As compared to control, maximum inhibition in growth of test fungus was observed by fraction F9 i. e followed by F7, F3, F1, F5, F6, F8, F2 and F4. All column fractions were checked for antifungal activity against test pathogens. Among the fractions most significant inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>A. solani</italic> was shown by fraction F9. This fraction F9 was subjected to GC-MS analysis for further refining and identification of active compound it contained. 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> showed the chromatogram obtained for fraction F9. There was total number of one compound seen on GC-MS chromatogram.
