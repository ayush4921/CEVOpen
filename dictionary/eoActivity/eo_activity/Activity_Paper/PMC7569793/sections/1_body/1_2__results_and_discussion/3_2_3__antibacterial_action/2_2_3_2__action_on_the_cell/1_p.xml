<p>The action of the test extract (PH-n-Hex) on the 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> cell membrane was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01111-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The quantification of the release of UV-absorbing materials at OD260 was an indication of a serious and irreversible alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane. The release of intracellular content was an index of damage and loss of membrane integrity [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. After treatment with PH-n-Hex at MIC and 4MIC, the OD increased up to 0.803 from 0.71 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01111-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). These observations implied that the test sample weakly damages the cytoplasmic membrane thereby leading to low leakage of 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> intracellular constituents. The percentage of crystal violet uptake significantly decreased after treatment with test material at MIC and 4MIC compared to untreated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01111-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). The difference in uptake of crystal violet from the bacterial cell wall after treatment compared to normal could be due to defective cell wall, as there were permeability changes [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The reduction in crystal violet uptake could probably be attributed to the enlargement of the treated cell, thereby changing the permeability and structure of the cell wall membrane layer compared to normal cells.
