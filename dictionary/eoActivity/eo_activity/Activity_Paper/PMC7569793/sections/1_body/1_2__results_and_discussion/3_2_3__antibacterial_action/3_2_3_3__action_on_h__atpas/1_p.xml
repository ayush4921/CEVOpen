<p>The inhibition of

 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase-mediated proton pumping was noted after treatment with PH-n-Hex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01111-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Ion exchange systems in bacteria are coupled to the ATP energy synthesis used by the bacteria and any inhibition of their functioning (which results in a reduction in the acidification of the medium) could be detrimental to their survival. Cytoplasmic pH of bacteria cells is regulated by extrusion proton through the respiratory chain and K
 <sup>+</sup> influx at acid pH, and cation/proton antiporter regulates the pH in alkaline states [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Every substance that disturbs the regulation of ATPase responsible for maintaining the homeostasis and osmotic stability of ions inside the cell is considered as a target of proton pumps. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01111-f005">Figure 5</xref>, the test fraction induced inhibition of the glucose-induced acidification of the external medium by 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. For instance, at 2MIC, the extract exerted a constant and total inhibition of 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> proton pumps, suggesting that the H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase of 
 <italic>S. enterica</italic> is a potential cellular target of PH-n-Hex.
