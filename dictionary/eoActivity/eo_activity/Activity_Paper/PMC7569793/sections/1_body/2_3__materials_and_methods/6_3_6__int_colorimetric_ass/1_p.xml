<p>The antibacterial assay of MeOH extract and fractions were carried out in triplicate using a broth microdilution method for plant extracts in 96-wells microplates, using INT as the bacterial growth indicator [

The final concentration of DMSO in the assay was less than 2.5%, a concentration innocuous to bacterial growth. The solution obtained was added to TSB, followed by a two-fold serial dilution in a 96-wells microplate. Subsequently, bacterial suspension initially prepared at the McFarland standard of 0.5 (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL), as mentioned, was diluted in TSB, and 100 μL of bacterial inoculum was seeded in the wells of plates containing test extracts. The final inoculum concentration was equivalent to 1.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL. Afterwards, the plates were covered with a sterile plate sealer, then shaken to mix the contents of the wells using a plate shaker, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 18 h. Wells containing adequate TSB, 100 μL of inoculum, and DMSO to a final concentration of 2.5% served as negative controls. The final concentration of the extracts varied from 0.008 to 1 mg/mL, whereas that of antibiotics ranged from 0.002 to 0.25 mg/mL. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of test samples was recorded after 18 h incubation at 37 °C, following the addition (40 μL) of INT 0.02% (

 <italic>v</italic>) and another incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The viable bacteria reduced the yellow dye to pink. Wells with test samples only (blank control) were used to ensure that the extracts were not producing color with INT. The minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was assessed by adding 50 μL aliquots of the preparations, which did not show any growth after incubation during MIC testing, to 150 μL of adequate broth. These preparations were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. The MBC was considered as the lowest concentration of samples that prevented the color change of the medium after the addition of INT as abovementioned. The assays were performed in triplicate and repeated thrice.
