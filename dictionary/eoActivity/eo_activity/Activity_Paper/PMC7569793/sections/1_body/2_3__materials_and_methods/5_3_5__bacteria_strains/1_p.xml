<p>Studied bacteria strains were from CCTCC (China Center for Type Culture Collection), CMCC (Center for Medical Culture Collection), and ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). These comprised two Gram-positive (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> CCTCC AB91093 and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> ATCC29212) and three Gram-negative bacterial strains (
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> CCTCC AB94018, 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> ATCC700323, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> CMCC(B)46117). Trypticase soy agar (TSA) and trypticase soy broth (TSB) were used as culture media for antibacterial testing. TSA and TSB are non-selective, general-use culture media that supply enough nutritive elements, allowing for a broad variety of microorganisms to grow. Before any experiment, studied bacteria were subcultured (at 37 °C for 18–24 h) in TSA. TSB was used for microdilution and antibacterial mechanistic studies. Bacteria inoculum was initially prepared in sterile distilled water, the turbidity adjusted with a spectrophotometer to a McFarland standard of 0.5, equivalent to 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL.
