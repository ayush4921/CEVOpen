<p>The GC–MS analysis of the n-hexane fraction (PH-n-Hex) was performed using an Agilent 7890A GC–MS system, operating in an electron-impact mode of 70 eV. The GC system was equipped with a capillary column Agilent 19091S-433 (325 °C, 30 m long × 250 µm id × 0.25 µm film thickness) (Agilent Co., Santa Clara, CA, USA). The chromatographic conditions were as follows: sample preparation in hexane; injection volume 1 µL; split ratio 1:10; carrier gas helium flow rate 1.0 mL/min; column oven temperature programmed from 60 to 300 °C, with a gradient of 5 °C/min; injector temperature 250 °C. The identification of the chemical components was done by comparing their mass spectra and retention time with the data available in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library (GC–MS System Nist. 11 lib.). </p>
