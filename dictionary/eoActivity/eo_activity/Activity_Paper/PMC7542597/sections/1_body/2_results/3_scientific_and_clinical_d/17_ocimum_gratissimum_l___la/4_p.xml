<p>Preclinical evidence. This herbal medicine has been experimentally proven for cough. An aqueous extract of 
 <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> was evaluated in OVA-sensitized guinea-pig about anti-tussive and anti-asthma activities. The aqueous extract did not exert effect in pre-convulsive dyspnea; however, reduced in a significant manner, the volume of tracheal liquid, although it did not interfere in the fluid viscosity, and reduced in more than 80% the number of cough episodes (

 <italic>O. gratissimum</italic> presented an antinociceptive effect in mice, in evaluation using classical methods (

 <italic>O. gratissimum</italic>, in mice, presented anti-inflammatory activity, reducing the number of the leucocytes in the peritoneum, and inhibited iNOS, COX-2 (in the same degree than indomethacin). Also, inhibited LPS-induced NO, IL-1β, and TNF-a production in RAW 264.7 cells (
