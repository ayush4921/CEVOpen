<p>Clinical evidence. 
 <italic>Salix alba</italic> preparations have been trialed clinically for fever and inflammation. A randomized study with 210 patients was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of 
 <italic>Salix</italic> bark extract for the treatment of low back pain. Patients received bark extract orally with 120 mg or 240 mg of salicin or placebo in 4-week. In the last week of treatment, 39% of patients were pain-free for the high dose, 21% for the low dose, and 6% for the placebo (

Patients received placebo or willow bark extract containing 240 mg salicin per day for 2 weeks. In the willow bark extract group, the WOMAC pain score was reduced by 14% after 2 weeks, compared with an increase of 2% in the placebo group. Therefore, 
 <italic>Salix</italic> extract was well tolerated, with no adverse effects reported (

 <italic>Salix</italic> extract, opioids, and NSAIDs. The results showed that in conjunction with the use of the 
 <italic>Salix</italic> extract, the pain scores were between 33% and 44% of baseline. Drug interactions were not reported (
