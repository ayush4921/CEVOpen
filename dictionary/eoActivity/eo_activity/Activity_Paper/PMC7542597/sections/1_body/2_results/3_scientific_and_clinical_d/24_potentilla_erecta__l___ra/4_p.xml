<p>Preclinical evidence. This herbal medicine has not been experimentally proven for symptoms of respiratory disease. However, a moderate antiviral effect against 
 <italic>Herpes viridae</italic> has been demonstrated for extracts of 
 <italic>P. erecta</italic> and hydrolyzable and condensed tannins isolated from this plant. In particular, the antiviral activity against 
 <italic>Herpes virus</italic> types I and II was reported, as well as the cytotoxic activity against 
 <italic>Influenza</italic> virus type A2 and Cowpox (
 <xref rid="B329" ref-type="bibr">May, 1978</xref>). An agrimoniin-rich ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. erecta</italic> inhibited the NF-kB and formation of IL-6, and PGE2 in TNF−α stimulated HaCaT cells (

 <italic>Vaccine</italic> virus together with an induction of interferon synthesis (
