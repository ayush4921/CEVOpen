<p>Safety. Echinacea preparations are generally considered to be safe, although some allergic reactions have been recorded (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">ANSES, 2020</xref>), at this stage, there is no evidence to support this and, more generally, herbal treatments are not known to rigorously block inflammatory processes and to negatively affect immune responses. Therefore, these concerns seem to be a theoretical postulate which would require further evaluation. While there are no clinical signals for interaction with other medications, ANSESâ€™s concerns might be linked to theoretical interaction with immunosuppressants (such as ciclosporin and methotrexate) due to an antagonistic effect (
