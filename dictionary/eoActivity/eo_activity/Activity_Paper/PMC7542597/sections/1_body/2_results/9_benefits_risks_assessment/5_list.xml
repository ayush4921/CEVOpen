  <p>The juice or tea of 
   <italic>Citrus limon</italic> (L.) Burm.f fruits, alone or associated with salt, honey or ginger has been used to relieve cough and fever related to flu and cold in several traditional systems (

   <xref rid="B275" ref-type="bibr">Klimek-Szczykutowicz et al., 2020</xref>). However, there is no clinical evidence of such action in the respiratory tract, although this species is well-known as a rich source of vitamin C (

  <p>Besides the use as food, the decoction of 
   <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> L. dried leaves is taken orally to treat respiratory distress (
   <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">Chevallier, 1996</xref>; 
   <xref rid="B419" ref-type="bibr">Ross, 2001</xref>), and the only information on 
   <italic>L. nobilis</italic> posology is given by the American Pharmaceutical Association (
   <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">Duke et al., 2002</xref>). The closest to an applicable study is an 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> study examining SARS-CoV and the effect of several essential oils (
   <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 1995</xref>). The essential oil of 
   <italic>L. nobilis</italic> leaves was also evaluated for its antinociceptive and anti-inﬂammatory activities in mice and rats (
   <xref rid="B433" ref-type="bibr">Sayyah et al., 2003</xref>). However, the lack of clinical evidence led to concerns about the use of this species.

   <italic>Mentha</italic> x 
   <italic>piperita</italic> L. (peppermint) is widely used to treat bronchitis, fever and other respiratory disorders (
   <xref rid="B507" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2002</xref>; 
   <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Blumenthal, 2003</xref>), although no evidence can be found to corroborate these actions. The essential oil contains, among other compounds, menthol, menthone, menthofuran, and pulegone, a well-known hepatotoxin (
   <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">Engel, 2003</xref>), leading to a deep concern about the use of essential oil (
   <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">EMA, 2016e</xref>). However, peppermint tea usually contains a small amount of these compounds, and the normal use rarely led to serious adverse effects (

   <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L. (black seeds) is globally known as a spice and as a food item. In Arabic medicine, this species has very high status as a herbal medicine used for a wide range of diseases. In the context of COVID-19, the relevant uses are for asthma and in the more general management of inflammatory conditions. With regards to respiratory diseases its use can be traced back at least to Avicenna (ca. 980 – 1037, C.E.), who indicated it for shortness of breath and for stopping phlegm and Imam Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya (1292–1350 C.E.), who recommended it for gasping and hard breathing (
   <xref rid="B278" ref-type="bibr">Koshak et al., 2018</xref>). In many Arabic Countries, “black seed” is used for asthma and cough, among many other uses, especially of gastrointestinal diseases (like abdominal pain, stomach ache, colic), rheumatism, skin diseases and recently use to manage diabetes have become popular (
   <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Aisa et al., 2019</xref>). Some small studies demonstrate clinical benefits in asthma patients (
   <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">Koshak et al., 2017</xref>). Although black seed may be useful in the symptomatic relief of respiratory symptoms, especially associated with the severe asthmatic cough, the clinical evidence is very limited. A particular concern, in this case, are the many well-intended but very low-quality studies and the broad range of claims they try to support, making any assessment problematic.
