<p>Clinical evidence. Echinacea preparations have been trialed clinically for flu and cold. However, the overall problem with the assessment of the evidence refers to the variability of the pharmaceutical preparations investigated in clinical studies (

 <xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">Karsch‐Völk et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">David and Cunningham, 2019</xref>). Therefore, a large number of clinical studies, as well as a range of pharmacodynamics studies, have been conducted, overall indicating at best a weak evidence for benefits for treating colds. Several metanalyses failed to find any evidence of clear benefits. Still, two RCT reported statistically significant benefits for patients in terms treated with 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> and 
 <italic>E. angustifolia</italic> preparations of both symptoms and reduced duration of flu or cold (

 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">David and Cunningham, 2019</xref>), thus qualifying for A (Ib). Of note, one study showed no difference between an
