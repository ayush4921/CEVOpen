<p>Several food/herbal-based remedies are associated with the treatment of common cold and flu because they include vitamins (such as lemon juice), aromatic principles with perceived benefits for the upper respiratory system (such as mint, bayleaf), or because they are culturally considered as a “cure-all” (such as Nigella). Some of them are presented to the public in a “pharmaceutical forms” (capsules, tablets, syrups), thus looking like a “safe and effective medicinal approach”. The regulatory status of these products varies from country to country, and we advise here that only products that are regulated as (herbal) medicines should be used since this is an essential requirement for a product’s safety.</p>
