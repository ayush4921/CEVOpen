The ground aerial parts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> were soxhlet-extracted with n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol.

Cell death ELISA, TUNEL assay, and the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) uncovered that the cytotoxic effects of dichloromethane and methanol extracts were attributed to apoptosis in cancerous cells. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR revealed significant increases in the mRNA expression levels of p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and also a decrease in Bcl-2 expression. These results suggested that the extracts mainly induced apoptosis via a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. Notably, dichloromethane extract had higher cytotoxic and apoptotic activities than that of methanol extract, against both cancer cell lines, particularly MCF-7 cells. Our results indicate that <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> may serve as a promising source of potent agents for the treatment of human cancers. </p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Scrophularia amplexicaulis</kwd><kwd>anticancer</kwd><kwd>cytotoxicity</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nowadays cancer is a crucial public health problem and one of the leading causes of death throughout the world. Approximately 70 % of cancer related deaths occur in developing countries. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimated that the annual number of new cancer cases would rise to an estimated 21.7 million in 2030 along with 13.0 million deaths (Wilkes, 2018[<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]; Dalton et al., 2019[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Among the various strategies for cancer treatment, chemotherapy is often known as the most widely used method to prevent and treat cancer. However, the current cancer chemotherapeutic drugs have severe side effects and acquired drug resistances (Alfarouk et al., 2015[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; Srivastava et al., 2016[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). Therefore, there is an imperative interest to find new effective and less-toxic therapeutic agents against cancer.</p><p>Plants have great potential to provide chemoprotective effects against cancer and over 60 % of anti-cancer drugs are derived from natural sources including plants, microorganisms and marine organisms (Sultana et al., 2014[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; Fridlender et al., 2015[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; Dey et al., 2019[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Plant-derived anticancer drugs such as taxol from <italic>Taxus brevifolia</italic> L., camptothecin from <italic>Camptotheca acuminata</italic>, Decne., vinca alkaloids from <italic>Catharanthus roseus </italic>(L.) G. Don and podophyllotoxin from <italic>Podophyllum peltatum</italic> L. are well-known and extensively used in clinical trial (Iqbal et al., 2017[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; Kuruppu et al., 2019[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). </p><p>Different species of medicinal plants are shown to exert remarkable anticancer activity through apoptosis without causing undesired side effects (Safarzadeh et al., 2014[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; Murthy and Alice, 2018[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is a vital component of various processes comprising normal cell turnover, embryonic development, immune system regulation, tissue homeostasis and chemical induced cell death. Dysfunction of the apoptotic cell death is powerfully associated with the cancer initiation, progression, metastasis and treatment resistance. Hence, it is a validated strategy to evaluate traditional medicinal plants for their apoptosis inducing potential in cancer cells (Pistritto et al., 2016[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; Pfeffer and Singh, 2018[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; Jan and Chaudhry, 2019[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). </p><p><italic>Scrophularia</italic> is regarded as one of the large genera of the family Scrophulariaceae. This family comprises about 3000 species and 220 genera which are widely distributed in mountainous regions of the world, especially in Asia and North America (Giessrigl et al., 2012[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; Pasdaran and Hamedi, 2017[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Since ancient times, diffrent <italic>Scrophularia</italic> species have been used in traditional medicines to treat fever, wounds, erythema, eczema, psoriasis, inflammatory diseases, mouth dryness, goiter, constipation, fistula and infectious diseases (Stevenson et al., 2002[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; Park et al., 2009[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Apart from these activities, anticancer properties of different extracts from several <italic>Scrophularia </italic>species against various cancer models have been reported in the literature (Orangi et al., 2016[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; Pasdaran and Hamedi, 2017[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Phenylpropanoid glycosides and iridoids are the main chemical compounds of <italic>Scrophularia</italic> genus which can lead to aforementioned therapeutic effects (de Santos Gal&#x000ed;ndez et al., 2002[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; Bermejo et al., 2002[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; D&#x00131;az et al., 2004[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]).</p><p><italic>Scrophularia amplexicaulis </italic>Benth. is one of the Iranian endemic species of Scrophulariaceae family. Phytochemical analysis of the aerial parts of this species revealed the presence of two phenylalkanoid glycosides, salidroside and verbascoside, and two iridoid glycosides, scropolioside D and scrophuloside B4 (Pasdaran et al., 2016[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]). The lack of any information about the anticancer activity of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> prompted us to investigate the cytotoxic effects of <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>extracts against MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells and determine their underlying molecular mechanisms. The mouse firosarcoma cell line WEHI-164 was selected to confirm the aforementioned effect with the aim of performing further <italic>in vivo </italic>studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and cell lines</title><p>n-hexane, dichloromethane (DCM), methanol (MeOH), and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) were of analytical grade and were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).

As shown in Figure 1A-B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>, DCM and MeOH extracts exhibited significant dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cell lines compared to the untreated control cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). However, no growth inhibition was observed following treatment with n-hexane extract. Furthermore, DCM extract inhibited the growth of cancer cells more powerfully than did the MeOH extract (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Considering all IC<sub>50</sub> values reported in Table 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2">(Tab. 2)</xref>, MCF-7 cells were more sensitive to growth inhibitory effects of DCM and MeOH extracts compared with WEHI-164 cells at all tested time points. Interestingly, DCM and MeOH extracts revealed little cytotoxicity toward normal cell line HUVEC (IC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003e; 400 &#x000b5;g/mL) (Figure 1C<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). Microscopic cell count using a hemocytometer showed a remarkable decrease in the number of viable MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells following exposure to DCM and MeOH extracts (Figure 2A-B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>). In addition, paclitaxel decreased the viability of MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells to 59.2 % &#x000b1; 0.4 and 83.5 % &#x000b1; 0.7 in comparison to the control cells, respectively (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of S. amplexicaulis extracts on the induction of apoptosis</title><p>To investigate whether DCM and MeOH extracts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>exhibit cytotoxicity due to apoptosis or necrosis, we used cell death detection ELISA kit. After 24 h of treatment with 48-h IC<sub>50 </sub>concentrations of DCM extract, the apoptosis rate significantly increased from 3.8 % and 2.9 % in the control cells to 53.5 % and 40.7 % in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) (Figure 3A-B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). When the cells were treated with 48-h IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of MeOH extract for 24 h, the percentages of apoptosis were 35.2 % and 25.5 % in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells, respectively (Figure 3A-B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). However, DCM and MeOH extracts did not show any apoptotic or necrotic death in HUVEC normal cells (data not shown). Notably, our results implied that DCM extract induced a higher rate of apoptosis than that of MeOH extract in both cancer cell lines, particularly MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, TUNEL assay was performed to identify the presence of DNA fragmentation and confirm the induction of apoptosis in cells treated with DCM and MeOH extracts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic>. As illustrated in Figure 4A-B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref>, the cells displayed dark brown stained nuclei following exposure to DCM and MeOH extracts, whereas no visible coloration was detected in the untreated control cells. We further examined the expression level of PARP cleavage in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells by Western blotting. Upon treatment with DCM and MeOH extract for 24 h, the expression of cleaved PARP was detected in both cancer cell lines (Figure 5<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">(Fig. 5)</xref>). Overall, the results indicated that the cytotoxicity of DCM and MeOH extracts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> against MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells is mainly mediated by apoptosis induction.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of S. amplexicaulis extracts on the mRNA expression of apoptotic-associated genes</title><p>In order to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of apoptotic-associated genes including p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and Bcl-2 in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells, qRT-PCR was carried out. As shown in Figure 6A-B<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">(Fig. 6)</xref>, treatment with 48-h IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of DCM extract for 24 h led to significant enhancement in the mRNA expression levels of p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax 3.2, 3.6, 4.5, and 5.6 fold in MCF-7 cells and 2.1, 2.5, 3.2, and 3.9 fold in WEHI-164 cells, respectively, when compared with the control cells (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Besides that, MeoH extract treatment could significantly increase the mRNA levels of p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax 2.0, 2.3, 2.9, and 4.3-fold in MCF-7 cells and 1.6, 1.7, 2.0, and 2.2-fold in WEHI-164 cells. In contrast, the expression level of Bcl-2 mRNA significantly decreased by about 6.8 and 2.1-fold in MCF-7 cells and 1.8 and 1.4-fold in WEHI-164 cells treated with DCM and MeOH extracts, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). These results are in line with our previous findings demonstrating a more alteration in the mRNA expression levels of the apoptotic-associated genes for MCF-7 cells treated with DCM extract compared to all other groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The results obtained herein suggest that DCM and MeOH extracts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> can induce apoptosis in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells through the mitochondrial pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Over the last few years, medicinal plant-based therapeutics have gained great attention in the treatment of cancer as they are more cost effective, natural, readily available and exhibit fewer undesirable side effects. In addition, the potential of plant-derived compounds to induce cellular apoptosis constitute a key event in anticancer activities of medicinal plants (Desai et al., 2008[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; Maqsood et al., 2018[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; Ahmed et al., 2019[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Herein, we performed a pilot study to firstly examine the cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of various extracts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> on cancer cell lines MCF-7, WEHI-164 and normal cell line HUVEC. The results demonstrated that DCM and MeOH extracts dose- and time-dependently inhibited the growth of MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells with little harmful effects on normal HUVEC cells, which highlight the selective cytotoxicity of these extracts. Furthermore, n-hexane extract did not show any inhibitory effects against cancer and normal cells. It is also worth mentioning that DCM extract exerted a cytotoxic activity more superior to that of MeOH extract at all tested time points. Thus, it could be concluded that high level of bioactive compounds of<italic> S. amplexicaulis</italic> may be in DCM extract. The other <italic>Scrophularia </italic>species such as <italic>Scrophularia atropatana</italic>, <italic>Scrophularia oxysepala</italic>, and <italic>Scrophularia frigida</italic> have also been reported to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells generally in a time- and dose- dependent way (Valiyari et al., 2013[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; Goldar et al., 2016[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; Safarzadeh et al., 2017[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]).</p><p>Cell death detection ELISA uncovered a remarkable apoptosis induction in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells following exposure with DCM and MeOH extracts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic>. Notably, the rate of apoptosis induced by DCM extract was much stronger than that caused by MeOH extract. Apoptotic DNA fragmentation detected by TUNEL assay also confirmed the results obtained from the ELSA. On the other hand, Western blot analysis exhibited that there was PARP cleavage in the cells treated with DCM and MeOH extracts. The nuclear enzyme PARP appears to be implicated in a variety of biological processes such as DNA repair, maintenance of genomic integrity and apoptosis. It is a 113 kDa protein that is cleaved by activated caspase-3 into two fragments of 89 and 24 kDa. This cleavage is considered as an important hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis (Agarwal et al., 2009[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Pham et al., 2016[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). These results are in line with the cytotoxicity data indicating <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> extracts as reliable apoptotic triggers.</p><p>Accumulated evidence demonstrated that p53 is a vital tumor suppressor gene that promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. p53 can specifically activate expression of pro-apoptotic gene Bax and repress anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 (Al-Fatlawi et al., 2015[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; Mitupatum et al., 2016[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; Messeha et al., 2019[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). The Bax gene product localizes to the mitochondria, mediates the permeabilization of the outer membrane, and enhances the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, which leads to activation of caspase cascade gene and subsequent apoptosis (Pe&#x000f1;a-Blanco and Garc&#x000ed;a-S&#x000e1;ez, 2018[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; Xiong et al., 2014[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; Gheda et al., 2018[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). In contrast, Bcl-2 gene encodes a protein that prevents apoptosis by binding and antagonizing with Bax (Al-Fatlawi et al., 2015[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Caspases belong to a large family of cysteine proteases that play crucial roles during the apoptotic process. Caspase 9 as an initiator caspase is involved in the activation of the executioner caspase-3 and the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of apoptosis (Palai and Mishra, 2015[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; Kalkhoran et al., 2017[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). In the current study, we observed that treatment of cancer cells with DCM and MeOH extracts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> led to a decrease in the mRNA expression levels of Bcl-2 and increases in p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax. These results suggest that <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> extracts can induce apoptosis through mitochondria mediated signaling pathway. Nevertheless, further investigations are needed to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptotic activity of S<italic>. amplexicaulis</italic> extracts.</p><p>A remarkable number of anticancer compounds that have been commercially available in the market are derived from medicinal plants. Some cytotoxic compounds have been derived from the <italic>Scrophularia</italic> genus such as iridoid diglycoside, flavonoids, alkaloids, sugar esters and phenylpropanoid glycosides. Iridoid glycosides and their hydrolyzed compounds have exhibited anticancer properties against myeloid leukemia K562, gastric carcinoma MNK-45, and cervical carcinoma Hela cell lines. According to the phytochemical investigation, iridoid and phenylalkanoid glycosides have been identified in <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> and we presume that the cytotoxic activity of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> may be attributed to the presence of these compounds; however, they should be explored in further studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our preliminary findings demonstrate that DCM and MeOH extracts of <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> are able to selectively kill cancer cells through induction of apoptosis in a mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. As a result, <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>medicinal plant can be considered as a promising chemotherapeutic candidate for extraction of anticancer components.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the financial support of Immunology Research Center of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>We declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
