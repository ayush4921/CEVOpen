 <italic>Scrophularia</italic> is regarded as one of the large genera of the family Scrophulariaceae. This family comprises about 3000 species and 220 genera which are widely distributed in mountainous regions of the world, especially in Asia and North America (Giessrigl et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; Pasdaran and Hamedi, 2017[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Since ancient times, diffrent 
 <italic>Scrophularia</italic> species have been used in traditional medicines to treat fever, wounds, erythema, eczema, psoriasis, inflammatory diseases, mouth dryness, goiter, constipation, fistula and infectious diseases (Stevenson et al., 2002[
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; Park et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Apart from these activities, anticancer properties of different extracts from several 
 <italic>Scrophularia </italic>species against various cancer models have been reported in the literature (Orangi et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]; Pasdaran and Hamedi, 2017[
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). Phenylpropanoid glycosides and iridoids are the main chemical compounds of 
 <italic>Scrophularia</italic> genus which can lead to aforementioned therapeutic effects (de Santos Galíndez et al., 2002[
