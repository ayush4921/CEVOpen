<p>To investigate whether DCM and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>exhibit cytotoxicity due to apoptosis or necrosis, we used cell death detection ELISA kit. After 24 h of treatment with 48-h IC
 <sub>50 </sub>concentrations of DCM extract, the apoptosis rate significantly increased from 3.8 % and 2.9 % in the control cells to 53.5 % and 40.7 % in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells, respectively (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (Figure 3A-B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). When the cells were treated with 48-h IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of MeOH extract for 24 h, the percentages of apoptosis were 35.2 % and 25.5 % in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells, respectively (Figure 3A-B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">(Fig. 3)</xref>). However, DCM and MeOH extracts did not show any apoptotic or necrotic death in HUVEC normal cells (data not shown). Notably, our results implied that DCM extract induced a higher rate of apoptosis than that of MeOH extract in both cancer cell lines, particularly MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, TUNEL assay was performed to identify the presence of DNA fragmentation and confirm the induction of apoptosis in cells treated with DCM and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic>. As illustrated in Figure 4A-B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">(Fig. 4)</xref>, the cells displayed dark brown stained nuclei following exposure to DCM and MeOH extracts, whereas no visible coloration was detected in the untreated control cells. We further examined the expression level of PARP cleavage in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells by Western blotting. Upon treatment with DCM and MeOH extract for 24 h, the expression of cleaved PARP was detected in both cancer cell lines (Figure 5
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">(Fig. 5)</xref>). Overall, the results indicated that the cytotoxicity of DCM and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> against MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells is mainly mediated by apoptosis induction.
