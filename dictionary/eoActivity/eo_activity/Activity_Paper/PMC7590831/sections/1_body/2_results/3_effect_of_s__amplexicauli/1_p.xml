<p>In order to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of apoptotic-associated genes including p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and Bcl-2 in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells, qRT-PCR was carried out. As shown in Figure 6A-B
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">(Fig. 6)</xref>, treatment with 48-h IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentrations of DCM extract for 24 h led to significant enhancement in the mRNA expression levels of p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax 3.2, 3.6, 4.5, and 5.6 fold in MCF-7 cells and 2.1, 2.5, 3.2, and 3.9 fold in WEHI-164 cells, respectively, when compared with the control cells (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Besides that, MeoH extract treatment could significantly increase the mRNA levels of p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax 2.0, 2.3, 2.9, and 4.3-fold in MCF-7 cells and 1.6, 1.7, 2.0, and 2.2-fold in WEHI-164 cells. In contrast, the expression level of Bcl-2 mRNA significantly decreased by about 6.8 and 2.1-fold in MCF-7 cells and 1.8 and 1.4-fold in WEHI-164 cells treated with DCM and MeOH extracts, respectively (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). These results are in line with our previous findings demonstrating a more alteration in the mRNA expression levels of the apoptotic-associated genes for MCF-7 cells treated with DCM extract compared to all other groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The results obtained herein suggest that DCM and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis</italic> can induce apoptosis in MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cells through the mitochondrial pathway.
