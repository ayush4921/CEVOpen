<p>Apoptosis and necrosis was assessed by Cell Death Detection ELISA
 <sup>plus</sup> kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were cultured at a density of 1×10
 <sup>4 </sup>cells/well into 96-well plates for 24 h at 37 °C and then treated with DCM and MeOH extracts of 
 <italic>S. amplexicaulis </italic>at their 48-h IC
 <sub>50</sub> (50 % inhibitory concentration) concentrations for 24 h. Untreated cells were used as a negative control. Thereafter, the cells were trypsinized, centrifuged (1500 rpm for 5 min), the supernatants and lysates were collected and transferred into the microtiter plates coated with anti-histone antibody. After 90 min of incubation, the plates were rinsed three times with washing buffer, anti-DNA antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were added and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT). Then, the plates were washed again and incubated with peroxidase substrate for 20 min at RT. The final absorbance at 405 nm was determined by a microplate ELISA reader (BioTeck, Germany).
