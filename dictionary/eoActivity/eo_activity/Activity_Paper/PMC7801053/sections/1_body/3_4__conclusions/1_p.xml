<p>From the CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>-soluble extract of the stems of 
 <italic>S. caudata</italic>, two new diarylalkanoids were isolated together with five known compounds. Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were found to possess potent tyrosinase inhibitory activity with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.033 and 0.11 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively. Binding interaction analyses between the 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-tyrosinase active site and the active compounds (
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>) have been performed. Plausible biogenetic pathways for formation of two new diarylalkanoids (
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>) were also proposed.
