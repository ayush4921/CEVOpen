<p>Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, and 
 <bold>8</bold> showed an H-donor interaction between a hydroxy group and a peroxide bridge PER404, presenting the distances of 1.85, 1.88, and 1.78 Å, respectively, whereas kojic acid showed the interactions with a Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion, HIS194, and THR203 residues (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the binding pocket, compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold> showed more interactions with targeting residues than those of 
 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These analysis results were consistent with their experimental inhibitory activities (
 <bold>8</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>1</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>2</bold>). The C-2 hydroxy group of 
 <bold>1</bold> exhibited H-bonding interactions with ASN191 and GLY183 residues. Moreover, the aromatic ring A of 
 <bold>1</bold> formed 
 <italic>π-π</italic> T-shaped and 
 <italic>π-σ</italic> interactions with TRP184 and ILE42 residues, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> showed an H-acceptor interaction between C=O group and ASN188 residue. In addition, the aromatic ring B of 
 <bold>2</bold> interacted with HIS194 residue via a 
 <italic>π-π</italic> stacking interaction. Thus, the 
 <italic>S</italic> values and these interactions suggested that 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> showed high binding affinity for 
 <italic>oxy</italic>-tyrosinase than those of kojic acid. Hypoxanthine showed the lower negative 
 <italic>S</italic> value and the longer-distance interactions than that of kojic acid. Apparently, these results could be used to validate the abovementioned docking procedure in this study.
