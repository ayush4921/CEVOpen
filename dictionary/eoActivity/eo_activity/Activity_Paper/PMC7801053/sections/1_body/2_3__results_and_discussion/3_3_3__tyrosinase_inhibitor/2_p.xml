<p>The presence of 
 <italic>α</italic>,
 <italic>β</italic>-unsaturated hydroxycarbonyl groups in cinnamic acid derivatives were found to enhance activity (

 <bold>3</bold>). Additionally, the occurrence of a C-3 methoxy group decreased the inhibitory activity (

 <bold>5</bold>) [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Diarylalkanoids with 2,4-disubstituted resorcinol subunit on ring B contributed the most to inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, the length of the conjugated carbon chain in diarylalkanoids led to a change of activity (

 <italic>β</italic>-phenyl-
 <italic>α</italic>,
 <italic>β</italic>-unsaturated carbonyl scaffold plays an important role for tyrosinase inhibition [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In previous reports, diarylpentanoids such as diarylpentadiene-3-one were not significantly inhibiting tyrosinase activity [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], but some analogues showed moderate antimelanogenesis activity [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Some cyclic diarylheptanoids were found to have melanogenesis-inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this regard, semedienone (

 <bold>2</bold>) could be the potent structural templates for developing new skin-lightening agents.
