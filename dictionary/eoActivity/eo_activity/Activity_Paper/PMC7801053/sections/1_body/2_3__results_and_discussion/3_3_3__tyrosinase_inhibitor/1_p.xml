<p>Compounds (
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>7</bold>) were tested for their tyrosinase inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Kojic acid, a purported skin-lightening agent, was used as a positive control. 2,4,2′,4′-Tetrahydroxychalcone (
 <bold>8</bold>), which was synthesized following our previous procedure [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], showed potent activity with an IC

 <bold>1</bold>) and semetrienone (
 <bold>2</bold>) exhibited remarkable inhibitory effect with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.033 and 0.11 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively, more potent than that of kojic acid (IC

 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> were found to possess tyrosinase inhibitory activity with the IC
