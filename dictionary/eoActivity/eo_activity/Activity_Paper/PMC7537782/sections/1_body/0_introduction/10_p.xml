<p id="Par12">Due to the absence of conventional therapies, Yang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>) reported that more than 85% of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in China were treated with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). During the 2002 to 2003 outbreak, TCM was also used as a supplementary treatment of severe laboratory-confirmed conditions of SARS (Hsu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2006a</xref>). Along this trajectory, the aim of the current review is to provide an update on the bioactivity functions of medicinal plants and other natural products that have previously been used to treat coronaviruses. In the short term, knowledge of these natural products may be significant in the relief of COVID-19 symptoms. In the long term, natural products that alleviate COVID-19 symptoms may be used in the search for novel drugs against SARS-CoV-2. In the face of current challenges to the treatment of COVID-19, data presented in this review may help to reimagine a new future where natural products are the new frontier for more efficacious and low-cost SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. The goal is to create a strong bioprospecting pipeline from which pharmaceutical companies can advance the discovery and repurposing of COVID-19 drugs from current medicinal plants and other natural products.
