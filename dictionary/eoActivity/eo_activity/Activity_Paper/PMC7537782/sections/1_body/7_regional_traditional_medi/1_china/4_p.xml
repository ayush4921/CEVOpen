<p id="Par51">Roots and rhizomes of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic>, a natural sweetener that contains glycyrrhizin, inhibit virus growth and inactivate virus particles. Glycyrrhizic acid, a major triterpene glycoside isolated from 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza</italic> species, has activity against several enveloped viruses including SARS-CoV and HIV (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2013</xref>). Diammonium glycyrrhizinate, extracted and purified from 
 <italic>G. uralensis</italic>, inhibited SARS-CoVs (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2016</xref>). Ho et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>) found that two widely used TCM plants in the family Polygonaceae inhibited the interaction of SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2; the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for extracts of the root tubers of 
 <italic>Rheum officinale</italic> Baill. and the root tubers/vines of 
 <italic>Polygonum multiflorum</italic> ranged from 1 to 10 μ/ml (Ho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>). Chen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>) stated that the mortality of COVID-19 patients in China was markedly reduced because of effective combination therapy of TCM and Western medicines. At least 20 patent TCMs were recommended by government guidelines in the treatment of COVID-19 patients in China (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>). Several TCM plant formulae for treating SARS-CoV and COVID-19 were reported by Yang et al. (
