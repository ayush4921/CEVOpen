<p id="Par55">Chiow et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) conducted 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> virus neutralization assays where an ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> and three of its constituent flavonoids were tested on murine coronavirus. With no cytotoxicity, the EA fraction of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic>, added before the viral adsorption stage, inhibited murine coronavirus (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.98 μg/ml) (Chiow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). The flavonoid quercetin weakly inhibited murine coronavirus with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 125 μg/ml, cytotoxicity CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 116.50 μg/ml, and selectivity index of 0.93. The EA fraction and quercetin yielded a long-lasting anti-murine coronavirus effect of up to 6 days. Overall, this study demonstrated that the EA fraction of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> and its flavonoid component, quercetin, neutralizes murine coronavirus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (Chiow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>).
