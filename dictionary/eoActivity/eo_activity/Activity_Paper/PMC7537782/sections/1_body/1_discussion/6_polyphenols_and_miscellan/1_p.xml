<p id="Par25">Many natural polyphenols, with antioxidant properties, possess antiviral activity and some of them, for example, myricetin (
 <bold>7</bold>), an inhibitor of coronavirus helicase nsP13 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.71 μM), are already being used against coronaviruses (Semwal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2016</xref>; Yu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2012</xref>). Naturally occurring flavonoids such as quercetin, naringin, hesperetin, and catechin, the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet, are usually found in fruit and vegetables as glycosides and sometimes as acylglycosides. Luteolin and quercetin can interfere with adsorption of the virus to its host cells. It was hypothesized that specific flavonoids, such as quercetin, hesperetin, and myricetin (
 <bold>7</bold>) and their glycosylated derivatives, may play an effective role in inhibiting SARS-CoV entry into host cells, specifically by binding with high affinity to the spike protein, helicase, and protease sites on the ACE receptor (Ngwa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2020</xref>), in addition to acting against fatty acid synthase (Wen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2011</xref>). Extracted from TCM herbal formulae used to treat SARS, the following active polyphenols inhibited various steps during SARS-CoV entry and replication: baicalin, emodin, epigallocatechin, gallate, gallocatechin gallate, herbacetin, isobavaschalcone, kaempferol derivatives, luteolin, myricetin, quercetin, 3-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, scutellarein, and tetra-

 <sc>d</sc>-glucose (Yang et al.
