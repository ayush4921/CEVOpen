<p id="Par21">Saikosaponins represent a group of oleanane derivatives, usually as glucosides, found in medicinal plants in the genera 
 <italic>Bupleurum</italic> L., 
 <italic>Heteromorpha</italic> Cham. &amp; Schltdl., and 
 <italic>Scrophularia</italic> L. (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>). Saikosaponins A, B
 <sub>2</sub>, C, and D demonstrated anti-HCoV-229E activity at concentrations of 0.25–25 μM, with the strongest activity being noted for saikosaponin B
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <bold>4</bold>) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1.7 ± 0.1 μM) (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>). Since saikosaponin B
 <sub>2</sub> blocks HCoV-229E attachment and penetration, it could be a novel lead for the development of a potential chemo-preventive agent for SARS-CoV infection (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>). Yang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>) reported that saikosaponins and glycyrrhizin from 
 <italic>Toona sinensis</italic> (Juss.) M.Roem. had potent anti-SARS-CoV effects by inhibition of viral cellular entry, adsorption, and penetration.
