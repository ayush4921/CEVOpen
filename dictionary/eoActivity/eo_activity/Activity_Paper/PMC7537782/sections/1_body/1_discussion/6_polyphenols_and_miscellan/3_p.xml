<p id="Par26">Quercetin (
 <bold>8</bold>) is an aglycone present at high concentration in onions. This compound has virucidal activity against enveloped viruses such as mengovirus, herpes simplex, parainfluenza type 3, pseudorabies, respiratory syncytial, and Sindbis viruses (Choi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). Quercetin is able to inhibit H
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase of lysosomal membrane and thus prevents virus coat removal and blocks viral replication and competitively inhibits SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 42.79 ± 4.97 μM (Chen et al.
