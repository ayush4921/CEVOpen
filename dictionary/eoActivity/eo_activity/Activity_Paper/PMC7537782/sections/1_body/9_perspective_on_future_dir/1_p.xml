<p id="Par61">Empirical data on SARS-CoV treatments are scarce (Wong and Yuen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2008</xref>), and the majority of viral diseases do not have targeted drugs or vaccines (Mahapatra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2019</xref>). Although the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic should remind scientists that current options for treating life-threatening zoonotic coronavirus infections are very limited (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2020</xref>), medicinal plants offer a strong pipeline for the discovery of novel lead compounds that can be converted into new drugs to treat COVID-19. Medicinal plants hold great promise for drug development against SARS-CoV-2, but there is paucity of research on the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs from natural products. In addition, most of the data on natural products with activity against HCoVs are from non-clinical and pre-clinical studies (Islam et al.
