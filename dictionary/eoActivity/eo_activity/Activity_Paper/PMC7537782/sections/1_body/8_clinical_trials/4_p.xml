However, the trial evidence was not sufficient enough due to the lack of methodological rigour. In a review of 90 peer-reviewed Chinese publications after the SARS epidemic of 2002/2003, Leung (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2008</xref>) urged a re-run of clinical trials involving TCM for the treatment of SARS because the validity of results was jeopardized by questionable trial designs and experimental biases. TCM should be evaluated in carefully designed clinical trials, either used alone or integrated with Western medicine, to cover the prevention and treatment of patients suffering from COVID-19 pneumonia (Ling
