<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the normal rats treated with AECe (250 mg/kg) did not affect the liver weight and liver index compared with those of the normal control rats, indicating that the dose of AECe may have no liver toxicity in rats. After CCl
 <sub>4</sub> administration, the liver weight and liver index significantly increased in rats (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), indicating serious hepatomegaly that was markedly suppressed by a dose of AECe (250 mg/kg) and silymarin (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001
