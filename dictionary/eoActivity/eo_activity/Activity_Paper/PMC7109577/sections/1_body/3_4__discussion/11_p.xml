<p>Antiproliferative activity of plants may be attributed to the presence of alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, and polyacetylenes [

 <italic>Caralluma</italic> species suggested the presence of glycosides and saponins [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Saponins are natural compounds that have several pharmacological activities like antiproliferative properties [
