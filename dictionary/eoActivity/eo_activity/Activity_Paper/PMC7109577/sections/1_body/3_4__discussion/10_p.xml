<p>Potential antiproliferative and anticancer activities of some species of Caralluma were reported in many earlier research works. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Caralluma acutangula</italic> exhibited effects with concentrations varying between 0 and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on MCF-7 (breast cancer) and HEPG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Caralluma acutangula</italic> possess an interesting antiproliferative activity on HeLa (cervix cancer), MCF7 (breast cancer), and HEPG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma) cells [
