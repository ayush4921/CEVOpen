<p>The obtained molecular docking interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01089-f005">Figure 5</xref>) of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> methanolic extract into the active site of the human progesterone enzyme were in good agreement with those reported by Acharya et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In fact, these authors demonstrated that furanocoumarins, xanthotoxol, bergapten, angelicin, psoralen, and imperatonin are potent anti-breast cancer agents against progesterone. These molecules were buried into the active site of the human progesterone enzyme via the following molecular interactions: LEU718, GLN725, MET 759, LEU763, ARG766, PHE778 (xanthotoxol), GLN725, LEU721, LEU718, MET756, MET759, LEU763, ARG766, PHE778, MET801(bergapten), LEU718, LEU721, GLY722, GLN725, MET759, LEU763, LEU763, ARG766, PHE778 (angelicin), LEU718, LEU721, GLN725, MET756, MET759, LEU763, ARG766, PHE778, MET801 (psoralen) and LEU718, LEU721, GLY722, GLN725, MET756, LEU763, ARG768, PHE778, LEU797, MET801, and LEU887 (imperatonin).
