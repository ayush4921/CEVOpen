<p>Our molecular docking results with antioxidant human peroxiredoxin 5 were perfectly correlated with those of Eze et al. [
 <xref rid="B105-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>], confirming the same and highest binding pose of 1-(phenylsulphonyl)-N-propylpyrrolidine-2-carboxamide in the binding cavity of human peroxiredoxin 5 with a binding energy of (−13.86 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) and interactions with THR44, PRO40, PRO 45, GLY46, ARG127, THR147, and CYS A47 residues. Similarly, α-tocopherol (−7.2 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> essential oil was perfectly fitted into the cavity of peroxiredoxin 5 establishing H-bonding with Arg 127(A) and non-covalent interactions with ASP A113, THR A147, LEU A116, SER A115, LEU A112, PRO A40, THR A44, GLY A46, CYS A47, PHE A120, and ASP A145. Additionally, caryophyllene oxide (−7.1 kcal mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) from the same essential oil was interacting with non-covalent interactions with PRO A40, THR A147, THR A44, PHE A120, PRO A45, LEU A116, and ILE A119 with amino of peroxiredoxin 5 amino acids residues, confirming therefore the high potency
