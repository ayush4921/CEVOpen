<p>The antioxidants of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> extracts have been widely studied [

 <xref rid="B75-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. For instance, using DPPH and β-carotene/linoleic acid assays, respectively, the petroleum ether (IC50 = 73.2; 9.2 µg/mL), chloroform (IC50 = 85.4; 5.1 µg/mL), methanol (IC50 = 20.1; 25.8 µg/mL), and water (IC50 = 40.6; 19.2 µg/mL) extracts of this plant which were collected from Kerman (Iran) showed strong antioxidant activity compared to our findings [

 <italic>T. polium</italic>, collected from Israel, was evaluated for its antioxidant potentiality using various tests [
 <xref rid="B76-antioxidants-09-01089" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. It inhibited superoxide radical (IC50 = 12.0 µg/mL), hydroxyl radical (IC50 = 66.0 µg/mL), β-carotene (inhibition percentage IP = 60% at 100µg/mL), iron-induced lipid peroxidation (IC50 = 7.0µg/mL), 2,20-azobis (2-amidinopropan) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced plasma oxidation (IP = 84% at 667µg/mL). It had also the capacity to bind iron (IC50 = 79.0 µg/mL). At 1 mg/mL, this aqueous extract had the ability to increase intracellular GSH (glutathione) levels in cultured HepG2 cells [

 <italic>T. polium</italic>, collected from Iran, was determined for its in vivo antiradical activity using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical (78.6 and 90.7%), total antioxidant power (23.6 and 37.5%), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (24.7 and 31.8%) in serum at 50 and 100 mg/kg, respectively [
