<p>Our study showed the strong antioxidant capacity of the methanolic extract. This activity could not be related to the total phenolic, (0.072 mg GAE/g extract), flavonoid (0.725 mg QE/g extract), or tannin contents (0,239 mg TAE/g extract), and the extract was analyzed by HR-LCMS in order to identify the major active compounds (
