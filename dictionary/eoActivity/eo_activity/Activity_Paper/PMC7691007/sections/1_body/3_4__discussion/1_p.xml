<p>The multiple biological activities and traditional use of

 <italic>capitata</italic> make this plant a good candidate for the preparation of a multiusage phytomedicine, especially against diabetes and oxidative stress, one of the factors that play a great role in the pathogenesis of diabetes [

However, for this to be effective, it is important to define the minimum conditions of its collection and preparation to guarantee its effectiveness at all times. This action goes through standardization to fulfill some basic requirements to guarantee phytomedicine efficacy, safety, and reproducibility. In this light, we studied some parameters that could influence the antidiabetic and antioxidant properties, the extraction yield, and the chemical profile of

 <italic>capitata</italic> extracts, including the nature of the extraction solvent, the host plant, and the phenological stage of
