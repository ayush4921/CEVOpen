<p>Five known compounds were isolated and characterized in ethyl acetate extracts, and this is described in the Supplementary material. The other aspect of chemical characterization of different extracts comprised total phenol (TPC), total flavonoids (TFC), total flavonols (TfnC), and total tannin content (TTC) determinations. For this purpose, a stock solution of each plant extract was prepared at a concentration of 4â€‰mg/mL in DMSO 1%. Prior to this, the ethyl acetate extract that showed the best antioxidant activity was submitted to HPLC for compound identification.</p>
