<p>The extracts and standard phenolic compounds were prepared at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in acetonitrile (HPLC grade). Each solution was then diluted to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and then filtered with a syringe filter (Corning, 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m) to obtain the solutions to be analyzed. The mixture of standards phenolic compounds was prepared immediately, and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of mixture solution was injected into HPLC to get the profile of standard. After column cleaning, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each plant extract was then injected into the HPLC system to determine its chemical profile. The proportion of gallic acid, quercetin, rutin, and tannic acid in the ethyl acetate plant extracts was determined by comparing the peak area (AUC) of the compound identified in the profile of the extract to its area in the profile of the standard [
