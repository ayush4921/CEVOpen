<p>Extraction yields varied with the solvents used for extraction, the host plant type, and the phenological stage of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Using methanol as the extracting solvent gave significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) yields compared to using either ethanol, water, ethyl acetate, or hexane, the latter giving the lowest yields. The extraction yield of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> harvested on 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mannii</italic> was overall significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) during flowering for an extraction solvent except with hexane. On the other hand, the extraction yield of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic> from 
 <italic>P. americana</italic> host was not significantly influenced by the phenological stage of 
 <italic>P. capitata</italic>.
