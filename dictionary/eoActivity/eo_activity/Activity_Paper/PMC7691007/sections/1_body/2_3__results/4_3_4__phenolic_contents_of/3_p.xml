<p>The solvents that enabled better extraction of total flavonols were, in the ascending order, ethyl acetate, methanol, and ethanol regardless of the phenological stage or the host plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(c)</xref>). For these three solvents, the flavonol contents increased significantly during flowering and even more during fruiting. Hexane was the solvent which extracted the flavonols the least, and for this solvent, the contents obtained were not influenced by the phenological stage and even less by the host plant. Overall, the water-extracted amounts of flavonols were practically comparable to ethanol, even though these quantities decreased significantly during fruiting. On the three hosts, the solvents behaved in the same way at all the phenological stages.
