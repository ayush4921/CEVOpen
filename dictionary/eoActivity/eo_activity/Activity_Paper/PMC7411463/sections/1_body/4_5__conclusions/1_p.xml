<p>To our knowledge, this is the first review to summarize the therapeutic activities and pharmacological mechanisms of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and its four active constituents, namely, 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-elemene, germacrone, ar-turmerone, and bisacurone, in experimental models that mimic hepatobiliary diseases. This review presents available evidence regarding 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> and may facilitate its use in the clinic to treat hepatobiliary diseases. However, several limitations exist regarding its use. First, its chemical compounds differ according to the cultivation area, harvest time, and the extraction method. Second, because its four ingredients are essential oils obtained from steam distillation, they have low solubility and poor absorption after ingestion like curcuminoids [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, based on this review, more efforts can be dedicated to broadening the range of clinical application of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> for treating different hepatobiliary diseases, such as the separation of its active ingredients with high bioavailability and efficacy, its standardization, and the establishment of optimal extraction conditions to maximize its effects.
