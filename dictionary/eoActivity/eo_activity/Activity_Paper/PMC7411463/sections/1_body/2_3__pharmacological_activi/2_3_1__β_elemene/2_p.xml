<p>In addition to anticancer effects, 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene exerted anti-inflammatory effects by downregulating hepatic CD14 expression and suppressing serum TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and endotoxin in CCl4-induced rats [

 <italic>β</italic>-Elemene lowered the serum AST and ALT levels in rats with CCl4-induced liver damage [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene decreased dendrites and increased the vesicular structure of LX-2 cells, thereby reducing liver fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic>β</italic>-elemene injection was found to lower hepatic collagen deposition in CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced rats, which might be caused by the reduction in serum angiotensin-II level and hepatic angiotensin-II type 1 receptor mRNA level [
