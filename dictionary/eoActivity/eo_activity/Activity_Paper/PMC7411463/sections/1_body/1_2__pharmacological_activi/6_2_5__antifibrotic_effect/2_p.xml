<p>First, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> was found to reduce the amount of collagen, which was accumulated in the liver tissue. The hot water extract of the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> inhibited the excessive accumulation of alpha-1 type I collagen and the sirus-red positive area in the liver of mice fed an MCD diet [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Second, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> enhanced the expression of enzymes promoting collagen degradation in the liver tissue by inhibiting tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP)-1, which blocks the activity of matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Third, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> could markedly suppress hepatic alpha-smooth muscle actin (
 <italic>α</italic>-SMA), a specific protein marker of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) contributing to the progression of liver cirrhosis [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The antifibrotic activities of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> may be exhibited via two molecular mechanisms—the blockade of transforming growth factor-
 <italic>β</italic> (TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>) signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and the induction of apoptosis of HSCs [
