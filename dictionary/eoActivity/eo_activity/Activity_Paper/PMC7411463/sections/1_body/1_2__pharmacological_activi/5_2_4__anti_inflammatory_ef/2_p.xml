<p>The anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> were mainly elucidated by a significant reduction in hepatic and serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), which was elevated by drugs [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], ethanol [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], MCD diet [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and TAA [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> markedly decreased the hepatic interleukin-6 (IL-6) value in C57BL/6 mice administered alcohol [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and an MCD diet [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which are models that demonstrate the important role of IL-6 in the development of alcoholic or nonalcoholic fatty liver into cirrhosis or cancer [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> improved the major hallmark of the inflammation-associated histological findings, such as periportal inflammatory cell infiltration [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], hepatic vascular congestion [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], F4/80-positive macrophages [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and mononuclear cellular infiltration [
