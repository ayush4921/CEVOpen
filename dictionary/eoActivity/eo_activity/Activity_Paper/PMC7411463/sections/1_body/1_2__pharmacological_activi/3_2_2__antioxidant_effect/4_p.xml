<p>Altogether, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> might exhibit strong antioxidant activities against the precursors, causing oxidative stress in the liver, such as chemicals, carcinogens, alcohol, drugs, pesticides, heavy metals, and iron, and two molecular mechanisms can be involved in its action. First, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> could markedly prevent and inhibit the overproduction of free radicals and lipid peroxides in the hepatic and gall bladder tissue by mediating a significant amount of CYP2E1 expression. CYP2E1 often generates reactive oxygen species, such as the superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide, and it is frequently activated in chronic liver diseases [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Hence, further studies focusing on the antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> via the regulation of intrahepatic CYP2E1 must be implemented to enable the use of this herb to treat hepatobiliary diseases. Second, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> exhibited some strengths in increasing the amount of antioxidant materials, and one of the underlying mechanisms might be the transcriptional regulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) targets. The rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> increased intrahepatic Nrf2 levels in a dose-dependent manner against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced injury. Additionally, antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD and CAT, were upregulated. Its efficacy to remove free radicals and lower lipid peroxidation is comparable to that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and vitamin C [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], respectively. Moreover, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> lowered the intrahepatic accumulation of lipid peroxides and activated the antioxidant defense system without causing toxicity in normal Wistar rats [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Hence, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> might be employed to manage different hepatobiliary diseases owing to its antioxidant activities.
