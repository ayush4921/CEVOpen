<p>Hence, 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> reduced collagen accumulation, accelerated the decomposition of the ECM, and inhibited the activity of proteins involved in the progression of liver cirrhosis. In addition, the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> shortened the prolonged prothrombin time in TAA-induced SD rats [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> against liver cirrhosis and its complications, such as delayed coagulation, should be investigated in further research. Regarding TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signaling suppression and proapoptosis of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> against hepatic fibrogenesis, PPAR-
 <italic>γ</italic> activation can hinder binding to TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> and induce apoptosis of HSCs. Such findings suggest that 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> could act as a PPAR-
 <italic>γ</italic> agonist in the treatment of hepatobiliary diseases.
