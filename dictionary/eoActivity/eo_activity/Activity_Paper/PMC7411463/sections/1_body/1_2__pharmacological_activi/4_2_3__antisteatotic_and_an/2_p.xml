<p>The antisteatotic effects of

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], high-fructose diet [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and high-fat diet [

 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> decreased the levels of TG contents, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the liver tissue, and hepatic histological findings by Oil Red O staining were consistently improved. Regarding the antisteatotic effects of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, its water extract at 250°C impeded the uptake of fatty acids into the liver by suppressing the mRNA expression of CD36 and fatty acid transport protein (FATP) in C57BL/6 mice. In addition, it inhibited intrahepatic lipid synthesis via the regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and acetyl CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC) mRNA levels. Furthermore, it promoted lipolysis partially through the regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-
 <italic>α</italic> (PPAR-
 <italic>α</italic>), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) mRNA levels [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Particularly, the rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> facilitated the secretion of lipids from the liver into blood via the increase in hepatic PDI [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and betaine [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] expression in male SD rats.
