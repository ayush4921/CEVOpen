    "Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a famous medicinal plant with its dried roots having been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal for more than 2000 years. Although its genome sequence has previously been published and molecular biology methods have been used to study this species, no suitable internal reference genes have been investigated for standardization of gene expression via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Here, the stabilities of 10 candidate reference genes, ACT11, ACT7, α-TUB, β-TUB, GAPDH, UBC, RPL, SAM, HSP70, and PP2A, were analyzed by four different procedures of GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Their expression stabilities were evaluated under various conditions, including different tissue types (root, stem, leaf, and flower), hormone stimuli treatments (methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid), and abiotic stresses (heavy metal, salt, drought, cold, and wounding). The results indicated that β-TUB was the most stable gene for all tested samples, while ACT11 was the most unstable. The most stable reference gene was not consistent under different conditions. β-TUB exhibited the highest stability for different tissue types and abiotic stresses, while for hormone stimuli treatments, ACT7 showed the highest stability. To confirm the applicability of suitable reference genes, we selected to SbF6H and SbF8H as target genes to analyze their expression levels in different tissues. This study helps to the accurate quantification of the relative expression levels of interest genes in S. baicalensis via qRT-PCR analysis."
