<p id="Par19">To verify the results of GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper software, we also used Reffinder tool to generate a comprehensive ranking. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> was the most stable reference gene for all samples, while 
 <italic>ACT11</italic> was identified as the most unstable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). When considering different tissues and abiotic stress treatments, 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> was confirmed as the most appropriate gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>) were confirmed as the least stable, respectively. For hormone treatments, 
 <italic>ACT7</italic> was regarded as the most appropriate reference gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>).
