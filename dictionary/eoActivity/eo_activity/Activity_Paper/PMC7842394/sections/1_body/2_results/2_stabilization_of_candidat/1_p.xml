<p id="Par15">The samples were further divided into three groups according to various tissues, hormone treatments (MeJA, SA, and ABA), and abiotic stresses (heavy metal, salt, drought, cold, and wounding). Based on the 
 <italic>M</italic> value, GeNorm identified 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> as the most stable reference gene for all samples, while 
 <italic>ACT11</italic> was identified as the most unstable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). When considering different tissues and abiotic stress treatments, 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> was confirmed as the most appropriate gene, while 
 <italic>α-TUB</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) and 
 <italic>ACT11</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) were confirmed as the least stable for different tissues and abiotic stress treatments, respectively. For hormone treatments, 
 <italic>ACT7</italic> was regarded as the most appropriate reference gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d).
