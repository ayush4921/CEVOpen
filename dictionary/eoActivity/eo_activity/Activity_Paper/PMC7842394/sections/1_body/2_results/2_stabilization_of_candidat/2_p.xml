<p id="Par16">Additionally, we applied the average pairwise variation (Vn/Vn + 1) to determine the number of reference gene for normalization of qRT-PCR in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>. Among our three experimental sets, the V
 <sub>2/3</sub> values were all below the cut-off threshold value of 0.15 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which showed that the top two highest-ranked genes were adequate for standardization of qRT-PCR in each experimental set. For the total samples, V
 <sub>2/3</sub> was 0.158. We ascertained that a combination of three genes (
 <italic>β-TUB</italic>, 
 <italic>UBC</italic>, and 
 <italic>SAM</italic>) was necessary for normalization because V
 <sub>3/4</sub> was lower than 0.15 (Fig.
