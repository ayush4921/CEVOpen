 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, as an important medicinal plant, has attracted the attention of many researchers. With the development of genome sequencing, whole genome information for 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> is now available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], providing the basis for molecular biology research of the species. An appropriate reference gene is the prerequisite for credible results of qRT-PCR, which is usually the preferred method for gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, the selection of suitable reference genes in diverse experimental conditions had not been reported previously.
