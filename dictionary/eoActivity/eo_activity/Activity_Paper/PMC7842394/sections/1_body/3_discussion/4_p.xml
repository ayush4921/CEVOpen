<p id="Par24">Although 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> is an extremely stable reference gene in some species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], it is unstable in species such as 
 <italic>C. pilosula</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], soybean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and 
 <italic>Raphanus sativus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Here, we found that 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> was the most stable among the 10 candidate reference genes in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>UBC</italic> and 
 <italic>SAM</italic>. 
 <italic>UBC</italic>, which encodes a protein-modifying enzyme that arises in a multi-step reaction, is used as a reference gene in 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and 
 <italic>Cocos nucifera</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. 
 <italic>SAM</italic>, which encodes a key enzyme for the plant synthesis of polyamines, is used as a reference gene in 
 <italic>Sinobambusa tootsik</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Homologous genes, which show similar structures and functions, are often used as reference genes for gene transcription analysis. Take 
 <italic>Fortunella crassifolia</italic>, for example, in which the homologous actin genes (
 <italic>ACT6</italic>, 
 <italic>ACT8</italic>, and 
 <italic>ACT7</italic>) have all been selected as suitable internal control genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The expression of homologous 
 <italic>EF1As</italic> (
 <italic>EF1A2a</italic>, 
 <italic>EF1A2b</italic>, and 
 <italic>EF1A1a1</italic>) are the most stable in 
 <italic>Glycine max</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Nevertheless, our results indicated that the homologous tubulin genes (
 <italic>α-TUB</italic> and 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic>) exhibit completely different expression levels and stabilities. For hormone treatments, 
 <italic>ACT7</italic> was regarded as the most stable reference gene, while 
 <italic>ACT11</italic> was the least stable (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Table 3). Therefore, homologous genes with similar sequences, structures, and functions may have quite different expression levels and stabilities.
