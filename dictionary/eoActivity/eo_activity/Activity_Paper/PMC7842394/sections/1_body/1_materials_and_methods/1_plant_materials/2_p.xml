<p id="Par7">For hormone stimuli treatments, the seedlings in uniform growth state were spritzed with 100 μM MeJA, 100 μM abscisic acid (ABA), or 200 μM salicylic acid (SA), while the control seedlings received only water. For heavy metal and salt stress, the seedlings were watered with 1 mM CrCL (Cr), 200 μM CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> (Cu), or 100 mM NaCl (Na). Wounding treatment involved cutting approximately 50% of the stem and leaf surfaces with a surgical knife. Seedling samples were collected 12 h after hormone, heavy metal, salt, and wounding treatments. For drought stress, the seedlings were imposed by withholding water for 10 days. For cold shock treatment, the seedlings were cultivated in pots at 4 °C for 24 h. Samples of different tissues were taken from one-year-old plants at the flowering stage in the experimental field. All samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen at once and preserved at −80 °C before RNA extraction.
