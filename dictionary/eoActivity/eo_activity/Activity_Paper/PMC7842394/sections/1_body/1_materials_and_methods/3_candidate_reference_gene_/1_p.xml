<p id="Par9">Based on the transcriptome sequences of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> root, stem, leaf, and flower, 10 internal reference genes that are commonly used in other plant species and extensively expressed in different tissues were chosen as candidate internal reference genes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The candidate reference genes were 
 <italic>ACT11</italic>, 
 <italic>ACT7</italic>, 
 <italic>α-TUB</italic>, 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic>, 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic>, 
 <italic>UBC</italic>, 
 <italic>protein phosphatase 2A</italic> (
 <italic>PP2A</italic>), 
 <italic>ribosomal protein L</italic> (
 <italic>RPL</italic>), 
 <italic>S-adenosyl methionine</italic> (
 <italic>SAM</italic>), and 
 <italic>heat shock protein 70</italic> (
 <italic>HSP70</italic>). To confirm the dependability of the proposed reference genes, a BLAST search was conducted for the coding sequences of the 10 candidate genes against the TAIR database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>). The sequence with the highest homology with 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was identified and presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Based on the unique sequence (Supplementary Table 1), Primer Premier software was used to design specific primers for all genes, with annealing temperatures (Tm) of the primers ranging from 57.9 °C to 61.0 °C, an amplicon length of 112–299 bp, and a primer length of 18–24 bp. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists the depiction of candidate reference genes, primer pairs, and qRT-PCR amplification effectiveness. In addition, the specificity of primers was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and melt-curve analysis.
