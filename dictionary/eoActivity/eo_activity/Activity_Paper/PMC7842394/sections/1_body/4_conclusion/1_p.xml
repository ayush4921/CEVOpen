<p id="Par26">In summary, four statistical methods, including GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comprehensive tool RefFinder, were applied to assess the expression stabilities of 10 candidate reference genes in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> in diverse experimental conditions, including different tissue types (root, stem, leaf, and flower), hormone stimuli treatments (MeJA, SA, and ABA), and abiotic stresses (heavy metal, salt, drought, cold, and wounding). 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic> is the optimum reference gene for different tissues, abiotic stress treatments, and all samples, while 
 <italic>ACT7</italic> is most stable for hormone treatments. In total samples, 
 <italic>β-TUB</italic>, 
 <italic>UBC</italic>, and 
 <italic>PP2A</italic> were the top three most stable reference genes, while 
 <italic>ACT11</italic> was the most unstable gene, followed by 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic>. The selection and confirmation of appropriate reference genes provides a basis for the accurate quantification of relative transcription levels of genes of interest in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> via qRT-PCR analysis.
