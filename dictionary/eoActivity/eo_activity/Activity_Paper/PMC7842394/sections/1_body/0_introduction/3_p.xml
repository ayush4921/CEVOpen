 <italic>β-tubulin</italic> (

 <italic>UBC</italic>) are traditional housekeeping genes and have been often applied as reference genes, which are commonly expressed in all species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, the transcription levels of some housekeeping genes may be unstable under various experimental conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. When inappropriate reference genes are applied for qRT-PCR normalization, a serious deviation or opposite conclusion in gene expression analysis may occur [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Selection and verification of suitable reference genes for qRT-PCR have been studied in quite a few plant species. The results indicate that the most stable reference genes may differ for different species, and the relatively stable genes differ under different experimental conditions. For example, 
 <italic>ACT</italic>, 
 <italic>TUB</italic>, and 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> are the optimum reference genes ascertained so far in 
 <italic>Apium graveolens</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], 
 <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and 
 <italic>Codonopsis pilosula</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], respectively. In 
 <italic>C. pilosula</italic>, 
 <italic>F-box</italic>, 
 <italic>CACS</italic>, 
 <italic>APT1</italic>, and 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> are the most appropriate reference genes for different tissues, different developmental phases, NaCl stress, and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) stimuli, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Consequently, reference genes appropriate for qRT-PCR standardization should be investigated under various experimental conditions for specific species. However, a systematic evaluation of optimum reference genes for qRT-PCR standardization in 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> has not yet been undertaken.
