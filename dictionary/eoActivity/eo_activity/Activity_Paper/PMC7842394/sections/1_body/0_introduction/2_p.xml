<p id="Par3">Gene expression levels in plant different tissues along with the abiotic stress tolerance are exceedingly meaningful for understanding the potential functions of the gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The techniques for detecting gene expression levels were include Northern blotting, microarray, RNase protection analysis, and qRT-PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Amongst these, qRT-PCR is a simple and accurate method with strong specificity, repeatability and sensitivity, and has been widely used for evaluating the transcription level of interest gene [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Although qRT-PCR is a powerful technology, many factors, such as RNA purity, RNA content, PCR amplification efficiency (
 <italic>E</italic>) and reverse transcription efficiency, can affect the results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. To eliminate the effects of these factors, one or several reliable reference genes should be used for correction. In different tissues and under different treatments, the transcription levels of ideal reference genes should be unaffected or show the minimal amplitude changes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, for accurate quantification, selecting suitable reference genes are of great significance and necessity for qRT-PCR analysis.
