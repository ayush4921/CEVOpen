<p>2, 6-dichloroindophenol (DCIP) method (Hameed et al. 2005) was followed for measurement of ascorbic acid which measures reduced Vitamin C only. In short, each molecule of ascorbic acid converts a DCIP molecule into a reduced 2, 6-dichloroindophenol (DCIPH2) and this conversion can be recorded as reduced absorption at 520 nm. The calibration curve was drawn with the help of known series of ascorbic acid concentrations. Ascorbate concentration in unknown sample was found by calculating simple linear regression equation.</p>
