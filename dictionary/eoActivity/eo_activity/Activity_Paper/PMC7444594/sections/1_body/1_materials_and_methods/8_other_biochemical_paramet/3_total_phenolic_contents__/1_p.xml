<p>A micro colorimetric assay was used to measure TPC, by using Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) reagent [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] with some modifications.0.05 g sample was kept in 95% methanol in dark for 48 hours. After 48 hours, the supernatant was taken. 150 Î¼l FC reagent (10%) and 1.2 ml sodium carbonate (700 mM) were added to it. Place this mixture at room temperature for one hour and took reading at 765 nm. Linear regression equation was calculated by using a standard curve of gallic acid at different concentrations. To measure tannin (0.1g) PVPP was added in the above prepared sample, vortexed vigorously and centrifuged again at 14000 g. the absorbance was measured at 765 nm.
