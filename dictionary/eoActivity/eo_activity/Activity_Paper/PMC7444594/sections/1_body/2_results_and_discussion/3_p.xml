<p>The antioxidant enzyme catalase is present in all animal tissues with its highest activities in liver and red blood cells which defend the tissues from highly reactive hydroxyl radicals by decomposing hydrogen peroxide. Decrease amount of catalase causes numerous damages due to hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical assimilation [
