 <italic>Zygophyllum</italic> Linn., with about 90 species, grows mainly between Northern Africa and Central Asia particularly in arid and semiarid areas. 
 <italic>Zygophyllum</italic> species have been phytochemically studied leading to the identification of various classes of compounds including triterpenes, flavonoids, saponins, sterols, simple phenolic compounds, and esters [
 <xref rid="pone.0231612.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The main chemical constituents described from 
 <italic>Zygophyllum</italic> species are zygophyllin, quinovic acid, and glycosides, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antipyretic activity [

 <italic>simplex</italic> L. is an annual, succulent halophyte plant, it was found that it belongs to genus 
 <italic>Tetraena</italic>, a sister to genus 
 <italic>Zygophyllum</italic> and recently reassigned to such genus and could be referred as 
 <italic>Tetraena simplex</italic> (L.) Beier &amp; Thulin (syn.
