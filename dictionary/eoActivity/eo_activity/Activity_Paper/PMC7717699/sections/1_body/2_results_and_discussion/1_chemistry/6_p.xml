<p>Mono-alkylation of 2-arylethanol derivatives 
 <bold>14a–g</bold> was accomplished using an excess of 1,6-dibromohexane under basic conditions (NaH) in general from excellent to quantitative yields (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>) to give 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>. Alkylation on the endocyclic nitrogen atom of 
 <bold>6</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>) was more complicated than previously anticipated. Nucleophilic displacement of 
 <bold>6</bold> on the terminal bromine atom of 
 <bold>7a–g</bold> accomplished derivatives 
 <bold>9a–g</bold> in moderate yields (46‒68%). Final deprotection using standard hydrogenolysis conditions furnished derivatives 
 <bold>11a–g</bold> in moderate to quantitative yields.
