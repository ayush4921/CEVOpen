<p>For accessing compounds

 <italic>O</italic>-benzylated 1-DNJ 
 <bold>6</bold>, which was accessed in a 5-step linear pathway (36% overall yield), following the procedure reported in the literature
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>42</sup>
 </xref>, starting from commercially-available methyl α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside 
 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>). Such procedure involves fully 
 <italic>O</italic>-protection, acidic hydrolysis of the glycoside moiety, reduction of the masked aldehyde of 
 <bold>3</bold>, Swern oxidation
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>43</sup>
 </xref>, and fast reductive amination of transient unstable dicarbonyl compound 
 <bold>5</bold>; the last step consists of a double reductive amination (DRA), a cascade reaction that provides a straightforward methodology for accessing polyhydroxylated piperidines

  <sup>44</sup>
 </xref>. Base-promoted 
 <italic>N</italic>-alkylation with bromoderivatives 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold>, and deprotection by hydrogenolysis, furnished compounds 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold>, respectively, with the substitution pattern depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>. We hypothesised that the presence of one or two methoxy groups could resemble the dimethoxy arene-based fragment of the indanone moiety in donepezil, and thus, might enable interaction with the PAS region of cholinesterases. Moreover, the use of a 
 <italic>o</italic>-dihydroxyphenyl ring (catechol moiety) could afford relevant antioxidant properties
