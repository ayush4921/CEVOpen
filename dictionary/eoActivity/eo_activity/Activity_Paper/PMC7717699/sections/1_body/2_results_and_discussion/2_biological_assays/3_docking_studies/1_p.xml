<p>Docking calculations predict that compound 
 <bold>11e</bold> forms a complex with AChE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). The iminosugar moiety establishes H-bond interactions with Trp86 and Glu202 at the cationic anionic subsite (CAS). Additionally, the aromatic ring moiety is involved in Ï€ stacking interactions with Trp286 at the peripheral anionic subsite (PAS). The aromatic ring also participates in van der Waals interactions with several residues at the peripheral anionic subsite.
