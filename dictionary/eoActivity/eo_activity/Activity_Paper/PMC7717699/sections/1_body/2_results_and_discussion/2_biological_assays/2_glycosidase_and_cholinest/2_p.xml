 </xref>. 
 <italic>p</italic>-Nitrophenyl glycosides (
 <italic>o-</italic> for β-galactosidases) were used as model substrates, and the release of the corresponding 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenolates at pH 6.8 was monitored spectrophotometrically (
 <italic>λ</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> = 400 or 420 nm for 
 <italic>p</italic>- or 
 <italic>o</italic>-nitrophenolates, respectively).
