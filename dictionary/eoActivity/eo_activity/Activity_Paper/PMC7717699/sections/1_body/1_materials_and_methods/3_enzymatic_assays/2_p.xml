 </xref>. Each set of experiments is prepared in PS cuvettes using 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and the corresponding 
 <italic>o</italic>- or 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl glycopyranosides as substrates. Reactions were monitored at 25 °C by following the formation of the corresponding nitrophenolates at 400 nm (glucosidases and α-galactosidase) or 420 nm (β-galactosidases) over a time of 125 s.
