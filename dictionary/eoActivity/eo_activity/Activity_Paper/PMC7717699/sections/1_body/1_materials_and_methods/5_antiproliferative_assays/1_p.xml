<p>We selected the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and the fibroblast cell line BJ-hTERT to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of the compounds. The tests were performed in 96-well plates using the SRB assay

 </xref> with the following specifications. Cell seeding densities were 5000 cells/well for SH-SY5Y and 7000 cells/well for BJ-hTERT. Drug incubation times were 48â€‰h. The optical density of each well was measured at 530 (primary) and 620 (secondary) nm. The antiproliferative activity expressed as 50% growth inhibition (GI
 <sub>50</sub>), was calculated according to NCI formulas
