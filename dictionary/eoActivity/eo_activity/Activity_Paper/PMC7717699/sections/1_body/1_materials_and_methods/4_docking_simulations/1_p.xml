<p>Interactions of cholinesterases with the compounds were analysed by computational docking using MOE software (Chemical Computing Group). Crystallographic structures of human AChE and human BuChE was obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB code 4EY6 and 4AQD, respectively). Protein structures was energetically minimised using Amber10 force field with EHT parameters for small molecules, R-field solvation model, dielectric constant of 1 for the protein interior and 80 for the exterior. Ligand structure was drawn in MOE software, and its energy was minimised with the above parameters using as stop criterion an RMS gradient lower than 0.01 kcal/mol/Å. For the docking calculations: in the placement stage we used the Triangle Matcher algorithm with the London dG scoring scheme. In the refinement stage, we kept the receptor rigid and used the GBVI/WSA dG scoring scheme. 2D diagrams were obtained from MOE software and 3D illustrations were obtained using Pymol software.</p>
