<p id="Par37">Several epidemiological studies in vitro and animal studies have claimed that galangin and the consumption of galangin-containing foods may affect several diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]. Galangin has a broad range of biological properties, including anti-oxidative and free radical scavenging, modulating enzyme activities, suppressing chemical genotoxicity, inhibitory effects on various microbes, the control of hypertension, diabetes, and chemoprevention of several cancers anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activities in various disorders [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. Galangin attenuated in vitro and in vivo airway remodeling by inhibiting TGF-β1-mediated ROS generation and MAPK/Akt phosphorylation in asthma; also, galangin improved ovalbumin (OVA)-induced airway inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB pathway, which reduced eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia. In addition, galangin reduced expression of iNOS, VCAM-1, TNFα induced p65 nuclear translocation, expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), eotaxin, and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) levels in lung tissue [

In fact, protective effects of galangin were associated with inhibition of NF-κB and upregulation of heme oxygenase (HO)-1. Similarly, galangin exerted profound anti-asthmatic property by activating PPARγ, which resulted in galangin alleviating airway inflammation in murine model of asthma. [
