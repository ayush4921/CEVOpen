<p id="Par17">Luteolin, like some other flavonoid compounds exerts several pharmacological activities, immuno-modulating, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-oxidant, anti-allergic and neuroprotective activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Luteolin suppressed LPS-elicited inflammatory events in mouse alveolar macrophages including COX2, the secretion of the pro-inflammatory agents, TNF-α, IL-6 and iNOS and ROS production was blocked by repressing NF-κB and AP-1 activation pathways, suggesting a possible therapeutic application of luteolin for treating lung inflammatory disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. A protection mechanism of luteolin against acute lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice was suggested by Akt/NFκB inhibition pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Similar mechanism of luteion protection activity against lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury and respiratory burst involved inhibition of MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways was suggested in neutrophils [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Moreover, luteolin inhibited Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation by repressing the immediate-early genes Zta (Zp) and Rta (Rp) and also inhibited Sp1-luc activity in the virus promoters, suggesting luteolin is a potential dietary compound for prevention of virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Furthermore, luteolin has been found to be a potent antifibrotic activity as it inhibits lung inflammation and suppresses of myofibroblast differentiation as well as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Anti-asthmatic activity of luteolin was also reported in experimental mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. In addition, two small molecules, tetra-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl-β-d-glucose (TGG) and luteolin, were identified, whose anti-SARS-CoV activities were confirmed using a wild-type SARS-CoV infection system. Both TGG and luteolin showed at the same concentration levels to effectively inhibit the entry of HIV-luc/SARS pseudo typed virus into its host, which suggests a potential clinical use of these two molecules as anti-SARS drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Consequently, luteolin could be selected as an alternative treatment or body immunity enhancer against COVID‐19 infection due to its strong anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties during infection.
