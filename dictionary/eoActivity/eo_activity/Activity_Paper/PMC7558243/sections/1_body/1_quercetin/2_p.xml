<p id="Par4">Quercetin and its glycosylated (quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-D-glucuronide) forms represent 60–75% of flavonoid intake [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and it has been found ubiquitously in many fruits and vegetables including apples, berries, brassica vegetables, capers, grapes, red onions, shallots, kale, green tea, cranberries, broccoli, tomatoes, nuts, flowers, barks, leaves and honey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Quercetin has been known for its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] as well as its exceptional ability to improve mental and physical activities and decrease infection risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In fact, quercetin is considered as a strong anti-oxidant due to its ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation and thus it protects many body organs from harmful effects of the consequential free radicals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, the general mechanism by which quercetin exerts its anti-inflammatory effects is believed to be due to its ability to restrain COX-2 and iNOS, NF-κB, activator protein-1 (AP-1), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) usually, associated with the inflammatory response during infections. Subsequently, inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory markers and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1: MCP-1, lipoxygenase: LOX) and thus enhancing the anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL10 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, a study demonstrated that both quercetin and quercitrin could inhibit LPS-induced macrophage inflammation and oxidative stress by experiment and theoretical calculations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Quercetin blocks in vitro TNFα-mediated inflammation which prevents TNF-α from directly activating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), c-Jun, and NF-κB, which are well known potent inducers of inflammatory gene expression and protein secretion. Quercetin can also indirectly inhibit the inflammatory process by increasing peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor c (PPARγ) which is antagonized NF-kB and AP-1 thus inhibiting the inflammatory cascades and subsequently decreases the expression of the inflammatory genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Quercetin has also beneficial immuno-stimulatory effects by inducing the expression of several vital genes and the production of Th-1 derived IFN-γ and down-regulating Th-2 derived interleukin 4 (IL-4). In fact, quercetin is seen as a universal suppressor of the accumulation and activation of immune cells, which prevents chronic inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Quercetin relaxes airway smooth muscle and potentiates β-agonist-induced relaxation via dual phosphodiesterase inhibition of purified phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase (CPLCβ) and phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor (PDE4) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Quercetin has exerted strong anti-pathogenic effects against several causal agents of upper respiratory tract infection in vitro studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Quercetin inverted lung fibrosing in mice and reversed the disease progression normally caused by usual pulmonary aging markers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moreover, it was found to reduce the reactive oxygenated species (ROS) produced during viral infection and subsequently decrease pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-8, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and increases anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], indicating that it has clear antiviral effects on several respiratory and common cold viruses through its ability to reduce virus imputation, replication and viral load in vitro, as well as lung inflammation and airways hyper-responsiveness in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Quercetin was found to be a strong inhibitor of influenza A virus in the early stage of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and demonstrated significant inhibitory activities against dengue virus type-2 but the mechanisms of how quercetin exerts its antiviral effects are not fully understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Quercetin prevented rhinovirus-induced progression of lung disease in mice with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Quercetin-3-β-galactoside, a quercetin derivate, was found to inhibit in vitro a protease essential for viral replication of SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and to block the enzymatic activity of MERS‐CoV 3CLpro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Moreover, quercetin has been reported to inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] from the same family as COVID-19. Therefore, these properties of quercetin could render it a favorable natural compound to be exploited in the medicinal field due chiefly to its strong antioxidant properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].
