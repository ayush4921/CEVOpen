<p id="Par33">Hesperetin and its metabolites display several biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid decreasing levels, anticarcinogenic, antidiabetic, immunoregulatory, and neuroprotective [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. Actually, several in vitro and in vivo studies have been reported that Hesperetin, its metabolites, and its synthetic derivatives augmented the antioxidant cellular defenses such as the ERK/Nrf2 signaling pathway and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), reduced inflammatory targets including NF-κB, iNOS, and COX-2, and other markers of chronic inflammation such as IL-1β, IL-6, NO and TNF-α [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>]. Hesperetin has been shown a potential drug for acute lung injury (ALI) induced in vivo by lipopolysaccharide by downregulated the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and suppressed NF-κB activation in lung tissue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. Hespertein plus naringenin has a protective capacity against lung fibrosis by reducing airway inflammation in murine chronic asthma model. In addition, the anti-fibrotic effects of hespertein have been indicated in the liver and kidney [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. Hespertin exerted inhibitory effect on the intracellular replication of transmitted Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and exhibits drug-like properties which maybe a potential as a therapeutic option for CHIKV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. Moreover, hesperetin has shown an antiviral activity against the human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) trough binding to M2-1 virus protein, which is an important transcriptional anti-termination factor and a potential target for viral replication inhibitor development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. Among several compounds that exhibit an in vitro activity against SARS-CoV, hesperetin, was the most selective with a selectivity index of ∼300. Hesperetin dose-dependently suppressed the cleavage activity of the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV in cell-free and cell-based assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study has reported that hesperetin has the potential to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the same host receptor of SARS-CoV and thus block infection with SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Therefore, these studies clearly suggest that hesperetin could play a key role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and related pneumonia.
