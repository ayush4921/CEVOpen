<p id="Par7">Several studies have indicated the role of catchins in preventing infectious diseases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A study has also shown that consuming green tea supplements twice daily for 3Â months resulted in a significant decrease in cold or influenza symptoms by approximately 23%. Moreover, green tea consumption per day or per week was in reverse to the instance numbers of influenza A or B among school children in Japan [

Catechins as the major content of green tea may be a potential treatment of COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus that is nominated as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 especially, the breath shortens and other symptoms related to this emerging virus infection.
