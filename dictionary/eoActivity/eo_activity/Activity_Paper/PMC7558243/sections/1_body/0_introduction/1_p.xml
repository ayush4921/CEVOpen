<p id="Par2">Since the first unveiling of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China in late December 2019, exceptional and unprecedented dares presented by the rapidly rising of COVID-19 pandemic health crisis are confronting people worldwide. COVID-19, a single-stranded RNA virus is actually complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a newly identified virus alike SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-2 that cause the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The main symptoms of COVID-19 comprise fever, dry cough, difficulty in breathing, fatigue, mild dyspnoea, sore throat, headache, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal problems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Initially, the pathogen strikes the respiratory tract particularly, the lower respiratory part, leading to a severe lung injury at all ages, subsequently in elderly people and those immuno-compromised individuals in particular, it may lead to a severe pneumonia associated with a systemic and strong inflammation implicated in airway damages, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and subsequently, multi-organ failure and cause fatality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. During SARS-CoV-2 infection, the viral immune response is divided into two main phases: incubation (non-severe stages), and massive destruction (severe stages). In the first phase, a specific adaptive immune response is vital to remove the virus and prevents the initiation of the second phase of virus infection from commencing. Therefore, good general health and appropriate genetic background of the host is crucial for the development of an endogenous protective immune response at the incubation and non-severe stages that produces specific antiviral immunity. However, in the case of an impaired immune response (second phase), virus will spread and massive destruction of the affected tissues will occur, followed by an induced innate inflammation in lungs mediated by pro-inflammatory macrophages, granulocytes, generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6 and IP-10, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 such as MIP1α, MIP1β and MCP1. These inflammatory molecules attract monocytes, macrophages and T cells to the site of infection, promoting further inflammation creating overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which ultimately damage the lung structure and then the resulting cytokine storm enters the circulation system and reaches other organs, leading to a multi-organ damage [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Actually, data indicated that activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB transcription factor (NF-κB) signaling pathway represents a major contribution to the inflammation induced post SARS-CoV infection and that NF-κB inhibitors are promising antiviral drugs against infections caused by the virus and potentially other pathogenic human coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this regards, several clinical trials based mainly on anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory drugs and other therapies are conducted to find a possible COVID-19 treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to world health organization (WHO), appropriate nutrition and well-balanced diet are vital to be healthier with stronger immune systems and lower risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases. Since, the human immune response has often been shown to be weakened by insufficient nutrition in several model systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, nutrition intervention and therapy need to be considered as an integral part of the approach to patient’s victim of COVID-19 infection especially among the general health workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In fact, several epidemiological studies have repeatedly shown an inverse association between the risk of chronic human diseases and the consumption of polyphenolic rich diet [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In fact, polyphenols, essential micronutrients in human diet, constitute one of the most numerous and ubiquitous group with more than 8000 polyphenolic compounds identified in the plant kingdom. In the past decades, polyphenols (phenolic acids, flavonoids, stilbenes, and lignans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] have been intensively studied due to their countless benefits for human health particularly, their strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory proprieties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Moreover, the newly emerging diseases such as the novel COVID-19 and other infectious diseases that impose grand burden on both human health and economy worldwide, require urgent research for a novel antiviral drug preferably from a natural origin such as polyphenols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The polyphenols antiviral effect is due to the interactions between the phenyl rings and viral proteins and/or RNA, or via their capacity to interfere with the host cell defense by regulating MAP kinase signaling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the antiviral effect of polyphenols is not significantly affected by viral mutations due to their binding capacity to the viral envelope lipids or sugar moieties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. These enormous features of polyphenols as a natural economical, simple and environmental friendly compounds warrant the birth of this review that highlights the current state of knowledge regarding the most important polyphenolic compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], their relative importance, their general properties in human health focusing principally on their antiviral activities, and their role in enhancing immunity in order to face the emergence of several infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and its related symptoms.
