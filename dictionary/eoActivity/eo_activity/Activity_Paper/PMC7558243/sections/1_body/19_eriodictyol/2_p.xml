<p id="Par41">Eriodictyol is also detected in some plants of the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family, such as peppermint (
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic>), oregano (
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>), and thyme (
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>) and it is ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables, including tomatoes, mint, grapefruit, oranges, and lemons as well as in several medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Bauhinia ungulata</italic>, 
 <italic>Arcytophyllum thymifolium</italic>, 
 <italic>Elsholtzia bodinieri</italic>, and 
 <italic>Clinopodium chinense</italic> [

Several studies have revealed that eriodictyol possesses several bioactivities, including anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, antimicrobial, anticancer, protective effects on the neurons, kidneys, and lungs, insulin secretagogue and antidiabetic properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies have shown that eriodictyol exerts its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects through Akt/NF-κB-related signaling pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>]. Eriodictyol has immunomodulatory effects, comprising inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by blockage of NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of p38, MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1 and 2), JNK and COX-2 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>]. Moreover, a study demonstrated that eriodictyol could alleviate the LPS-induced lung injury in mice by regulating the Nrf2 pathway and inhibiting the expression of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β and MIP-2, suggesting that eriodictyol may be used as a drug for the treatment of LPS-induced lung injury. In addition, its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative capacities have drained attention to its therapeutic potential, especially, for asthma and treating colds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>]. A recent study has reported that (2S)-eriodictyol 7-
 <italic>O</italic>-(6″-
 <italic>O</italic>-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, aneriodictyol derivative, ranked as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys-145 and His-41) of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>]. A recent docking study has ranked Eriodictyol among other compounds to be tested experimentally as an inhibitor of ACE2 receptor of COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>]. These studies suggested that natural products such as Eriodictyol may prove more useful candidates for COVID-19 drug therapy.
