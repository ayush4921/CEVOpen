<p id="Par54">Although pharmacy students are not full-rate health care specialists, it is reasonable to study their awareness level and attitude towards the use of cannabis for medical purposes. Since cannabis and cannabinoids are prohibited for medical and scientific purposes in Ukraine, the issues on their therapeutical properties, the endocannabinoid system and others are not considered in curricula and programs to prepare degree-seeking pharmacy students. Therefore, pharmacy practitioners’ awareness respecting this problem is likely to be at the same level as that of students. Besides, the survey included students who mostly study in their final year at the university, they have already had their internship in pharmacies, in accordance with the standards of Specialist (Master) of Pharmacy program. Some part-time students have experience of working in pharmacies. Senior students, who already got the knowledge in physiology, pharmacognosy, pharmacology, etc., consider it important to include materials on cannabis and endocannabinoid system’s properties, and their specific medical use into the educational program. It is doubtless that general population and sampling frame selected for the research cannot provide the appropriate evaluation of awareness and attitude level to legalization of cannabis and cannabinoids for medicine. However, this allow obtaining useful data for holistic approach concerning development of the perspective CBMP market in Ukraine, with the purpose of providing patients with effective pharmaceutical care.</p>
