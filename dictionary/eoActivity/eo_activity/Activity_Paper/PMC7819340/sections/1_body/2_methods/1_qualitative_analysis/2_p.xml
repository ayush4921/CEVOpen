<p id="Par50">Stakeholder analysis is based on the process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative information. It will allow identifying and evaluating the expectations, purposes, interests of stakeholders and predicting their possible actions. Kammi Schmeer noted that stakeholder analysis “allows policymakers and managers to interact more effectively with key stakeholders and to increase support for a given policy or program” (Schmeer

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2000</xref>), if this analysis is conducted before a policy or a program is implemented, policymakers and responsible executives (managers) “can detect and act to prevent potential misunderstandings and/or opposition to the policy or program”. To identify key stakeholders, a stakeholder power-interest grid was used (Eden and Ackerman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1998</xref>). According to this grid, stakeholders can be divided into four groups (players, context setter, subjects and crowd) depending on the level of their interests and power. In this paper, the expectations and interests of key stakeholders were analyzed, and their actions after legalization of medical cannabis were predicted.
