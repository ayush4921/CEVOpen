<p id="Par53">It should be observed that the majority of pharmacy students at the Bogomolets National Medical University study part-time to obtain a degree of Specialist (Master) of Pharmacy which directly influences the sample structure. These degrees are practically identical in Ukraine, as a Master’s degree in Pharmacy had been introduced comparatively recently with the purpose of harmonization of national educational standards to international ones. Some students already have higher education (in economics, medicine, biology, philology, etc.), 15.4% of students have already received the specialized secondary education in medicine, and 20% have got the same in pharmacy (a Junior Specialist’s degree). In fact, a Junior Specialist’s degree can be considered as a Bachelor’s degree. In this connection, the majority of students, who already have the specialized secondary education in pharmacy, actually work in pharmacies and receive their higher education part-time (mostly, these are second-year students). Some of the students entered part-time study after graduating from secondary school, and the rest are the full-time students.</p>
