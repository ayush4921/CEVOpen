<p id="Par120">To improve the quality of life and health of patients suffering from various diseases, it is vital to consider the issue of legalization of cannabis and cannabinoids for medical and scientific purposes, as it has already been done in many countries worldwide. However, to provide adequate conditions for developing these products market and consequently its physical and economic availability for patients, it is advisable to apply a complex approach to study this situation. In this view, we have studied the present accessibility of medical cannabis for patients in the USSR and former USSR countries such as Lithuania, Georgia, Estonia, Russian Federation, and Ukraine. We conducted a survey among pharmacy students to evaluate the anticipation of the future healthcare professionals in Ukraine about cannabis legalization for medical purposes and its adequate use to improve the quality of life and health of patients. So, according to the survey results, the vast majority of respondents demonstrate a positive attitude towards legalization of medical cannabis. At the same time, slightly less than half of the students are practically not informed about the therapeutic properties of these products. Nearly 90% of students think that educational materials on cannabis and cannabinoids use for medical purposes should be included in training programs. They should also include risks and advantages of such application, functioning of endocannabinoid system etc. Using a holistic approach, we performed the stakeholder and SWOT analysis to provide recommendations for an adequate supply of medical cannabis for the patients in Ukraine. It reveals the existing legal framework and regulation mechanisms, compliance with stakeholdersâ€™ interests and expectations, as well as formation of value orientations in society speaking.</p>
