<p id="Par45">The usage of CBMP will enable satisfying partially the need for pain-relieving preparations, considering a low availability rate of opioid analgesics in Ukraine. According to the analysis of International Narcotics Control Board data, the intake of narcotic opioid analgesics (fentanyl, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone, and pethidine) in Ukraine had dropped nearly 30% during 2014–2016, compared to that of 2004–2006: from 93 to 66 daily doses for statistical purposes (s-DDD) per 1.000.000 inhabitants. Ukraine takes the lowest positions among European countries in this matter, taking into consideration that opioid use in many western countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, USA) exceeds 10.000 s-DDD per 1.000.000 inhabitants (Bosetti et al.
