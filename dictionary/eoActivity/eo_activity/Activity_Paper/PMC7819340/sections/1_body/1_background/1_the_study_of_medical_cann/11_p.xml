<p id="Par41">It is worth summarizing that patients access to medical cannabis preparations is still limited in ex-USSR countries, despite the legislation liberalization all over the world. Baltic countries (Lithuania, Estonia), being the EU members, take a more active position. The decriminalization of cannabis use in Georgia also testifies to democratic initiatives and actions to observe human rights. At the same time, in other countries of the former Soviet Union, including the Russian Federation, cannabis is under absolute prohibition, both for medical, recreational purposes and for scientific research. Legislation liberalization in these countries is likely to happen only after changes are introduced into the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971), in line with recommendations suggested at the 41st Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) meeting.</p>
