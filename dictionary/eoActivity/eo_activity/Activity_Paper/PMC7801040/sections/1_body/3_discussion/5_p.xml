<p>MDA is the aldehyde byproduct of ROS and indirectly reflects the degree of oxidative damage to the liver and endothelial cells. SOD is the only enzyme that employs oxygen free radicals as substrates in aerobic organisms. Thus, it is the most important enzyme in the body and can catalyse the disproportionation reaction of O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>–</sup> to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, which has a cytoprotective effect by blocking the production of toxic hydroxyl radicals. It has been reported that MDA increases SOD activity simultaneously decreases when lipid peroxidation is enhanced by serum lipid elevation (Niki 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Our results showed that SHJ decreased the activity of serum and cellular SOD and increased the contents of MDA and ROS, thereby enhancing lipid peroxidation, oxidative damage and membrane damage, which is unfavourable for the protection of metabolic functions in the body. This finding indicates that SF has a tremendous impact on the bioactivity and efficacy of HJ.
