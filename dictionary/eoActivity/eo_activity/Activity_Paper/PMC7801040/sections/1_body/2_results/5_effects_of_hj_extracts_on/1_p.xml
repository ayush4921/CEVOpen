 <sup>â€“</sup>. The results showed that compared to the BC group, the ox-LDL group exhibited a dramatic increase in MDA levels and a decrease in intracellular SOD enzyme activity; this increase in MDA levels was reversed by treatment with both NHJ and SHJ, with the effect increasing as the NHJ or SHJ dose increased. These results also showed that the decrease in MDA levels and the elevation of SOD activity were more efficient in HUVECs treated with NHJ compared to HUVECs treated with SHJ (
