<p>The effects of two HJ extracts on oxidative stress in a hyperlipidemic rat model and on ox-LDL-treated HUVEC apoptosis were comprehensively investigated. Based on the above results, NHJ has better antioxidant potential than SHJ. In future studies, the differences in the chemical composition between the two HJ extracts and their mechanisms in regulating antioxidant and apoptosis will be further clarified.</p>
