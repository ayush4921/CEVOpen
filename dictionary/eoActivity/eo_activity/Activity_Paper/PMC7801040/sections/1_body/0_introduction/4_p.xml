<p>Nevertheless, SF is forbidden because the period needed for SF inevitably has negative effects on the ingredients of herbal drugs, causing alterations in the bioactive components of herbs and consequently affecting their bioactivities and pharmacokinetics (Zhan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In addition, long-term exposure to sulphur dioxide and heavy metals produced by SF can cause an uncomfortable mouth feel and induce respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, including cough, chest tightness, throat discomfort and shortness of breath (Duan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Thus, the China Food and Drug Administration has compulsorily demanded that the level of sulphur dioxide residue be lower than 400 mg/kg for 12 TCMs and lower than 150 mg/kg for all other TCMs to ensure their quality, safety and efficacy (Guo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). To date, the occurrence of SF-induced chemical alterations in a great deal of TCMs, including

 <italic>Ginseng</italic> Radix et Rhizoma (Ma et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), has been verified. Our previous research showed that SF of 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> cv. Hang-ju (HJ) causes flavonoid glycosides to transform into aglycons by hydrolysis and results in a significant loss of hydroxycinnamoylquinic acids. However, no investigations have revealed the different effects of nonfumigated HJ (NHJ) and sulphur-fumigated HJ (SHJ) on antioxidation induced by oxidative stress.
