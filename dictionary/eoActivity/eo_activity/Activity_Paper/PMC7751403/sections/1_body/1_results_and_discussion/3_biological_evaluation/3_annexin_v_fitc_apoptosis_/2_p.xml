<p>Induction of apoptosis is mainly considered as an important strategy for the development of new anti-proliferative agents

 </xref>. Compounds 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> were further investigated for their potential role of apoptosis induction in the colorectal SW-620 cancer cell line (SW-620 cell line was selected because most of the new compounds showed significant potency more than HT-29 cell line). Exposure of SW-620 cells to compounds 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> resulted in the induction of apoptosis in a dose dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). As shown in the results, compound 
 <bold>7c</bold> at concentrations of 250 nM and 500 nM was able to induce approximately 5.2- and 10.66-fold, respectively, total apoptosis increase compared to the control for SW-620 cell line (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>). Similarly, compound 
 <bold>7g</bold> induced approximately 7.3 and 9.6 fold total apoptosis increase compared to the control when incubated with SW-620 cell line at concentration of 250 nM and 500 nM, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>). These findings encouraged us to further investigate the effect of compounds 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> towards the anti-apoptotic mitochondrial markers Bcl2 and BclxL.
