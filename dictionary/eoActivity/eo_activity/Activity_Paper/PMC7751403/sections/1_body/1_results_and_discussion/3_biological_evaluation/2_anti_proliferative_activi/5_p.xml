<p>Furthermore, to investigate the selective cytotoxicity of the tested compounds, the effect of compounds 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> was studied on normal human skin fibroblast (HFF-1). Compounds 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> were found to have no/or little effect on cell viability of HFF-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A,B)</xref>). This finding indicates that compounds 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> inhibited cell viability of cancer cells without affecting normal fibroblast.
