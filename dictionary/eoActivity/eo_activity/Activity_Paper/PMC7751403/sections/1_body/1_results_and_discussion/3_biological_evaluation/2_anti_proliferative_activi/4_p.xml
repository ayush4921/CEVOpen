 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> illustrated that treatment of HT-29 and SW-620 cell lines with different concentrations of compounds 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell viability. Compound 
 <bold>7c</bold> was found to inhibit HT-29 and SW-620 with IC
 <sub>50</sub>=188 nM and 206 nM, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A,B)</xref>), whereas compound 
 <bold>7g</bold> was found to exhibit IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 279 nM against HT-29 and 299 nM against SW-620 cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(C,D)</xref>), compared to the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for 
 <bold>5FU</bold> that was found to be 1.5 µM against HT-29 and 4.6 µM against SW-620 cell lines.
