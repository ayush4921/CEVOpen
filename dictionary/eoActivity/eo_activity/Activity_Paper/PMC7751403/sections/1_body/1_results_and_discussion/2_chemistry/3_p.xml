<p>On the other hand, in

 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6c</bold> and 
 <bold>6d</bold> were alkylated with methyl iodide, propyl bromide and benzyl bromide in DMF with the presence of K

 <bold>8a-e</bold>, which heated under reflux with the carbohydrazide 
 <bold>5</bold> in acetic acid to furnish the final compounds 
 <bold>9a-e</bold>, respectively. The structure of the synthesised 2-oxindolin-3-ylidene-indole-3-carbohydrazide was confirmed under the basis of spectral and elemental analyses which were in full agreement with the proposed structures.
