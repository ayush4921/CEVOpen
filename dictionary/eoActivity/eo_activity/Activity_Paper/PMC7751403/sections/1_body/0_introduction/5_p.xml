<p>Motivated by the aforementioned findings and in continuation to our previous work, in the present study, a novel series of isatin/indole conjugates (
 <bold>7a-j</bold> and 
 <bold>9a-e</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) were designed and synthesised. The antiproliferative effect of the new compounds against HT-29 and SW-620 colorectal cancer cell lines were examined. In addition, the levels of the mitochondria-related anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl2 and BclxL in HT-29 and SW-620 colorectal cancer cell lines after incubation with isatin derivatives 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> were determined.
