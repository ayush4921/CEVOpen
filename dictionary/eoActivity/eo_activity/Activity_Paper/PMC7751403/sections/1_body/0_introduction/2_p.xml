<p>Cancer is a group of diseases that is characterised by uncontrolled and rapid cell proliferation and differentiation mechanisms with the potential to invade or spread to other body parts

 </xref>. Since several decades, cancer has been one of the main world health problems and is still considered a serious leading cause of death worldwide. Early strategies of cancer treatment were based on the unspecific induction of cell death mainly targeting the replication machinery

 </xref>. Thus, the development of effective and safe new antitumour drugs with increased selectivity towards cancer cells is still an active search
