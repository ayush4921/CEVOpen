<p>Suzuki coupling is one of the most efficient and widely used methods for the C-C coupling, yet there are some shortcomings associated with the reaction. The scramble product formation, and catalyst decomposition may occur during the course of reaction. In addition, the associated homo coupled by-product can diminish the desire product and may hamper the isolation of the pure product. To mitigate these problems, an exhaustive reaction condition optimization maybe required to get the coupled product in good yield. The screening of reaction conditions was performed, and the results are given in Table 1. Initially, the coupling of thiazolyl substituted 6-bromocoumarin (4) and phenylboronic acid in the presence of palladium acetate, triphenylphosphine, and potassium carbonate in toluene as a solvent provided the desired product 5a in only 22% isolated yield (entry 1). During the solvent screening, change of solvent from toluene to THF could not improve the yield (entry 2). The study of the ligands revealed that utilizing JohnPhos as the ligand resulted in a moderately improved 38% yield, while pre-formed PdCl2dppf catalyst provided a similar yield (entries 3-4). The sterically demanding Buchwald ligands can withstand the test of time for variety of coupling reactions [31], and the bidentate ferrocene based DPPF ligand favors the reductive elimination during the catalytic cycle. Both of the above ligands have shown some improvement in the coupling reaction. The strong sigma donor N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based Pd-PEPPSI family of precatalyst systems have been developed by Prof. Michael G. Organ, and these have shown eclectic utility and robustness [32]. Therefore, employing precatalyst Pd-PEPPSI-IPr under otherwise similar conditions resulted in 25% desired product (entry 5). When the reaction was performed by switching the base to KtOBu, the desired 5a was formed with enhanced yield (entry 6). To our delight, when the reaction was performed with more sterically demanding Pd-PEPPSI-IPent catalyst in the presence of KtOBu in toluene, the product 5a was obtained in 95% yield (entry 7). At this point, when the reaction was further tested with NatOBu or with higher loading of KtOBu, the yield could not be improved (entries 8-9). Lowering the Pd-PEPPSI-IPent catalyst loading upto 2 mol%, the yield of the desired product was 90% (entry 10). Thus increasing or decreasing the base loading or changing the type of base could not improve the yield. As previous studies of PEPPSI precatalyst explored the importance of sterics in the backbone of the NHC core in the cross coupling reactions, which prompted us to prompted to optimize the steric bulk of NHC core of the Pd-PEPPSI precatalyst. The optimizations (Table 1) showed that a moderate yield of the final coupled product was obtained with Pd-PEPPSI-IPr, while a quantitative yield was obtained when Pd-PEPPSI-IPent was used. Thus, the suitable catalyst for the current Suzuki cross coupling of thiazolyl coumarin system was found to be Pd-PEPPSI-IPent.</p>
