<p>Pd-PEPPSI-catalyzed Suzuki coupling strategy was utilized to cross couple thiazole-coumarin based coumarin derivatives with array of substituted aryl boronic acid to synthesize arylated thiazole coumarins in excellent yield using mild reaction conditions. Molecular docking studies were performed to evaluate the drug-like potential of the synthesized moieties. These studies were performed to investigate the interaction modes between the compounds and active site of antibacterial and antifungal drug targets. A good correlation was observed between in vitro and in silico studies. It can be inferred that the synthesized thiazole coumarin derivatives are useful to assess in further studies to develop new antimicrobial agents with higher efficacy.</p>
