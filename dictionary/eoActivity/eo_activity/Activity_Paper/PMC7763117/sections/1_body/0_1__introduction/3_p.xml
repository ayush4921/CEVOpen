<p>The basic core structure having thiazole and coumarin subunits has been synthesized through Knoevenagel condensation [21], Pechmann reaction [22], and Hantzsch reaction [23], using readily available starting materials. Suzuki cross-coupling reaction of organoboron compounds and organic halides is one of the most efficient methods for the construction of carbon-carbon bonds [24]. Overall, the commercial availability and bench top stability of the starting materials, mild reaction conditions, and the tolerance of a broad range of functionalities have extended the scope of the reaction. The NHC bound family of palladium precatalysts, including Pd-PEPPSI-IMes, Pd-PEPPSI-IPr, and Pd PEPPSI-IPent, serve as complementary; and in most cases, superior catalyst system has been widely utilized for a variety of cross coupling reactions [25,26]. Herein, we report the computational docking and biological studies of the thiazolyl coumarin derivatives synthesized through a facile Suzuki reaction.</p>
