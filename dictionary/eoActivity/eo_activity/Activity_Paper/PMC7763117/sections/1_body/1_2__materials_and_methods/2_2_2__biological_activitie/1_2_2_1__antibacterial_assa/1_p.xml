<p>A strain of gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC: 6538) and gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (ATCC: 8739) were obtained from the culture collections of SA-Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Science (SA-CIRBS), IIUI. Both cultures were refreshed in nutrient broth. The bacterial culture was grown in nutrient agar to obtain single colonies of both strains. After culturing and refreshing, antibacterial activity was performed via agar well diffusion method. The media was prepared by suspending 2.8 gm of nutrient agar powder in 100 mL of distilled water in a flask. The media was autoclaved at 121 °C for 15 min; afterwards, it was left to cool but not solidify. About 20 mL of the media was poured into each petri dish in a laminar flow hood. The petri dishes were left on the sterile surface until the media solidified. Lids were placed on each petri dish. Bacterial dilution in saline solution was prepared according to McFarland standard. The agar plate surface was inoculated by pouring 100 µL of bacterial suspension over the entire agar surface and spreading it with glass rod [28]. The plates were left for drying. A 6 to 8 mm-diameter hole was punched aseptically with a sterile cork borer, and 20 µL of each compound was introduced into the well. DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and PenStrep were used as negative and positive control. The agar plates were incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. The antimicrobial agent diffused in the agar medium and inhibited the growth of microbes. In initial step, qualitative test was performed to find out active compounds, followed by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was performed on the active compounds. The concentration for MIC includes 500, 250, 125, 62.5, and 31.25 µg/mL[29].</p>
