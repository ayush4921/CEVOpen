<p>Finally, some of our hit xanthone derivatives may be emphasized as follows. As antitumor agents, the selective and poor water-soluble 1-carbaldehyde-3,4-dimethoxy-xanthone (
 <bold>7</bold>) and the drug-like P-gp dual inhibitor 1-[[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]amino]-4-propoxy-9
 <italic>H</italic>-thioxanthen-9-one (
 <bold>80</bold>) stand out; both proved their activity in patient derived-cells and in in vivo models, respectively. The first one still needs to be optimized due to unfavourable PK profile and the hit-to-lead optimization stage is ongoing based on the investigation of bioisosters of the aldehyde including ketones, ketoesters and boronic acids/esters. Since we have recently disclosed that the molecular mechanism of antitumor action of the dual inhibitor is related to the cholesterol transport, a balanced activity for both P-gp/antitumor activity can be tuned by structure-based design.
