<p>Concerning antimicrobial agents, marine-derived halogenated xanthones 
 <bold>28</bold>–
 <bold>31</bold> were the most promising and efforts must be directed to improve solubility and to integrate chemical features that would overcome MDR such as the ones performed for other chemotherapies. This approach already allowed us to obtain chlorinated/aminated xanthone derivatives with broad activity spectrum also against parasitic protozoa. There are many examples of effective anti-infective drugs, which also do not obey the usual drug-likeness rules; therefore, considering the urgent need for new antimicrobial agents we can hope that marine-derived xanthones will be very useful models in this area of research. Sulfated groups have proven to be an important molecular feature for the recognition of several targets both in human (coagulation cascade) and in virus as well as to render mimetic derivatives of marine secondary metabolites with antifouling activity. Although the proof-of-concept for this class of xanthones is more advanced concerning safety, PK, and bioaccumulation profile, the chemical process to scale-up for kg applications is still a difficulty to surpass. Considering the analytical applications as chiral selectors for LC, the best enantioselectivity results were achieved for xanthone-phenylglycinol-derived CSPs. The next strategy to improve the design and obtain more efficient CSPs possessing wider applicability will be the preparation of selectors based on CDXs comprising one or more bulky aromatic moieties and polar groups to maximize π-π stacking and H-bonding, essential interactions for enantiorecognition.
