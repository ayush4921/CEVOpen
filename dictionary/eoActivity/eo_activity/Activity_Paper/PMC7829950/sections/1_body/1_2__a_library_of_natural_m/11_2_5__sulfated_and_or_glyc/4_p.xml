According to this hypothesis, the sulfated diglycosylxanthone would lead to a molecule with higher molecular size and number of sulfate groups than the previous polysulfated mangiferin derivatives and thus increase anticoagulant effects. As planned, this octasulfated xanthone was more potent than the tetra and heptasulfated mangiferins and was shown to activate coagulation by a dual mechanism, inhibiting the factor Xa directly and via antithrombin III activation [
