<p>A second series of 20 analogues of 
 <bold>22</bold> with linear and angular fused pyran and dihydropyran rings were also synthesized and evaluated for their lipophilicity and antiproliferative activity in human tumor cell lines in order to perform SAR studies concerning the effect of the fused ring orientation and oxygenation pattern in pyranoxanthones (

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The compounds were synthesized either by molecular modification of simple oxygenated xanthones or by total synthesis through benzophenone and diaryl ether routes. The introduction of pyran rings in simple oxygenated xanthones were accomplished either by the cyclization with platinum of the dimethylpropargyl aryl ethers, or by the condensation with prenal or by the reaction with prenyl bromide catalysed by Montmorillonite K-10 and MW heating. The total synthesis of pyranoxanthones was carried out via diaryl ether and benzophenone using the appropriate benzopyrans and carboxylic acid derivatives as building blocks. From this work, the angular pyranoxanthone 
 <bold>27</bold> (

 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 13.3 ÂµM), showing suitable drug-like lipophilicity. Overall results obtained for the evaluation of the cell growth inhibitory activity in the referred four tumor cell lines allowed to advance some putative SAR summarized in
