<p>Yicathins B and C are two marine natural xanthones that have shown antibacterial and antifungal activities [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The total synthesis of yicathin B (
 <bold>37</bold>) and yicathin C (
 <bold>38</bold>), along with six analogues (
 <bold>39</bold>–
 <bold>44</bold>) was reported by our group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f010">Figure 10</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Lipophilicity of yicathins and their analogues was evaluated using in silico and experimental biomimetic methodologies. The obtained partition coefficients were quite different, namely for ionized compounds at physiological pH. Nevertheless, the lipophilicity of the synthesized compounds were within the limits preconized by the most common “drug-like” guidelines. In vitro antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated. Antitumor activity was screened in three human tumor cell lines, but the compounds did not reveal a significant ability to inhibit cell growth, being 48.70 μM the lowest GI
 <sub>50</sub> value. Nevertheless, compounds 
 <bold>37</bold>, 
 <bold>41</bold>, and 
 <bold>43</bold> showed a significant in vitro anti-inflammatory activity, which was comparable with well-known nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like diclofenac and celecoxib.
