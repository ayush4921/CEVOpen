<p>Overall, most of the discover hits were trioxygenated derivatives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f004">Figure 4</xref>), manly with antitumor activity. Dihydroxyxanthones, particularly those with a catechol moiety, were found to be the most promising hits for activities in which redox mechanisms are involved. From a medicinal chemistry perspective, these catechol hits could be considered as PAINS, pan-assay interference compounds [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Although their activity does not depend on a specific, drug-like interaction between the molecule and a protein, they are able to coat a protein or sequester metal ions that are essential to a proteinâ€™s function, and these are mechanisms recognized for some FDA approved-drugs. Moreover, a screening hit compound is useful when supported by strong SAR complemented by hit-to-lead optimization [
