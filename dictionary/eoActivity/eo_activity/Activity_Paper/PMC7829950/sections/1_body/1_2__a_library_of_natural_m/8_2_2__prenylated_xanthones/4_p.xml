<p>The presence of prenyl groups in the xanthone nucleus can influence the physicochemical properties, namely lipophilicity. Additionally, these groups also have impact in the biological activity, as they affect the three-dimensional properties of the xanthone and consequently the interaction with the biological targets [

In fact, a relationship between activity and the presence of prenyl groups in key-positions on the xanthone nucleus was associated with some biological activities, such as antitumor, anti-inflammatory and human lymphocyte proliferation inhibitory effects [
