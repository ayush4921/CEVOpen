<p>In fact, the excellent results of SER of CDXs with a diversity of CSPs justify the investigation of CDXs as selectors for cLC. Thus, in addition to the interesting biological activities, CDXs have also been explored as selectors for CSPs [

 <xref rid="B147-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. CDXs possess all the necessary attributes to constitute good selectors for cLC due to the 3D quasi-planar structure and peculiar electronic properties of the xanthone scaffold and the diverse association with a variety of functional groups and chiral moieties, what results in structural characteristics that afford the establishment of different types of interactions as well as the three-dimensionality, factors that influence the enantioselectivity, similarly with the basic scaffold of Pirkle-type CSPs (

Accordingly, six CDXs in enantiomerically pure form were covalently linked to silica gel through a spacer yielding the corresponding CSPs. The synthetic methodology involved only a few steps and the reactions provided good yields. These new CSPs are based on a completely different scaffold of small molecules of Pirkleâ€™s CSPs [

The resolution capability of these CSPs was evaluated using different chemical classes of chiral compounds under multimodal elution conditions. A library of CDXs was also evaluated in order to explore the principle of reciprocity as well as the chiral self-recognition phenomenon. In general, the CSPs provided high specificity for the enantiomeric mixtures of CDXs evaluated, mainly under normal elution mode [
