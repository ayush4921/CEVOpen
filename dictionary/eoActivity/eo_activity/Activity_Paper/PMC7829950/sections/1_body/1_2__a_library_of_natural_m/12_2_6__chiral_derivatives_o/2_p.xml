<p>The first CDXs synthesized by our group were inspired in natural molecules, specifically in xanthonolignoids. This natural class of compounds was chosen, as they are interesting bioactive and very promising templates for molecular modifications. They are isolated from plants of the Clusiaceae family (Guttiferae) and comprise a phenylpropane nucleus bounded to a xanthone scaffold by a dioxane moiety, formed by radical oxidative coupling [

 <italic>trans-</italic>kielcorin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f003">Figure 3</xref>) and its stereoisomer, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-kielcorin, both xanthonolignoids of the kielcorin group [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It was the first report of the biomimetic synthesis of these compounds. While the total synthesis of kielcorin derivatives requires severe reaction conditions and many steps, the biomimetic pathway is based on natural building blocks and is achieved by an oxidative coupling of a suitable dihydroxyxanthone with a cinnamyl alcohol derivative, in the presence of an oxidizing agent at room temperature [
 <xref rid="B127-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>]. In 1999, also by a biomimetic approach, the synthesis of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-kielcorin B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f003">Figure 3</xref>) and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-isokielcorin B was described by our group [
 <xref rid="B128-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. To obtain bioactive analogues with kielcorin scaffold, other constitutional isomers were synthesized by us in 2002, namely 
 <italic>trans</italic>-kielcorin C (
 <bold>61</bold>), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-kielcorin D (
 <bold>62</bold>), 
 <italic>trans</italic>-isokielcorin D, 
 <italic>cis</italic>-kielcorin C, and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-kielcorin E [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Once again, the synthetic approach was performed on a biomimetic way, by oxidative coupling of coniferyl alcohol with an appropriate xanthone. The oxidizing agents Ag

 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, K
 <sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)
