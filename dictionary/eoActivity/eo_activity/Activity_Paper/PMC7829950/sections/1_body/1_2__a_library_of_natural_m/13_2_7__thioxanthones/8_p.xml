<p>Being the antitumor and P-gp inhibitory mechanisms of action already explored individually, the most promising thioxanthones were further investigated on K562Dox cell line (derived from K562 by doxorubicin stimulated overexpression of P-gp) with the purpose of analysing if thioxanthones were effectively capable of reducing cell growth of a resistant cell line. Six of the compounds had a GI
 <sub>50</sub> value inferior to 20 μM on K562Dox cell line, suggesting a potential dual mechanism of action: P-gp and cell growth inhibitory activity. Notably, 
 <bold>80</bold> was 9-fold more potent than doxorubicin in this cell line. Furthermore, six compounds significantly decreased the doxorucibin GI
 <sub>50</sub> value on K562Dox cell line. At 1 µM, 
 <bold>71</bold> and 
 <bold>73</bold> caused a high decrease in doxorubicin GI
 <sub>50</sub> on K562Dox cell line but almost did not affect doxorubicin GI
 <sub>50</sub> on K562 sensitive cell line (the effect is mainly due to P-gp inhibitory activity), whereas 
 <bold>80</bold> caused a high decrease in doxorubicin GI
 <sub>50</sub> on both cell lines (the effect is also due to 
 <bold>80</bold> own cytotoxic activity) [
