<p>Prenylated xanthones are the major group of naturally occurring xanthones. The majority of reported synthetic prenylated xanthones possess a 3-methylbut-2-enyl or isoprenyl group (A,

Nevertheless, the presence of other open chain prenyl groups can also be found in literature; compounds containing 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran (B), 2,2-dimethylpyran (C) and 2,3,3-trimethyldihydrofuran (D) groups, which are the result of cyclization of the prenyl substituents with the 
 <italic>ortho</italic> hydroxyl group could also be found (

Among these substitution patterns, our group has been involved in the synthesis of bioactive prenylxanthones with isoprenyl (A), 2,2-dimethyldihydropyran (B), 2,2-dimethylpyran (C), 2,3,3-trimethyldihydrofuran (D), 1,1-dimethylallyl (E), and 3-methylbut-3-en-2-yl (F) and groups (
