<p>Hydroxylated xanthones have previously revealed to have antimalarial activity, pointing to the same molecular mechanism as antimalarial 4-aminoquinolines mefloquine, halofantrine, and quinine. [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] This mechanism consists in preventing the process of haemozoin formation; hence, the consequent concentration of free haematin would be sufficient to kill the parasite [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. These compounds might interact with haematin in the form of a µ-oxo dimer or a dimer of haemozoin. This interaction would lead to stabilization of haematin in a soluble form, consequently leading to parasite death [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Aided by docking simulations [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], our group designed a series of twelve new chlorinated 9
 <italic>H</italic>-xanthones with a [2-(diethylamino)ethyl]amino group in position C-1 and one to four Cl-atoms in different positions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f013">Figure 13</xref>), and studied their antimalarial activities [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. All twelve compounds were found to be active against the chloroquine-susceptible and chloroquine-resistant strains 3D7 and Dd2, respectively, of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. A more pronounced effect was observed for strain 3D7 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.7–18.1 µM) relative to strain Dd2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.9–66.4 µM). From this study, compound 
 <bold>56</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f013">Figure 13</xref>) emerged as a hit compound due to significant in vitro activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.9 µM) towards the resistant Dd2 strain. The position and number of the Cl substituents are of great importance regarding activity. When compared to known antimalarial drugs, a Cl atom in position C-6 seems to be important for activity in both strains, as well as a single Cl atom in position C-5, indicating a similar mechanism of action.
