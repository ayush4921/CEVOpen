<p>Early in 1997, a small library of 12 mono and trioxygenated xanthones was investigated for their influence on the complement system and revealed anticomplementary activity of 3-hydroxy- and 4-hydroxyxanthones [

 <sup>2+</sup>. This library of simple oxygenated xanthones enlarged over the years both from natural [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and synthetic derivatives, to more than 60 simple oxygenated xanthones and hundreds of more complex derivatives with substituents at different positions. This collection of xanthones allowed to establish structure-NMR chemical shift relationships [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] to guide synthetic chemists. Also, this appendance diversity-oriented synthesis allowed to develop a chemical toolbox of synthetic conditions and intermediates, based on classical and novel methods to obtain xanthones, recently reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and to establish methods for their quantification validated in a diversity of matrices [
