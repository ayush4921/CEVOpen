<p>Regarding polysaccharide-based CSPs, the SER of twelve enantiomeric pairs of CDXs were investigated on 
 <italic>tris</italic>-3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamates of cellulose and amylose and 
 <italic>tris</italic>-3,5-dimethoxyphenylcarbamate of amylose under multimodal elution conditions. All the enantiomeric mixtures of CDXs were enantioseparated with very high values of Î± and Rs, ranging from 1.43 to 12.41 and from 1.48 to 10.29, respectively. Amylose 
 <italic>tris</italic>-3,5- dimethylphenylcarbamate CSP under polar organic elution conditions presented the best results. The influence of the mobile phases and structural features of the CSPs and CDXs on chiral discrimination were also discussed. Considering the overall results, the chiral recognition of CDXs on polysaccharide-based CSPs depends not only on the nature of the CSPs but also on the mobile phase composition. The chemical bridges of the CDXs, the substitution of the xanthone scaffold, as well as the position of the stereogenic center had great influence on the enantioselectivity [
