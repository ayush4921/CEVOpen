<p>Other enantioselectivity studies associated with biological activity of CDXs were performed, specifically the in vitro and in silico inhibition of cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. All tested CDXs inhibited both enzymes being, in general, the inhibitory effects similar. The only exception was the enantiomeric pair of CDX 
 <bold>70</bold>, being the (
 <italic>R</italic>)-enantiomer more active at inhibiting COX-2 than COX-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f016">Figure 16</xref>). The inhibitory effects for COX-1 demonstrated to be dependent on the stereochemistry of the compounds. Enantioselectivity was also observed for COX-2 inhibition being the CDXs (
 <italic>S</italic>)-
 <bold>70</bold> and (
 <italic>S</italic>)-
 <bold>66</bold> the more active compounds (
