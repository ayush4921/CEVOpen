<p>Heparin polysaccharide is decorated by numerous ionic groups, via sulfate and carboxylate groups. Since heparin has an average molecular weight of 15 kDa, this property gives heparin the highest negative charge density of any known naturally derived biomolecule. Although heparin has been one of the most effective and widely used drugs of the past century [
 <xref rid="B106-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>], it is beset with many complications including haemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, osteoporosis and inconsistent patient response, owing to its polyanionic, polymeric and polydisperse nature. Functional mimics of heparin without its adverse effects are highly desirable as an alternative for anticoagulant therapy [
 <xref rid="B107-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Replacing the sulfate groups in the binding domain of heparin with other anions nullifies its anticoagulant activity. Therefore, sulfated small molecules are expected to preserve some molecular properties of heparin but with reduced anionic character, higher hydrophobic nature, and feasible synthesis (
