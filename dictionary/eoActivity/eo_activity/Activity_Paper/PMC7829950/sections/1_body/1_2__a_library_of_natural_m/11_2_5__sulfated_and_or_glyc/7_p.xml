<p>A number of viruses use sites on heparan sulfate (HS) as receptors for binding to cells [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Mimics of these sequences are likely to interact with the virus in solution, thereby tying it up and disrupting the viruses interaction with cell surface HS (

 <xref rid="B115-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Therefore, the potential of our sulfated small molecules as antivirals was later explored by our group. It was discovery that sulfated xanthones 
 <bold>58</bold> and 
 <bold>59</bold> were able of decreasing Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV) levels in a Burkitt lymphoma (BL) [
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. EBV infects more than 90% of the world population. Following primary infection, EBV persists in an asymptomatic latent state, associated with several diseases, such as BL. To date, there are no available drugs to target latent EBV, and the existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are mainly active against lytic viral infection. The fact that compounds 
 <bold>58</bold> and 
 <bold>59</bold> led to a decrease in the EBV DNA present in the Raji cell line (Burkitt lymphoma) was a first indication that these molecules were targeting EBV in its latent state or interfering with episome maintenance. The use of hydroxyurea (an anticancer drug) to reduce EBV DNA load, although having been successful, has the disadvantage of leading to the accumulation of additional mutations in the cellular genome. In this context, the sulfated xanthones revealed by our group may serve as a starting point for development of alternative molecules to hydroxyurea. In addition, these compounds did not present cytotoxicity at the concentrations tested for their antiviral activity what is relevant for their possible use as antivirals, being potentially specific and not affecting cell viability.
