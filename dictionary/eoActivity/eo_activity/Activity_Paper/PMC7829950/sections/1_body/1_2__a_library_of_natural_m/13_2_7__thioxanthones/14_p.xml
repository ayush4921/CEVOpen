<p>Thioxanthones have aroused enormous interest in the preceding decades because of their multidimensional health effects, as anticancer agents and MDR-reverter agents. Moreover, they are privileged structures and promising biomolecules due to their potential role as protective agents against toxic xenobiotics or due to its ability to inhibit settlement and growth of fouling organisms. These aspects and their impact on drug bioavailability have recently been reviewed in [
