<p>Additionally, considering that lipophilicity is one of the most important drug-like properties having a great impact in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics processes, the lipophilicity of a series of CDXs inferred by the partition between octanol and aqueous phase were assessed using four different methods: computational methods, vortex-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction coupled with LC, reversed-phase thin layer chromatography, reversed-phase LC, and biomembranes model by the partition between micelles and aqueous phase [

The methodologies and data gathered in this study allowed a better understanding of lipophilicity of this important class of compounds, which highlights the need to have different lipophilicity measurements to take conscious decisions in the hit to drug optimization process.
