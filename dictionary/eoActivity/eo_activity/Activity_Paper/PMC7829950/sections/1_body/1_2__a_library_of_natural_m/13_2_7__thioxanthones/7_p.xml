<p>As 
 <bold>80</bold> was considered a hit compound, with in vitro antitumor potential by modulating autophagy and apoptosis in human tumor cell lines, the mechanism of action of 
 <bold>80</bold>.HCl was further investigated using in vitro and mouse xenograft tumor models of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). It was discovered that 
 <bold>80.</bold>HCl caused abnormal cellular cholesterol localization and reduced the growth of human NSCLC cells in vitro and of NSCLC xenografts in mice, without presenting toxicity to the animals [

 <bold>80</bold>, which may be relevant for the development of anticancer therapeutic strategies which target cholesterol transport [
