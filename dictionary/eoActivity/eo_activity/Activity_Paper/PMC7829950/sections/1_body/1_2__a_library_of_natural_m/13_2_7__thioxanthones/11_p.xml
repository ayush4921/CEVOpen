<p>More recently, new chiral thioxanthones with aminated substituents at C-1 (2-amino-1-propanol, 1-amine-2-propanol, leucinol, and valinol) were synthesized in enantiomerically pure form in order to analyse the effect of the stereochemistry in P-gp modulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f021">Figure 21</xref>). All chiral thioxanthones at 20 ÂµM significantly decreased the intracellular accumulation of a P-gp fluorescent substrate Rh123, suggesting an increment in the activity of the efflux pump. Therefore, these thioxanthones were shown to behave as P-gp activators, increasing the efflux of substrates without interfering with P-gp levels of expression. Moreover, (

 <italic>H</italic>-thioxanthen-9-one (

 <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> to thioxanthone derivatives with antitumor activity (
 <bold>75</bold>, 
 <bold>81</bold>, and 
 <bold>86</bold>) revealed that there is an induction of ABC transporters in that fungus, particularly atrb and cdr4, which is a common consequence of the treatment with (thio)xanthones [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Moreover, a group of genes were downregulated by the tested thioxanthones during oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. While screening for potential P-gp inhibitors that increased the accumulation of known P-gp substrate Rh123, some of the tested thioxanthones caused the opposite effect, decreasing the Rh123 accumulation ratio. This effect is compatible with a possible P-gp activation, and such compounds are potential protectors against toxic effects induced by P-gp substrates [
 <xref rid="B170-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Indeed, P-gp, besides being responsible for multidrug resistance of neoplastic cells to cancer therapy, is also constitutively expressed in many excretory and barrier tissues and, due to its wide substrate specificity, can play a crucial role in limiting the absorption and increasing the efflux of harmful xenobiotics. This defence mechanism can be very important at the intestinal barrier, as it can decrease the intestinal absorption of toxic xenobiotics [
