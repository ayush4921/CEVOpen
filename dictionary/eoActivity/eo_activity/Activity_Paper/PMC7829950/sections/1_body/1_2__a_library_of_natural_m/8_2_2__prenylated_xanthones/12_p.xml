<p>Although the antitumor activity of prenylated xanthones was the most reported biological activity, the potential of these compounds as AF agents has recently been explored by our group. In this context, and as a part of our efforts to discover innovative antifoulants inspired in natural products, xanthone 
 <bold>22</bold> was also investigated along with the simple oxygenated xanthones (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-molecules-26-00431">Section 2.1</xref>). This prenylated xanthone 
 <bold>22</bold> showed even more potent in vivo activity toward the settlement of 
 <italic>Mytilus galloprovincialis</italic> larvae (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.60 µM) than the dihydroxyxanthone 
 <bold>9</bold>, showing also a low toxicity profile to this macrofouling species (LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 500 µM and LC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 108.70) and to 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> (&lt;10% mortality at 50 µM). Concerning the mechanisms of action in mussel larvae, xanthone 
 <bold>22</bold> showed a specific target directly related with the proximal thread proteins (TMPs), which are expressed by bivalve molluscs that adhere to underwater surfaces through the production of byssal threads [
