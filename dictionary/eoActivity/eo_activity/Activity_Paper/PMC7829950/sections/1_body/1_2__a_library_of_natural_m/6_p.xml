<p>In this work, we describe xanthone derivatives divided in seven groups, based on different chemical families, concerning the diverse substituents. We will exemplify strategies that we consider significant for our contribution: prenylation, sulfation, and introduction of chiral moieties starting from simple oxygenated xanthones. Given the objective of this work, most of the references indicated throughout the text correspond mainly to the contribution of our group to medicinal chemistry in the chemical family of xanthones and not to an exhaustive research in this area. We expect that this review may serve as an inspiration for other groups working with diverse “privileged structures” in an integrative way.</p>
