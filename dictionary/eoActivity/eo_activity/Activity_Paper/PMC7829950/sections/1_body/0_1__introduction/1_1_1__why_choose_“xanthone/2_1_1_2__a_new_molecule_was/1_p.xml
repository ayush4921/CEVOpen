 <italic>H</italic>-Xanthen-9-one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00431-f001">Figure 1</xref>) is not a natural product, in fact, this structure was only obtained by synthesis in 1860, by Kolbe and Lautermann, using phosphorus oxychloride in sodium salicylate via condensation of phenol and salicylic acid [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Historically, the first natural xanthone described was gentisin (1,7-dihydroxy-3-methoxyxanthone) in 1821, isolated from the plant 
 <italic>Gentiana lutea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the first prenylxanthone derivative, tajixanthone, was isolated from the mycelium of 
 <italic>Aspergillus stellatus</italic> in 1970 [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00431" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the first synthesis proposed for a xanthone (hydroxyxanthone) was achieved by Michael, in 1883, and later by Kostanecki and Nessler, in 1891, through the distillation of 
 <italic>O</italic>-hydroxy-benzoic acid, acetic anhydride and a phenol [
