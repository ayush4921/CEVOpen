We checked the stalls for the freshest plants and bought a varying number of plants on each visit. Prior to buying the specimens, we introduced ourselves in Portuguese to the vendors, explained the framework of this research project, and highlighted that we were collecting medicinal and ritual plant specimens for the Herbarium of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi (MG). We followed the ISE Code of Ethics [
