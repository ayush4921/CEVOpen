<p id="Par15">We identified most plants by comparing them to herbarium vouchers at the MG and in the field during informal walks in nearby areas where these plants were presumably collected, such as at Ilha do Combu and the Parque Estadual do Utinga. Photographs of those specimens that we could not identify at the MG were compared to South American collections at the Herbarium of Naturalis Biodiversity Center (L) in Leiden, the Netherlands. We completed our identifications by consulting the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) website [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the Tropicos database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and literature on medicinal plants in Brazil [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and Suriname [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We identified seeds and barks by comparing their vernacular names with those mentioned in literature on Brazilian useful plants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and comparing them with photographs in Google Images. We checked and updated the species scientific plant names by using The Plant List [
