<p id="Par33">The last vernacular name with an African etymology, 
 <italic>tapete de Oxalá</italic> (rug of Oxalá in English, 
 <italic>Episcia cupreata</italic>), is also used in other parts of Brazil for other plant species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Oxalá is a Candomblé deity and has a West African etymology, but it is unknown when and how this name was introduced into the Brazilian Portuguese vocabulary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and therefore how and by whom 
 <italic>Episcia cupreata</italic> was first associated with this deity.
