<p id="Par34">Thus, contrary to our expectation, we found very few vernacular names of medicinal and ritual plants sold at the Ver-o-Peso with African-derived origins. Yet, many of the plants we documented at the VOP with Portuguese and Tupi vernacular names, including African and non-African species, are used in rituals and ceremonies performed by followers of Afro-Brazilian religions, like Candomblé [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Other areas in Brazil, for instance in the northeast, where the Afro-Brazilian population is larger and may have experienced less difficulty in preserving Yoruba and Kikongo language elements, may exhibit other vernacular plant name patterns, including more African-derived plant names [

So, while we documented only a few plant names of African origin, several plants sold at the VOP were associated with ritual uses that were influenced by Afro-Brazilians. These findings may give us a glance into history: enslaved Africans who were brought to Brazil and arrived in the area of Belém, and later Afro-Brazilians faced more difficulties in retaining their language, possibly because they were in fewer numbers than Portuguese and Tupi-speaking peoples. However, they were clearly able to keep their knowledge on plant uses alive and to adjust their ceremonial and ritualistic customs to the new plants encountered in Brazil.
