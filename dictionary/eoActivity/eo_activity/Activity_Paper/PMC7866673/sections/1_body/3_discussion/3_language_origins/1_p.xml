<p id="Par29">The largest part of the vernacular plant names at this Amazonian market bore names of Portuguese origin. For example, the vernacular name 
 <italic>arruda</italic> (
 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic>) is of Portuguese origin, and the species is native to the Mediterranean region where it is embedded in the local plant pharmacopeia and also used against the “evil eye” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. We noticed this that several vendors at the VOP wore a sprig of 
 <italic>arruda</italic> to protect against the “evil eye,” an interesting usage also commonly found in Bahia among Candomblé practitioners [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Bussmann et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] also found that most plants sold at markets in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru have mostly Spanish names. However, in northern Peru, Bussmann and Sharon [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that Spanish names were mainly used for introduced and coastal plant species whereas plants from the montane forests were often referred to by their indigenous name. In our case, there were relatively few plants of European origin at the VOP market and most plants with Portuguese vernacular names were native Brazilian species, such as, 
 <italic>Mansoa alliacea</italic>, called 
 <italic>cipó de alho</italic> (garlic vine).
