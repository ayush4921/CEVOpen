  <italic>Acanthopanax trifoliatus (Linn.) Merr.</italic> is an edible vegetables and medicinal plant from Asian countries. In this study, the complete chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> was assembled and annotated by high-throughput sequencing. The total chloroplast genome size of 
  <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> was 156,716 bp, containing a large single-copy (LSC) region of 86,672 bp, a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,174 bp, and a pair of inverted repeat regions of 25,935 bp. A total of 134 genes were predicted in the chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic>, including 89 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 
  <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> was closely related to 
  <italic>Eleutherococcus gracilistylus</italic>.
