 <italic>Acanthopanax trifoliatus</italic> is an edible medicinal plant belonging to the 
 <italic>Acanthopanax</italic> genus in the Araliaceae family. It is commonly cultivated in China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Leaves of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> are popularly consumed as vegetables and herbal tea in southern China (Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Traditionally, 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> has also been used as folk medicine to treat various diseases, including lung hemorrhages, bruises, ulcers, and partial (Sithisarn et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Pharmacological studies also reported that 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> extracts showed numerous biological activities, including antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective effects (Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The sequencing of the chloroplast genome of medicinal plants will promote in-depth research on the chloroplast genome of medicinal plants and the development of related industries. In this study, we assembled the complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> to provide genomic and genetic sources for further research.
