<p>Murine embryonic fibroblast cell line (3T3-CCL92), purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA), was cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cell proliferation assay, modified from that of Mosmann [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], was used in which the cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and the residue diluted with a fresh medium into a suspension at the concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml. Then 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the cell suspension was seeded into each of the 96-well plates and incubated for 24 hrs. After incubation, the supernatant was replaced with medicinal plant extracts in basic growth media (DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin). Asiaticoside was used as a positive control. After 24 hrs incubation, MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added and further incubated for 2 hrs. The formazan was dissolved in DMSO and determined at 570 nm. The viability was calculated as percentage of proliferation [
