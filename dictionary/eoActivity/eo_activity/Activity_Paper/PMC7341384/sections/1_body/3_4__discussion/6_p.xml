<p>Our results suggested that ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic>, 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic>, and 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> may be applied to treat the wound in various phases. They can be divided into two groups. The first group consists of the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> which can be applied together with the saline washing solution to remove foreign bodies and bacteria. This is due to the fact that the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> can reduce inflammation and protect the wound surrounding cells. They have been shown to effectively inhibit 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> MRSA with the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values of 9.8 and 4.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The second group consists of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> which can be applied on open wounds or wounds that are not completely close, to accelerate wound recovery. Glycyrrhizin and thymoquinone enhanced wound closure without any cell proliferation activities and may be beneficial in the second phase of wound treatment as well as 
 <italic>α</italic>-mangostin. Interestingly, 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> and 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> yielded high percentage of their ethanolic extracts which made them more attractive for future utilization.
