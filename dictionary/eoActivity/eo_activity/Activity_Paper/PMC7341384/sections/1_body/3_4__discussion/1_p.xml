<p>Eight Thai medicinal plants were selected from Mukkharoka scripture, the National List of Essential Medicines of Thailand, and traditional usages. These were 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> seed, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> root, 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> fruits, 
 <italic>Solanum indicum</italic> fruits and 
 <italic>Solanum trilobatum</italic> fruits, 
 <italic>Garcinia mangostana</italic> pericarp, 
 <italic>Mimusops elengi</italic> bark, and clove bud (
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic>). Four 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies were chosen to demonstrate whether their ethanolic and aqueous extracts could influence wound healing. At the first stage of wound healing, inflammation occurs; this involves RNS and ROS from our immune cells. These free radicals are essential for ridding of bacteria but it could also cause damage to cells surrounding the wound. In this regard, the tests for anti-inflammation and antioxidant were used. At the second stage of wound healing fibroblast cell proliferation commences and the wound reduces its size. To demonstrate these activities of the 16 plant extracts, fibroblast cell proliferation and scratch wound closure assays were chosen.
