<p>The selection of the plant extracts for the proliferation of 3T3-CCL92 murine embryonic fibroblast cell line was based on the results of viability assay (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic>, 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic>, 
 <italic>α</italic>-mangostin, glycyrrhizin, and thymoquinone were toxic with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 44.63 ± 0.30, 52.58 ± 1.45, 5.31 ± 0.02, 42.71 ± 0.59, and 7.29 ± 0.11 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Other ethanolic and aqueous extracts were not toxic. Appropriate concentrations of the ethanolic extracts, aqueous extracts, and pure compounds were used accordingly. The ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic>, 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic>, and 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> could increase the proliferation to the maximum of 52.68 ± 1.99, 52.13 ± 3.95, and 15.47 ± 0.87%, respectively. These were significantly different from that of negative control. Interestingly, the result of 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> extract was comparable to that of asiaticoside, the positive control, with the maximum proliferation value of 13.71 ± 0.51%. Among the pure compounds tested, 
 <italic>α</italic>-mangostin gave maximal proliferation of 26.72 ± 2.21%, while glycyrrhizin and thymoquinone did not promote cell proliferation (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). It should be noted that the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> and 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> and 
 <italic>α</italic>-mangostin promoted significantly greater cell proliferation than the positive control. The negative results were not presented (
