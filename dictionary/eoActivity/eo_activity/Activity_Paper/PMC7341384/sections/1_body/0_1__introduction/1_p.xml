<p>The skin forms a barrier that protects the body from pathogens, maintains moisture, and preserves the temperature of the body. A wound is a type of injury on the skin which causes physical, chemical, electrical, or thermal damage. When a wound occurs, the healing process is immediately initiated in response to the injury to regenerate the tissue. Wound healing consists of 3 phases, that is, inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling, a complex process associated with multiple cells, and molecules [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. When a wound occurs on the skin, within 10–30 minutes the inflammatory phase is activated which induces vasodilation and increases capillary permeability that causes pain, swelling, and redness at the wound area. When the immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages reach the wound, nitric oxide (NO) as the primary reactive nitrogen species (RNS) was produced to destroy the cell debris and bacteria. Nitric oxide is formed from L-arginine and molecular oxygen (O
 <sub>2</sub>) by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Additionally, the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) or the superoxide anion radical (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) are formed from molecular oxygen (O
 <sub>2</sub>) during cellular metabolism in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (METC) and others [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, increments of ROS and RNS cause damage to nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids of cells surrounding the wound leading to loss of functions and cell death [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. When the inflammation phase is passed and all the potentially dangerous factors are removed, the proliferation phase commences. Fibroblasts play a major role in this process. Fibroblasts, differentiated into myofibroblasts, mainly via the activation of mediators, migrate to the wound area and produce abundant extracellular matrix [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Myofibroblasts also express smooth muscle actin filaments in order to facilitate wound contraction and achieve skin restoration while epithelial cells migrated to cover tissue from the edge of the wound. The remodelling phase is the final phase of the wound healing process, which begins about 20 days after the wound occurs on the skin. From months to years, this period consists of the collagen cross-link and different cells of the wound; then the creation of collagen decreases until the balance is achieved.
