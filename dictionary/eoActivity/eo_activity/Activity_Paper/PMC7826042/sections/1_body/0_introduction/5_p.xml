<p id="par0035">As the world is awaiting curative remedies for COVID-19, there have been several attempts in the recent past towards repositioning of existing drugs to combat the spread of COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 80 % of global population rely on traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies carried out on plants and their derived products have helped to develop effective antibiotic, antimitotic, and antiviral activities. In addition, the pharmaceutical companies began to develop new antimicrobial drugs from natural plant sources (

The available antiviral drugs act on specific enzymes involved in targeting the viral structure or in the replication cycle, making them effective targets. But the failure of several conventional drugs against viral infections and the rise in incidence of specific viral resistance has led to an interest in plants as an alternative source of effective antiviral agents (
