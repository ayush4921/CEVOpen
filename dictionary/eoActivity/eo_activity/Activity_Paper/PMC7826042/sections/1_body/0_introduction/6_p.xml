<p id="par0040">With the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, research has been initiated to screen the potential of several plant secondary metabolites in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>)/chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) using molecular docking analysis to examine binding affinity. However, screening a large number of medicinal plants for phytocompounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 will be a challenge in very short period of time. Drug discovery is a time consuming, slow and challenging process (
