<p id="par0190">An alternative way to block the activity of the SARS-CoV is to target the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV S proteins or blocking the human ACE2 receptor. 
 <xref rid="bib0510" ref-type="bibr">Yi et al. (2004)</xref> reported that tetra-O-galloyl Î²-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose from 
 <italic>Galla chinensis</italic> and luteolin from 
 <italic>Veronica linariifolia</italic> exhibit strong binding affinity to spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV. Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone), rhein (1,8-dihydroxy-3-carboxyl-910-anthraquinone), and chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) are produced in high levels in plants of genus Rheum and Polygonum; these compounds were responsible for blocking the binding of S protein in SARS-CoV to ACE2 (

 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Emodin blocked the binding of S protein to ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner (
