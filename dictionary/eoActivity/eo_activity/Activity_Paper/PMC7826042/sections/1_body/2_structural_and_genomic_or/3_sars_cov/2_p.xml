<p id="par0070">The genome of SARS-CoV encodes the structural spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein and nucleocapsid (N) protein in 5สน- 3สน direction within the 3สน proximal 1/3
 <sup>rd</sup> region of the genome. All the SARS-CoV genomes harbor an extremely large gene 1 (separated into ORFs 1a and 1b and extending over two-thirds of the genome) encoding nonstructural proteins responsible for proteolytic processing of the gene 1 polyprotein products, virus genome replication, and sub-genomic (sg) mRNA synthesis (
