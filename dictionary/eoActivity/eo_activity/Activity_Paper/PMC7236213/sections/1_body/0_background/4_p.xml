<p id="Par15">The present review focuses on compounds with tested activities against various malaria parasites derived from a literature survey from 2013 to 2019 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A total of 187 NPs belonging to diverse classes, including alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, flavonoids, steroids, and terpenoids are described. These compounds have been identified from 45 plant species belonging to 23 families. It is hoped that the results summarized will help for lead compound identification and for further anti-malarial drug discovery. The review describes the NPs with potential anti-malarial properties from African medicinal plants, arranged alphabetically according to the main NP compound classes.
