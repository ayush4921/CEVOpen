 <italic>Aloe percrassa</italic> (Asphodelaceae), is an indigenous species used in Ethiopian folk medicine to treat malaria, wounds and gastric problems [

 <bold>100</bold>) microdontin B (
 <bold>101</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>), are four anthrones derived from the leaf latex of 
 <italic>Aloe percrassa</italic> by Geremedhin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. The anti-malarial activities of the mixtures of Aloin A/B and microdontin A/B were lower than the latex. The mixtures were shown to have suppressed parasitaemia from 36.8 to 66.8% at doses of 100 to 400 mg/kg/day. This suggested that the compounds within the two mixtures may have acted synergistically.
