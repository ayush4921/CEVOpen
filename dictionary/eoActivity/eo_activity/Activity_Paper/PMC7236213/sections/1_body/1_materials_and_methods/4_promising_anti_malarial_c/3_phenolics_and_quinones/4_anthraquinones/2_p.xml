<p id="Par46">The roots of the same plant, also harvested in Ethiopia, led Abdissa et al. to isolate a dimeric anthraquinone, 10-methoxy-10,7′-(chrysophanol anthrone)-chrysophanol (
 <bold>93</bold>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>93</bold> showed antiplasmodial activities against the W2 and D6 strains with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.22 and 7.73 μM, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The investigations of Bringmann et al. led to the isolation of new dimeric phenylanthraquinones; joziknipholone A (
 <bold>90</bold>) and joziknipholone B (
 <bold>91</bold>) from the roots of 
 <italic>Bulbine frutescens</italic> (Asphodelaceae) harvested in Kenya [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The authors also tested the two compounds against the K1 strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and obtained remarkable activities, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.17 and 0.26 μM, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Knipholone anthrone (
 <bold>82</bold>) was tested again from the leaves of the Ethiopian medicinal plant 
 <italic>Kniphofia foliosa</italic> (Asphodelaceae) by Feilcke et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The activity of this compound in several biological assays was described by the authors and showed antiplasmodial activity against 3D7 strain with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 0.7 μM.
