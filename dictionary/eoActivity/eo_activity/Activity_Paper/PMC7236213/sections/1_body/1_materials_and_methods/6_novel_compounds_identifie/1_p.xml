<p id="Par77">It was observed that 53 out of the 187 compounds (about 28%) were described in the literature for the very first time. Besides, from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig38" ref-type="fig">38</xref>, the majority of the NPs were terpenoids (30%), followed by flavonoids (22%), alkaloids (19%) and quinones (15%), the rest of the compound classes, each representing only less than 5% of the entire compound collection. It was also observed that most of the plant species from which the compounds were identified were of the families Rubiaceae, Meliaceae, and Asphodelaceae (Fig.
