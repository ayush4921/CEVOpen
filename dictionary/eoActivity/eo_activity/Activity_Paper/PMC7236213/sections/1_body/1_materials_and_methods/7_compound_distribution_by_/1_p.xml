<p id="Par78">A classification of the compounds by class into the plant families showed that most of the plant families represented their typical (chemotaxonomic) compound classes, often seen in the literature for species harvested from the African continent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>]. As an example, for the collected data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig40" ref-type="fig">40</xref>), all the 26 compounds from the Leguminoceae-Fabaceae were flavonoids, while 23 out of the 25 anti-malarial NPs from the Asphodelaceae were quinones. It was also noted that 27 out of the 34 compounds from the Meliacious species were terpenoids, just like the Euphorbiaceous species that included 12 terpenoids out of 13 compounds identified within the family. Meanwhile, all the 12 compounds from the Ancistrocladaceae were alkaloids, just like the Loganiaceae and Annonaceae for which all 8 compounds and 9 out of the 12 identified compounds were, respectively, alkaloids. On the contrary, the compounds from the Rubiaceous species were distributed among different classes, the majority being phenolics and quinones.
