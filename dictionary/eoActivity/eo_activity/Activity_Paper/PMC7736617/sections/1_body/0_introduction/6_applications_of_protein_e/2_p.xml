<p>3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase is a rate-limiting enzyme in monoterpenoid synthesis, which catalyzes HMG-CoA to generate MVA irreversibly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). To relieve the intermediate product inhibition and accumulate of end products, the N-terminal membrane of HMGR was anchored and the C-terminal of HMGR separately (tHMGR) was expressed in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which increased the final production of target monoterpenoid (

 <italic>tHMGR</italic> and other genes in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> lead to 22.49 mg/L limonene (
