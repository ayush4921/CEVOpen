<p>Although 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been proven to be able to synthesize monoterpenoids efficiently, the metabolic flux of MVA pathway in 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is still low (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ignea et al., 2019</xref>). The metabolic regulation mechanism of the MVA pathway is complex, which greatly affects the final production of monoterpenoids. In order to increase the metabolic flux of the MVA pathway, several important metabolic rate-limiting/key enzymes have been identified and optimized.
