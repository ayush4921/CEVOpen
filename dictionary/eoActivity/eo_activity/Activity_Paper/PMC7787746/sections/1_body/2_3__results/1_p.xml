<p>Experimentally induced diabetes in rats significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) elevated blood glucose, ALT, and AST levels, while diminished insulin level (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05), in STZ group as compared with the nondiabetic control group. Treatment of the diabetic rats with 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> in 150 and 300 mg/kg doses significantly reduced the blood glucose (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01 and 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001, respectively), ALT (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001, respectively), and AST (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01, respectively) levels, while only the 300 mg/kg dose significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) elevated insulin levels, as compared with the STZ group. TC, TG, and LDL were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001) increased, while HDL was significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05) reduced, in serum of diabetic-untreated rats as compared with nondiabetic group. Both doses of 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05 and 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01, respectively) decreased the serum levels of TC, TG, and LDL in diabetic animals as compared with the STZ group (
