<p>Nowadays, the use of medicinal plants has gained more intention as they possess several pharmacological actions owing to their biologically active constituents. 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> is a traditional medicinal plant used widely throughout Asian countries such as Yemen and Saudi Arabia and some African countries such as Ethiopia. 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> belongs to family Loranthaceae. It was shown that 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> could grow on several trees such as 
 <italic>Zizyphus spina-christi</italic>, 
 <italic>Ficus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> sp. 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> is considered a hemiparasitic shrub as it takes its water and mineral requirements from these trees, while carbohydrates are photosynthesized in its green leaves [

 <italic>L. regularis</italic> is also known as a member of mistletoe. Several pharmacological studies have identified the therapeutic value of many mistletoe species in traditional medicine including antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory [

 <italic>L. regularis</italic> could act as antioxidant and antimicrobial agents with a moderate anticancer activity [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mothana et al. found that the phenolic constituents of 
 <italic>L. regularis</italic> are effective against inflammation, nociception, fever, and oxidative stress [

 <italic>L. regularis</italic> against metabolic diseases, where oxidative stress and inflammation are deemed as causative factors.
