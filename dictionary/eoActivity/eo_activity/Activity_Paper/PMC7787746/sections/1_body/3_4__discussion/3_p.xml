<p>Our results showed that the commonly used liver function tests were imbalanced in the serum of diabetic animals. In addition, hyperglycemia impaired the lipid profile markers in diabetic animals treated with STZ alone, which is in accordance with earlier studies [

The resulted hepatocellular damage is mainly due to inflammation and oxidative hepatic tissue injury, leading to elevation of the designate serum levels of ALT and AST. These enzymes characterize hepatocellular damage and used as diagnostic markers in case of diabetic associated-nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis [

Studies have reported that deficiency in insulin secretion stimulates peripheral free fatty acid lipolysis and their movement to hepatic tissues. At this stage, hepatic uptake of the free fatty acids increases the production of very LDL and triglycerides, leading to augmentation of their serum levels [
