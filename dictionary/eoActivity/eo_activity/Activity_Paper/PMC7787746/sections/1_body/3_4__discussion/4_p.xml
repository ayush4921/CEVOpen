<p>Insulin deficiency might influence the inflammatory response systemically. In the present study, diabetic-untreated animals exhibited significant high values of inflammation biomarkers in their serum including TNF-

 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and IL-6, which elevates their hepatic expressions. In addition, caspase-3 levels were upregulated in diabetic animals suggesting the involvement of apoptotic pathways. Collectively, these inflammatory responses have harmful effects on liver tissues as demonstrated histologically. Diabetic-untreated animals showed fatty degeneration and inflammatory cell infiltrates, which was reported previously using the same STZ animal model of DM [
