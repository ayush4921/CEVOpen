<p>In the present study, the STZ model of DM was utilized in experimental animals. After systemic absorption, STZ is up taken by pancreatic beta cells selectively. This action is mediated by glucose transporter type 2. STZ induces alkylation of DNA strands inside beta cells, leading to failure in the physiological function of the cells and sudden insulin deficiency [
