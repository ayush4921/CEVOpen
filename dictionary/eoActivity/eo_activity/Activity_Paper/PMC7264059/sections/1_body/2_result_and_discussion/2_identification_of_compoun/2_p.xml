<p id="p0095">Methanol (MeOH) extract from the stem bark of 
 <italic>Dipterocarpus littoralis</italic> was fractionated successively by vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) into three major fractions. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction was selected for subsequent studies, on further fractionation and purification of the major component either by VLC, silica gel column chromatography (CC), sephadex LH 20 CC and preparative TLC, which resulted in the isolation of a known compound (
 <bold>1</bold>). Moreover, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was reported for the first time from this species.
