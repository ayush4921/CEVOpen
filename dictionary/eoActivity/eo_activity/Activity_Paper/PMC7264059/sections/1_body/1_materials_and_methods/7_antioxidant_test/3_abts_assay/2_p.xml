<p id="p0065">The method of Re et al (1999) is also applied to determine the activities of antioxidants from the extract [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previously, potassium peroxydisulfate solution 140 mM was prepared and 2, 2 -azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic (ABTS) solution 7 mM was ready. Then both stock solutions were blended and left to sit for about 12 h at room temperature. ABTS solution (1 mL) and 88 Î¼L extract were blended. Then, it took 4 min to incubate the mixture. After that, the absorbance was monitored at 734 nm. The ABTS inhibition rate was examined with formula: Inhibition (%) = [(A
 <sub>b</sub>-A
 <sub>s</sub>)/A
 <sub>b</sub>] x100. The concentration of the extracts made linear graphs towards percentage inhibitions formation to estimate IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. The experiment was presented in triplicate.
