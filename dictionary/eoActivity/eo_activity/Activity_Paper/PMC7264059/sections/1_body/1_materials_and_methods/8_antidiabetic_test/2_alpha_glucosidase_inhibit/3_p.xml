<p id="p0075">Sodium phosphate buffer 150 μL including 20 μL α-glucosidase solution and sample extracts 10 μL were blended. Then, it took 10 min to incubate the mixture at 37 °C in 96-well plates. The absorbance was recorded UV spectrophotometrically at 490 nm for sample absorbance (A
 <sub>s</sub>) and blanko absorbance (A
 <sub>b</sub>). The absorbance then was estimated as the percentage inhibition of the sample at various concentrations. The α-glucosidase inhibition was examined with the formula: α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (%) = [(A
 <sub>b</sub>-A
 <sub>s</sub>)/A
 <sub>b</sub>] x100.
