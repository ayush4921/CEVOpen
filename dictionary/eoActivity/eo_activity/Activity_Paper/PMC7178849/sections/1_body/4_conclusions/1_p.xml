<p>The present study demonstrated that MeJA, SA and MWCNTSs induced different biochemical and physiological processes with different responses both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. They presumably elevated the level of oxidative stress in the 
 <italic>Satureja</italic> plants through inducing an up-regulation in the gene expression level involved in the flavonoid metabolism resulting to activate specific key enzymes such as CAT, POD and APX. These results could be utilised for the induction of plant defensive system against ROS that will enable the plant to withstand many biotic and abiotic stresses. However, it caused a decrease in the RA contents and enzyme activity in severe oxidative stress. These results draw attention to the fact that exogenous application of MeJA, SA, and MWCNTSs influences biochemical and physiological aspects of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> plant. They can act as an effective elicitor to enhance the biosynthesis of pharmaceutically active molecules such as RA, which may be considered as part of the daily human diet in treatment of several diseases.
