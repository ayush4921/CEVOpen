<p>Nanoparticles could act as signal compounds inducing metabolic and physiological responses in 
 <italic>Pelargonium zonale</italic> L. L’Hér. (Geraniaceae) (Hatami and Ghorbanpour 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Previous research reported that nanosilver particles could cause oxidative stress, raise lipid peroxidation, and catalase activity in 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> L. (Compositae) (Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Also, some studies revealed that nanoparticles could activate plant antioxidant systems and increase activities of superoxide dismotase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) in spinach chloroplast (Lei et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). It was shown that MWCNTs had ability to enhance the growth of tobacco cells at different concentrations (Khodakovskaya et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In this study, two separate experiments were performed. At the first experiment, different concentrations of MWCNTs and MeJA were applied on nodal segments cultures of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> grown 
 <italic>in vitro.</italic> The second one was performed to investigate the potential effects of spraying 100 mg/L MWCNTs and 200 mg/L SA at different time points on 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> plants. Phytochemical responses, including RA contents, enzyme activities; catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (POD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) were measured in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> treated plants. Antioxidant activities of the extracts (DPPH and β-carotene) were measured in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> plants exposed to MWCNTs and SA treatments at different times from initial treatments. Finally, the antifungal effects of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> extracts and also inhibitory impacts of callus were evaluated.
