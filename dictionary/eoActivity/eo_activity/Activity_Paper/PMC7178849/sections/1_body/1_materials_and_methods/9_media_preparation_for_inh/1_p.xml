<p>The fungal strain 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> Mart. FsK is an endophyte, originally isolated from tomato roots (Kavroulakis et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). The fungus was cultivated on autoclaved (121 °C for 20 min) potato-dextrose-agar medium (PDA) supplemented with total extracts of non-treated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> plant and non-treated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> nodal segments. From each sample, the amount of extract used in the PDA culture medium was determined based on the concentration of 1 mg/L of RA. The extracts were solved in 50:50 (V:V) methanol/water and 10 μL of the filtered solvent were added to the PDA media. The media without any solvent was considered as a control. An agar plug of FSK was placed in the middle of a petri dish and incubated in growth chambers in the dark at 25 °C. The number of conidia, fresh weight and dry weight of FsK were measured under treatment of control, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> extracts of 
 <italic>S. khzistanica</italic> plants. On the other hand, callus induction of 
 <italic>S. khzistanica</italic> was performed following the method which was done by Ghorbanpour and Hadian (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In order to study the effect of calluses on FsK growth, two callus pieces were placed on two sides of each petri dish containing fungi. The inhibitory effects of these calluses on FsK growth was assayed by measuring the diameter growth of FsK every day for 6 days.
