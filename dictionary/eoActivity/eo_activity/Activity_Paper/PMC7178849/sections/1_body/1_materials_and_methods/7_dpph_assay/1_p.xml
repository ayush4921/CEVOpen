<p>In this assay, the radical-scavenging abilities of the extracts were tested to determine their antioxidant activity through the bleaching of the purple-colored methanol solution of DPPH (Sigma_Aldrich, Munich, Germany) by spectro-photometer. The extract (50 μL), dissolved in methanol, was added to 5 mL of DPPH solution (0.004% DPPH in methanol). Synthetic standard of Trolox (1 mM), a stable antioxidant, was used as a reference. Also, 2 mL of the hydroalcoholic extract (50 mg/L) was added to an equal volume of DPPH solution (125 μM in 1 mL of methanol) concomitant with vitamin C (5 μg/mL) as a positive control for measuring the radical scavenging activity of the hydromethanolic extracts. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was recorded at 517 nm against a blank using UV_Vis spectrophotometer. The inhibition percentage of the DPPH free radical was calculated according to the following equation (Khodakovskaya et al.
