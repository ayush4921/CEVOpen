<p>In this experiment, the RA content was assessed in a nodal segment culture of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> under MeJA and MWCNT elicitors at 0, 50, 100 and 250 mg/L. Treated cultures with different concentrations of both MeJA and MWCNTs elicitors showed significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in RA content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). The amount of RA was increased under both treatments in nodal segments culture of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica.</italic> The highest amount of RA was obtained in nodal segments culture treated with 50 mg/L MeJA (140.99 mg/g DW, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>) and 250 mg/L MWCNTs (140.49 mg/g DW, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>), which was 2.43-fold higher than untreated cultures (57.87 mg/g DW). RA accumulation was enhanced by the addition of 50 mg/L of MWCNTs and MeJA, and then it noticeably decreased with 100 mg/L of both treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(A)</xref>). MWCNTs at 50 and 250 mg/L, raised RA contents to 113.54 and 140.49 mg/g DW, which was 1.96‐ and 2.42-fold higher than the content in the control, respectively, while the amounts of RA in nodal segments culture treated with 50 and 100 mg/L MeJA were higher than control (140.99 and 98.31 mg/L DW, respectively,
