<p>Non-treated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (nodal segments) extracts and callus derived from 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> were used in order to assess their ability to inhibit FsK growth. In an attempt to evaluate the impact of extracts and callus, FsK growth was significantly affected in all cases. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>, the aggregation of the control samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>) was higher than both 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> samples. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> nodal segments extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(B)</xref>) had a more inhibitory effect on FsK growth aggregation than 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(C)</xref>) one. The FsK aggregation was the lowest for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> extract in fresh weight (6.51 g, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(D)</xref>), dry weight (0.21 g, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(E)</xref>) and number of conidia (1.82 × 1010, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(F)</xref>), The results showed that the callus does not have any effect on the growth rate of FsK till the end of the 4th day, but significant result was observed on 5th day (2.75 mm, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">Figure 7(A–C)</xref>).
