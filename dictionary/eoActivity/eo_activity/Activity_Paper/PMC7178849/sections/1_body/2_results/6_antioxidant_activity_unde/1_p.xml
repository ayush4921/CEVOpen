<p>The free radical scavenging activity of the elicited samples was evaluated using DPPH and β-carotene leaching assays. The results indicated that the extracts obtained from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> plants treated with 100 mg/L MWCNTs and 200 mg/L SA exhibited a significant induction of antioxidant activity. It seems that 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> extracts possessed strong radical scavenging activity in comparison to a standard antioxidant trolox. It was also found that 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> hydromethanolic extract caused around 80% inhibition in formation of peroxidation products in comparing to its standard BHT (52.37%) in β-carotene bleaching test (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A,B)</xref>). The complementary measurement of antioxidant activity was done using β-carotene leaching test, and the similar tendency was found as DPPH assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(C,D)</xref>). The highest antioxidant activity in DDPH assay was observed in 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> extracts 48 h after MWCNTs treatment (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(B)</xref>). In β-carotene bleaching test, the highest values of antioxidant activity were obtained after 48 h from both MWCNTs and SA treatments (
