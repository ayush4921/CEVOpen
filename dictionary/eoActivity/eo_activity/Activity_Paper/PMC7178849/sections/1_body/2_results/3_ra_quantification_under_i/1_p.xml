<p>In this experiment, the RA content was investigated in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> derived shoots of 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> under both SA and MWCNTSs elicitors over a period of time from 0 to 72 h. The quantification of RA was performed by using the standard calibration curve method. 
 <italic>S. khuzistanica</italic> plants treated with 100 mg/L MWCNTs and 200 mg/L SA showed significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) in concentrations of RA at different time points after both treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>). The results demonstrated that the highest amount of RA was noticed at the time point of 24 h after the MWCNTSs treatment and 72 h after SA treatment (7.13 mg/g DW and 9.12 mg/g DW, respectively) which was 1.5- and 1.8-fold higher than untreated plants, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>). The RA content was increased under MWCNTSs elicitor, 24 h after treatment, while the reduction was observed at 48 h and reached to less than control after 72 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(B)</xref>). RA production was decreased 24 and 48 h after SA treatment (2.91 and 1.89 mg/g DW, respectively) while a dramatic increase was observed after 72 h from initial treatment (
