<p>Our results demonstrated that the level of enzyme activity decreases by enhancing the MWCNTs concentration that could be due to inactivation of related molecules by MWCNTs or other chemical interactions. This result was compatible with the result of Smirnova et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). They showed that peroxidase activity was enhanced in 
 <italic>Onobrychis arenaria</italic> (Kit.) DC. (Leguminosae) seedlings at the concentrations of 100 and 1,000 mg/L MWCNTs, which was significantly higher than the control (Smirnova et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The same results happened to CAT and APX enzymes in this study. It was shown that increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes is caused by exogenous application of MeJA (Anjum et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), leading to oxidative stress in plant cells. The antioxidant enzymes can play protective roles against the harmful effects of ROS, which is observed at initial moments of MeJA exposure (Afkar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The plants use enzymatic-antioxidant systems to minimise the damage caused by ROS (Smirnova et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In our study the enhancement of CAT, POD and APX enzyme activities can be due to stimulation of the defence system against ROS, while the decrease in the enzyme levels may be caused by hyper toxicity of ROS. As reported by Woodward and Bartel (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), the increase of peroxidase enzyme activity changes the plant stress hormone levels resulting in oxidative defence in plants. In accordance with the results of this study, the exogenous treatment of 
 <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> L. (Lamiaceae) with MeJA significantly increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes (POD, SOD) (Afkar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).
