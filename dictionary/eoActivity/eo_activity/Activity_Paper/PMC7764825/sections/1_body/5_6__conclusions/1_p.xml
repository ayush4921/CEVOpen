<p>To preserve rare and endangered plant species, along with classical methods of ex situ conservation, it is necessary to create so-called bioresource collections. Bioresource collections are not only physical stores of biological material (such as in vitro culture, callus cultures, DNA Bank, cryopreservation of samples, seed library, etc.) but also specialized databases containing a complete description of species from the collection of rare and endangered plant species (including botanical descriptions of populations, data on the genetic structure of populations, data on plant genotyping, genetic passports, etc.) posted on the Internet in open access. The data of bioresource collections must be updated with new data and samples of plants. The goals of bioresource collections are diverse: they could be of great scientific interest, and may serve educational purposes for students and researchers worldwide. The creation of such bioresource collections with a database will help the collaboration of research groups in large botanical gardens, which will more effectively preserve the biodiversity of rare and endangered plant species.</p>
