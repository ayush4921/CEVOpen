<p>Today, the in vitro culture method is widely used to solve the problems of preservation and restoration of the gene pool of rare and endangered plant species. In addition, this method is able to provide the material in a larger amount for plant breeding programs at specific sites. The endemic habitats of rare and endangered species are often hard to reach for various specific purposes. It is associated, first, with the formation of callus, suspension, meristematic cultures, cultures of ovules, anthers and pollen, cryosurgery of tissues; secondly, the development of technologies for reproduction with the prospect of their further dedifferentiation and redifferentiation. Creating plant in vitro collections can be considered as a protection form of plants of natural flora, and an effective method of their ex situ biodiversity preservation, which is part of the overall strategy for plant protection [
