<p>New methods in emerging and updated micropropagation of rare and endangered species of plants, standard technologies for selecting cultivation conditions are most often discussed. For rare plant species that have not been previously regenerated in vitro, it is very important to optimize the most effective combinations of macro- and microelements, vitamins, amino acids, growth regulators, as well as, sometimes, antibiotics and substances that bind phenolic compounds. It is necessary to take into account the chemical composition of the soil of plant communities where a rare plant grows, which is necessary for introduction into culture [
