<p>The MS medium both without the addition of phytohormones and with the introduction of 2 mg/L IBA showed similar values of the rooting percentageâ€”20% (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01733-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Most likely the concentration of endogenous auxins 
 <italic>A. hololeuca</italic> is high enough that the introduction of additional auxins from the outside inhibits the formation of roots. Thus, by direct organogenesis the technology of micropropagation for 
 <italic>A. hololeuca</italic> was developed. Acclimatization after in vitro cultivation has not yet been investigated. The high efficiency of using a mixture of alcohol and hydrogen peroxide at the initial stages of seed sterilization as explants was revealed. The mucus formation on the seeds when their shell is watered can complicate the process of sterilization of this type of explants. The combined use of cytokinin and auxin in the nutrient medium increases the proliferation rate of 
 <italic>A. hololeuca</italic> shoots. The MS medium without adding additional auxins is optimal for in vitro rhizogenesis of this plant species.
