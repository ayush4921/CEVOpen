<p>The described approaches do not solve the main problem associated with the high cost of technology, because of the need for periodic subculturing of plants. It is possible to completely abandon subcultures, only if the mitotic activity and metabolic processes are completely stopped. Therefore, as a result, the growth of preserved plants is stopped, which is achieved by cryopreservation methods. Long-term storage of meristems can be achieved by several cryopreservation methods including slow freezing, vitrification (rapid freezing), and encapsulation-dehydration. The first method is based on slow cooling (usually to −40 °C), the use of cryoprotectors, and rapid immersion in liquid nitrogen followed by storage and thawing [
