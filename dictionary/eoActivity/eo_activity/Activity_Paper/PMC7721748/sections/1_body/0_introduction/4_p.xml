<p id="Par5">The biological activities of the EOs may include antiseptics, antimicrobials, antifungals, antioxidant, antitumor, antivirals, and/or anti-inflammatories. Moreover, these activities vary according to the chemical constitution, which may differ from plant to another according to their geographic location, agriculture conditions, climatic or seasonal changes

 </sup>. Noteworthy, the evaluation of the EOs' bioactivities cannot be constantly credited to one single compound in the EOs mixture. The genuine connections between the EO’s cocktail and its biological activities are highly non-linear, especially when considered across variable pools of chemical structures. Hence, reliance on traditional techniques in predicting the biological impact for such activity data with this variety of structures is a troublesome issue
