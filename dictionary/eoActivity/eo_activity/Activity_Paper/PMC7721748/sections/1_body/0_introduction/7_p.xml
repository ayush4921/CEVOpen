<p id="Par8">This study seeks to classify and predict the biological activities of the Egyptian essential oil-producing plants based on their EOs content as an experimental case study. The classification is implemented based on two algorithms: Multiclass Neural Network (MNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to evaluate the efficiency of both machine and deep learning techniques. The effective algorithm is adopted in developing a biological activity prediction model EOs-producing cases cultivated in Egypt. The research skills in this study are organized as follow; first, presenting the results obtained from implementing the two algorithms; MNN as a machine learning algorithm and CNN as a deep learning algorithm, when applied on the Egyptian essential oils dataset. Next, these results were discussed and evaluated for the existing dataset and the new untested datasets. Finally the methodologies followed in this work are discussed.</p>
