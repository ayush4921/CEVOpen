<p id="par0115">To investigate the cytotoxic effect of PPD on HaCaT cells, cells were treated with various concentrations of PPD from 0 to 400 μM for 48 h. When cells were treated with PPD 100 μM for 48 h or 72 h, the cell viability appeared to be reduced significantly in a dose dependent manner (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). The viability of HaCaT cells following the treatment of PPD 100, 200 and 400 μM declined to the level of 60.1 %, 47.4 %, and 37.2 % at 48 h and 52.4 %, 34.8 %, and 9.5 % at 72 h, respectively, as compared to the control. Based on these results, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for PPD was about 200 μM at 48 h. Furthermore, the morphological change was also observed by increasing treatment of PPD (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, the number of cells significantly decreased, and morphological alteration including enlargement of the cells, forming a variety of shapes, cell shrinkage, blebbling of plasma membrane occurred.
