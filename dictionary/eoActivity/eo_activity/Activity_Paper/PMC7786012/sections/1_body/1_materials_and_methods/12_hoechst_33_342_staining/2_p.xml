<p id="par0100">The protective effect of RSE on PPD induced DNA damage was evaluated by Hoechst33342 staining. HaCaT cells were seeded in a 6 well culture plate with 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/wells. After overnight incubation, cells were pretreated with various concentrations of RSE (0, 2.5, 5, 10 μg/mL) for 4 h before PPD treatment at 37 °C. 2 days later, the cells were washed and stained with Hoechst staining solution (5 μg/mL) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature in the dark condition. Then cells were rinsed with PBS, and nuclear morphological changes were observed under an EVOS fluorescent microscope (Advanced Microscopy Group, Bothell, WA, USA).
