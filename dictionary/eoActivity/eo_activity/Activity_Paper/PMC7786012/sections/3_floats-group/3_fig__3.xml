  <p>Effect of RSE on PPD induced apoptosis in HaCaT cells.</p>
  <p>(A) Annexin V-FITC and PI staining of HaCaT cells following treatment with RSE prior to PPD induced apoptosis. Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of RSE for 4 h before PPD treatment. After 48 h, the cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC and /or propidium iodide and analyzed by using flow cytometry. (B) Equivalent cells were stained by hoechst 33,342 dye and visualized under the fluorescence microscope. (C) Western blot analysis of caspase-9, caspase-3, cleavage of PARP and Î²-actin.</p>
