  <p>Protective effect of gallic acid on PPD- induce HaCaT cells.</p>
  <p>HaCaT cells were exposed to PPD (200 μM) with or without gallic acid for 48 h. (A) Morphological changes in HaCaT cells were observed using an inverted microscope after treatment of PPD for 48 h. (B) Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. For cell viability analysis, HaCaT cells were seeded on a culture plate, and treated with various concentrations of gallic acid prior to PPD induction. (C) Equivalent cells were stained by hoechst 33,342 dye and visualized under the fluorescence microscope. The analysis was mean of triplicated measurements ± SD of three separate experiments. *
