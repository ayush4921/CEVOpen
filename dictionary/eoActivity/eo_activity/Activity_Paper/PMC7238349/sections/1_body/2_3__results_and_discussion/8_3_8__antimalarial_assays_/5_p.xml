 <italic>Aloe vera</italic>. The methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> were assessed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for its antiplasmodial potency against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain with 50% inhibition of 32 to 77 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The anthrone C-glucoside homonataloin isolated inhibited the strains with activity of 13.46 ± 1.36 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (IC
 <sub>50</sub>); similarly, homonataloin displayed activities of 107.20 ± 4.14 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. C-glycosylated anthrones, that is, nataloin and 7-hydroxyaloin, two isolated compounds in 
 <italic>Aloe pulcherrima</italic>, displayed significant dose-independent activities on plasmodia strain using 4-day suppressive test. Pronounced activity of 56.2% was observed at 200 mg/kg/day in 48 h, which support the ethnomedical claims of the plant [
