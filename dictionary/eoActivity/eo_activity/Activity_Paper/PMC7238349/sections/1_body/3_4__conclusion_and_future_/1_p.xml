<p>Malaria is a universal civic health peril, and recent drug resistance of the parasite is a persistent concern. This study shows that a highly diverse set of native medicinal herbs is currently used for the management of malaria in Nigeria. Based on the results, there is substantial indication that the traditional use of antimalarial medicinal plants by Yoruba ethnics (studied areas) is driven by important therapeutic agents, which could be elucidated structurally and further established by

 <italic>in vivo</italic> investigations. In recent times, the growing interest in phytoremediation of malaria led to the isolation and characterization of bioactive compounds in medicinal plants (
