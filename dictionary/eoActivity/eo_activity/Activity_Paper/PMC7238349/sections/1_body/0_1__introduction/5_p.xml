<p>Tropical plants are identified to contain high proportions of natural chemical compounds and a greater diversity than plants from any other biome. Thus, they are potential sources of new medicines [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The increased number of drug-resistant strains makes the development of novel antimalarial urgent. The high cost of malaria treatment has left the poor masses of Nigeria heavily reliant on traditional practitioners and medicinal plants for the treatment of the disease. It seems logical to encourage studies on plants from these regions, especially since the major proportions of malaria attributable deaths occur in sub-Saharan African regions. Although several compounds had achieved success at treating malaria diseases, the emerging threats of drug resistance by some plasmodium species call for the development of new molecules with novel bioactive features. The study explores the ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological appraisal of antimalarial plants used by people of Omu Aran, Ogbomoso, Ado Ekiti, and Sagamu communities in Nigeria. Hence, the search for novel natural antimalarial molecules in selected plant sources via ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological investigation is clearly justified.
