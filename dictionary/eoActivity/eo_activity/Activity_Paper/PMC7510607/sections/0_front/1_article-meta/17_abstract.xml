  <italic>Bletilla striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. is one of the commonly used traditional Chinese medicine with tuber as medicine. We report herein the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
  <italic>Bletilla striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. It has a length of 159,491 bp, which contained a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,778 bp and a large single-copy (LSC) region of 87,139 bp, separated by two copies of an inverted repeat (IR) of 26,787 bp. The chloroplast genome contains 114 unique genes, including 80 PCG, 30 tRNA, and 4 rRNA genes. In addition, 18 genes contained one or two introns, which of those including 10 PCG genes possess a single intron, and 2 PCG genes harbor two introns; and 6 tRNA genes harbor a single intron. In this study, 
  <italic>Bletilla stariata</italic> is sister to 
  <italic>Bletilla formosana</italic> and clustered within the group consisting of the species that belong to Orchiidaceae.
