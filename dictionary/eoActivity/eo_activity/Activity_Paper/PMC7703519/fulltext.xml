These agile approaches were classified into 3 categories, namely, where health and regulatory authorities had: (1) facilitated product management across the entire lifecycle, notably in expediting medical product use for COVID-19, ensuring the continuity of clinical trials, and addressing supply chain issues; (2) strengthened international cooperation; and (3) addressed regulatory burden with the adoption of electronic and digital tools.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications</title><p>While many regulatory measures have been introduced temporarily as a response to the COVID-19 crisis, there are opportunities for leveraging an understanding from these approaches in order to collectively achieve more efficient regulatory systems and to mitigate and address the impact of COVID-19 and further future-proof the regulatory environment.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key words</title><kwd>agilities</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>global response</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>regulatory science</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">A global pandemic of the magnitude of COVID-19 has a significant, even transformative, impact on health care, particularly on those involved in developing COVID-19&#x02013;related treatments, medical devices, and vaccines, and on those who ensure that already-approved medical products remain available to patients.</p><p id="p0015">To address the effects of COVID-19 and to simultaneously ensure the continuity of development of non-COVID treatments, regulators have demonstrated significant regulatory agility while maintaining high standards of quality, tolerability, and effectiveness.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0020">Regulators have adopted and made public crucial steps to raise awareness and to provide guidance to stakeholders on how to respond and navigate the current pandemic. In doing so, they have demonstrated tremendous agility. This review provides a comprehensive overview and assessment of these steps and of the approaches made available by regulatory authorities. Through this, we include reflections on some lessons learned and how to leverage solutions that continue to provide value-added, streamlined regulatory processes, or to address regulatory burden for the benefit of all stakeholders; from the medical-product developers through the regulators to health care practitioners&#x000a0;for the ultimate benefit of patients.</p><p id="p0025">In this paper, we present several documents or informational materials related to the regulatory environment around the development and management of medical products concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these documents refer to actions, initiatives, or exceptional approaches where health or regulatory authorities have either: (1) advanced existing initiatives aimed at agile and responsive regulatory systems and processes; or (2) introduced new and innovative ways to expedite and improve such processes. For the purpose of this review, we refer to <italic>regulatory agility</italic> as the willingness of authorities to take quick action within the accepted regulatory framework to ensure that the regulatory ecosystem swiftly responds to the challenges imposed by the pandemic for the ultimate benefit of patients and society as a whole.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="p0030">The data collected for this analysis were extracted by the authors from COVID-19&#x02013;related information (eg, guidance, guidelines, notices, administrative communications) issued by health authorities in selected markets and regional and international bodies (the African Union, the European Commission, the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Pan American Health Organization, and the World Health Organization [WHO]) from January to July 2020 during the initial outbreak. These relate to information that has an impact on the policy environment around the development or lifecycle management of medical products. The information was sourced from the official websites of health authorities or bodies, when available, but excluded policies or information related to confinement and lockdown measures or to situational reports (eg, monitoring the number of cases in a region or country).</p><p id="p0035">The documents were then classified by zone, country, regulatory authority, information format, and topic area. These documents were also further classified into what we refer to as &#x0201c;regulatory agilities&#x0201d; by flagging those that explicitly indicate, within the text, the use of exceptional measures or flexible approaches of a regulation or regulatory process, which ultimately aim to facilitate the review, approval, and availability of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic within the January to July 2020 time frame. We have then used these data as a basis for extracting trends, learnings, and potential ways forward. To put trends and learnings into perspective, additional information was gathered through a literature review and analysis of related data available from the public domain, as were the authors' experiences within the company.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><title>Figures&#x000a0;on COVID-19&#x02013;related Documents and Information</title><p id="p0040">As of July 2020, we collected 1705 documents and informational materials related to the policy environment affecting the development and management of COVID-19 medical products based on the aforementioned methodology. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>

To fully benefit from the gains achieved in the United States of these agile regulatory approaches and extracted lessons for the future, it would be useful to conduct ex-post or postimplementation reviews. These reviews would allow regulators to determine which specific approaches resulted in the most gains across the sector and to identify those that can be introduced temporarily during emergency situations or permanently adopted.

At the heart of the attention is the tremendous commitment from health authorities and regulators to ensure that communication channels remain open across stakeholders in order to collectively address the impact of the pandemic. Health authorities and regulators have responded promptly and communicated widely. They have provided guidance and demonstrated regulatory agility to complement efforts in the industry. These approaches have ensured that COVID-19 medical products are developed and made available to society, that new medical innovations under development continue to progress, and that existing medical products remain available to patients around the world. Such guidance and agile approaches remain valuable in addressing this crisis and in future situations, especially when they are consistent and aligned across regulatory authorities.</p><p id="p0240">The current pandemic has provided lessons learned in addressing global emergency situations, and these experiences&#x02014;both the challenges and solutions adopted&#x02014;can be leveraged for preparation for any future situations and can serve as an opportunity to reflect on current regulatory processes and tools. The authors propose that all relevant stakeholders work together to arrive at concrete proposals and actions in adopting learnings identified from agile approaches used during the COVID-19 crisis. Initiatives to review learnings are being undertaken by some health and regulatory authorities to embed enhancements into future regulatory processes. In some instances, it may help agencies to &#x0201c;leapfrog&#x0201d; into contemporary approaches (ie, maturing regulatory agencies looking into advancing their regulatory processes and systems and strengthening collaboration with other regulatory agencies and stakeholders).</p><p id="p0245">The use of digital tools during the pandemic has also been remarkable and has facilitated the continuity of business operations.
