 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). Around 60% constituted documents that came in the form of communications (including announcement, notices, press releases, and circulars); 22%, guidance (including policies); 7% in the form of laws (including regulations, statutes, directives); and the rest as publications or “other.” In terms of topic area (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ), excluding the category “other,” most documents referred to information on clinical trials, safety, or multidisciplinary areas. The category “other” referred to documents and information that could not be otherwise classified (eg, agency operation and continuity, procurement, data protection, coordination mechanisms and platforms, meetings and response documents, among others).
