<p>There is often a discrepancy between the potential for an herb–drug interaction, as shown in preclinical (in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo) research, and what actually occurs in clinical practice. This discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a number of processes induced by the herbal compound affecting the bioavailability of the active components of the conventional drug. Curcumin is one of the most investigated herbal products being used by oncology patients, as mentioned earlier. Preclinical research has shown a wide range of effects induced by this herb on drug metabolism, many of which are contradictory to one another. For example, curcumin has been shown to increase CYP3A4 activity [

 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceuticals-13-00455" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Curcumin has also been shown to both increase and decrease P-gp activity, as well as that of the transport protein MDR-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels [
