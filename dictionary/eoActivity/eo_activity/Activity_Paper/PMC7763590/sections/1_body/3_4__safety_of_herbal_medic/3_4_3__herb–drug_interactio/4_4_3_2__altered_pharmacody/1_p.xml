<p>As with conventional drugs, herbal compounds have the potential to alter the pharmacodynamics of conventional anticancer drugs. The most well-known and researched of these is hypericum or St. John’s wort (
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic>). Hypericum’s widespread use is a result of the extensive research showing its efficacy in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders [

However, as the use of this herb became more popular, physicians treating patients with kidney and heart transplants began to see more and more cases of organ rejection, despite the insistence of patients that they were diligent in their adherence to the antirejection immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin. It was discovered that patients showing signs of organ rejection had recently begun taking hypericum for depression and anxiety, which led to the discovery that the active component of the herb, hyperforin, was causing a significant reduction in cyclosporin serum levels. The mechanism for this effect involved two aspects of drug metabolism: induction of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, thereby increasing the metabolism of many drugs, including cyclosporin; and increased activity of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transport protein which inhibits gastrointestinal absorption of conventional medications. It was qshown that the ingestion of hypericum supplements, through the induction of the two enzymes, led to subtherapeutic plasma cyclosporine levels, with rejection of transplanted organs as a result [
