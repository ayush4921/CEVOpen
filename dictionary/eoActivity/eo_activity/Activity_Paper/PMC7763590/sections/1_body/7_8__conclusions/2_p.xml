<p>The multidisciplinary approach can increase the likelihood that oncology patients are using herbal medicine in a safe and effective fashion. With oncologists, pharmacists, and integrative physicians working together for this purpose, patients will most likely be more willing to disclose their current or planned use of herbal medicinal products, facilitating a nonjudgmental and patient-centered conversation about this practice. For this to occur, integrative physicians should be included as part of the conventional oncology staff, serving as “gatekeepers” with respect to the use of nonconventional modalities, identifying the use of herbal and other complementary medicine modalities, and providing evidence-based guidance on the safe and effective use of these practices. Further research of the multidisciplinary collaboration is needed to better understand the implications of the sum of the parts, as opposed to each discipline (oncologist, pharmacist, and integrative physician) on its own.</p>
