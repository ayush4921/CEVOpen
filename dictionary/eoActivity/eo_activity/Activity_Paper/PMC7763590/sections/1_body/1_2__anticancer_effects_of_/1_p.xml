<p>While research has shown that many herbal compounds consistently demonstrate significant anticancer activity, the overwhelming majority of this research has been conducted in the preclinical (in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo) setting. Explanatory clinical research (randomized, controlled trials) of herbal medicine in the treatment of cancer is limited by a number of factors, which include difficulty in obtaining funding from private sources, since herbal compounds and formulas cannot be easily patented in most Western countries; a shortage of clinical researchers with an interest in an ability to conduct rigorous clinical trials in this particular field; and a reluctance on the part of conventional oncology departments to allow such research to take place in their centers, especially on patients participating in pharmaceutical company-funded research in which the use of herbal medicine is considered as an exclusion criterion.</p>
