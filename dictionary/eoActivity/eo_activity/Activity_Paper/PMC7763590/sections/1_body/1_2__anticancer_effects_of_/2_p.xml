<p>In many cases, the significant anticancer activity of many herbal compounds observed in basic science studies is not translated into a similar effect in clinical research. An example of this is the active component of the spice turmeric (
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, curcumin). A recent PubMed search using the keyword “curcumin” yielded nearly 16,000 references, with 6000 of them related to the treatment of cancer. However, only 70 of these papers are itemized as clinical research, and although the overwhelming majority of the preclinical studies show the significant anticancer activity of curcumin, clinical research has yet to show any statistically significant benefit of this herb on treatment outcomes or symptom load [

This discrepancy has been attributed to curcumin’s poor gastrointestinal absorption and rapid metabolism, which has prevented researchers from achieving what they believe to be therapeutic levels of the herbal compound in the patient’s serum [
