<p id="Par6">The elements captured from this question reveal information both about the items mentioned, as well as about the people who listed them, showing remarkable data in a community/culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], such as the importance of items based on the community’s consensus (frequency of convergent reports) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; the local preference for components used during the interview period of time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; the determination of local specialists, since large lists characterize the most knowledgeable people [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the listing order of the items, in which those an individual mentions first are cognitively prominent or “salient” in relation to the last ones [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Items’ order in lists, together with the number of times the item is cited, serves to calculate the Salience Index [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that determines the cultural relevance of a term or element. However, some studies use the free list without taking the Salience Index into account in their analyses and only draw items based on the cross-list frequency of the item’s mentions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
