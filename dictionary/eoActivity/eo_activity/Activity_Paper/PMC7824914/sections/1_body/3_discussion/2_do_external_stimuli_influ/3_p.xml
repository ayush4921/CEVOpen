<p id="Par60">In ethnobiological research, interviews can take place in various environments, such as, at the participant’s home, close to home, at the workplace, among others and in living spaces. Among those, the living space is the least suitable in opposition to the other places, where the participants have a greater control of the spaces [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In the studied community, the interviews were conducted at the participant’s house, the neighbor’s house and at the workplace (within the community), a very familiar environment and perhaps that is the reason the place has not influenced on the collection of information, as the selected space prepares a relaxed and enjoyable environment for the interview.
