 <p>3-alkyl-5-aryl-1-pyrimidyl-1
  <italic>H</italic>-pyrazole derivatives were designed and synthesised as selective inhibitors of JNK3, a target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Following previous studies, we have designed JNK3 inhibitors to reduce the molecular weight and successfully identified a lead compound that exhibits equipotent activity towards JNK3. Kinase profiling results also showed high selectivity for JNK3 among 38 kinases. Among the derivatives, the IC

  <italic>H</italic>-pyrazol-3-yl)acetonitrile exhibited 227â€‰nM, showing the highest inhibitory activity against JNK3.
