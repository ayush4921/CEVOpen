<p>Next, we used kinase panel screening in duplicate for compound 
 <bold>7a</bold> over 38 different kinases at a single-dose concentration of 10 μM (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The compound was indeed a selective JNK3 inhibitor with an excellent selectivity profile. This compound has an inhibitory activity of 90% on JNK3 at a concentration of 10 μM; the inhibition activity was less than 20% for most other kinases except GSK3β, but for which, was also six fold selective in terms of IC
 <sub>50</sub>.
