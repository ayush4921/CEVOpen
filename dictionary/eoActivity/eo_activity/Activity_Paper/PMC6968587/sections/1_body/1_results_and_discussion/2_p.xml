<p>All of the synthesised compounds, 
 <bold>7a</bold>–
 <bold>7f</bold>, 
 <bold>8a</bold>–
 <bold>8f, 9a</bold>–
 <bold>9f,</bold> and 
 <bold>10a</bold>–
 <bold>10f</bold> were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against JNK3 (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). First, we investigated the effect of the aryl group on their activity. The larger aryl groups such as the naphthyl and dichlorophenyl bound at position 5, elicited more potent activity towards JNK3 (
 <bold>a, b vs. e, f</bold>). This seems to be related to the electron density of the aromatic ring due to the sulfur-π interaction in the active site of JNK3. Compared to the mono-substituted phenyl groups, the relatively electron-rich dichlorophenyl and naphthyl groups could have formed a stronger π–π interaction, which may affect the activity. Next, to investigate the effect of the substituent at position 3, the compound 
 <bold>7a</bold> was hydrolysed to convert it to an amide and a methyl ester (
 <bold>11a, 12a</bold>). As a result, the existing nitrile was the best in terms of potency, but not a noticeable difference. In an effort to reduce the molecular weight, the piperidine ring was diversified into pyrrolidine and azetidine with less carbon atoms. Surprisingly, when (
 <italic>R</italic>)-aminopyrrolidine was coupled to the pyrimidyl group instead of the (
 <italic>S</italic>)-aminopiperidine, the activities were increased approximately two to three fold (
 <bold>7a vs 8a, 7b vs 8b, 7c vs 8c, 7d vs 8d</bold>). This also suggested that the configuration of the amino group in the ring should be considered important for binding, even in the solvent exposure part for optimal extra-hydrogen bonding. The extra hydrogen bonding seemed more plausible in (
 <italic>R</italic>)-pyrrolidine (
 <bold>8</bold>) than in both cases of (
 <italic>S</italic>)-piperidine (
 <bold>7</bold>) and (
 <italic>S</italic>)-pyrrolidine (
 <bold>9</bold>) in the docking structures (
