   <italic>albiflora</italic> Benth. white flower phenotypic appearance (Photo courtesy of Dr B Loedolff) and 
   <bold>b</bold> its corresponding acetonitrile (75%) extract, HPTLC phytochemical profile. Whole flower metabolite extractions were prepared using various extraction solvents and, the acetonitrile (75%) extracts were selected for downstream analyses. The phytochemical profile was developed fully (mobile phase; chloroform:methanol 9:1, stationary phase; silica
   <sub>60Å</sub>) before reagent visualization (0.1% Fast blue B salt dissolved in 1 mM NaOH) was applied to reveal potential pCB candidates, based solely on an red–orange colour development. Compound 
   <italic>x</italic> (Rf value: 0.55) represents a colorimetric-specific pCB-like candidate compound which was selected for further LC–MS/MS analyses
