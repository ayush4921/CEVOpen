<p id="Par22">A single, potential pCB-like compound (distinct red–orange colour, R
 <sub>f</sub> 0.55; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) was isolated, and its identity tentatively determined using LC–MS/MS in both positive and negative ionization modes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, b). Mass spectra from whole flower extracts and the isolated HPTLC compound were compared (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d) resulting in equivalent retention times and peak masses in both negative (RT: 30.78 min; [M−H]
 <sup>−</sup> = 374.26) and positive (RT: 30.77 min; [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup>  = 376.26) ionization mode. Further investigation using the international metabolite repositories, Metabolomics Workbench, PubChem, and METLIN Metabolite and Chemical Entity Database, consistently grouped this compound as a fatty amide with tentative identification as 7,10,13,16-Docosatetraenoylethanolamine ([M–H]
 <sup>−</sup> = 374.31; [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup>  = 376.32; neutral m/z = 375.31), also known as adrenoyl-ethanolamide (EA). Adrenoyl-EA is a bioactive endocannabinoid previously thought to be unique to mammals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, it has recently (and for the first time) been confirmed to occur in methanol extracts of the Mashua plant (
 <italic>Tropaeolum tuberosum</italic>), extensively used in Andean folk medicine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Our findings tentatively identify the occurrence of a pCB-like compound (predicted to be like adrenoyl-EA) in acetonitrile extracts from the flowers of
