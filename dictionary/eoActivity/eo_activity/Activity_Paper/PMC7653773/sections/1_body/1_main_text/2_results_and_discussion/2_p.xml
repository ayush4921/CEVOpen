<p id="Par21">Based on its mild Cannabis-like effect when smoked, we conducted analyses into the flower-derived phytochemicals and the potential presence of pCB-like compounds in 
 <italic>L. leonurus</italic> var. 
 <italic>albiflora</italic> Benth. (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Since extensive phytochemical profiling of the leaves have never yielded any pCB-like compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], we suspected that such compounds may be present in flowers (akin to Cannabis). Using HPTLC, coupled to fast blue B salt as a selective colorimetric detection method for pCB compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we extracted flower metabolites with gradient concentrations (50, 75 and 100%) of either methanol or acetonitrile (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1). The fast blue method detects major neutral cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and their cannabinoid acid derivatives THCA and CBDA, among other cannabinoids with high sensitivity and selectivity [
