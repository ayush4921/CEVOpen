<p>Phenolic compounds are present in most food and medicinal plants, and their antioxidant activity and other pharmacological effects have been reported [
 <xref rid="B93-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The antioxidative effect of phenolics in edible sources have been regarded that the phenolics retard oxidative degradation of lipids by direct quenching of ROS [
 <xref rid="B94-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. The studies on the molecular mechanism of health promoting effects of phenolics in edible plants that unraveled the bioactivities are also associated with the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory cascades involved with HO-1. The phenolic compounds are the largest family of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory natural products inducing HO-1 to exert a variety of bioactivities including hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, antiobestic, antidiabetic activity and so on.
