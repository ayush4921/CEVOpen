<p>Curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) is the main bioactive phenolic compounds present in turmeric, a spice with a variety of medicinal functions including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B156-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>], antimutagenic and antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B157-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>,
 <xref rid="B158-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>] activity. A number of research groups has reported the induction of HO-1 expression by curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) and the association with its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activity, furthermore, the therapeutic and preventive potential for the related diseases since the first report on its HO-1 inducing activity [
 <xref rid="B159-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. The early investigations on induction of HO-1 by curcumin have markedly contributed to extending the understanding of the molecular mechanism of antioxidant effects exerted by HO-1. Curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) was identified as a potent inducer of HO-1 in vascular endothelial cells and the increased heme oxygenase activity is an important component in curcumin-mediated cytoprotection against oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B160-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. Hill-Kapturczak et al. elucidated the mechanism of HO-1 induction by curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) was involved in the NF-κB pathway in human renal cells [
 <xref rid="B161-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. In the course of the study on antioxidant potential of curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>), it was discovered that stimulation of 
 <italic>ho</italic>-1 gene activity could promote inactivation of the Nrf2–Keap1 complex, leading to increased Nrf2 binding to the resident 
 <italic>ho</italic>-1 AREs [
 <xref rid="B162-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. McNally et al. discovered that PKC and p38 MAPK activity are required for full induction of HO-1 in the course of their study using curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) [

 <xref rid="B166-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>], hepatoprotective effects by curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) pretreatment was involved in the dose- and time-dependent induction of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B167-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. Furthermore, the HO-1 induction exhibited inhibition of hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication along with AKT pathway inhibition [
 <xref rid="B168-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. The induction of HO-1 expression by curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) may protect human retinal pigment epithelial cells against oxidative stress by reducing ROS levels [
 <xref rid="B169-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. The recent study on the hepatoprotective potential of curcumin demonstrated that hepatic chronic inflammation could be ameliorated through the activation of HO-1 by curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B170-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Cisplatin is a standard chemotherapeutic agent for solid malignances, in spite of the high incidence of side effects including ototoxicity [
 <xref rid="B171-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Fetoni et al. reported that curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) treatment attenuated hearing loss induced by cisplatin via curcumin-mediated upregulation of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B172-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>) also protected SH-SY5Y cells against appoptosin-induced intrinsic caspase-dependent apoptosis by upregulating HO-1, attenuating accumulation of intracellular heme and ROS [
 <xref rid="B173-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. Oregonin (
 <bold>30</bold>) is a glucose-conjugated diarylheptanoid, which shares the same structural backbone with curcumin (
 <bold>29</bold>). Oregonin (
 <bold>30</bold>) is known as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent isolated from leaves of 
 <italic>Alnus formosana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B174-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>], and the bioactivities are also involved in the induction of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B175-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. A diarylheptanoid with cyclic structure, acerogenin A (
 <bold>31</bold>) from Japanese folk medicine 
 <italic>Acer nikoense</italic>, showed neuroprotective effects and ROS reduction on glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by inducing the expression of HO-1 [
 <xref rid="B176-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. Structures of the diarylheptanoids (
