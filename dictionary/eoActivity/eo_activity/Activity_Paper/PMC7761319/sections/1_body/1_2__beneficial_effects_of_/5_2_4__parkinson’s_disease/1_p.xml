<p>Parkinson’s disease is one of the major neurodegenerative disorders of uncertain pathogenesis characterized by the loss of the dopaminergic neurons [

Hung et al. utilized an adenovirus containing human HO-1 gene and injected it into rat substantia nigra concomitantly with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium that causes parkinsonism. Overexpression of HO-1 significantly increased the survival rate of dopaminergic neurons, and reduced the production of TNF-α and IL-1β in substantia nigra [

Another in vivo study revealed that intracerebral administration of a natural HO-1 inducer also suppressed the dopaminergic neuronal loss and behavioral dysfunction in the 6-OHDA mouse model. Dopaminergic neurons from oxidative stress were protected by upregulation of glial expression of HO-1 [
