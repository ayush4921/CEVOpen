<p>Hepatic fibrosis is overly exuberant wound healing that excessive connective tissue builds up in the liver [
 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It is an integral part in chronic liver disease progression, ultimately leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [
 <xref rid="B44-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. HO-1 has been implicated to play an important role in antioxidative stress and cytoprotective systems in the liver. Increased level of HO-1 induced SIRT1 and ameliorated fructose-mediated liver fibrosis by decreasing vascular dysfunction in mice [
 <xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cobalt protoporphyrin (CoPP), a HO-1 inducer, was able to suppress oxidative stress markers and negate HO-1 decrease by fructose intake [
 <xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. On the other hand, HO-1 deficiency in mouse models and human caused severe chronic hepatic inflammation, iron deposition and oxidative damage in the liver [

 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Most importantly, HO-1 induction reduced liver damage and chronic inflammation by regulating immune cell infiltration or proliferation and TNF receptor signaling in Mdr2 knockout mice, a genetic mouse model of chronic liver inflammation and fibrogenesis [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Fibrosis progression was significantly reduced by HO-1 induction with CoPP [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Although the therapeutic potential of HO-1 and its mechanism of action are still largely unknown in patients, upregulation of HO-1 gene expression is a potential future clinical implication to improve metabolic balance and attenuate hepatic fibrosis.
