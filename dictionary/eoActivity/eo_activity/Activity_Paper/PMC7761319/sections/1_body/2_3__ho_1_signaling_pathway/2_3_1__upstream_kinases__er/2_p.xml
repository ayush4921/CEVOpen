<p>JNK is another member of MAPK that plays a central role in stress signaling pathways implicated in gene expression, neuronal plasticity and regulation of cellular senescence [
 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Pharmacological inhibitor studies showed that JNK regulates the HO-1 expression level [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In rat hepatocytes, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 decreased HO-1 mRNA expression mediated by sodium arsenite [

 <xref rid="B59-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Pretreatment of SP600125 suppressed Nrf2 translocation under the oxidative stress signal [
