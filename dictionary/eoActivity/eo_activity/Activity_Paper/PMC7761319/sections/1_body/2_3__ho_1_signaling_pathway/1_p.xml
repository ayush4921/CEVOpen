<p>Considering the clinical implications of HO-1 mentioned above, elucidating the signaling pathway of HO-1 and understanding the molecular mechanism are crucial. Here we categorize HO-1 signaling pathway into two segments: upstream kinases and transcription factors of HO-1. Key proteins that regulate transcription factors of HO-1 include extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 and Akt (

Transcription factors that bind to upstream of the initiation site of HO-1 to stimulate its mRNA expression include nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). After expressed by the regulator proteins, HO-1 affects downstream elements such as Heme, bilirubin and carbon monoxide (CO).
