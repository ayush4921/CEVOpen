<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA that govern post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and affect a wide range of protein expression [
 <xref rid="B86-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. There are several miRNAs that downregulate HO-1 both directly and indirectly. miR-217, miR-377, miR-1254 and miR-24-3p directly regulate HO-1 translation. miR-217 and miR-377 in combination showed no change in HMOX1 mRNA levels, but a significant reduction in HO-1 protein expression and enzyme activity [
 <xref rid="B87-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The two miRNAs were able to bind to the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of human HMOX1 [
 <xref rid="B87-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. miR-1254 suppresses HO-1 expression at the post-transcriptional level by directly targeting HO-1 3′ UTR [
 <xref rid="B86-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Pu et al. found that HO-1 expression was inversely correlated with miR-1254 level in human cells [

 <xref rid="B88-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. miR-122 and miR-494 indirectly regulate the HO-1 expression level. Antagomir of miR-122 induced HO-1 mRNA levels in vitro [
 <xref rid="B89-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In contrast, miR-494 upregulates the HO-1 expression level. Endogenous miR-494 inhibition impaired HO-1 induction in response to H
