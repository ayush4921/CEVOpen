<p>Akt, a substrate of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a key role in oxidative damage response [

 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Mo et al. found that hydrogen peroxide enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and that treatment with LY294002, a selective inhibitor of PI3K, suppressed Akt phosphorylation and hydrogen peroxide-induced HO-1 expression [
 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Another study also confirmed the role of the PI3K-Akt pathway on HO-1 expression and further elucidated that Nrf2 is involved in the process. Pretreatment of LY294002 prevented nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and inhibited HO-1 induction in RAW 264.7 cells [
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In sum, ERK, JNK, p38 and PI3K-Akt pathways govern the HO-1 expression level primarily by regulating important transcription factors such as Nrf2 and NF-ÎºB.
