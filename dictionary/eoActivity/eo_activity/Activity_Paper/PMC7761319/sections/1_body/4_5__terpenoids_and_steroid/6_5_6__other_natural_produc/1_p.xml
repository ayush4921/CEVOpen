<p>Astaxanthin (
 <bold>89</bold>) is a blood-red pigment that belongs to xanthophyll, which is present in many aquatic organisms such as krill, algae, shrimp, salmon and so on [
 <xref rid="B269-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>]. It is produced commercially from large cultures of microalga, 
 <italic>Haematococcus pluvialis</italic> as an ingredient for dietary supplements and fish feeds [

 <bold>89</bold>) could also ameliorate the chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin-induced liver injury through the Keap1/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in mice [

 <bold>90</bold>) is classified as a nonaisoprenoid, and it is known to be present in tobacco, potato and tomato [
 <xref rid="B271-antioxidants-09-01191" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>]. Yao et al. suggested that the anti-inflammatory activity of solanesol (
 <bold>90</bold>) also comes from induction of expression of HO-1 via p38 and Akt and suppression of proinflammatory cytokines production [
