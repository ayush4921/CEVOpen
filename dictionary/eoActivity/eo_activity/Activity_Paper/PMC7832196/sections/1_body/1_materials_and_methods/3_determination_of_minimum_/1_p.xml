<p>280 μL of mixed solution of Mueller–Hinton Broth (MHB) and two-fold myticaganal C (8000 μg/mL) or ampicillin (200 μg/mL) was filled in the first well of 96-well plate. Wells 2–8 had 140 μL MHB. To prepare myticaganal C concentrations of 62.5–8000 μg/mL or ampicillin concentrations of 1.56–200 μg/mL, 140 μL aliquot from the first well was pipetted and filled into the next well to make a two-fold serial microdilution in the 96-well plate. 50 μL of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> suspension was added into each well. The 96-well plate was then incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Then, 0.015% resazurin (10 μL) was added into each well, and it was further incubated before measuring for a color change. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest concentration of the tested compound that prevented oxidation of the blue dye to a pink resorufin product.[
