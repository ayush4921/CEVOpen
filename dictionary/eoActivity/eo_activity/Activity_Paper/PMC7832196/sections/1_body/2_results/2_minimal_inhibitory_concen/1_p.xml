<p>After 24 h of incubation, unchanged resazurin blue color was observed for the wells with 12.5–200 μg/mL of ampicillin, whereas the wells with myticaganal C did not show any inhibition (resazurin changed from blue to pink) [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The wells containing 0.0975 and 0.195 μg/mL of ampicillin combined with 8000 μg/mL myticaganal C had the resazurin blue color. Therefore, the MICs of ampicillin alone and ampicillin and myticaganal C in combination were 12.5 μg/mL and 0.0975 and 8000 μg/mL, respectively. Myticaganal C at 8000 μg/mL reduced the MIC of ampicillin 128-fold from that of ampicillin alone, against
