<p>The inhibition of 
 <italic>S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhi, B. subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> by the DCM: MeOH extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> shows that this extract has antibacterial compounds. This extract was more potent on Gram-negative than on Gram-positive strains, thus acting as a broad spectrum. These findings are consistent with other reported research works, and this could be attributed to the presence of a lipophilic outer membrane consisting of lipopolysaccharide molecules with an affinity for lipophilic molecules [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The phytochemicals present in this extract have been reported to inhibit the growth of both Gram-negative bacteria such as 
 <italic>E.coli, V. cholera, P. aeruginosa, S. senftenberg</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> and Gram-positive such as 
 <italic>S. aureus, S. mutans, S. pneumoniae, B. anthracis</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> [

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Thus, they are acting as a broad spectrum similar to tetracycline activities.
