<p>The broth microdilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the plant extract against the test bacterial cultures using 96-well microtiter plates [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Starting from the highest concentration of each extract, two-fold serial dilutions were prepared in sterile MHB in sterile test tubes, resulting in a concentration range from 500 mg/ml to 7.8125 mg/ml, the wells were clearly labeled with the respective extract concentration, and 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>l of each extract dilution was added into the respective well for each bacterial isolate to be tested. Each well containing the extract dilution and the growth control well was inoculated with 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>l of the bacterial suspension to achieve a final inoculum of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/ml, and the plate was incubated at 37°C for 24 h.
