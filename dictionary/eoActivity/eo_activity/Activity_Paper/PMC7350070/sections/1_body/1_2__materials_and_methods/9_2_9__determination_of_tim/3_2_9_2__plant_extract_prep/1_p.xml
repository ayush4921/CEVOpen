<p>The 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> DCM: methanolic extract was prepared in MHB to a final concentration corresponding to 1 × MBC, 2 × MBC, 3 × MBC, and 4 × MBC. From each concentration, 9 ml was mixed with 1 ml of the inoculum prepared as mentioned above and incubated at 37°C. A growth control with only the bacterial cultures in MHB and a culture with tetracycline drug were used as a negative and positive control, respectively. Five hundred microlitre samples were taken from each test tube at times of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h after incubation and diluted tenfold in physiological saline. A hundred microlitres (100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l) of each dilution was plated on MHA and plates incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Growing colonies were counted after 24 h of incubation with only plates containing 30–300 colonies of each dilution counted. Growth curves were plotted to show the log
