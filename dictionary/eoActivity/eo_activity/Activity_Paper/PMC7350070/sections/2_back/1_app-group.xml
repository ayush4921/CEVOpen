    <title>Procedures to Prepare 0.5 McFarland Standard Solutions</title>
    <p>Original 
     <italic>McFarland</italic> standards were made by mixing specified amounts of barium chloride and sulfuric acid together. Mixing the two compounds forms a barium sulfate precipitate, which causes turbidity in the solution. A 0.5 McFarland standard is prepared by mixing 0.05 ml of 1.175% barium chloride dihydrate (BaCl
     <sub>2</sub>∙2H
     <sub>2</sub>O) with 9.95 ml of 1% sulfuric acid (H
     <sub>2</sub>SO
     <sub>4</sub>). The standard can be compared visually to a suspension of bacteria in sterile saline or nutrient broth. If the bacterial suspension is too turbid, it can be diluted with more diluents. If the suspension is not turbid enough, more bacteria can be added.
