<p>For heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments, the datasets were acquired with 1024 and 512 data points for the f2 (
 <sup>1</sup>H) and f1 (
 <sup>13</sup>C) dimensions, with spectral widths of 11161 and 38736 Hz, respectively. Eight scans were performed and the relaxation delay was fixed at 1 s.
