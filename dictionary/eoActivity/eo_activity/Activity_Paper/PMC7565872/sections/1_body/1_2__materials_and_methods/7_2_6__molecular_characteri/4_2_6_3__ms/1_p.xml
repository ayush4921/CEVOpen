<p>The purified fraction of interest was solubilized in HPLC grade MeOH at a 1 mg/mL concentration. It was analyzed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC (Santa Clara, CA, USA) mounted with an Inertsil ODS-3 3 µm 3 × 100 mm column and using the following gradient: acetonitrile: mQ water (85:15, solvent B) and mQ water (solvent A) + 0.2% formic acid and 12 mM ammonium formate. One minute of 53% B was followed by a linear increase of B to 100% at 17 min and an isocratic elution at 18 min. The gradient was then reversed at 6 min followed by a stabilization after 3 min at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The injected volume was 10 µL.</p>
