<p>Then using an ESI-ion trap mass spectrometer (Esquire HCT ion trap mass spectrometer; Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany), the fraction of interest was characterized. The ESI was operated in the positive mode. Mass spectrometer parameters were set as follows: capillary voltage -4500 V; endplate offset −500 V; nebulizer pressure 50 psi; dry gas flow rate 10 L/min; dry gas temperature 300 °C; skimmer 20.6 V; capillary exit 300 V; oct 1 DC 10 V; oct 2 DC 2.79 V; Lens 1–5.2 V; lens 2–72 V; oct RF 300 Vpp; trap drive 92.8. The scan range was optimized at 300–1250 m/z.</p>
