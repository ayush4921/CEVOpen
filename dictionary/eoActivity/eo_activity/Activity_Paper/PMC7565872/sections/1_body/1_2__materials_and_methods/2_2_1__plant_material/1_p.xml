<p>During the ethnobotanical study, 
 <italic>Litchi chinensis</italic> roots were collected around the village of Coconi, (Mayotte Island, 12°50′03.3″ S 45°08′24.2″ E) and a specimen was stored into the CBNM’s herbaria for proofing reasons (referenced as MAO00051). A total of three independent collects occurred between 2014 and 2017 on trees of similar size in the same area. The 
 <italic>L. chinensis</italic>’s roots were dried for 48 h at 40 ± 1 °C using a drying oven, they were then powdered, vacuum packed and stored at −22 ± 1 °C until being used. Extractions and purifications were therefore carried out on three completely independent biological samples.
