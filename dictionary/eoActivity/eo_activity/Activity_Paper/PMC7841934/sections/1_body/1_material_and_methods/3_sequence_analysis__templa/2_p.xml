<p>Due to the lack of solved three-dimensional (3D) structures of 
 <italic>Ld</italic>TR, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>NH, and 
 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT, homology modeling was opted to determine the structure of these enzymes. The protein sequence of 
 <italic>Ld</italic>TR, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>NH, and 
 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT enzymes of 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> was retrieved from NCBI. For the identification of similar templates, BlastP
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
 </sup> was performed against Protein Data Bank (PDB), and on the basis of maximum sequence similarity and least 
 <italic>e</italic>-value, the crystal structures were used as template structures to model the 3D structures. Modeller 9.24
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
 </sup> was used for homology modeling, and 3D structures were visualized in PyMol. The generated models were assessed by the PROCHECK program, PDB sum tool, and Ramachandran plots.

 </sup> The crystal structure of pteridine reductase protein was downloaded from PDB (ID: 2XOX). The proteins were finally prepared by Discovery Studio keeping all of the parameters at default. The critical residues of the binding pockets were identified from the native catalytic pockets of the available crystal structure of proteins, CASTp, and Discovery Studio. The 3D structure of the constituents of the leaf extract of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> was retrieved from the PubChem database in SDF format.

 </sup> Syringaresinol, quercetin-
 <italic>O</italic>-hexoside, and apigenin-
 <italic>C</italic>-hexoside-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside were sketched by MarvinSketch. The atomic coordinates of all of the ligands were changed to pdbqt setup using Open Babel GUI, an open-source chemical toolbox for the interconversion of chemical structures.
