<p>Plants extracts have promising medicinal properties and had been used in the traditional system of medicine. The available ethnopharmacological data of different identified medicinal plants and their secondary metabolites have enormous potential for the discovery of cost-effective, low cytotoxic, and potential antileishmanial drugs.

 </sup> The 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> plant has plenty of medicinal values. It has been reported to have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antioxidant activities.

 </sup> It has been used to treat tuberculosis, rheumatism, leprosy, syphilis, and skin disease.

 </sup> There has been an exponential growth in the study of primary and secondary metabolite compositions of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> in the last few years, which are responsible for most of its attributed biological effects.

 </sup> There are around 12 glycosylated phenolic compounds (including one lignan, two phenolic acids, and nine flavonoids) reported in its leaf extract yet (

  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>). These phytochemicals were selected for 
 <italic>in silico</italic> docking study against unique drug targets of 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>. Proanthocyanidin B dimer, kaempferol rhamnosylxyloside, myricetin hexoside, apigenin-6,8-di-
 <italic>C</italic>-glycoside, apigenin-C-hexoside-O-pentoside, and 3,4-di-O-caffeoylquinic acid showed binding affinity toward the drug targets of 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>. Proanthocyanidin B dimer and kaempferol rhamnosylxyloside showed the highest binding affinity toward 
 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>TR, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>NH, and 
 <italic>Ld</italic>PTR1. The predicted inhibition constants of proanthocyanidin B dimer against 
 <italic>Ld</italic>SMT, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>TR, 
 <italic>Ld</italic>NH, and 
 <italic>Ld</italic>PTR1 are calculated as 6.92 μM, 6.18 μM, 5.74 μM, and 5.00 μM respectively (

 </xref>). Molecular docking results suggested possible antileishmanial activity of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic>. In the light of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> results and medicinal values including antimicrobial activities, we further evaluated its leishmanicidal activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> leaves was found effective on promastigotes as well as intramacrophagic amastigote forms in a dose-dependent manner. Leaf extract was found very much safe against human THP-1-derived macrophages with a very high CC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 626 ± 39 μg/mL. Although the positive control, an existing antileishmanial drug, miltefosine was found relatively more toxic on human macrophages as reported by others as well as by us (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.133 ± 0.65 μg/mL). The exact mechanism of the antileishmanial activity of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> extract was not dissected in detail, but our apoptotic assay suggested partial induction of apoptosis in parasites upon treatment. The number of dead parasites and the percentage of apoptotic cells are not correlated, which suggested the other possible mechanism of antileishmanial activity of the extract.
