<p>The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> data suggested that phytoconstituents possibly inhibited the key drug targets of 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>, which are important for their growth and survival. Further detailed studies are required to work out the exact mechanism of antileishmanial action of the 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> leaf extract 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> as well as 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our findings may be helpful for designing of the treatment of leishmaniasis through the use of 
 <italic>C. fistula</italic> alone or in combination with the existing antileishmanial drugs.
