A total of 20 compounds were detected and tentatively identified based on their retention times, MS data and comparison together with the information previously reported in the literature [

Three different phenolic compounds classes were present in the ethyl acetate extract namely phenolic acids (quinic acid, gallic acid, and gallic acid ethyl ether), flavonoids (derivatives of quercetin and kaempferol) and several iridoids. The content of phenolic acids and flavonoids were evaluated except for the iridoids. The whole content was as high as 46.6 ± 0.36 mg/g (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) (DW). The most abundant compound was represented by quercetin-rhamnoside 14.5 ± 1.20 mg/g (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) (DW), followed by kaempferol-derivative 10.8 ± 0.50 mg/g (
 <italic>w/w</italic>) (DW), which explain the agreement between the obtained results and those on the antioxidant activity and the TPC. The detected compounds have never been reported before as constituents of Moroccan
