<p>In this contribution, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents as well as the antioxidant capacity evaluated by ABTS, FRAP and DPPH assays of ethyl acetate and chloroform leaves extracts of 
 <italic>Globularia alypum</italic>, L. grown in Morocco, were investigated. The phenolic profile revealed a total of 20 compounds including phenolic acids, flavonoids and iridoids in the ethyl acetate extract, whereas the volatile profile showed a total of up to 73 compounds belonging to different chemical classes. The results achieved are very promising and if supported by “in vivo” studies might propose such a species to be used for therapeutic purposes.
