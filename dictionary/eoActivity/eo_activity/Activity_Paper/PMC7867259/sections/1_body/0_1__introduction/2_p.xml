<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) serve as cell signaling molecules for normal biologic processes; in general, the disproportion between production of the ROS and the biological system ability of the normal detoxification leads to oxidative stress. These disturbances in the normal redox state of cells can cause toxic effects through the production of free radicals that react with cellular constituents and caused severe damage to the cells [

Antioxidants can be defined as any compounds able to react with free radicals by neutralizing them to non-radical products and, consequently, these compounds can be used to stop or minimize the deleterious effects caused by free radicals in the human body [
