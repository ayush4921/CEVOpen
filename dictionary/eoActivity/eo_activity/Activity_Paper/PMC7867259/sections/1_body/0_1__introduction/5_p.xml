<p>The aim of the present study was to determine the total phenolic and flavonoid contents in two different extracts of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> and the investigation of the antioxidant activities of these extracts by using three different methods, namely free radical scavenging assays (ABTS and DPPH tests), and reducing power assays (FRAP). In addition, a chemical determination of phenolic compounds and volatile profile of 
 <italic>G. A.</italic> extract was determinated by the high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS) and gas chromatography coupled to MS detection.
