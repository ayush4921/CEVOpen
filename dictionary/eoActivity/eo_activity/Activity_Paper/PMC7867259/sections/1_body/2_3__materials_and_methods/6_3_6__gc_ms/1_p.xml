<p>The analysis of the volatile fraction was performed on a GC-MS-QP2020 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an “AOC-20i” system auto-injector. The analyses were carried out on an SLB-5ms column (30 m in length × 0.25 mm in diameter × 0.25 μm in thickness of film, Merck KGaA). The initial temperature was set at 50 °C, afterwards increased up to 350 °C (increase rate: 3 °C/min; holding time: 5 min). GC-MS parameters were as follows: injection temperature: 280 °C; injection volume: 1.0 μL (split ratio: 10:1); pure helium gas (99.9%); linear velocity: 30.0 cm/s; Inlet pressure: 26.7 KPa. EI source temperature: 220 °C; Interface temperature: 250 °C. The acquisition of MS spectra was carried out in full scan mode, in the mass range of 40–660
