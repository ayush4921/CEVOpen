<p>The plant tissues were processed with the method described by Qin et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In brief, the samples were thoroughly washed in running water for 30 min, followed by an ultrasonic cleaning (200 W, 10 min), and then air-dried for 2 h at room temperature. After drying, the plant samples were surface-sterilized with the protocol described by Tan et al. with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Air-dried plant samples were surface-sterilized using sequential washes in 70% ethanol for 1 min, 2.5% NaClO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2 min, and 70% ethanol for 1 min. Following sterilization, leaves were rinsed three times in sterile distilled water. All the samples were then excised into 555 segments of 1–2 mm length. Segments were placed on a PDA medium (house-made, containing (g/L): Agar power 16, potato 200 (peel potatoes, cut into 1 cm pieces, boiled for 20 min, filtered to obtain filtrate), and dextrose 20, pH 6.0) using 90 mm petri plates. The medium was supplemented with amikacin sulfate (100 U/mL) to prevent the growth of bacteria. Seven tissue segments were placed on each petri dish (90 mm), which were then sealed with parafilm and incubated at 28 °C for one week. Emergent fungal colonies were isolated and purified in a PDA medium for further identification and bioactive assays (see below). Pure isolates growing on the PDA medium were photographed and the agar piece plugs with pure isolates were stored at −80 °C in a 20% glycerol solution in the engineering center of QinLing Mountains natural products, Shaanxi provincial institute of microbiology.
