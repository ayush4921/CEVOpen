<p>The colonial and microscopic morphology of the strain F8158 on PDA were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05958-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B and were similar to those of 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> spp. [
 <xref rid="B17-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-ijms-21-05958" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The isolated fungal culture F8158 was observed as fast growing with a scanty mycelial growth on PDA. During the growth process, mycelia of the strain F8158 spread out in all directions and the colony color turned from white to green. The fungal hyphae of F8158 were hyaline and smooth-walled and the conidiophores are highly branched. A subsequent sequence analysis showed that the isolate F8158 shared 99.66% identity with 
 <italic>Trichoderma</italic> cf. 
 <italic>harzianum</italic> voucher PDAN04-1 (MF108878) in the NCBI database (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05958-f002">Figure 2</xref>C). The strain F8158 exhibited good antagonistic capacities (the percent inhibition of mycelial growth ranged from 47.72–88.18) against different pathogens (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-05958-f002">Figure 2</xref>D). In particular, the average growth percent inhibition of F8158 against 
 <italic>V. mali</italic> var. 
 <italic>mali</italic> was the highest and reached 88.17 ± 1.51, followed by 
 <italic>B. cinerea</italic> Pers.: Fr. with a percent inhibition of 85.97 ± 1.27 and the percent inhibition of 
 <italic>S. sclerotiorum</italic> (Lib.) de Bary was 79.87 ± 1.84 (
