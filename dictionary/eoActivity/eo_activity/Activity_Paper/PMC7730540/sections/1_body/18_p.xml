<p>A review by Sadee et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] addressed the less explored area of biased opioid antagonism, where biased MOR antagonists, such as 6Î²-naltrexol, could serve as modulators of opioid dependence, for improved pain therapy and opioid use management. They proposed a novel receptor model that can account for diverse pharmacological effects of MOR ligands, including biased antagonists.
