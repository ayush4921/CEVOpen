<p>The Special Issue, “Opioids and Their Receptors: Present and Emerging Concepts in Opioid Drug Discovery”, includes 11 research articles, one communication and six reviews, with authors from 12 different countries, giving insight into ongoing subjects that span the opioid research field. This issue presents recent advances in medicinal chemistry and pharmacology of new ligands targeting the opioid receptors. Moreover, it highlights current concepts in opioid drug discovery together with strategies to mitigate the deleterious effects of opioids. Central topics of this Special Issue include drug design, structure–activity relationships (SAR), biochemistry of the receptors, understanding of ligand specific actions and the link between therapeutic effects, side effects and molecular mode of action.</p>
