<p>In their review, Faouzi et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] presented the design and pharmacological outcomes of biased agonists of all opioid receptor types (MOR, DOR, KOR and NOP), aiming at achieving functional selectivity. They described a large number of structurally diverse biased agonists, with the focus on the understanding of the limitations and advantages both in vitro and in vivo that they can provide. Azevedo Neto et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] discussed the accumulated literature on the potential of biased MOR agonists for the development as safer analgesics. They presented the pharmacology of three G protein-biased MOR agonists, oliceridine (TRV130), very recently approved for pain treatment, and PZM21 and SR-17018, in relationship to that of morphine and fentanyl, and proposed that their improved safety profile could be likely attributable to low efficacy partial agonism rather than G protein-bias.
