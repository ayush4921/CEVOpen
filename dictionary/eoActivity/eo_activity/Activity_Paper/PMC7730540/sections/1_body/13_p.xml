<p>Increasing evidence on the heteromerization of native opioid receptors in discrete brain neuronal circuits with selective targeting of heteromers as a tool to modulate receptor activity, and multifunctional ligands, which simultaneously activate two or more targets to produce a more desirable drug profile, are emerging concepts for the development of novel therapeutic drugs and strategies, presented in the earlier cited report [
