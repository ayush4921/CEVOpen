<p>The study by Wtorek et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05658" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] targeted the concept of multifunctional ligands, specifically novel hybrids combining opioid pharmacophores with either substance P (SP) or neurokinin receptor (NK1) antagonist fragments, as a strategy for developing effective and safer medications for pain treatment. They reported on opioid agonist/NK1 antagonist Tyr-[D-Lys-Phe-Phe-Asp]-Asn-D-Trp-Phe-D-Trp-Leu-Nle-NH
 <sub>2</sub> and opioid agonist/NK1 agonist Tyr-[D-Lys-Phe-Phe-Asp]-Gln-Phe-Phe-Gly-Leu-Met-NH
 <sub>2</sub> peptide hybrids with antinociceptive efficacy without inducing analgesic tolerance or constipation in mice after intraperitoneal administration.
