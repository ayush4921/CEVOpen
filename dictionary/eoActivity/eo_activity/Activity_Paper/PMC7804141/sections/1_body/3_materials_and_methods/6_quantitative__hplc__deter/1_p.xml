 </sup> with little modifications. The separation was performed at 35 °C on an RP-18 column (250 × 4.0 mm id, 5 µm; Purospher Merck). The mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid acidified ultrapure water (solvent B). The composition of the mobile phase varied during a 1-h run according to a linear gradient ranging from a 5:95 (v/v) to 100:0 (v/v) mixture of solvents A and B, respectively, at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. Detection was performed at 260 nm for simple phenolics (gallic acid and caffeic acid), 360 nm for flavonoids (catechin, myricetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and apigenin) and 210 nm for saponins (nahagenin, hederagenin, ursolic acid and betulinic acid). A typical HPLC chromatogram of a

Compounds were identified by comparison with authentic standards purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and confirmed by standard additions and/or LC–ESI–MS analysis performed on Water 2695 Alliance coupled with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer ZQ. LC–ESI–MS data were collected in the positive and negative modes as described previously

 </sup>. Data acquisition and processing were performed with MassLynx 4.0 software. All the compounds were quantified against 5-point calibration curves (R

The Quantifications were recorded using calibration curves and retention time of corresponding reference standards and the results were expressed as μg/mg DW of sample. 5-methoxyflavone (0.2 µg/mL) was used as internal standard for extraction (with detection set at 360 nm).
