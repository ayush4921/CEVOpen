 </sup> with little modifications. Briefly, the 10 mL of methanol (99.9%) was used to thoroughly dissolve 200 mg of each powdered callus (dried at 50 °C) and placed in rotatory for 24 h at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were then sonicated for 25 min (Toshiba, Japan) followed by vortexing for 5 min. The procedure for phytochemicals extraction was repeated twice and mixtures were then centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatants were evaporated to dryness before being subjected to cellulase R10 from
