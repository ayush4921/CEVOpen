<p id="Par57">The kit method (10004883, Cayman Chem. Co, Interchim, Montluçon, France) was followed with manufacturer instructions to measure inhibition of phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) enzyme. The Diheptanoyl thio-PC was used as substrate and thiotheramide-PC was applied as positive control inhibitor. While. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (100 _M) was used as 15-LOX inhibitor during the assay. The extraction volume in equal amount was applied as blank. The absorbance was recorded via microplate reader (BioTek ELX800; BioTek Instruments, Colmar, France) at 420 nm.</p>
