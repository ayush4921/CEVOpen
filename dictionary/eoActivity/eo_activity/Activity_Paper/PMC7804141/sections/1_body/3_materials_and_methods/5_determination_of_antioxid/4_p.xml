 </sup> was used with little modifications. Briefly, ABTS (2,2-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) salt (7 mM) and 2.45 mM of potassium per sulphate were gently mixed in equal proportion to make ABTS solution, followed by incubation for 16 h in dark. The absorbance was measured at wavelength (734 nm), adjusted to 0.7 and solution then mixed with the extracts and incubated at 25 ± 1 °C in dark for 15 min. The absorbance of was recorded at 734 nm by using Microplate reader (ELX800, BioTek Instruments). Antioxidant capacity of samples was expressed in terms of TEAC.
