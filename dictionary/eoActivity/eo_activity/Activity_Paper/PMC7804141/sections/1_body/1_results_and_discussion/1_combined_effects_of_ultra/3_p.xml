<p id="Par12">Overall, the UV-C treatments for 20–40 min (1.2–7.2 kJ m
 <sup>−2</sup>) enhanced the callus proliferation but for extended duration of UV-C doses inhibited the cells growth under different photoperiod regimes.. The reduction in biomass accumulation at higher UV-C treatments could be the result of irreversible toxic effects to cells that might raise cell death in plant cultures
