 </sup>, a total eleven important phenolic metabolites have been evaluated in UV-C irradiated cultures under different photoperiod regimes via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The HPLC evaluation showed that the highest accumulation of compounds (6.067 μg/mg ± 0.03) occurred in cultures grown in photoperiod (16L/8D h) after exposure to UV-C dose of 5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>. The cultures treated with UV-C radiations (7.2 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) for 40 min were found with total production of compounds (4.624 μg/mg ± 0.05) under continuous light (24 h) while least production (4.39 μg/mg ± 0.015) was found in cultures maintained in dark (24 h) after UV-C treatment (3.6 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) as compared with control (Fig.
