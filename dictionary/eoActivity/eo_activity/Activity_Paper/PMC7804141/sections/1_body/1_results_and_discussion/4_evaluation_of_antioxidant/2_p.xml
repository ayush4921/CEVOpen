<p id="Par28">Likewise, the data showed that enhanced levels of FRAP and ABTS antioxidants activities were found in elicited cultures with UV-C radiations than controls (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Among different doses of UV-C radiations, the maximum FRAP antioxidant activity (182.32 µmol Trolox-C equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC)/ mg DW) was recorded at UV-C dose of 5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup> applied to callus subsequently grown in photoperiod (16L/8D h), while cultures under continuous light (24 h) were found with FRAP activity (174.31 µmol TEAC/ mg DW) after exposure to UV-C (3.6 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) for 20 mints. The cultures maintained in dark (24 h) after treating with UV-C doses showed the FRAP activity (194.27 µmol TEAC/ mg DW) at UV-C (7.2 kJ/ms
 <sup>2</sup>) as compared with control.
