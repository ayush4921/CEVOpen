<p id="Par19">Similar patterns were observed for total flavonoids contents and flavonoid production maintained under UV-C treatment associated with photoperiod regimes. The callus cultures maintained in photoperiod (16L/8D h) after UV-C (5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) treatment were found with optimum levels of flavonoids (total flavonoids contents (TFC): 4.05 μg quercetin equivalent (QE)/mg DW; total flavonoids production (TFP): 166.8 μg QE/mg DW), followed by UV-C treatment (7.2 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) for 40 min in continuous light (24 h) with maximum flavonoids accumulation (TFC: 2.7 μg QE/mg DW; TFP: 65.09 μg QE/mg DW) respectively with comparative controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, b). However, the cultures grown in dark were found with low induction comparatively and maximum flavonoids accumulation (TFC: 0.96 μg QE/mg; TFP: 33.5 μg QE/mg DW) after exposure to UV dose (3.6 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) as compared with control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c).
