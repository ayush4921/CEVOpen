 </sup>. In the literature we can find some mechanistic opinions about influence of UV-C radiation over induction and enhancement of secondary metabolism of plants. Some studies indicate that a stimulation of the secondary metabolism under UV-C treatment can be triggered through the activation of key enzymes such as 
 <sc>l</sc>-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS). Such enzymes are responsible for catalyzing the main steps during biosynthetic pathways of many phenolics and flavonoids
