<p id="Par34">Conclusively, the current study involved the elicitation strategy via UV-C radiations under different photoperiod regimes in callus cultures of 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic> (L.). The UV-C treatments effectively raised the production of phenolic compounds and biomass proliferation. The cultures exposed to UV-C radiations (5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) for 30 min and grown under photoperiod (16 h light /8 h dark) were found worthwhile sources of phytochemicals and biomass production. The highest levels of phytochemicals, anti-inflammatory and antioxidants activities were recorded on the same treatment of UV-C under photoperiod. Our data provide evidences showing that elicitation of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> callus cultures with UV-C radiation is a viable strategy for a safe, sustainable and enhanced production of biomass and phytochemicals. We anticipate that scale up studies at both pilot and commercial scales could confirm these trends. This will definitely assist with decoding the molecular mechanisms behind maximum expression of genes responsible for growth and phytochemicals production.
