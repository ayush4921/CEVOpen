 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f007">Figure 7</xref>c shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C3. C3 forms 8 hydrogen bonds with residues of cathepsin L. One of the catalytic residue C25 forms C-H⋯S and N-H⋯S type hydrogen bonds with C3. The other catalytic residue H163 forms C-H⋯N and N-H⋯N type hydrogen bonds with C3. Further, one of the two pyrrole rings present in C3 forms hydrogen bond with residue G23. Lastly, M70 forms a C-H⋯S type hydrogen bond with C3. Further, C3 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues Q21, C22, L69, M70, A135 and W189.
