<p>Phytochemicals T4 (pseudo-α-colubrine), T6 (strychnine 
 <italic>N</italic>-oxide), T7 (α-colubrine) and T9 (2-hydroxy-3-methoxystrychnine) have binding energies of −9.3 kcal/mol, −9.3 kcal/mol, −9.2 kcal/mol and −9.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These four phytochemicals are monoterpenoid indole alkaloids produced by 
 <italic>Strychnos nux-vomica</italic>. The herb 
 <italic>Strychnos nux-vomica</italic> is used in traditional Indian medicine and its alkaloids have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, antitumor and hepatoprotective activities [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f005">Figure 5</xref>d shows the TMPRSS2 residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with T4. T4 forms C-H⋯O type hydrogen bonds with residues A400, N433, D435 (substrate binding residue), C437 and D440. Further, T4 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues E260, I381, S382, T387, N398, A399, V434, D440 and A466. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f005">Figure 5</xref>f shows the TMPRSS2 residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with T6. T6 forms a C-H⋯N type hydrogen bond with residue N398. The substrate binding residue D435 also forms a C-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with T6. Further, T6 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues N398, A400, V434 and A466. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S3a</xref> shows the TMPRSS2 residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with T7. T7 forms five C-H⋯O type hydrogen bonds with residues N433, D435 (substrate binding residue), C437 and D440. Further, T7 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues E260, T387, N398, A399, A400, V434 and A466. 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S3c</xref> shows the TMPRSS2 residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with T9. The phenolic hydroxyl group of T9 forms hydrogen bonds with residues S382 and A399. The substrate binding site D435 also forms a C-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with T9. Further, T9 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues E260, N398, A399, A400 and V434.
