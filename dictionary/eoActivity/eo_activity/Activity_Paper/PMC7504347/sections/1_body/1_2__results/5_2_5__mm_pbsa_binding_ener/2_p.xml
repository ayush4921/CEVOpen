<p>Although T1, T2 and T3 have the same docked binding energy value of −9.6 kcal/mol to TMPRSS2, there are differences in their binding energy computed using MM-PBSA method. While TMPRSS2-T1 complex has the lowest binding energy value of −39.15 ± 2.799 kcal/mol, TMPRSS2-T2 and TMPRSS2-T3 complexes have binding energy value of −30.284 ± 3.585 kcal/mol and −27.386 ± 2.077 kcal/mol, respectively (

Moreover, in comparison to binding energy obtained from docking using AutoDock Vina, binding energy for the TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L complexes with their top inhibitors computed using MM-PBSA method were found to be 2-fold to 4-fold lower, signifying even stronger binding (
