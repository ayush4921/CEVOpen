<p>Phytochemical C9, trisjuglone, has a binding energy of −8.0 kcal/mol. C9 is a naphthoquinone present in 
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic> (i.e., walnut). In traditional medicine, 
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic> has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antimicrobial activities [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S4c</xref> shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C9. The benzoquinone moiety present in C9 forms two C-H⋯O type hydrogen bonds with residue Q21 and one N-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with W189. In contrast, the other catalytic residue H163 forms a N-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with C9. Also, the residue W189 forms a face-to-edge type of π-π stacking interaction with C9. Further, C9 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues Q21, G23, C25, L144 and W189.
