<p>In order to investigate the stability of the protein-ligand complexes of the identified inhibitors, MD simulation of 180 ns was performed for top three inhibitors of TMPRSS2 namely, qingdainone (T1), edgeworoside C (T2) and adlumidine (T3), and of cathepsin L namely, ararobinol (C1), (+)-oxoturkiyenine (C2) and 3α,17α-cinchophylline (C3). Specifically, we have performed six 180 ns MD runs for protein-ligand complexes (TMPRSS2-T1, TMPRSS2-T2, TMPRSS2-T3, cathepsin L-C1, cathepsin L-C2 and cathepsin L-C3) and two 180 ns MD runs for free TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L proteins (

 <sub>g</sub>) of the protein, root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the Cα atoms of the protein, root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) of the Cα atoms of the protein, RMSD of the ligand and finally distance of the center of mass of the ligand from the center of mass of the catalytic residues or substrate binding residues of the protein in complex with the ligand (
