<p>Phytochemical C6, tectol, has binding energy of −8.1 kcal/mol. C6 is a naphthoquinone derivative [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] present in 
 <italic>Tectona grandis</italic> and 
 <italic>Tecomella undulata</italic>. 
 <italic>Tectona grandis</italic> has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and antiparasitic activities [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. 
 <italic>Tecomella undulata</italic> has been used to treat syphilis and also reported to have anti-inflammatory and anti-HIV activities [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Additionally, Tectol has been reported to inhibit farnesyltransferase enzyme [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f007">Figure 7</xref>f shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C6. The pyran group of C6 is involved in a C-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with residue L144. The catalytic residue C25 forms a C-H⋯S type hydrogen bond with C6. The other catalytic residue H163 forms a N-H⋯O type hydrogen bond with C6. Also, the residue W189 forms both face-to-face and face-to-edge type of π-π stacking interaction with C6. Further, C6 forms hydrophobic contacts with G23, L144 and W189.
