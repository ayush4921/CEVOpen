<p>In the fourth stage, the structure of docked protein-ligand complex in .pdb format for each filtered phytochemical from third stage was used to determine the ligand binding site residues in the target protein and different non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bond, halogen bond, hydrophobic interactions, etc. between ligand and target protein (

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-25-03822">Section 3</xref>), and therefore, a potent inhibitor should either bind to or form non-covalent interactions with D435. In case of cathepsin L, the specificity of this cysteine protease is dependent on the catalytic residues, C25 and H163, in the S1 subsite (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-molecules-25-03822">Section 3</xref>), and therefore, a potent inhibitor should either bind to or form non-covalent interactions with the catalytic residues. In this work, we consider a phytochemical to be a potential inhibitor of TMPRSS2 (respectively, cathepsin L) only if the ligand binding energy in the best docked pose is ≤−8.5 kcal/mol (respectively, ≤−8.0 kcal/mol) and the ligand binds to or forms non-covalent interactions with the residue D435 in TMPRSS2 (respectively, residues C25 and H163 in cathepsin L).
