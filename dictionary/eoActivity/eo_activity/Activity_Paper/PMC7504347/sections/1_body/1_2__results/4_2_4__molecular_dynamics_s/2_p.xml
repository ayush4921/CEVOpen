<p>The R
 <sub>g</sub> value of TMPRSS2 in complex with T1, T2 and T3 remains largely stable throughout the MD simulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f008">Figure 8</xref>a). This implies that the top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 namely, T1, T2 and T3 do not induce any major structural changes to TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2 remains structurally stable in complex with these inhibitors. TMPRSS2 in complex with T1, T2 and T3 has an average R
 <sub>g</sub> value of 2.110 ± 0.022 nm, 2.096 ± 0.024 nm and 2.091 ± 0.021 nm, respectively. Further, RMSD value of the Cα atoms of TMPRSS2 in complex with T1, T2 and T3 become stable after 80 ns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f008">Figure 8</xref>b). Over the 80 ns to 180 ns time interval, TMPRSS2 in complex with T1, T2 and T3 has an average RMSD value of 0.525 ± 0.023 nm, 0.501 ± 0.016 nm and 0.634 ± 0.018 nm, respectively. Lastly, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f008">Figure 8</xref>c shows the RMSF value per residue for TMPRSS2 in complex with T1, T2 and T3. R

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03822">Supplementary Figure S2a–c</xref> show the superimposed snapshots at 120 ns, 140 ns and 160 ns of TMPRSS2-T1, TMPRSS2-T2 and TMPRSS2-T3 complexes, respectively. To further quantify the stability of the inhibitors T1, T2 and T3 bound to TMPRSS2, we have computed the RMSD of T1, T2 and T3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f008">Figure 8</xref>d) and distance of the center of mass of T1, T2 and T3 from the center of mass of the substrate binding residue D435 in TMPRSS2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f008">Figure 8</xref>e). Both RMSD of T1, T2 and T3 bound with TMPRSS2 and distance of the center of mass of T1, T2 and T3 from the center of mass of the substrate binding residue D435 becomes largely stable after 100 ns of the MD simulation (
