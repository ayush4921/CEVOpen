 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03822-f007">Figure 7</xref>e shows the cathepsin L residues that form hydrogen bonds or π-π stacking interactions with C5. The carboxylic acid group present in C5 forms hydrogen bonds with residues Q19 and H163. The indole ring of C5 forms a N-H⋯N type hydrogen bond with residue G68. Further, C5 forms hydrophobic contacts with residues G23, C25, G67, G68, L69 and Y72.
