<p>Hydrogen bonds. The accepted geometric criteria for hydrogen bonds of type D-H⋯A are as follows. Firstly, the distance between the hydrogen (H) and acceptor (A) atom should be less than the sum of their van der Waals radii. Secondly, the angle formed by donor (D), H and A atoms should be &gt;90° (
