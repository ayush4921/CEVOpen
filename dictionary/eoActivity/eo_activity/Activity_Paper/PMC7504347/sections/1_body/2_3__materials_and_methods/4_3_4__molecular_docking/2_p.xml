<p>For protein-ligand docking, the appropriate grid box specified by the search space centre and search space size for TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L was manually determined by considering the key residues in target proteins such as the catalytic residues and substrate binding residues, which are important for the function and specificity of the considered proteases as reported in the literature. For TMPRSS2, the grid box was defined by the search space centre (40.50, −6.00, 25.70) and search space size of 25 Å × 25 Å × 25 Å. For cathepsin L, the grid box was defined by the search space centre (55.06, 48.65, 18.12) and search space size of 25 Å × 25 Å × 25 Å.</p>
