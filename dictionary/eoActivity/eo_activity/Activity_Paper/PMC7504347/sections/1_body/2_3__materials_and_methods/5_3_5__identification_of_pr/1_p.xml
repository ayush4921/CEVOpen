<p>We searched the combined structure file of the docked protein-ligand complex for ligand binding residues in protein and different non-covalent interactions that can facilitate the binding of the ligand with the protein. These non-covalent protein-ligand interactions were identified using different geometric criteria which are specific to different types of interactions:</p>
