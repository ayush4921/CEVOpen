Specifically, traditional systems of Indian medicine including Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani have over centuries acquired invaluable knowledge on medicinal plants spanning the rich biodiversity of the subcontinent for treating various ailments including viral infections [

 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], it is worthwhile to search for potential anti-COVID drugs among phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. In this direction, some of us have built IMPPAT [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03822" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the largest resource on phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants to facilitate natural product-based drug discovery. In this work, we have performed virtual screening of 14,011 phytochemicals that are produced by Indian medicinal plants to identify potential inhibitors of key host factors, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, for SARS-CoV-2 infection. For the identified top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, we have performed MD simulation, and thereafter, employed MM-PBSA method to compute binding energies of the protein-ligand complexes.
