<p>We have predicted 96 potential phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2, of which the top three candidates, namely, qingdainone (T1), edgeworoside C (T2) and adlumidine (T3), have binding energy value of −39.15 ± 2.799 kcal/mol, −30.284 ± 3.585 kcal/mol and −27.386 ± 2.077 kcal/mol, respectively (

We have also predicted nine potential phytochemical inhibitors of cathepsin L, of which the top three candidates, namely, ararobinol (C1), (+)-oxoturkiyenine (C2) and 3α,17α-cinchophylline (C3), have binding energy value of −22.384 ± 3.420 kcal/mol, −20.577 ± 3.600 kcal/mol and −26.156 ± 3.433 kcal/mol, respectively (

Additional in vitro and in vivo testing of the identified phytochemical inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L is needed before these molecules can enter clinical trials against COVID-19. In conclusion, we expect the natural product inhibitors identified in this computational study for TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L will likely inform future research toward natural product-based anti-COVID therapeutics.
