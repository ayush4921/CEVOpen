<p>Foaming ability was evaluated according to the methods of Chen et al. [

 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and Pradhan and Bhattacharyya [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] with slight modifications. The extracts were dissolved in water at the concentrations of 5 and 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>). The solution was then vigorously shaken for 1 min by hand in a 10 mL measuring cylinder and the foam height was measured at room temperature. Foam stability and foam height after 30 s and 5 min were also recorded. The measurements were repeated three times from separate set of samples and the values were averaged.
