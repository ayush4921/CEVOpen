<p>The explants were inoculated in MS culture medium. The media consisted of 30 g/L sucrose and 7 g/L agar and the pH was adjusted to be within 5.68 after the addition of plant growth regulators. Different concentration, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/L of two auxin (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)) and two cytokinin (6-Benzylaminopurine (BA) and Kinetin (KIN)) were used in the study.
