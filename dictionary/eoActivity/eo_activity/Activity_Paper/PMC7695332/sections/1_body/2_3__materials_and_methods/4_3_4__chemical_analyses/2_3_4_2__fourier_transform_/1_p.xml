<p>To identify the presence of saponin functional groups, the FTIR spectra of the extracts were collected by a Bruker model ALPHA II, diamond ATR (Hamburg, Germany) and operating at the basic of 500â€“4000 wavenumber for averaging 47 scans per spectrum. For the analysis of the different chemical bonds in crude extracts, both methanol and water extracts were used for the FTIR measurement [
