<p>After six weeks of incubation, the callus induction from the tissue of 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> was observed. The highest callus formation was found in the explants cultured with Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2.0 mg/L Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The greatest fresh weight was observed at 0.84 ± 0.47 g in IAA at concentration of 0.5 mg/L. Meanwhile the dry weight was the highest at 0.13 ± 0.03 g in 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) at concentration of 2.0 mg/L (

 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] stated that the colour of callus becomes brown because they produced phenolic compounds and the variation in callus morphology is due to the explant variant, basic medium, growth regulators, and the biotic and abiotic supplements in the culture. In tissue culture, plant growth regulators play significant role in controlling plant growth and development [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Auxins are the major hormones responsible for stem elongation, vascular tissue differentiation, and cell expansion in plant developmental processes [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Similarly the cytokinins are required for cell division in a wide variety of plant tissue cultures [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. During the micropropagation, factors influence the induction of callus are such as plants growth regulator, auxins, and cytokinins, and environmental condition, light, and temperature [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Therefore, in studying plant tissue culture for metabolites induction, at least two combination of hormone types are required. The study of callus induction for the production of saponin using different hormones and the combination thereof including 2,4-D and IAA combined with BAP and kinetin (KIN) [
