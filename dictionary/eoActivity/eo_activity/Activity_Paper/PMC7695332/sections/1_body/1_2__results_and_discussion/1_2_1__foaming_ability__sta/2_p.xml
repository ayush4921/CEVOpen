<p>Different solvents used to extract the active ingredients could obviously play a role in the foaming properties. In our experiment, crude aqueous extract showed the highest content of foam compared to that of the methanol extract. The highest foam was found with 10% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> methanol extract of 
 <italic>S. rarak</italic> (7.1 cm). In the other hand, 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> extracts either by water or methanol gave low content of foam (1.1–1.5 cm). These are similar with Inalegwu and Sodipo [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] found that the crude aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Tephrosia vogelii</italic> leaves illustrated higher foam height than that of the methanolic extract. Structural wise, saponins contain one or more sugar moieties attached to steroid or triterpenoid backbone. The number of sugar molecules could affect foaming characteristics with the lesser the sugar number, the lower foaming ability of the compound produced. It is also possible that some saponins possess no foam forming ability [

 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] also added that saponins from different plant resources illustrated variable in the interfacial properties, which could mask their true functionality. Not only that, crude extract may contain combination of various compounds such as protein that could contribute to the formation of foam [
