<p>As a qNMR experiment, the internal standard should have high stability, high purity, easy weighing nature, and no effect on the peaks of the materials to be tested. According to the previous work experience, cresol, pyrazine, maleic acid, and dichloromethane were selected for experiments. The results showed that only dichloromethane had good stability during the experiment and was able to overcome peak-to-peak mutual influence. Therefore, dichloromethane was selected as the internal standard.</p>
