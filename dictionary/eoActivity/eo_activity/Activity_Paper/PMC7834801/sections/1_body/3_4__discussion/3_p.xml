<p>Further, the mode of cell death, whether apoptosis or necrosis, induced by the plant extract was assessed. Double staining of AO/EB for nontoxic concentration of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> showed nuclear and morphological changes of apoptosis only in less than 10% of the cells. However, more than 10% apoptosis was observed for cells treated the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> extract. Similar observations were made for Hoechst staining. However, comet assay revealed that 7.25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> IC
 <sub>50</sub> induced severe damage to DNA of A549 cell. In contrast, plant extracts at non-cytotoxic concentration(s) did not induce DNA damage in A549 cell. Thus, our results clearly demonstrated that 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> at nontoxic doses did not exert genotoxicity in A549 cells. In fact, the extract at these nontoxic concentrations could be used as preservative of food stored for human consumption without any adverse effect on human health. Thus, considering the nontoxic concentrations, acceptable daily intake (ADI) of the extract could be approximately calculated using NOAEC (no-observed adverse effect concentration) divided by uncertainty factor (usually10 to extrapolate from animal to human and 10 for interindividual differences in sensitivity). NOAEC is defined as the concentration at which there is no risk (nontoxic level) [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The approximate ADI value for 
 <italic>A. malaccensis n</italic>-hexane extract is 55.41 mg/day (data not shown). However, bioavailability of the extract(s), animal data, or PBPK (physiologically based biokinetic model) is necessary to derive an appropriate ADI for humans. Therefore, we recommend further investigations on subchronic and chronic toxicity testing to find the reliability of the estimated ADI of the plant extract when used as food preservative and/or therapeutic. Put together, the most nonpolar (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane) extract of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> offers great potential as a food preservative as well as therapeutic which could be further established through clearly directed studies.
