 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies are equally important in deciphering if a material is toxic or not. Different cell lines might exhibit different sensitivities towards a compound if it is cytotoxic. Therefore, use of more than one cell line is considered necessary in the detection of cytotoxic effects [

 <sub>50</sub> values of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis n</italic>-hexane extract for A549, HepG2, 3T3, and COS-7 cell lines which were 7.25, 22.5, 62.75, and 8.25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, respectively, and the zero-toxic concentration (IC
 <sub>0</sub>) was 2, 1.4, 30, and 1.4 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, respectively. This is important since so far no toxicity data have been reported in literature for 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> [
