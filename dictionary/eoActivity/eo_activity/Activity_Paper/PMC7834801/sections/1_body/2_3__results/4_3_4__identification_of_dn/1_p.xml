<p>Comet assay was adopted to detect the cellular DNA lesions or genotoxicity. Comet assay is very sensitive of strand breaks in DNA. DNA damage was analyzed based on DNA tail size, shape, and migration pattern, and the data are shown in

 <sub>50</sub> caused moderate damage to DNA. However, at the no toxicity concentration, there was only negligible damage to DNA. Since the tail length and density reflected the extent of strand breaks in DNA, the percentage of DNA in the tail provided a quantitative measure of DNA damage as shown in
