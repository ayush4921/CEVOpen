<p>The cytotoxic property of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis n</italic>-hexane extract was analyzed against A549, HepG2, 3T3, and COS-7 cells at different concentrations to determine the respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> by MTT assay. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of different concentrations of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> extract are graphically represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in respect of A549, HepG2, 3T3, and COS-7 cells were 7.25, 22.5, 62.75, and 8.25 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, respectively. The extract showed 0% inhibition at concentrations 2, 1.4, 30, and 1.4 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL, for A549, HepG2, 3T3, and COS-7 cells, respectively, and these concentrations are considered as nontoxic.
