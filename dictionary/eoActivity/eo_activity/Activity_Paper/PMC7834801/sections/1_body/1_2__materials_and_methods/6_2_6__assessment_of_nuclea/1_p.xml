<p>The nuclear morphological features of the cells were assessed using Hoechst 33528 staining [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The cells were cultured in 6-well plates and treated with 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> at its IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration and no toxicity concentration, for 24 h. After incubation, the treated and control cells were harvested and stained with Hoechst 33258 (1 mg/mL in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature. A drop of cell suspension was placed on a glass slide and covered with a cover slip. Three hundred cells, each in triplicate, were observed at x400 in the fluorescent microscope fitted with a 377–355 nm filter. The percentage of cells reflecting pathological changes was calculated.
