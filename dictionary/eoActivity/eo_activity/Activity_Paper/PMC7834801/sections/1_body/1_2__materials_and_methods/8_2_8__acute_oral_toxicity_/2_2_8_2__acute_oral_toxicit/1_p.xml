<p>Acute oral toxicity test of the crude 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract of rhizome of 
 <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> was carried out according to the method described in OECD Test Guideline 423. Three-month-old female Wistar rats, weighing 150–200 g, were randomly divided into three groups, control (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) and two treatment groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 each). The animals were maintained in an air-conditioned and light-controlled room with access to water and feed 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic> throughout the experiment. Animals were kept fasting overnight with free access to water the day prior to starting the experiment. Animals were individually weighed. Rats in the control group were administered olive oil (1 mL). Doses of 300 and 2000 mg/kg BW of crude extract were used for the limit test. The administered volume was adjusted to 1 mL/kg BW per rat.
