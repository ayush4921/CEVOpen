<p>Genotoxicity assessment was performed using comet assay where single-cell gel electrophoresis was performed to quantify the DNA damage [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The cells were treated with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration and no toxicity concentration of the extract for 24 h. The harvested cells were suspended in low melting point agarose in PBS and pipetted out to microscope slides on precoated layer of normal melting point agarose. Another layer of medium melting agarose was laid on top of the low melting agarose. Slides were immersed in prechilled lysis buffer (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>EDTA, 10 mM Tris, 0.2mMNaOH (pH 10), and Triton X-100) and incubated overnight at 4°C in order to lyse the cells and allow DNA unwinding. Then, the slides were exposed to alkaline buffer (300 mM NaOH, and 1 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>-EDTA (pH &gt; 13)) for 20 min to allow DNA unwinding and then subjected to electrophoresis at 7 V. The slides were washed with neutralization buffer (0.4 M Tris, pH 7.5) for 2 min and observed in the fluorescent microscope. The triplicate data, each from one hundred and fifty cells, from each treatment group, were collected manually. The images were used to evaluate the degree of DNA damage representing the fraction of total DNA in the tail, according to Gayathri et al. [
