  <p>Assessment of DNA damage in A549 cells adopting comet assay. Data for the other cells are not shown since all showed similar trend. (a) DNA damage induced by 
   <italic>A. malaccensis</italic> extract. Treated cells in which DNA has undergone strand breaks look like comets. (b) DNA damage as defined according to the DNA in the tail. The multiple parts of each column (from the bottom to the top): intact (0–20%), slightly damaged (20–40%), damaged (40–60%), highly damaged (60–80%), and dead (80–100%). Data are expressed as average of three independent experiments.
