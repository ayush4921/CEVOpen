<p>While the extracts were rich in cichoric and caftaric acids, the amount of chlorogenic acid in the extract was below limit of detection (LOD). Thus, it was omitted from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05142-f001">Figure 1</xref>. Generally, cichoric acid was the most abundant phenolic acid in the extracts. Its concentration ranged between 2.1 (in W-3D)- and 3.3 (in E50-1D)-fold higher than the amount of caftaric acid in the corresponding extracts. Thus, the cichoric acid content was the main contributing factor to the total phenolic acid content (TPA), calculated as the sum of caftaric, chlorogenic, and cichoric acid contents. The concentrations of caftaric and cichoric acids correlated significantly (
