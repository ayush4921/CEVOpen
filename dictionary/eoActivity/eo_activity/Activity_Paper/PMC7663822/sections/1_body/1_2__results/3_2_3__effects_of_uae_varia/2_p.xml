<p>The effects of the independent variables on the amount of target substances are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05142-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The results clearly show that the extraction variables have a great impact on the success of the extraction. Depending on the extraction parameters, the concentrations of caftaric and cichoric acid changed from 6.64 to 50.26 μg/mL and from 7.49 to 155.31 μg/mL, which are approximately seven- and twenty-fold increases, respectively. The levels of independent variables needed for the maximum extraction of caffeic acid derivatives were as follows: glycerol 90% (
