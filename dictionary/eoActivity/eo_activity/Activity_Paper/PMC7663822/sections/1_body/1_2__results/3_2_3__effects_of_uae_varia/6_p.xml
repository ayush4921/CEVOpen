<p>The Pareto charts illustrating the effects of the extraction conditions on the contents of cichoric acid (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05142-f004">Figure 4</xref>a) were rather similar due to the cichoric acid being the most abundant phenolic acid and contributing largely to TPA. The Bonferroni limit and the 
 <italic>t</italic>-value limit were also rather similar, with the 
 <italic>t</italic>-values of the effects being approximately 3.6 and 2.09, respectively. Variables with coefficients above the Bonferroni limit, such as A, B, D, and E, were significant model factors. Similarly, the terms AD, DE, and ABC, which fell between the Bonferroni limit and the 
 <italic>t</italic>-value limit, were considered likely to be significant factors. The color codes indicate that A, B, D, and AD positively affected extraction efficiency, while E, DE, and ABC influenced the extraction negatively. The predicted and measured values were in good agreement (
