<p>A preliminary extraction was carried out using a two-level factorial design with the following independent variables and their ranges: glycerol concentration (10%–90%, 
 <italic>w/w</italic>), temperature (20–70 °C), ultrasound power (72–720 W), time (10–40 min), ascorbic acid concentration (0–2 mg/g), and amount of solvent (10–30 g). The numbers in brackets represent the low (−1) and high (+1) limits of the corresponding variables. Detailed conditions are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05142-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Powdered plant material (0.1 g) was suspended in the appropriate amount and concentration of glycerol–water mixtures with or without addition of ascorbic acid in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask. The extraction was performed in an ultrasonic bath (Bandelin SONOREX
 <sup>®</sup> Digital 10 P DK 156 BP, Berlin, Germany) using the frequency of 35 Hz at various temperatures, ultrasonication strengths, and time intervals. Upon extraction, the mixtures were filtered and stored in the dark at −20 °C until further analysis.
