<p>In this work, the amount of phenolic acids extracted by using different solvents varied slightly. Although the previous research indicated that the 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> phenolics are poorly extracted with ethanol [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it was still interesting to note that the ethanol extracts did not contain any detectable amounts of caftaric acid, while the cichoric acid was present in very low amounts. In addition, chlorogenic acid was absent in the extracts prepared by maceration, even though Bergeron et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] noted that unlike in glycerol extract, it should be present in ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>E. purpurea.</italic> Previous reports indicated that 50% ethanol was the most efficient solvent for extraction of phenolic acids from potato peel (
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, its extraction efficiency in this work did not statistically differ from the efficiency of the investigated glycerolâ€“water mixtures. Bearing in mind the importance of glycerol in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry, as well as the aforementioned advantages of glycerol from ecological and biological points of view, this is an important finding with numerous practical implications.
