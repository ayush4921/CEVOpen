<p>In order to explain the observed degradation of caffeic acid derivatives in the presence of ascorbic acid, the contents of selected transition metal were assessed. Several elements, the presence of which may influence the anti- or pro-oxidant behavior of ascorbic acid during extraction, such as iron, copper, zinc, and manganese, were determined in 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> aerial parts. It is known that ultrasonication may initiate the production of hydroxyl radicals, especially at high temperatures [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, this effect was not pronounced enough to reduce the contents of phenolic acids in the extracts prepared without ascorbic acid. In addition to antioxidant activity, ascorbic acid in the presence of catalytic metal ions can also exert pro-oxidant effects. For example, in the Fenton reaction, ascorbic acid may enhance hydroxyl radical generation. Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> reacts with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> to generate Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> and the hydroxyl radical. The presence of ascorbate can lead to recycling of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> back to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, which in turn will catalyze the formation of highly reactive oxidants from H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> catalyze the reaction of ascorbic acid with oxygen by increasing the rate of radical formation, while copper promotes the oxidation and formation of free radicals of ascorbic acid, even without the presence of oxidizing agents [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05142" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. All of these processes may generate hydroxyl and other radicals, and consequently may cause degradation of caffeic acid and its derivatives [
