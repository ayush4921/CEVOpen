Herbal remedies were known to treat many infectious diseases throughout the history of humankind. Thus, the discovery of medicinal plants as source of antimicrobial agents is useful in expanding the wide variety of antibiotics available (
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Zaidan et al., 2005</xref>). The majority of these herbal plants contain substances, which are precursors for the synthesis of conventional drugs, or substances that can be used for therapeutic purposes. Extracts which proved to be potentially effective can be used as natural alternative preventives to control food poisoning diseases and preserve food stuff avoiding health hazards of chemically antimicrobial agent applications (

Antibiotic resistance is a problem that continues to challenge the healthcare sector in a large part of the world in both developing and developed countries. The spread of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria in hospital and community settings remains a widely unresolved problem and a heavy burden to health services (

A great efforts are being made to reverse this trend, and one of them is the wide spread screening of medicinal plants from the traditional system of medicine hoping to get some newer, safer, and more effective agents that can be used to fight infectious diseases (
