<p id="p0025">The plants were identified and authenticated properly at the Herbarium of Haramaya University. The plant leaves were separated, washed and cleaned thoroughly with tap water and then with distilled water and air-dried in shade at botanical laboratory for several weeks. Plant extracts were prepared in accordance with the methods described in (
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Basri and Fan, 2005</xref>) with minor modifications. About 40 g of the powder was separately soaked in 200 mL of methanol (70%) and aqueous, in a 400 mL stoppered reagent bottle and the mixture were shaken for 72 hrs using an electrical shaker. The resulting mixture was first filtered with cheesecloth, then with Whatman N
 <underline>o</underline>1 filter paper. The filtrates were then separately concentrated in vacuum using Rotary Evaporator at 30-40 °C. The methanol extracts were transferred carefully to labeled vials and allowed to permit evaporation of residual solvents at room temperature for 3–4 days while the aqueous extracts were dried using Lyophilizer alpha 1–2 LD plus-Martin Christ to prepare crude powder. Then the dried extracts were stored in sterile bottles and kept in refrigerator until further use. Heat treatment of plant crude extracts was done using the method described by (

 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Simlai and Roy, 2012</xref>) with some modifications. Dried extracts of plant materials were kept under 45, 50, and 55 °C for both 30 and 60 min in oven dry. Then the samples were cooled at room temperature and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C until further use. The disc diffusion method (
