<p id="p0035">Solutions of 200 mg/mL were prepared by reconstituting 1 g of each of the dried crude powder in 5 mL of aqueous solution. From this stock solution, 150 mg/mL, 125 mg/mL and 100 mg/mL working solutions were prepared and used for the susceptibility testing. Another stock solution of crude extract 20 mg/mL was prepared by reconstituting 0.1 g of each of the dried crude powder in 5 mL of aqueous solution. Five sterile test tubes were arranged on a test tube rack and 1 mL of sterile solvent solution was dispensed into them. From the stock solution, 1 mL of extract was transferred into the first test tube and then successive two-fold serial dilutions of the extracts were carried out. The resultant concentrations in the test tubes were 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625 mg/mL (
