<p>To an ice-cooled solution of corresponding amine (2.63 mmol) in ACN (6.1 ml), 
 <italic>t</italic>-BuONO (325 mg, 3.16 mmol) was added dropwise, followed by TMSN
 <sub>3</sub> (333 mg, 2.89 mmol). Solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 h and in the next step, 
 <bold>1</bold> (632 mg, 2.63 mmol) and 1 M solution of TBAF in THF (2.89 ml) were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> · 5H
 <sub>2</sub>O (65.7 mg, 0.263 mmol) and a freshly prepared aqueous solution (0.526 ml) of sodium ascorbate (104 mg, 0.526 mmol) were added, and the obtained solution was stirred for 24 h under an argon atmosphere at room temperature. Afterwards, the reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum and the crude product was dissolved in AcOEt (30 ml). Obtained solution was washed with 0.1 M hydrochloric acid. After separation organic phase was dried using MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>, solvent was evaporated and the resulting residue was crystallised from ACN to give the desired products
