 <sup>3</sup>H] oestrone sulphate for enzyme and cellular assays was purchased from PerkinElmer. Acetonitrile (ACN) and dichloromethane (DCM) were dried and distilled using standard procedures. Melting points (uncorrected) were determined with a Stuart Scientific SMP30 apparatus. Infra-red spectra were measured on a Nicolet 8700 spectrometer. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts δ are reported in parts per million relative to the residual solvent peak (CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> = 7.26 ppm for 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 77.0 ppm for 
 <sup>13</sup>C, DMSO-d
 <sub>6</sub> 2.49 ppm for 
 <sup>1</sup>H, and 39.5 ppm for 
 <sup>13</sup>C). Coupling constants are given in Hertz. Mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent 6540 Accurate Mass Q-TOF LC/MS System. Elemental analysis was performed using CHNS-Carlo Erba EA-1108. Preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out with Polygram SIL G/UV254, silica gel (Macherey-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Düren, Germany). Column chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh, Merck).
