<p>A solution of 6-bromo-2-naphthol (892 mg, 4 mmol), trimethylsilylacetylene (0.831 ml, 6 mmol), palladium(II) chloride (35.5 mg, 0.20 mmol), triphenylphosphine (105 mg, 0.40 mmol), copper(I) iodide (19 mg, 0.10 mmol) and triethylamine (3.94 ml, 28.2 mmol) in dry ACN (20 ml) was refluxed under an argon atmosphere. After 3 h of heating, the reaction mixture was cooled down and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and crude product was purified with column chromatography using AcOEt/hexane (1:4) as eluent to afford the desired compound
