<p>The newly designed compounds 
 <bold>3A-L</bold> based on 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamate derivatives were synthesised according to the route shown in (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH001">Scheme 1</xref>). In the first step, we synthesised 6-((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)naphthalen-2-ol 
 <bold>1</bold> by the Sonogashira coupling reaction between 6-bromo-2-naphthol and trimethylsilylacetylene. Next step included the preparation of 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-ol derivatives 
 <bold>2 A-L</bold> by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. In this case the corresponding azide derivatives (obtained from commercially available anilines by the reaction with 
 <italic>t</italic>-BuONO and TMSN
 <sub>3</sub>) were treated with 
 <bold>1</bold> in the presence of CuSO
 <sub>4</sub> · 5H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.1 equiv.), sodium ascorbate (0.2 equiv.), and TBAF. Finally, 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-ol derivatives 
 <bold>2 A-L</bold> were sulphamoylated using sulphamoyl chloride previously generated in the reaction of chlorosulphonyl isocyanate and formic acid in the presence of a catalytic amount of 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-DMA. After standard isolation, the desired derivatives 
 <bold>3A-L</bold> were obtained.
