<p>In order to analyse the ligand-protein interactions that could be responsible for the stabilisation of the inhibitor-enzyme complexes, studies using BIOVIA, Dassault Systémes, Discovery Studio Visualiser software have been carried out. Our research has shown that the newly designed potential STS inhibitors based on 6–(1-phenyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)naphthalen-2-yl sulphamate derivatives were able to create the complexes with the STS protein stabilised by a number of interactions including π-alkyl, alkyl, π-sulphur, conventional hydrogen bond, carbon hydrogen bond, π-cation, or π-sigma (listed in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The largest number of interactions was detected for compounds 
 <bold>3E</bold>, 
 <bold>3F</bold>, 
 <bold>3G</bold>. However, apart from the above-mentioned numerous interactions, an extremely important aspect (influencing the inhibitory properties of STS inhibitors based on aryl-sulphamate derivatives) is their ability to undergo the nucleophilic substitution reactions on the sulphur atom. Although the mechanism of action is not confirmed and remains a topic of discussion, a sulphamate functional group (sulphate mimic) might be transferred to fGly75 residue leading to irreversible inhibition of the STS enzyme

 <bold>3L</bold> using VMD 1.9 (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. The sulphamate functional group, which is directly responsible for the inactivation of the enzyme, is located in the catalytic region of STS close to the fGly75 residue coordinated to Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and stabilised by π-sulphur interaction with His290 (the distance between the sulphur atom of 
 <bold>3L</bold> and OH group of fGly75 is 2.90 Å). For this reason, we suppose that the compound 
 <bold>3L</bold> (despite a smaller number of electrostatic interactions indicated by the docking program) may prove to be the most effective due to the very close distance of the sulphamate group to fGly75 residue. Furthermore, the tetracyclic core of compound 
 <bold>3L</bold> is well accommodated in the STS active site and is surrounded by some hydrophobic amino acid residues (e.g. Leu103, Leu167, Phe178, Phe182, Phe237, Val486, Phe488, and Phe553). Interestingly, the fluorine atoms of compound 
 <bold>3L</bold> are within a short distance to the nitrogen atoms of the Arg98 residue (4.12 and 4.29 Å), indicating the possibility of electrostatic interactions (undetected by the Discovery Studio Visualiser). On the other hand, the presence of the fluorine atoms may be crucial for its potentially increased ability to undergo the enzymatic reaction. Highly electronegative fluorine atoms may reduce the pKa value of the molecule, making it a good leaving group in the nucleophilic substitution reaction on the sulphur atom. In addition, the molecular modelling studies indicated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) that the triazole ring of compound 
 <bold>3L</bold> is located close to the Thr484 residue, suggesting an additional interaction including hydrogen bond between OH group of Thr484 and ring-nitrogen atom (5.81 Å). These detected interaction points may be responsible for an enhancement of inhibitory potency by stabilisation of the potential STS inhibitor in the enzyme’s active site.
