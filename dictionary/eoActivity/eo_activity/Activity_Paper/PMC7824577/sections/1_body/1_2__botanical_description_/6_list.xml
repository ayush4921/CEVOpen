   <italic>M. oleifera</italic> is especially sensitive to low temperatures. During the coldest months, it can withstand between −1 °C and 3 °C, tolerating short and low-intensity frosts. If the frost persists, the plant dies immediately. Consequently, low temperatures are considered to be the “exclusive” factor for the development of this plant. In the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands, December, January, and February are the months when the lowest temperatures are reached. The main mountain systems and most of the Douro Valley are unsuitable areas for the cultivation of the
