<p>Furthermore, a Japanese research report [

 <sub>2</sub>) of the 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> tree is twenty times higher than that of vegetation in general. The 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> tree has great potential not only to store carbon but also to improve the livelihoods of many smallholders. Therefore, as discussed above, planting this tree in different parts of the country could mitigate the effects of climate change [
