<p>According to the WHO [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], total dietary fat should be between 15–30% of the total energy, of which less than 10% must be saturated fatty acids (SFA), between 6–10% must be polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), and 15% must be monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). The ideal balance of SFA: MUFA: PUFA would be approximately 1:1.3:1 [
 <xref rid="B61-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Within PUFAs, the most important are omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, with an omega-6 percentage of about 5–8% of the total dietary energy and between 1–2% of omega-3. Interest in omega-3 PUFAs has increased in recent years due to their various roles in promoting health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These fatty acids are present in certain vegetables and soybeans and other plants have been genetically modified to contain higher levels of PUFA [

 <xref rid="B64-foods-10-00031" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, it is not desirable to reduce the supply of omega-6 fatty acids because it would cause an imbalance in that proportion, but it is much more desirable to increase the supply of omega-3 fatty acids [
