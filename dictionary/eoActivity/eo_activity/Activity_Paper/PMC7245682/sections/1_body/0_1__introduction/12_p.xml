<p>It is important that Sub-Saharan African countries start to use local resources for the development of drugs. Therefore, this work intends to analyze the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of medicinal plants from Sub-Saharan Africa against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. in order to identify effective extracts and chemical compounds against the bacteria that may be the subject of further studies for development of new drugs. To our knowledge, there is no systematized data for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of medicinal plants against this pathogen. Thus, this review is a pilot research that may direct future research to identify drug candidate molecules in Sub-Saharan African flora.
