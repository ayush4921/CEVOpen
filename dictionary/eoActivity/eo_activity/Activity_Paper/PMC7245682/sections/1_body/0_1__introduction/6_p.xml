 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. are on the World Health Organization (WHO) list of global priority pathogens for research and development of new antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Several antibiotics are no longer effective in the clinical treatment of campylobacteriosis, so new antibiotics and novel treatment schemes are needed [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this context, medicinal plants are promising in isolating candidate molecules for new drugs [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], since phytochemicals are a major source of bioactive compounds with potent antimicrobial activities [
