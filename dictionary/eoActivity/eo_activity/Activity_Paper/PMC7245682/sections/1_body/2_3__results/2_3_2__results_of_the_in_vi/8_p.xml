<p>A total of seven pure compounds were isolated from 3 plants and tested against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. Cryptolepine, an alkaloid isolated from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. sanguinolenta</italic> root, was the most effective compound with MIC ranging between 6.25 and 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and 
 <italic>C. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Methyl gallate from the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Searsia chirindensis</italic> leaf presented a MIC of 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml against 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and was very effective as well [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Other four compounds were isolated from this plant extract, namely, myricetin-3-O-arabinopyranoside, myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside, and quercetin-3-O-arabinofuranoside with MICs ranging between 130 and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, friedelan-3-one, a terpenoid isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Pterocarpus santalinoides</italic> leaf, was not effective against 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
