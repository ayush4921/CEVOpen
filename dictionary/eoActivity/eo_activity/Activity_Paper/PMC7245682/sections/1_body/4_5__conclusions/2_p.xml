<p>Some plants, such as 
 <italic>Cryptolepis sanguinolenta</italic> and 
 <italic>Terminalia macroptera</italic> are the most effective with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. Besides these, 
 <italic>Combretum woodii</italic>, 
 <italic>Albertisia villosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Lippia javanica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pterocarpus angolensis</italic> have also a strong activity against the bacteria. Of those plants with strong activity, only 
 <italic>C. sanguinolenta</italic> had its active compounds isolated and tested against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. These data demonstrate the need to isolate and test compounds from other plants as precursor steps in the discovery of novel candidate drugs.
