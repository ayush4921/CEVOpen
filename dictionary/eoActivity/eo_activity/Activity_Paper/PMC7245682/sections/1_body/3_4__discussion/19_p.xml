<p>A study in South Africa reported that, among many bacteria tested on a total of 11 medicinal plants extracts, 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> was the most resistant [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], probably due to its biochemical defense mechanisms. Some of the mechanisms are the efflux pumps that remove antibiotics from the cytosol of the bacteria [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Other biochemical defense mechanisms include decreasing outer membrane permeability and alterations in the membrane structure or in porin proteins [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This fact is important and emphasizes the truth that few plants with considerable antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. have been found. In this context, plants with low MIC values are promising in the development of new drugs or in the natural treatment of diarrhea caused by these bacteria.
