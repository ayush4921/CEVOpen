<p>It is interesting that another plant of the Combretaceae family, 
 <italic>Combretum woodii</italic>, was the third with greater antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> spp. (MIC = 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of the acetone and ethanolic extract of leaves). Nevertheless, unlike other species from that family, traditional medicinal use of 
 <italic>C. woodii</italic> has not been reported in the literature.
