 <italic>P. angolensis</italic> bark is used for treatment of wounds, malaria, gonorrhea, headaches, stomach aches, diarrhea, mouth sores, and rashes in Venda, South Africa [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Tannins and saponins were the identified classes of compounds in a preliminary phytochemical screening of stem bark [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The water and methanol extracts of the bark are very effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Candida krusei</italic>, while the dichloromethane extract is effective against 
 <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Four tannins were isolated from an ethanolic extract of the stem bark, namely, (-)-epicatechin, epicatechin-3-O-gallate, epicatechin (4bâ€“8)-epicatechin (B2), and a hexamer of epicatechin. These compounds were effective against the following bacteria: 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Micrococcus kristinae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Acinetobacter calcoaceticus</italic> [
