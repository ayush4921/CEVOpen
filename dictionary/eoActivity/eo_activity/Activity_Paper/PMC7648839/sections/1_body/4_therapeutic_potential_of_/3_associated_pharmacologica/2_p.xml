<p id="Par12">Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] examined antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> plant extract against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced toxicity mice by applying several standard in-vitro methods. Standard procedures were applied in their research to examine the properties of malondialdehyde (MDA) and antioxidant enzymes which includes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT). Powder generated by evaporation and lyophilization of ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> was diagnosed with potent antioxidant ability. Balasundari et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] proposed that lethal cell injury against CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and elevated development of lipid peroxidation compounds due to deficiency of antioxidant enzyme activities can be prevented by xanthones, isolated from 
 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> plant extract. In vivo experiments using different animal models were conducted in this study to confirm antiradical properties of xanthones rich extract specifically to prevent toxic effects of free radicals. Sharma et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] evaluated antioxidant capacity of the plant extract by analyzing its free radical scavenging potential (DPPH assay). Butylated hydroxy toluene was used to analyze antioxidant capacity of acetonic and methanolic plant extract. The result of EC50 value of methanolic extract was evaluated as 27.70 μg/ml, which was comparable to the result of 17.75 μg/ml for butylated hydroxytoluene extract. It clearly indicates that methanolic extract of the whole plant possesses potent antioxidant property. Suryawanshi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] hypothesized that the presence of flavonoids and secoiridoids mainly determines the antioxidant property of methanolic plant extract.
