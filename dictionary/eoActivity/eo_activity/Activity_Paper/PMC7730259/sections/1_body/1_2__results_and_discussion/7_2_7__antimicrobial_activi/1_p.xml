<p>The COR-NE was assessed in a disk diffusion assay with pathogenic Gram-negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and Gram-positive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria, and the results were compared with those produced by commercial 
 <italic>neomycin</italic>-impregnated disks. The zone of inhibition by COR-NE in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> cultures was 11 and 12 mm, respectively, which was similar to the 
 <italic>neomycin 30</italic> disk (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05733-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The mechanism involved in the inhibition of bacterial growth is the transformation of membrane permeability, and the destruction of protein and nucleic acid structure that inhibit nucleic acid synthesis and permanently damage the cell wall of the bacteria. Overall, this causes cell death with an increase in structural lesions and induces the release of electrolyte, protein, and other cell contents [
