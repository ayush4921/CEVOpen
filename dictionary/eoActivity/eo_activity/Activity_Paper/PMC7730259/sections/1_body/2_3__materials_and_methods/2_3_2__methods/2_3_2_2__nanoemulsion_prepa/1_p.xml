<p>The NE was prepared as described previously with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Optimization of the COR-NE was performed using different extracts, oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants. A total of three samples were prepared and optimized, and their stability was assessed. The NE was prepared using 10 g of 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> (extracted using 100 g/2 L water) sea buckthorn oil, Tween 80 (nonionic surfactant), and chitosan (from crab shell) as a co-surfactant added at 1% of the total volume. A total of three samples were prepared for optimized stability, namely, S1, S2, and S3.
