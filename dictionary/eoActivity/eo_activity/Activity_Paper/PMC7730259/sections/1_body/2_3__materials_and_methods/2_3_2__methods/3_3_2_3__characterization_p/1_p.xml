<p>Several analytical methods were used to determine the size, shape, stability, and morphology of the NE. The morphology and size were confirmed using field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM; JEM-2100 F, JEOL, Suwon, Korea). One drop of the NE was deposited onto a carbon grid and dried in a 60 °C oven for 10 min and placed for capturing images. The particle size and zeta potential of the NE were analyzed using dynamic light scattering (DLS; Otsuka Electronics, Shiga, Japan). The NE preparations were diluted 10-fold with distilled water for evaluation of the Z-average diameter, zeta potential, and the polydispersity index (PDI). The temperature was maintained at 25 °C and as a reference condition, a dispersive medium of pure water with a refractive index of 1.3328, a dielectric constant of 78.3, and viscosity of 0.8878 was used. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR; Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer, Boston, MA) was performed in the range of 450–4000 cm
