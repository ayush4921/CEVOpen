<p>To prepare the coarse emulsion, the water extract was poured into a conical flask and stirred continuously at 500 rpm at room temperature using a magnetic stirrer while adding the oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant. The preparation was then subjected to an ultrasonic probe (VCX 130 ultrasonic processor, from Sonics and materials Inc., (Newtown, CT, USA) for NE formation. The probe frequency was set to 20 kHz and 130 W, the amplitude was set to 50%, and the probe diameter was 3 mm (titanium alloy). The whole process was completed within 15 min using a 10 s pulse and 1 s off cycle. Three preparations were prepared using the same conditions. We performed the whole experiment using an ice bath to avoid any thermal damage and kept the NE formulation at 4 Â°C and the flasks were wrapped with foil for further experiments. Finally, the best optimized sample was used for characterization and further experiments.</p>
