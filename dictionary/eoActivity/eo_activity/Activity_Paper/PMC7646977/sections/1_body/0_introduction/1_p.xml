<p>Inflammation, which is one of the physical barriers of innate immunity, is the protective response by which the body eliminates harmful stimuli, such as damaged cells, pathogens and irritants (

However, the prolonged inflammatory response of immune cells to noxious stimuli leads to chronic inflammation, which causes various diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, cancer, cirrhosis, Alzheimer's disease and neurological diseases (

 <sub>2</sub>, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), have been linked to pathophysiological events and chronic inflammatory diseases (
