 <xref rid="b22-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Briefly, leaves, branches or fruits of honeyberry (20 g) were extracted by shaking in 70% ethanol (400 ml) at room temperature for 72 h. The ethanol-soluble fraction was then filtered, concentrated to a volume of ~120 ml using a vacuum evaporator and freeze-dried. The ethanol extracts were kept in a freezer (−80°C) until use. The extracts from the leaves (HBL), branches (HBB) or fruits (HBF) of honeyberry were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) when used to treat cells. DMSO was used as a control and the final DMSO concentration in the cell culture was ≤0.1% (v/v).
