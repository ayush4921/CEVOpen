<p>Total phenolic content was measured using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay (
 <xref rid="b23-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Briefly, 0.5 ml HBL, HBB or HBF (50 mg/ml) was mixed with 0.5 ml 2N Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (cat. no. 47641; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) at room temperature for 5 min, followed by the addition of 2 ml 7% sodium carbonate (w/v). The mixtures were incubated for 90 min at room temperature. The absorbance of the mixture was then measured at 750 nm using a UV/visible spectrophotometer (Xma-3000PC; Human Corporation).
