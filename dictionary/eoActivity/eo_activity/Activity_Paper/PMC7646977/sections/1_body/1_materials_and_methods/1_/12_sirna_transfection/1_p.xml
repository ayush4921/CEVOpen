<p>RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (1×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with control, HO-1 or ATF3 siRNA at 37°C for 48 h at a concentration of 100 nM using TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, LLC) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB were treated at 37°C for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) at 37°C for 20 h. Following treatment, mRNA expression levels of HO-1, ATF3, iNOS or IL-1β were analyzed using RT-qPCR.
