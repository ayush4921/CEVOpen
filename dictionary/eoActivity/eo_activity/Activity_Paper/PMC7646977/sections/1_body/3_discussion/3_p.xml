<p>NF-κB is an important transcription factor involved in the inflammatory response (
 <xref rid="b39-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Inflammatory stimuli, such as LPS, activate NF-κB by inducing cytosolic IκB-α degradation and the subsequent accumulation of p65 in the nucleus, which leads to the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (
 <xref rid="b39-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Interestingly, the present study demonstrated that HBL and HBB did not inhibit the LPS-induced cytosolic degradation of IκB-α but attenuated the increase in the nuclear level of p65 protein. There is evidence that p65 phosphorylation is essential for the nuclear accumulation of p65 and transcriptional activation (
 <xref rid="b40-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). There are various phosphorylation sites of p65, among which the phosphorylation of serine 529 has been reported to be involved in the nuclear accumulation of p65 (
 <xref rid="b40-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that the inhibitory effects of HBL and HBB on p65 nuclear accumulation are caused by the inhibition of p65 phosphorylation at serine 529. However, this hypothesis requires elucidation through further study.
