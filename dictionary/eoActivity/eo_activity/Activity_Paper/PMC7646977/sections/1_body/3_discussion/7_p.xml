<p>In summary, the present study demonstrated that HBL and HBB inhibited LPS-induced NF-ÎºB activation by blocking the nuclear accumulation of p65, increasing HO-1 expression through ROS/p38/Nrf2 activation, and increasing ATF3 expression. Furthermore, HBB inhibited LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation. The regulatory effects of HBL and HBB on these signaling pathways may be associated with their anti-inflammatory activities. These findings suggest that HBL and HBB may have great potential as anti-inflammatory drugs and should be further explored for development as natural anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the study is limited as it involved only cell-based experiments. Therefore, preclinical studies using animal models are required to validate the anti-inflammatory activities of HBL and HBB prior to their development as natural anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
