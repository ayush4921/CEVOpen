<p>MAPK is also involved in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (

However, HBB suppressed LPS-induced p38 phosphorylation but not ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As p38 MAPK is considered a potential molecular target for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs, p38 inhibitors are currently being developed. The anti-inflammatory activities of these p38 inhibitors have been confirmed clinically (

 <xref rid="b42-mmr-22-06-5219" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Therefore, the data in the present study indicate that the inhibition of p38 activation by HBB was associated with the downregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators.
