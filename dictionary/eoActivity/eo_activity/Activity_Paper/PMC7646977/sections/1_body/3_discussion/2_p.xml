<p>According to previous reports, HBF inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators during the LPS-induced inflammatory response (

However, in the present study, it was observed that HBF (100 µg/ml) did not inhibit the LPS-induced overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators, namely NO, iNOS, and IL-1β, whereas HBL and HBB significantly suppressed the overproduction of these mediators at the same concentration. Polyphenolic compounds are associated with lower risk of degenerative and chronic diseases than other dietary components and are known to have anti-inflammatory properties (

This result indicates that the difference in the inhibitory activities of HBL, HBB and HBF against the production of inflammatory mediators may be associated with the levels of polyphenolic compounds they contain. We also hypothesize that the differences in the inhibitory effect of HBF on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in different studies may be due to variations in the growth environment of honeyberry. This is because the secondary metabolites of plants are regulated by the environment in which the plants are grown (
