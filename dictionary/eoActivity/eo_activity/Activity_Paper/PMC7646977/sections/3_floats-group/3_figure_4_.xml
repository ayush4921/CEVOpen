  <p>Inhibitory effects of HBL and HBB on NF-κB and MAPK activation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. (A) RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 100 and 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB for 4 h and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 30 min. (B) RAW264.7 cells were pretreated with 100 and 200 µg/ml HBL and HBB and then co-treated with LPS (1 µg/ml) for 1 h. After the treatment, nuclear protein was prepared. The cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting was performed using antibodies against IκB-α, P-p38, p38, P-ERK1/2, ERK1/2 and p65. Actin or TBP was used as the internal control for western blot analysis. *P&lt;0.05 vs. untreated cells and 
   <sup>#</sup>P&lt;0.05 vs. cells treated with LPS alone. HBL, honeyberry leaf extract; HBB, honeyberry bark extract; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; P, phosphorylated; T, total; TBP, TATA-box-binding protein.
