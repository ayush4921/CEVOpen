<p>Exploratory research using naturally occurring products with diverse chemical and bio-functional properties remains a promising tool for discovering new bio-functional principles. The isolation and structural elucidation of the constituents from a wide variety of medicinal resources, including traditional medicinal plants, as well as synthetic research and biological evaluation are therefore being performed. Fortunately, in this Research Topic, researchers who are active in this field have reported on recent promising research. We hope that the articles collected within this Research Topic will help inspire readers to embrace future opportunities in the field.</p>
