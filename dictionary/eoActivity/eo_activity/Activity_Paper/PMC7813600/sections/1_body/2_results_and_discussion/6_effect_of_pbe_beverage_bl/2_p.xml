<p>In this study, we observed elevated activities of α-amylase (1.54 units/g protein) and α-glucosidase (1.31 units/g protein) in the untreated diabetic rats compared with NC rats, representing increases of approximately 8-fold and 3-fold, respectively (
 <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These results imply that the increased glucose production and absorption into the blood stream were beyond the threshold level. However, upon administration of the PBE and beverage blends, the activities of these hydrolysing enzymes were remarkably reduced. Interestingly, α-amylase activity in rats treated with CHPBE-1 and CHPBE-2 did not significantly differ (
