<p>PBE treatment decreased blood glucose levels from 560 to 210 mg/dL. Although there were no significant differences (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) in blood glucose levels during the first eight days (543 to 553 mg/dL), readings on day 12 (428 mg/dL) and day 14 (210 mg/dL) significantly differed (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) from each other and from those of the first eight days. Groups treated with extracts containing 1% and 2% cocoa powder showed reduced postprandial responses (585 to 152 mg/dL and 433 to 171 mg/dL, respectively). In addition, for both the STZ+CHPBE-1 and STZ+CHPBE-2 groups, blood glucose levels for days 8 to 14 did not significantly differ (
 <italic>P</italic>&gt;0.05) from one other, but significantly differed (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) from levels at day 1 and day 4.
