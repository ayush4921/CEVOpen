<p>STZ-inducement increases free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), coupled with increased levels of the oxidative stress marker (TBARS), which interrupt the antioxidant system (
 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">Konda et al., 2019</xref>). Excessive production of ROS and decreased level of GSH promote lipid peroxidation. TBARS is an important end product of lipid peroxidation and is therefore an important biomarker for oxidative stress, a major characteristic of DM. Moreover, TBARS levels can be used to indicate the extent of oxidation in tissues or organs. Reduced activities of CAT and SOD (as observed in STZ-IND rats) promotes initiation and propagation of lipid peroxide (

Low levels of lipid peroxide may invigorate insulin secretion, whereas increased endogenous peroxide concentrations induce uncontrolled lipid peroxidation, resulting in cellular infiltration and damage to islet cells common to type 1 diabetes (
