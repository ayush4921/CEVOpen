<p>Overall, the STZ+CHPBE-2 group showed the most significant decline in blood glucose levels (greater than group treated with acarbose), with the value at day 14 similar to that of the NC group [118 mg/dL (day 1) to 97 mg/dL (day 14)]. These results suggest that the extract possesses hypoglycaemic effect, with incorporation of cocoa powder promoting this property in the herbal beverage. Although, the bioactive compounds responsible for these action(s) could not be ascertained in the present study, a previous report showed that Musa

In addition, cocoa extracts exhibit hypoglycaemic potentials, credited to their rich contents of polyphenols such as tannins and (âˆ’)-epicatechin (Chee et al., 2011). We concluded that the observed blood glucose lowering effect of PBE and its blended products (particularly CHPBE-2) could be as a result of synergistic and/or additive effect of these compounds.
