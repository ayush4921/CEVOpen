<p>Blood was centrifuged at 3,000

Tissues were homogenized separately in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) using a Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged and the supernatant used in biochemical assays. Pancreas was cut into small pieces with the aid of stainless scissors and put into 3 volumes of 200 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9 with 6 mmol/L NaCl) and homogenized. The homogenates were then centrifuged at 12,000
