<p>NO levels in the liver and kidney tissues were determined using the protocol described by 
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">Miranda et al. (2001)</xref> in a medium containing 400 μL of 2% VCl
 <sub>3</sub> in 5% HCl, 200 mL of 0.1% 
 <italic>N</italic>-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and 200 μL of 2% sulfanilamide (in 5% HCl). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min, and nitrite levels (which correspond to estimated levels of NO) were determined spectrophotometrically at 540 nm, based on the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by VCl
 <sub>3</sub>. NO levels were expressed in nanomoles of NO per milligram of protein.
