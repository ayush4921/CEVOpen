<p>α-Amylase and α-glucosidase activities were evaluated following the methods of 
 <xref rid="ref74" ref-type="bibr">Worthington (1993)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Apostolidis et al. (2007)</xref>, respectively, as described in the report of 
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Ademiluyi et al. (2014)</xref> with slight modifications. Fifty microliters of pancreas homogenates were prepared in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.9 with 0.006 M NaCl), and added to 50 μL of 1% starch solution. Reaction mixtures were incubated (25°C/10 min), and 200 μL of dinitrosalicylic acid was added for colour development. Mixtures were then boiled in a water bath (5 min) to stop the reaction, cooled to room temperature, and then diluted with 2 mL of distilled water. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm in a ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. α-Amylase activity was expressed in units/mg protein.
