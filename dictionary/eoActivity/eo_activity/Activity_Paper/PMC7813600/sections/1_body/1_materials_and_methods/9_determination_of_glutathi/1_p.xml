<p>GST activity was carried out as described by 
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Mannervik and Guthenberg (1981)</xref>. Aliquots (30 μL) of tissue homogenate were added to reaction mixtures containing 150 μL of 1 mM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), and incubated at 28°C. The absorbance was monitored for 3 min (every 15 s) at 340 nm. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the formation of 1 unit of 
 <italic>S</italic>-2,4-dinitrophenyl glutathione from CDNB and glutathione (GSH) per min at 28°C pH 6.5.
