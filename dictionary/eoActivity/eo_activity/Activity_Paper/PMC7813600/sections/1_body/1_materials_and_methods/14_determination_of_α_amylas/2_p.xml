<p>α-Glucosidase activity was evaluated in the small intestine. Small intestine homogenates (15 μL) were prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9), and added to 15 μL of 3 mM GSH and 445 μL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9), and incubated (37°C/10 min). Then, 40 μL of 5 mM 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) was added to the mixture and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Sodium carbonate (2 mL) was then added and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Total protein content of the enzyme solution was determined according to
