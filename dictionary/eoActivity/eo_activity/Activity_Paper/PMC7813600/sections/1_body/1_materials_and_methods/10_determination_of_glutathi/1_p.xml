<p>Evaluation of GPx activity in tissue homogenate was carried out following the method of 
 <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">Rotruck et al. (1973)</xref>. Exactly 500 μL of tissue homogenate was added to 250 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 50 μL sodium azide (10 mM), 100 mL GSH (4.0 mM), 50 μL H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (2.5 mM), and 500 mL of distilled water. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 3 min at room temperature; 50 μL of 10% trichloroacetic acid was then added, mixed, and the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 rpm. The supernatant (50 μL) was then added 450 μL 0.3 M disodium hydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 500 mL of freshly prepared 0.6 mM dithiobisnitro-benzoate in 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. The absorbance was read at 412 nm against blank (prepared by replacing homogenates with distilled water).
