<p>CAT activity was evaluated using the method of 
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Beers and Sizer (1952)</xref> with modification. Briefly, 50 μL of tissue homogenate was added to a mixture containing 500 μL of 59 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 950 μL of 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The reaction was carried out at 25°C and absorbance was monitored at 570 nm for 3 min at 150 s interval. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing decomposition of 1 mmol H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> per min at 25°C and pH 7.0.
