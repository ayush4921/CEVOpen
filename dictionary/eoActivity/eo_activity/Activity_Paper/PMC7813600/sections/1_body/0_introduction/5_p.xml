<p>The blend of plantain bulb extracts (PBEs) with cocoa powder has an unpleasant after taste, which requires sweetening before consumption. Natural honey is the most ancient sweetener and comprises of several components (including vitamins and mineral elements), including fructose and glucose as the main substances (

However, studies have reported honey is safe for consumption by diabetic patients, considering its low glycaemic index and overall effect on glycaemic control (

Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the antihyperglycemic, hepatic-protective, and nephro-protective potentials of PBE beverage blends (with 1% or 2% cocoa powder). We assessed blood glucose levels, antioxidant status, and modulatory activities of α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes after periodic administration of PBE blends to streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.
