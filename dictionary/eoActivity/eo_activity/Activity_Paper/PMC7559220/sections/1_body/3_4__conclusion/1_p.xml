<p>In this study, we report a one-step biosynthesis of ecofriendly and stable AgNPs from 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic> leaf extract at an optimum condition of 1 mM AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> when combined with 5 mg/mL extract in a ratio of 1 : 10 (extract to AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>) at 60°C for 2 hours. Furthermore, controlled size nanoparticles (10-60 nm) were obtained that were confirmed by XRD, DLS, and SEM analyses. The 
 <italic>Fagonia indica</italic> extract and AgNPs induced anticancer activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The NPs and extract induce membrane permeability, nuclear condensation in an apoptotic manner due to activation of caspases, and generation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, these nanoparticles have the potential for the future development of the anticancer drug.
