<p>The outcome of AgNPs on nuclear changes was observed using the DAPI staining assay. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"> Figure 8</xref> indicates significant changes in the morphology of the chromatin nuclear material after DAPI staining of AgNP and extract-treated cells for 24 hours compared to the untreated control. It can be observed that the control cells have normal rounded nuclei with normal blue color, whereas the treated cells have a bright color, abnormal nuclei, and condensed chromatin with irregular cell structure. These results are consistent with Ciftci et al. [
