<p>XRD analysis was used to examine the crystallinity level of silver nanoparticles. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the XRD pattern of biosynthesized AgNPs. The obtained Bragg peaks were found to be consistent with crystallographic reflections from 111 (35.68°), 200 (51.62°), 220 (65.86°), and 311 (77.95°) that corresponds to the JCPDS pattern 04-0783. Average size was calculated as 12.09 nm using the Debye-Scherrer approximation [
