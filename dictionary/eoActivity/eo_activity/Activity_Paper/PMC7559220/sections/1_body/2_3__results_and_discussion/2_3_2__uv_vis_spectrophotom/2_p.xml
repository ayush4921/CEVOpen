<p>Aqueous extract-mediated reduction of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> in AgNPs was monitored using a spectrophotometer in the UV-visible range. The surface plasmon resonance was found to be ~430 nm. Results of the various optimization parameters are presented in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>–3(d). The concentration of 1 mM AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> was found to be effective and yielded silver nanoparticles, while at higher concentrations, the biosynthesis was insignificant as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>. Therefore, the concentration of 1 mM was processed for the further optimization experiments. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3(b)</xref> suggests the variation in concentrations of plant extracts by keeping the concentration of the precursor as 1 mM as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>. Temperature-dependent biosynthesis was performed by applying a varying degree of temperature with a difference of 5°C between the ranges of 40°C to 60°C. It can be observed that below 50°C, there was no formation of AgNPs. Ag nanoparticle formation was indicated at 55°C and 60°C. The temperature of 60°C was considered as the optimum temperature for biomodulated AgNP synthesis. Furthermore, the formation of AgNPs was monitored relative to time. Time-based optimization was carried out from 0 hr to 2 hrs. It was investigated that the biosynthesis was increased relative to the increase in the time period. Biosynthesis was maximum after the duration of 2 hrs as deduced from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(d)</xref>. Already optimized parameters were used to carry out the biosynthesis. The results of our study using UV-vis spectroscopy are consistent with the earlier study reported using diverse plant extracts [
