<p>The quantification of the extent of apoptosis was performed by using Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining assay [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Only the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of AgNPs was considered for the treatment. Briefly, washing was carried out with PBS for the collected cells at least two times, and then staining was carried out with PI and Annexin V-FITC. Flow cytometry (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) was performed. Number of live cells, necrotic cells, late apoptotic cells, and early apoptotic cells were distinguished by direct counting of the cells.
