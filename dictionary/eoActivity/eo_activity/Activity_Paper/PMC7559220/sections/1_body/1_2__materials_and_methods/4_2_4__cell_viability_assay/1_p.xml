<p>The previously described protocol of MTT cytotoxicity assessment with slight modifications was used to investigate the viability of cells [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Cancer cells were grown to a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well for 24 hours and then exposed to different test concentrations of AgNPs for 24 hours. After, PBS with added 5.0 mg/mL MTT was introduced at the rate of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L into each well and incubated for another 4 hours. The introduction of MTT led to the formation of formazan crystals inside the live cells. DMSO (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was introduced for dissolving the formazan crystals, and the readings were taken at 570 nm using a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek).
