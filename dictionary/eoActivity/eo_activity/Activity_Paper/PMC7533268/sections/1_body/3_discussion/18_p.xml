<p>The highest percentage of edema inhibition for all doses (100, 200 and 400 mg) was observed at the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day of observation with the respective values of 69.46%, 74.83% and 79.87% respectively. The highest dose of the extract showed significantly higher effect (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01) via the lower (100 mg/kg) and the middle dose (200 mg/kg) while its effect was higher at the 1
 <sup>st</sup> and 2
 <sup>nd</sup> days and remain comparable at the rest days of observation with the standard drug (diclofenac 10 mg/kg). Increasing edema inhibition of the extract as the dose increased can be explained by the possible existence of an adequate concentration of the active metabolite(s) in the maximum dose level (400 mg/kg) when compared to the lower and middle (100 and 200 mg/kg) dose levels of the extract and by the quick metabolism and elimination of the effective phytoconstituents present in inadequate concentrations in the lower and middle dose levels. The observed effects of the extract may be through anti-proliferative activities against fibroblasts, inhibition of infiltrations of neutrophils and macrophages, and antagonizing the migration of leucocytes and phagocytes in to the area of inflammation.
