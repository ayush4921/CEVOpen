<p>The anti-inflammatory action of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> extract in the present study can be supported by previous reports from scientific journals that stated plants which contain mainly alkaloids, flavonoids, saponin, and tannins phenolic compound, glycosides, coumarins and triterpenoid chemical constituents showed strong anti-inflammatory effects. So, it can be deduced that the anti-inflammatory effect of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> extract in the present study may be due to the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, saponin, tannin, and triterpenoids. Alkaloids exert its anti-inflammatory activity through interfering with indubitable COX expression and production of PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines production like IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, terpenoids exert its anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of PLA
 <sub>2</sub> activity, inhibition of TNF-α production, inhibition of iNOS expression, inhibition of COX-2 expression, and inhibition of NF-κB activation, while saponins are believed to interfere with iNOS expression, inhibition of COX-2 expression and subsequent production of PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, and exert their sequential anti-inflammatory effects.
