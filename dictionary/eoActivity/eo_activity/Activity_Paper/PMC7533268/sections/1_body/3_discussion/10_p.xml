<p>In the study of the anti-inflammatory activity, the root extract of 
 <italic>EK</italic> was detected against carrageenan-induced acute and formalin-induced sub-acute phases of inflammation. Since the inflammatory response is a polyphasic tissue reaction, which involves both short lived increase in vascular permeability and prolonged cellular infiltration and proliferation, it is important to evaluate the potential of the extract for anti-inflammatory effect via a sequential test valid for various phases of inflammation.
