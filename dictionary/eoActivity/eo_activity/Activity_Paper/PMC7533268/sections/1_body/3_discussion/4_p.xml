<p>The possible mechanism by which the extract produced peripheral analgesia in this model might be associated with inhibiting the synthesis and release of various endogenous inflammatory mediators and suppression of sensitivity of peripheral nociceptors in the peritoneal free nerve endings for chemical-induced pain. These proposed mechanisms are in line with the principles that stated, any agent that decreases the number of writhing will demonstrate analgesia by inhibiting the synthesis and release of PGs, and by inhibiting the peripheral pain transmission.
