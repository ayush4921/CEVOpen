<p>Even though the plant 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> M. is frequently reported for its antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory potentials by traditional healers in different parts of Ethiopia, no any scientific reports concerning the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of this plant have been found in literatures yet. So, it is deemed prudent to investigate the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of the plant scientifically. The aim of the present study was therefore, to investigate the analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of 80% methanol root extract of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> M. in a mice model.
