<p>The maximum percent of anti-inflammatory activity of the extract at all test doses was observed at the 4
 <sup>th</sup> time with the respective percentage values of 54.62%, 61.54% and 70.00% and the effect at this time was found to increase in dose dependent manner. The maximum dose (400 mg/k) of the extract produced higher paw edema inhibition than the lower dose (100 mg/kg) and middle dose (200 mg/kg) of the extract (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05 respectively), whereas its edema inhibition effect was comparable with the positive control (indomethacin 25 mg/kg) at the 4
 <sup>th</sup> time of observation (
