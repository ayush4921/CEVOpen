<p>The hot plate method was performed to determine the central analgesic activity of 
 <italic>EK</italic> extract in mice. In this model all the three test doses of 
 <italic>EK</italic> extract and the standard drug morphine produced significant central analgesic activity (p &lt; 0.05, p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001) by delaying the reaction time at all-time intervals of observation when compared with the negative control (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The maximum analgesic activities of all doses of the extract (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) was observed at 120 mins of observation with the respective values of 63.93%, 66.94%, and 69.40% as compared with the standard drug (morphine 10 mg/kg) that produced 70.81% analgesic activity (
