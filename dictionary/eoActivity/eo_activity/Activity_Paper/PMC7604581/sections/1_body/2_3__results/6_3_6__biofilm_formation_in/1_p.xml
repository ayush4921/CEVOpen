 <italic>H. floribunda</italic> crude extract (MHF), which showed the highest biofilm formation inhibition toward 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>), was successively fractionated to obtain the pet-ether (PHE), ethyl acetate (EHE), and methanol (MHE) fractions, and their biofilm inhibitory effects were investigated. MHE showed the highest biofilm formation inhibitory effect with an MBIC of 0.0625 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). An alkaloidal fraction (AKL) was further prepared from MHE and purified by column and high-performance liquid chromatography to yield the compounds HF1A, HF1B, and HF1C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The amount of biofilm formed recorded as optical density in the presence of different concentrations of PHE, EHE, MHE, AKL and the isolated compounds toward 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> is demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>–
