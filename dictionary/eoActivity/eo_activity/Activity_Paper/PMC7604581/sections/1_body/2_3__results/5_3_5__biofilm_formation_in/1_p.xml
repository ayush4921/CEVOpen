<p>The methanol extracts of the eight plants that showed antibacterial activity were further tested for biofilm inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The ability of the extracts to considerably inhibit biofilm formation by a strong biofilm producer (i.e., 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>) was determined and the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration (MBIC) recorded. From the experiments, six out of the eight plant extracts failed to significantly inhibit biofilm formation by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> at concentrations up to 10 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref>). Meanwhile, the methanol extracts of two plants, 
 <italic>Grossera vignei</italic> (MGV) and 
 <italic>Holarrhena floribunda</italic> (MHF), showed appreciable biofilm formation inhibitory activities. At a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL, MHF reduced 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> from a high biofilm producer (OD &gt; 1.38) to a low biofilm-producing organism with an OD &lt; 0.24 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>). 
 <italic>G. vignei</italic>, methanol extract (MGV) on the other hand, reduced the biofilm production of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> to a moderate biofilm producer at concentrations of 5 to 10 mg/mL (
