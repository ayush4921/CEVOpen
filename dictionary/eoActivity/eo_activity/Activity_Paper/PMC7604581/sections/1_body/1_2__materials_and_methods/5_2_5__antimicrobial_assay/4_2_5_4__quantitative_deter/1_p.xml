<p>Quantitative assessment of biofilm formation was done using the Crystal Violet (CV) assay as described by Sasirekha et al. and the description partly reproduces their wording [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Briefly, fresh Mueller Hinton broth (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was seeded with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of standardized microorganism culture in a 96-well microtiter plate and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. After incubation, the planktonic cells were aspirated and the wells were washed with sterile water to remove the free-floating bacteria. The adhering biofilm was fixed by heating and then stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The wells were then washed with sterile water and dried. The amount of biofilm formed was quantified by adding 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 95% ethanol/acetic acid mixture (1:1) and the optical density (OD) of the resulting solution was measured at 595 nm. Background absorbance was compensated for by subtracting the optical density (OD) of sterile broth (negative control). The experiment was carried out in triplicate and the mean OD was considered. A cutoff OD was determined from the negative control and used to separate nonbiofilm from biofilm-producing microorganisms following standard methods [
