<p id="Par57">Participants will be recruited from five sites within the Queensland Palliative Care Research Group (QPCRG). These five sites have been chosen from the QPCRG as they have an established research team including research support systems within Palliative Care and have previous experience in trial participation in this setting. It is anticipated that this will be predominately an outpatient study, with these sites having the ability to access this participant population from their established clinic service.</p>
