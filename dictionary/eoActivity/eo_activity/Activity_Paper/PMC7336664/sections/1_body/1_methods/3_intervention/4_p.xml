<p id="Par56">Dose titration will be confirmed following regular consultation. Each participant will be advised to increase their dose according to a schedule every 2 days until they are satisfied with their symptom improvement or they experience unacceptable side effects. Dose titration downwards will also be allowed, in consultation with research staff. The participant in collaboration with research staff will define the dose level at which they will continue until the primary outcome point (14 days). Participants will then be given the option of remaining on the blinded oil solution for a further 2 weeks (28 days total) for continuing assessment of efficacy and adverse events (continue final dose if perceived to be of benefit and tolerated). Assessment at 28 days following 14 days of stable dose is a secondary end point.</p>
