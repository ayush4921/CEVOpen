<p id="Par44">Cannabis contains almost 500 bioactive compounds, including over 70 different cannabinoids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The predominant cannabinoids include delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is the main psychoactive component of cannabinoids and is thought to act as a partial agonist on the endocannabinoid system. Potential benefits of THC include analgesia, anti-nausea and muscle relaxation, with potential side effects including intoxication, psychosis, anxiety and sedation. The recommended dose range for oral THC varies from 2.5 to 40 mg/day [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. CBD is also considered to mediate many of the adverse psychotropic effects of THC, although this research is still emerging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. CBD has been used with a dosing in the range of 40 to 1280 mg/day orally [
