<p>The methanol fraction (24.1 mg) was eluted with methanol and water (9 : 1, v/v) to yield a brown solid. Phytochemical screening of this fraction revealed the presence of tannins and amide bonds. This fraction tested negative for saponins, sterols, reducing sugars, flavonoids, and terpenoids. The NMR spectra (Supplementary Figures
