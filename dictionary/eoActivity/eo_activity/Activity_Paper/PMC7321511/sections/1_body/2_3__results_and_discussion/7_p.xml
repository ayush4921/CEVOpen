<p>The hexane extract, which exhibited good anti-conjugant activity at a non-cytotoxic concentration was further evaluated against plasmid R7K (IncW) at sub-inhibitory concentrations, 16 to 256 mg/L. The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) showed that the activity of the hexane extract was concentration dependent and its anti-conjugant activity was comparable to the known IncW plasmid R7K conjugal inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], linoleic acid, although the activity of the linoleic acid was slightly more potent. The anti-conjugant IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the hexane extract and linoleic acid was found to be 77.8 and 60.5 mg/L, respectively, against the conjugal transfer of IncW plasmid R7K. Statistically, the activities of both the 
 <italic>M. lowiana</italic> hexane extract and linoleic acid were found to be similar since the corresponding 
 <italic>p</italic> value (0.68) indicated that their IC
 <sub>50</sub>'s were not significantly different.
