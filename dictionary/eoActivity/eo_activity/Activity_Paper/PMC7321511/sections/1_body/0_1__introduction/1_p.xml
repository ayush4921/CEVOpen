<p>Currently, antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern, especially since to date there is no known universal method for reversing drug resistance in microbes and the world is running out of effective antimicrobials [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There is considerable evidence of resistance against almost all existing classes of antimicrobial agents, namely, the

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, it has been predicted that if no antimicrobials or means of reversing antimicrobial resistance are found soon, the death toll for antimicrobial-resistant associated infections may rise to 300 million by 2050 [
