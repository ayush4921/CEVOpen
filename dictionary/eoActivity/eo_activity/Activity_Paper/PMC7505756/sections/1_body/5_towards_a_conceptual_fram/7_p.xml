<p id="p0305">Since local people are the source of information for revealing the potentials of medicinal species, their distribution and local use, their participation in any intervention is critical [

 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Hence, any transformation agenda for the sustainable integration of medicinal plant genetic resources into global value chains, should seek to integrate IK, property rights, power, knowledge and agency as analytical lenses in policy engagement and programming that targets sustainable utilisation at local level and integration into global value chain. We suggest a conceptual framework (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 3</xref>), that can be utilised in assessing ecological impacts from medicinal plant value chains. The framework may be used in the development of responsive policies on CPRs, bioprospection, conservation and sustainable utilisation of endemic medicinal flora.
