<p id="p0125">Natural resource management is vulnerable to institutional failures [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The institutional failure challenges are partly accounted for by failure to consider social and environmental contexts in which community participation is embedded [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The institutional failures are thus fueled through competition, collusion and conflict, as well as policy discourses that cement rationalities and promote particular regimes of governance [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This includes selective legitimization of strategic interests of actors, such as development agencies, state organisations and dominant market players [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This is critical in analysis of medicinal value chains where community actions are increasingly being shaped by outside forces rather than locally initiated collective action [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We extend the view in the next section in examining design challenges and some policy failures in CPRs.
