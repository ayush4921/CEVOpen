<p id="p0315">We have identified significant linkages between medicinal value chains, power, knowledge, agency, property rights and ecological degradation risks in the global supply and demand of medicinal plants. Though delocalisation of community based resource management systems, such as medicinal plants offer opportunities for income earning and employment, they are biased in favour of dominant value chain actors who leverage on IPR governance systems to advance their strategic interests. Since commercialisation of medicinal plants undermine locally established values and norms that regulate access to and control of CPRs, it promotes pervasive incentives that increase vulnerability to overexploitation and extinction of medicinal plant species. Further, in most judicial precedents, IK are considered inferior to IPR, moreso where the legal and policy frameworks are weak. IPRs, a common feature of biotechnological innovations in the isolation, processing and patenting of active ingredients from medicinal plants thus portend reaching implications on CPRs [
