<p id="p0320">As a risk management strategy, actors in the global medicinal plant value chain offer pervasive livelihood incentives through middlemen increasing the risk of overexploitation and environmental vulnerability to degradation. Increasing demand for medicinal flora, as well as legal dilemmas, agrotechnological risks and governance challenges, are thus the main drivers for overexploitation and/or extinction of medicinal flora. We conclude that sustainable exploitation and integration of endemic medicinal plants into the global value chain require multipronged strategies, such as innovative domestication of the Nagoya convention on access and benefit sharing in reducing the risk of biodiversity loss and conflicts in CPRs, documentation and validation of IK. The strategies should be anchored on reflective models that recognise and integrate feedback loops, complementarity and synergy around indigenous property rights, collective action, knowledge, power relations and agency.</p>
