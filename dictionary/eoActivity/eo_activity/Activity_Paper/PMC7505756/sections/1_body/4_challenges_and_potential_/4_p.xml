<p id="p0175">Middlemen dominated medicinal plant value chains are generally long, unregulated and have a tendency to amplify inequity and inefficiency [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In the upstream value chains, capital and skills, volume, quality, and consistency of supply are major bottlenecks, especially in small scale farmers’ value chains [
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Poor availability of market information exacerbates the constraints [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The domination by middlemen greatly reduces the margins to farmers and harvesters. It further increases the risk of biopiracy or the patenting and selling plant derived pharmaceutical products from indigenous plant species without acknowledging or providing financial compensation and/or royalties for the traditional knowledge to the medicinal plant source countries or communities.
