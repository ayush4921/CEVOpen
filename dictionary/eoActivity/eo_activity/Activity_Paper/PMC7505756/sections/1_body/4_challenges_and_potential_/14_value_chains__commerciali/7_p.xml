<p id="p0250">The ecological degradation risks in the exploitation of endemic medicinal plants, such as 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> is exacerbated by climate change, pests and diseases. Such drivers could negatively influence the ecological distribution of 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> by 2050 [
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. For example, between 1997 and 2003, 21% of the 
 <italic>Prunus Africana</italic> at Ischeno, Kakamega forest, died from bark harvesting, with 9â€“50 % of the trees experiencing canopy dieback from other causes other than debarking [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given that the genetic and chemotypic variation of 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> reflects ancient dispersal routes and evolution in isolated vulnerable montane and rare forest ecosystems in Africa [
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], the destructive harvesting practices are expected to affect the reproductive future and genetic diversity of exploited populations [
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In the next section we explore some of the successful innovations in the agricultural value chain and identify opportunities that can support the sustainable integration of endemic medicinal flora into the global value chain.
