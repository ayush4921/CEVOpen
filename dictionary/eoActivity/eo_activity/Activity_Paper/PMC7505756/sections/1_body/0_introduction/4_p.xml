<p id="p0020">In spite of increasing international trade in medicinal plants, benefits to developing countries, particularly to growers and producers, remain low. This is attributed to intermediaries, as well as lack of organisation and networking by the poor collectors of medicinal plants from the wild. This increases transactional costs, a constraint exacerbated by increasing stringent health and safety requirements in the main developed country markets [

Though some exemptions on the scope of needed documentation are provided for clinically proven products (directive 2001/83/EC; European Union, 2004), such exemptions only apply to EU member countries.
