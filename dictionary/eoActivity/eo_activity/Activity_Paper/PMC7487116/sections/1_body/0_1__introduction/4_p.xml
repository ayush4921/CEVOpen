<p>Wild vegetables contribute to people's food security and health in many rural areas of the world [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. They may have remarkable nutrient values and can be an important source of vitamins, fibers, minerals, and fatty acids; they may also show important medicinal properties [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Wild edible plants have always been an essential and widespread food source for food-insecure families living in poverty in developing countries [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. They are relevant to household food security and nutrition in some rural areas and are relied on to supplement the staple food, to fill seasonal food shortages, and to serve as emergency food during famine [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. They are also important for many communities in rural villages [
