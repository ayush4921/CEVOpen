<p>The wild leafy vegetable species had high CFSI values in both the Karen and the Lawa communities and these values were similar to those found for wild food plants in northwestern Tuscany, Italy [
 <xref rid="B52-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. They were, however, not as high as the values found for edible fruits and seeds in Bali, Indonesia, probably because the fruit species had multiple uses, including for medicine [
 <xref rid="B53-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Time may influence the selection of wild food because fruits are more difficult to harvest than leafy vegetables. Besides, most wild leafy vegetables with high CFSI values had medicinal properties in both the Karen and Lawa communities (

 <xref rid="B62-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Moreover, the availability of vegetables and the multifunctionality of food uses, i.e., fresh consumption, food addition, and condiment, are related to highly important species [

Using a compound index is a powerful tool to understand the cultural significance of resources in more detail, but informants have to deal with a large number of questions for every sub-element for each species known, and that is very time consuming [
 <xref rid="B61-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The reasons for using wild leafy vegetables were mainly related to taste, availability, and multifunctionality, which is similar to trends in the use of wild vegetables in West Sumatra, Indonesia [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Taste is a sociocultural factor for wild food plant consumption which appears to be a prime motivation for continuing consumption of wild food plants [
 <xref rid="B63-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and this is related to changes in the use of wild food plants [
 <xref rid="B64-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Moreover, loss of availability of familiar food taxa from the wild is one of the main reasons for a decrease in wild food plant consumption [
