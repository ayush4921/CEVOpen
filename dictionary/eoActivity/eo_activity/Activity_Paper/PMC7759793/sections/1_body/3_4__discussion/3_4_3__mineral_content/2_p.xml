<p>The consumption of wild plants, for instance,

 <italic>Acmella paniculata</italic> (61–138% of RDA), 
 <italic>A. uliginosa</italic> (59–133% of RDA),

However, it would take 50–100 g (fresh weight) of iron-rich species to reach the recommended volume, and the consumption of iron-rich species should be a food of choice for Thai children suffering from anemia caused by Fe deficiency. The copper levels of
