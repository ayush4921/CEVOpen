<p>Minerals are important in the physiological processes of the human body. Sodium and potassium function as electrolytes, which maintain ionic balance and establish the electric potential across cellular membranes [

 <xref rid="B72-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. According to the nutrient composition database of food made available by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), many wild leafy vegetables show high contents of macrominerals and trace minerals when compared with domesticated leafy vegetables. The range of the sodium content in the 12 species studied here was quite low when compared with the recommended dietary intake for adults (0.02‒1.4% recommended per day) (

 <xref rid="B59-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Low sodium contents in wild vegetables have been reported in previous studies of wild vegetables [

 <xref rid="B12-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and some species have moderate potassium levels (5‒27% of RDA) when compared with recommended dietary intakes. The calcium contents varied, but some species, such as 
 <italic>Spondias pinnata</italic> and 
 <italic>Ficus auriculata</italic>, had higher calcium levels in fresh weight than wild edible plants in Bangladesh [

 <italic>Spondias pinnata</italic> (98% of RDA). The calcium content of 
 <italic>S. pinnata</italic> was six times higher than the calcium contents of Chinese cabbage (150 mg/100 g FW) and kale (152 mg/100 g FW) [
