<p>Crude fat extraction was determined using a Soxhlet apparatus and petroleum ether. Crude fat residues were measured after drying, following method 954.02 [

Mineral elements analyses (phosphorus, potassium, sodium calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, zinc, and copper) were performed using atomic absorption spectroscopy (Analytik Jena, model ZEEnit 700). About 1 g of dry ash of a sample was wetted with a small volume of deionized water and then brought into a solution using 2 mL of HCl. For determination of potassium, calcium, and magnesium, the final volume should be 100 mL, which is sufficiently above the detection limit for a 1.0-g sample. For determination of manganese, iron, copper, and zinc, the final volumes should be between 10 and 50 mL. Quantification of each element was performed using atomic absorption spectrometry and comparing the linear curve from the standard solution with the sample [
