<p>Our study has revealed the importance of wild food plant species, particularly leafy vegetables, commonly used in traditional diets in northern Thailand. The importance of wild vegetables was mainly related to taste, availability, and multifunctionality of species, whereas the frequency of utilization, plant parts, and medicinal roles are less important. The proximate compositions are comparable with most domesticated leafy vegetables. It illustrates the potential of wild plants as sources of essential nutrients. These wild vegetables are rich in macrominerals and trace minerals when compared with recommended dietary allowances, including magnesium (41% of RDA), iron (138% of RDA), and zinc (242% of RDA). A few wild vegetable species showed high manganese contents that exceeded tolerable upper intake level ( &gt; 11 mg/100 g edible parts), producing health risks. The data have been mostly quantitative with fresh leafy vegetables. This is important and underlines the need to pay attention to the quantity of wild plant selection and consumption. The determination of bioavailability of minerals, antioxidants, vitamins, heavy metals, and anti-nutrient factors from these wild plants is necessary to evaluate their safety. Pharmacological studies should also be conducted to verify some of the ethnomedicinal properties.</p>
