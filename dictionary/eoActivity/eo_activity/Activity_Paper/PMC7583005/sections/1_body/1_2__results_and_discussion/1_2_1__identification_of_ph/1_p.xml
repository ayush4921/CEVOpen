<p>Gas chromatographic profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04528-f001">Figure 1</xref>) represents the peaks and the retention time of each phytochemical compound contained in the ethanolic extract studied. Each compound has a dominant percentage. The extract is mainly composed of Chromium, pentacarbonyl (13.22%), 2-phenazine carbonitrile (10.64%), Terpinenol-4 (10.04%), and 4H-1-benzopyran-4-one,2,3-dihydro-5,7-dihydroxy-2phenyl(S) (8.76%) (
