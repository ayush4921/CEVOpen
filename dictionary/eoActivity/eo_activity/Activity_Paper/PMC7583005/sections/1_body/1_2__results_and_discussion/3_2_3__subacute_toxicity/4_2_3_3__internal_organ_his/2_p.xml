<p>The powder from leaves of 
 <italic>W. frutescens</italic> has been used in folk medicine for centuries and has proven to be harmless to health. In vivo toxicity studies of products provide knowledge about safe doses in humans [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04528" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The results obtained in this work were used for performing a comparison with the earlier data, which showed no toxic effect occurred in animals treated with 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> hydroalcoholic extract under subacute toxicity conditions [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04528" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The standardized extract of 
 <italic>W. frutescens</italic> attracts plenty of interest due to its use as an adjuvant in cancer treatment. The molecular purification of compounds contained in 
 <italic>W. frutescens</italic> extract revealed that this plant contains withanoloids as an effective agent vs. cancer. Withaferin as a compound revealed in 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> extract showed to be a promising anticancer agent [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04528" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04528" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The present findings were in confirmation with the earlier literature which reported that no toxic symptoms happened in humans ingested 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04528" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Subacute toxicity results suggest that the oral administration of 
 <italic>W. frutescens</italic> extracted up to 2000 mg/kg/day does not cause any adverse effects in the animals.
