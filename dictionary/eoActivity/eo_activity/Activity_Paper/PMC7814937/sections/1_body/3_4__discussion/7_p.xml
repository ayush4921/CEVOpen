<p>In 2005, Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported that NB4 cells treated with diosgenin resulted in the enlargement of cell size, and arrest was made at G
 <sub>2</sub>/M. Diosgenin increased the p53 levels in NB4 cells, indicating its importance in controlling cell cycle arrest. Flow cytometric sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> analysis showed that a dramatic hypodiploid number of K562 cells appeared after treatment with diosgenin for 48 h along with DNA fragmentation. Another research carried out by Hsu et al. [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] presented that treatment of squamous cell carcinoma-25 (SCC-25) with red mold 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> cell cycle for 24 h caused arrest at the G2/M phase. This effect was also connected to the repression of CDK1 and cyclin B1 mRNA levels, ensuring cell proliferation inhibition.
