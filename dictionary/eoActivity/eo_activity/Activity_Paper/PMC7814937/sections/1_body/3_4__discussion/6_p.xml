<p>The result of the present study was similar with Srinivasan et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] where diosgenin led to cell growth in the G
 <sub>1</sub> phase, consisting of 72% of cells in G
 <sub>1</sub> at 24 h and 82% and 76% at 48 h and 72 h posttreatment, respectively, compared to untreated cells. Similar observation was found in diosgenin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells where there was aggregation of cells in the G
 <sub>1</sub> process occurred (82% at 24 h, 81% at 48 h, and 71% at 72 h). In addition, Moalic et al. [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] found that cells treated with diosgenin suppressed 1547 cell proliferation rate after 12 h along with a significant accumulation of cells in the G
 <sub>1</sub> phase which was increased at 24 h. Consequently, the fraction of S phase cells decreased at 12 h. A sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> population, typically associated with apoptotic cells, appeared at 48 h when compared to controls. According to a similar study conducted by Wang and Weller [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of protodioscin (bioactive component in 
 <italic>D. collettii</italic>) for up to 24 h, accumulated mainly in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner with consequent increase in the sub-G
 <sub>1</sub> phase of cell cycle. Moreover, diosgenin isolated from 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> was reported to induce S-phase arrest at a concentration of 13 
 <italic>µ</italic>M in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. At 24 h of incubation phase, S arrest was relatively substantial, but at 48 h of incubation, there was no such effect, and arrest was not found to be important in MCF-7 compared to DU-145 [
