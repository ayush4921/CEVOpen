<p>A study performed by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] showed that diosgenin treatment in focus subordinate caused increment of G
 <sub>2</sub>/M stage cell population in Bel-7721, SMMC7721, and HepG2 HCC cells, suggesting that diosgenin could arrest the cell cycle in the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M stage because of the way that extent of G
 <sub>2</sub>/M stage cells with expanded in centralization of diosgenin. Lee and his colleagues [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] presented the antiproliferative impacts of diosgenin from yam (
 <italic>D. pseudojaponica</italic>) on malignant growth (MCF-7, A 549, and Hep G2) and typical (HS68 and clone 9) cells. The outcome demonstrated that diosgenin from 
 <italic>D. pseudojaponica</italic> hindered MCF-7 cells multiplication through G
 <sub>0</sub>/G
