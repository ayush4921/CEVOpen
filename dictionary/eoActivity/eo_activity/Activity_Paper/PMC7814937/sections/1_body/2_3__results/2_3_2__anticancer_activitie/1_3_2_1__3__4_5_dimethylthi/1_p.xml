<p>Cytotoxic activity of the plant extracts against the breast cancer cells lines was assessed using MTT assay. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of extracts on the viability of cancer cells after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of incubation were evaluated. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined which lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values signifying a higher antiproliferative activity. All the three extracts tested have demonstrated significant and effective antiproliferative activities in both dosage and time-dependent manner.
