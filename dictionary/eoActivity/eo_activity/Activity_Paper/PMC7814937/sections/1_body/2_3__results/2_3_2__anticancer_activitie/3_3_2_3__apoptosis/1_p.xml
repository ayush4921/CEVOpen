<p>Cell lines were treated, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were obtained. The cells were stained with both FITC-conjugated annexin V and Pl. FACS was utilised to acquire the stained cell populace. Histograms from FACS investigation at each concentrate fixation are shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) shows the proportion of annexin-V-FITC and PI-stained cells at the different time of treatment, at an early stage of apoptosis, apoptotic, and late apoptotic cells. Plant extracts for the treatment were examined for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h in cell lines.
