<p>Methanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane solvents were used for the extraction of plant samples by successive maceration methods as described by Bhunu et al. [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] with some modifications. The mixture was filtered using a vacuum filter and then evaporated using a rotary evaporator where the yield of extracts was found; hexane (6.22%), ethyl acetate (8.63%), and methanol (20.6%) were used. The extract was later used to identify its phytochemicals, antioxidant, and antiproliferative effects.
