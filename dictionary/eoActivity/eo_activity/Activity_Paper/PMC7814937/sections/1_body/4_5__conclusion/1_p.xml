<p>In conclusion, the effort presented herein has proved that 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> methanol extract had resilient antiproliferative activity when compared with a standard drug. The antioxidant activities shown by methanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane extracts of the plant were significant compared with ascorbic acid, indicating the potential of the leaves of this species as natural antioxidants. Hence, antiproliferative activities demonstrated by leaf extracts authenticate the old style uses of this plant against various diseases of breast cancer inclusive.
