Introduction</title><p>Respiratory diseases, with asthma being the most important, are classified among the major categories of non-communicable diseases and their prevalence accounted for more than 1 billion patients worldwide in 2018 [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting from the malfunction of the interaction between the airways and the immune cells [<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Inflammation is considered to be a physiological defense mechanism which helps the body to protect itself from microbial infections, burn, toxic chemicals, allergens, or other harmful stimuli. Depending on the number or the degree of events and mediators linked to that reaction, inflammatory reaction can trigger, maintain, or aggravate many diseases [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sometimes the delicate balance between immune-mediated clearance and noxious stimuli is troubled and this correlates with inadvertent self-harm from chronic inflammation. As a result, the immune system inappropriately leads to inflammation against its own cells, resulting in different chronic inflammatory diseases including respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, the complicated form of SARS Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) viral pneumonia outbreak was reported to be associated with a plethora of cytokines wreaking havoc throughout the body often vividly referred to as &#x0201c;cytokine storm&#x0201d;, which triggers a violent inflammatory immune response that contributes to respiratory problems, multiple organ failure, and finally death in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several studies have reported the role of different inflammatory cells and mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma where the volume and nature of involved inflammatory mediators determine the severity and exacerbations of the disease. Depending on those inflammatory patterns, there are two main subtypes of asthma, the eosinophilic (diagnosed by the expression of Th2-derived cytokines) and the neutrophilic (diagnosed by the expression of Th17-derived cytokines and chemokines) [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The latter asthma subset is characterized by a high proportion of neutrophils recruited by inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;). It is well known that inflammasomes, multiprotein cytoplasmic complexes activating inflammatory responses, are involved in the upregulation of these cytokines, particularly the IL-1&#x003b2; through the activation of caspase-1 [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among these inflammasomes, NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is the most widely studied and its properties and functions are the best characterized [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, in response to a microbial infection or injury, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated and involved in the host protection by inducing immune responses to clear injury or microbial invasion [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome requires two distinct signals. The first is a pro-inflammatory priming step, mediated by toll-like receptors (TLR), that induces the upregulation of the NF-&#x003ba;B transcription factor and promotes the expression of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and the NLRP3 inflammasome component. The second signal is an activation step that induces the assembly of the NLRP3/ Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC)/pro-caspase-1 complex, ending up in the proximity auto-cleavage and maturation of caspase-1 which, in turn, induces a caspase-1-mediated maturation of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and release of active IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Several pieces of evidence from research suggest that inflammasomes and/or their components and effectors are associated with the physio-pathogenesis of asthma and other respiratory diseases including COPD, SARS CoV-2, etc. [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In fact, it has been reported that the excessive release of active IL-1&#x003b2; and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) specks leads to the induction of neutrophil-dominated inflammatory responses in the airways that contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD and neutrophilic asthma [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The neutrophilic asthma is the most severe and has been reported to be refractory to the corticoid-based treatment [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite this resistance, the use of corticosteroids remains the basic treatment for several respiratory diseases involving cytokine storms. A recent clinical trial report revealed that the treatment with Dexamethasone significantly alleviated COVID-19 disease severity of hospitalized patients who were under invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Regarding the neutrophilic asthma, drugs that alleviate disease severity include specific monoclonal antibodies against key mediators of the inflammatory pathway [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but the associated treatment cost is not affordable for low and middle income countries (LMICs). Hence, urgent efforts are needed to identify new, effective, affordable, and safe anti-inflammatory drugs. A reliable therapeutic source which remains poorly explored is the traditional pharmacopeia. Previously, our investigations on the anti-asthmatic activities of herbal recipes from Rwandese traditional healers revealed a candidate recipe with significant inhibitory properties on the activation of caspase-1 using Caspase-Glo 1 Inflammasome assays [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. <italic>Hibiscus noldeae</italic>, from the <italic>Hibiscus</italic> genus in the <italic>Malvaceae</italic> family, was one of the plants composing the recipe. Plants from the same <italic>Hibiscus</italic> genus, including <italic>H. acetosella</italic>, <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic>, and <italic>H. vitifolius</italic> have been reported to have anti-inflammatory potentials and some of the responsible molecules, such as gossypin, caffeoylhydroxycitric acid, delphinidin-3-sambubioside, and neochlorogenic acid have been isolated [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In contrast, no such studies has been reported on <italic>H. noldeae</italic>, although used by traditional healers in the treatment of asthma, urogenital infections, postpartum abdominal pain, swelling of the legs, cleaning of babies, facilitation of delivery, sprains, headache, wounds, women infertility, abortion prevention, etc. [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we report on the bio-guided fractionation of <italic>H. noldeae</italic> and assessment of the inhibitory properties of some fractions and purified compounds on NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-6. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was determined by detecting the activity of caspase-1 and the production of IL-1&#x003b2; in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and ATP-stimulated THP-1 macrophages, while the production of IL-6 was studied in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, a well-known standard method. It was observed that hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the aerial parts of <italic>H. noldeae</italic>, as well as caffeic acid, isoquercetin, and ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions revealed the highest inhibitory effects on Caspase-1 activities, and on IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 production. The ER2.4 and ER2.7, our fractions of most interest, downregulated the production of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6, in a similar range as the caspase-1 inhibitor AC-YVAD-CHO and the drug Dexamethasone all used as controls, respectively. Overall, our findings pave the way for the first time on the scientific based evidence on <italic>Hibiscus noldeae</italic> activities underlying its potential role in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and asthma in Rwanda.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-25-04693"><title>2. Results</title><p><italic>Hibiscus noldeae</italic> (<italic>H. noldeae</italic>) has been studied by virtue of its attribute as one of the medicinal plants used by the traditional healers in Rwanda to manufacture their remedies. In the context of asthma treatment, the recipe, containing 7 different plants, that revealed the best anti-inflammatory activity [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] comprised <italic>H. noldeae</italic> in major proportion (35%). We therefore hypothesized that this medicinal plant may harbor the therapeutic constituents.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-molecules-25-04693"><title>2.1. Hexane and Ethyl Acetate Fractions Revealed Similar HPLC Profiles for the Constituents of the Crude Extract of the Aerial Parts of H. noldeae</title><p>A bio-guided fractionation approach was employed and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f001">Figure 1</xref>, a complex chemical profile for hexane and ethylacetate fractions was observed in the High performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detection (HPLC-DAD) analysis, indicating the presence of different major substances of different polarities. Many peaks eluted between 20 and 40 min, a fact that demonstrates the presence of medium polarity molecules, most of which are major compounds. The transposition of the analytical method to the preparative HPLC allowed for the isolation of five of the seven major compounds from ethylacetate and hexane fractions of <italic>H. noldeae</italic>. Three of the five isolated compounds were pure and were identified by chromatographic and/or spectroscopic comparison with data from literature. This led to the elucidation of one flavone glycoside, namely quercetin 3-<italic>O</italic>-glucopyranoside, along with two polyphenols, caffeic acid and caffeoyl-hydrocitric acid (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04693">Supplementary Table S1 and Figures S1&#x02013;S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-molecules-25-04693"><title>2.2. Hexane and Ethyl Acetate Extracted Constituents of Hibiscus noldeae Inhibit the Activation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome in THP-1 Macrophages</title><p>Prior to the investigation of anti-inflammatory properties of the compounds of interest, their effect on the cell viability on both THP-1 monocytes and derived macrophages was first determined. Cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 25, 50, and 100 &#x000b5;g/mL) for 24 h, and the cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA). Up to 25 &#x000b5;g/mL, all tested compounds did not exhibit cytotoxicity to both THP-1 and RAW264.7 cell lines (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04693">Figures S4 and S5</xref>). Our anti-inflammatory activities were therefore determined within this range.</p><p>To investigate whether the isolated compounds and fractions of interest possessed potential NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitory effects, their influence on the NLRP3 inflammasome activation, in LPS and ATP-stimulated THP-1-derived macrophages was assessed. The levels of caspase-1 activities in the culture media were determined using the Caspase-Glo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1 Inflammasome Assay (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f002">Figure 2</xref> below, it was observed as expected that LPS and ATP treatment significantly (*** <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) increased caspase-1 activities in the cell culture supernatant when compared with the untreated cells. However, when cells were pretreated with the isolated compounds and fractions of interest in graded concentrations ranging from 5 to 20 &#x000b5;g/mL, the caspase-1 activities were reduced by at least 34%. The tested compounds revealed their maximal inhibitory activities at 5 &#x000b5;g/mL, except for the ER2.4 fraction that showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the caspase-1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, the production of IL-1&#x003b2; was investigated using the human IL-1&#x003b2; (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) ELISA kit (Invitrogen/Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA). As controls, two distinct reference inhibitors, namely Ac-YVAD-CHO (YVAD) which specifically acts on caspase 1 and Dexamethasone (Dex) which downregulates the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway were used. As results, it was observed as expected that LPS and ATP treatment significantly (*** <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) increased the production of IL-1&#x003b2; in the cell culture supernatant when compared with the untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). When cells were first treated with <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constituents or the controls, the production IL-1&#x003b2; was significantly inhibited. Reductions of more than 70% could be revealed in some cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Moreover, it was observed that, at equivalent dose of 20 &#x000b5;g/mL, ER2.7 fraction and Dexamethasone showed similar inhibitory effects, while at the same concentration other tested constituents of <italic>H. noldeae</italic> revealed inhibitory activities comparable to the caspase 1 reference inhibitor YVAD. Isoquercetin was observed to have the lowest inhibitory effect on IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>A).</p><p>It is well-known that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces the activation of caspase-1 that promotes the production of Gasdermin D. The N-terminal domain of Gasdermin D oligomerizes to form cytolytic pores and leads to the programmed cell death called &#x0201c;pyroptosis&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the effect of our compounds and fractions of interest on inflammasome activation-induced cell death by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture supernatants. As expected, the pretreatment of cells by our test compounds significantly inhibited ATP-induced pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04693">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p>NLRP3 inflammasome-associated IL-1&#x003b2; production is a two-step process: a priming signal that promotes Pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and NLRP3 synthesis and a secondary signal that induces the inflammasome assembly and the subsequent caspase-1 activation [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We investigated the effect of the crude extract and fractions of interest on the expression of Pro-IL-1&#x003b2; and Pro-Caspase-1 by Western blot (WB). We observed as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>B that cells pretreatment with ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions led to the reduced Pro-Caspase-1 amount marked by the faint WB-signals. This suggest that our fractions of interest inhibited the expression of this protein by impacting the first priming step of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation or induced its degradation by a mechanism to be clarified. Moreover, the Pro-IL-1&#x003b2; production appeared induced as marked by the width of the WB-signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Knowing the critical role of Caspase-1 in the inflammasome activation, these observations suggest that the reduced expression of the Pro-Caspase by both ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions may in fact be acting to inhibit the upregulation of Caspase-1, hence block the Pro-IL-1&#x003b2; cleavage. In addition, treatment with Dexamethasone, the crude extract and the EtoAc fraction revealed reduced Pro-IL-1&#x003b2; WB-signals. While the effect of Dexamethasone is associated with the inhibition of the NF-&#x003ba;B activities leading to the repression of Pro-IL-1B production, the effects of the crude extract and EtoAc fraction could results from the dilution of the ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions or likely their effects on NF-kB activities by their constituents to be identified.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-25-04693"><title>2.3. Hexane and Ethyl Acetate Fractions and Purified Compounds from H. noldeae Inhibit IL-6 Production</title><p>Interleukin 6 (IL-6) like IL-1&#x003b2; is a biomarker of inflammasome activation. Hence, the effect of the fractions and purified compounds from <italic>H. noldeae</italic> on the production of IL-6 in RAW264.7 macrophages supernatants by ELISA was investigated. Dexamethasone at concentration of 20 &#x000b5;g/mL was used as control. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with LPS alone resulted in a significant increase in this cytokine production as compared to the control group. As expected, a pre-treatment of cells with Dexamethasone reduced about 72% of the production of IL-6. Also, it was observed that the levels of IL-6 production were significantly (*** <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) decreased upon pre-treatment of cells with <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constitutuents. Moreover, while a saturation of inhibitory effects was already observed at either 5 or 10 &#x000b5;g/mL with the ER2.4 fraction or with the crude extract and the EtoAc fraction, a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6 production was revealed by the caffeic acid and ER2.7 fraction pre-treatment. At 20 &#x000b5;g/mL, the inhibitory effect of ER2.7 fraction was similar to that of Dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f004">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-molecules-25-04693"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>An important body of studies have proven the associations between neutrophilic asthma and increased IL-1&#x003b2; responses induced by the excessive NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This raises the possibility of targeting different inflammasome components as substantial therapeutic targets in neutrophil-dominated forms of severe, steroid-refractory asthma [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The analysis of inflammasome formation is mostly investigated through the monitoring of downstream processes and outcomes, the presence of cleaved caspase-1 enzyme being the most widely used method, as well as the caspase-1 activity on substrates such as pro-IL-1&#x003b2;, pro-IL-18, and pro-gasdermin-D [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In view of determining the inhibitory properties of the <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constituents of interest on NLRP3 inflammasome, their effect on either caspase-1 activation using the Caspase Glo 1 assays (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and/or IL-1&#x003b2; production as hallmarks of the NLRP3 inflammasome was evaluated. In fact, it is well known that the inflammasome activation induces a cascade of events including the recruitment of pro-caspase-1 and its cleavage into a corresponding active caspase-1 enzyme that also cleaves pro-IL-1&#x003b2; into its mature form, IL-1&#x003b2; [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>In our previous study, among the plant recipes evaluated, R19Sz was the most potent in inhibiting caspase-1 activity [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. <italic>Hibiscus noldeae</italic>, one of the plant&#x02019;s components of the recipe, has been cited by three different traditional healers during our investigation, indicating its possible importance in the treatment of asthma. In addition, few studies reported on the traditional use of the plant in the treatment of different ailments, some of which are of inflammatory background such as asthma, wounds, headache, etc. [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An important question was then to determine whether <italic>H. noldeae</italic>, would have inhibitory properties on inflammasome or on IL-6 production, a well-known downstream target of IL-1&#x003b2;. A bioguided fractionation approach to address this question was employed. Many of the isolated compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04693">Table S1</xref>) were polyphenols, secondary plant metabolites proven to exert various biological properties including anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic activities [<xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As far as inflammation is concerned, cell death could also lead to the activation of the inflammatory pathway in a manner similar to the inflammasome activation [<xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, plant crude extracts, fractions and purified compouds were first tested for eventual cytotoxicity allowing to select the range of working sample concentrations in such a way that their pharmacological effects could not be biased.</p><p>Within a plant extract, there can be hundreds of molecules, some of which are active individually or act synergistically against a given disease. In most of the cases, major compounds are responsible of the activity of the extract though it is not always the case [<xref rid="B35-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study, an important question was to determine whether the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome resulted from a single compound or from a combined effect of different compounds. We opted first to investigate the effect of cell pre-treatment with our various samples on the caspase-1 activities and observed an average reduction of about one-third which formed a plateau at the tested concentration ranges as shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Such reduction suggested the presence of an inhibitor of caspase-1 in the plant extract. Indeed, caffeic acid, purified from <italic>H. noldeae</italic> in this work, was reported to interact with and inhibits Caspase-1 and ASC activation [<xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The plateau could be explained by the fact that a saturated quantity of caffeic acid is already in the lowest sample concentration used (5 &#x000b5;g/mL).</p><p>The findings that our plant products of interest had inhibitory effects on the caspase-1 activities prompted us to assess the production of IL-1&#x003b2; in the supernatant from the different samples. Consistent with the inhibition of the caspase-1 activities all the tested crude extract, fractions and purified constituents of <italic>H. noldeae</italic> revealed significant inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). To ensure that <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constituents acted on the inflammasome activation pathway, we further investigated their effects on pyroptosis. In fact, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces the activation of caspase-1 that promotes the production of Gasdermin D and the latter is associated to the programmed cell death called &#x0201c;pyroptosis&#x0201d; [<xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast, compared to the production of IL-1&#x003b2;, the effect of Dexamethasone was less than that of ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04693">Figure S6</xref>). This may be explained by the fact that Dexamethasone is able to act at the transcriptional level or to selectively induce the degradation of IL-1&#x003b2; transcripts after their production [<xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, the additional effect of these both mechanisms justifies its enhanced inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; production in the supernatant. However, at the highest concentration tested (20 &#x000b5;g/mL) an unexplained ease of the inhibitory effect was observed with both fractions. Such unexpected reactions deserve further investigation during the characterization of ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions. </p><p>NLRP3 inflammasome-associated IL-1&#x003b2; production is a two-step process. Our findings on both pyroptosis assays (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04693">Figure S6</xref>) and IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) suggest that <italic>H. noldeae</italic> derived products interfere with the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, to block cell death (pyroptosis) and IL-1&#x003b2; production. However, the Western blot results showed that ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions repressed the expression of Pro-Caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Capsase-1 is a critical component of the inflammasome and the reduced expression of this enzyme by fractions from <italic>H. noldeae</italic> indicates that ER2.4 and ER2.7 may in fact be acting to inhibit signal 1 (priming step) of inflammasome activation by specifically blocking upregulation of Caspase-1. In our future research, the mode of action of the molecules contained in these fractions will be elucidated.</p><p>Several studies have reported in vivo anti-inflammatory properties of caffeic acid and isoquercetin as well as several corresponding derivatives [<xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In this study, as suggested by our results, several polyphenolic compounds detected in the plant extracts of <italic>H. noldeae</italic> likely contribute to the inhibitory property of the plant on the inflammasome expression. However, the activity of the plant remains inferior to the activity of purified caffeic acid as well as the concentrated fractions ER2.4 and ER 2.7. This suggests that the fractionation of the plant extracts led to the enhancement of their inflammasome inhibition potency. This is in accordance with previous studies that reported the beneficial effect of fractionation in concentrating polyphenolic compounds, leading to enhanced biological activities [<xref rid="B40-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We thus argue that the bioactive compounds in fraction ER2.4, ER2.7 together with the well-known caffeic acid and isoquercetin are the main compounds involved in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><p>In the present study, the effect of our plant samples on the production of IL-6 in RAW264.7, a murine cell line widely used for the in vitro production of IL-6, was also investigated. This cytokine is a known downstream target of IL-1&#x003b2; and is consistently increased in serum from patients with NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated conditions. In fact, IL-1&#x003b2; has been reported to be one of the most potent activators of IL-6 production, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that IL-6 could be a therapeutic target in the treatment of IL-1&#x003b2;-mediated inflammation [<xref rid="B42-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, abnormal expression of IL-6 has been associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of human diseases, including asthma, cancers and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthrosis, and recently with COVID-19 [<xref rid="B43-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In asthma, it has been reported that IL-6 is linked with mixed eosinophilic&#x02013;neutrophilic bronchitis during exacerbations of the disease and worse pulmonary function in humans [<xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Moreover, cytokine-targeting therapies are gaining an increasing popularity in the treatment of inflammatory diseases including asthma and other respiratory diseases. With the Covid-19 outbreak pandemic, it has been reported that dexamethasone and monoclonal antibody drugs targeting IL-6 (tocilizumab) reduced the mortality rate [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B45-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In the light of the above-mentioned role of IL-6 in different pathologies, we investigated the effect of the <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constituents of interest on its production in RAW264.7 cell line. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f004">Figure 4</xref>, results obtained indicate that fractions and partially purified ER2.4 and ER2.7 compounds from the plant exhibited similar trends as on IL-1&#x003b2; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). These findings allowed to argue that this medicinal plant is an important drug target for &#x02018;cytokine storm&#x02019;- related diseases such as the neutrophilic asthma and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-25-04693"><title>4.

Samples were eluted with a nonlinear gradient method with acetonitrile and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in ultra-pure water. The column temperature was maintained at 25 &#x000b0;C. Then 20 &#x003bc;L of each sample were injected into the HPLC-UV/DAD (Diode-Array Detection) system and the analysis, performed at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, was monitored at 210, 254, 288, and 350 nm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="molecules-25-04693-g001"/></fig><fig id="molecules-25-04693-f002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Crude extract (<bold>a</bold>) and Hexane (<bold>c</bold>) and ethylacetate (<bold>b</bold>) fractions as well as the caffeic acid (<bold>f</bold>) and semi-purified fractions, ER 2.4 (<bold>d</bold>) and ER 2.7 (<bold>e</bold>), thereof exhibited significant inhibition of caspase-1 in THP-1 derived macrophages.
