  <p>The following are available online. Table S1: The 1H-NMR chemical shifts for the 3 purified compounds from H. noldeae. Figure S1: 1H–NMR spectrum of Quercetin-3-O-glucoside (isoquercetin). Figure S2: 13C spectrum of Quercetin-3-O-glucoside (isoquercetin) (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz). Figure S3: 1H, 13C-HMBC of Quercetin-3-O-Glucoside (isoquercetin) (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz). Figure S4: Effect of different H. noldeae’s constituents on the THP-1 cell viability. Figure S5: Effect of different H. noldeae constituents on the RAW264.7 cell viability. Figure S6: Crude extract and the ethylacetate fraction as well as the caffeic acid and semi-purified fractions (ER 2.4 and ER 2.7), thereof exhibited significant inhibition of pyroptosis in THP-1 derived macrophages.</p>
