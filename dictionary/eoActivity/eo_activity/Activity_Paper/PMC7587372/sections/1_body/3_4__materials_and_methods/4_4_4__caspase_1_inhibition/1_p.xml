<p>The evaluation of caspase-1 activity was done using the Caspase Glo 1 inflammasome assay (Promega Co. Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, THP-1 cells were grown for 2 days in 24-well plates to a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in the presence of 10 nM PMA at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. PMA-supplemented medium was then discarded and macrophages were pretreated with fresh medium containing fractions at different concentrations for 1 h. Dexamethasone at a concentration of 20 µg/mL or 20 µM AC-YVAD-CHO treatments were used as controls. Cells were further incubated with LPS (Sigma, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) (at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL) for 3 h and then with 5 µM ATP (Invitrogen/Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for additional 1 h. The caspase-1 activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo 1 Inflammasome Assay (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 24-well plate containing treated cells was removed from the incubator and 50 µL of the supernatant in each well were transferred to the corresponding well of a new white 96-well plate. An aliquot of 50 µL of the Caspase-Glo 1 reagent was then added to each well and gently mixed on a plate shaker at 300 rpm for 30 s. The mixture was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature before measuring the luminescence on a Berthold Technologies luminometer.
