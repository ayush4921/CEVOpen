<p>For Western blot analysis, THP-1 cells (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were differentiated in a 12-well plate by 10 nM PMA for 2 days and then treated as stated above. Cells were washed with 600 µL of an ice-cold PBS, and directly lysed with a reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and then centrifuged at 11,000 rpm (round per minute) for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were kept at −70 °C until analysis. The protein quantitation in the supernatant was quantified by the Bradford assay. An equivalent amount (15 µg of protein) of each sample was separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electro-transferred onto Nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted by anti-ProIL-1b (Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) or anti-Pro caspase-1 (abcam) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were then stripped, reprobed with anti-β-Actin antibodies (Cell signaling Technology) and exposed again to detect the internal β-Actin standard. Immunoblots were visualized using a chemiluminescence Odyssey Imaging System (Odyssey
 <sup>®</sup> Fc, Bad Homburg, Germany). To scan and quantify the immunoblots, we used the Image Studio Lite Ver 5.2 software (Li-Cor Biotechnology-GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany).
