<p>An important body of studies have proven the associations between neutrophilic asthma and increased IL-1β responses induced by the excessive NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This raises the possibility of targeting different inflammasome components as substantial therapeutic targets in neutrophil-dominated forms of severe, steroid-refractory asthma [

The analysis of inflammasome formation is mostly investigated through the monitoring of downstream processes and outcomes, the presence of cleaved caspase-1 enzyme being the most widely used method, as well as the caspase-1 activity on substrates such as pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18, and pro-gasdermin-D [

 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constituents of interest on NLRP3 inflammasome, their effect on either caspase-1 activation using the Caspase Glo 1 assays (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and/or IL-1β production as hallmarks of the NLRP3 inflammasome was evaluated. In fact, it is well known that the inflammasome activation induces a cascade of events including the recruitment of pro-caspase-1 and its cleavage into a corresponding active caspase-1 enzyme that also cleaves pro-IL-1β into its mature form, IL-1β [
