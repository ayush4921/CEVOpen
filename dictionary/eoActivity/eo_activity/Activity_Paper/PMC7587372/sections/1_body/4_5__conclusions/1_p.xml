<p>Considering the importance of inflammasome components in the severity of respiratory diseases in general and in asthma in particular, our preliminary results at the molecular and functional levels suggest that 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> and/or its constituents may play a role in the management of asthma and other respiratory diseases if the ex vivo results obtained can be reproduced in vivo. Additional purification and characterization of ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions are of prime interest for our future study.
