<p>Interleukin 6 (IL-6) like IL-1β is a biomarker of inflammasome activation. Hence, the effect of the fractions and purified compounds from 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> on the production of IL-6 in RAW264.7 macrophages supernatants by ELISA was investigated. Dexamethasone at concentration of 20 µg/mL was used as control. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with LPS alone resulted in a significant increase in this cytokine production as compared to the control group. As expected, a pre-treatment of cells with Dexamethasone reduced about 72% of the production of IL-6. Also, it was observed that the levels of IL-6 production were significantly (*** 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) decreased upon pre-treatment of cells with 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constitutuents. Moreover, while a saturation of inhibitory effects was already observed at either 5 or 10 µg/mL with the ER2.4 fraction or with the crude extract and the EtoAc fraction, a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-6 production was revealed by the caffeic acid and ER2.7 fraction pre-treatment. At 20 µg/mL, the inhibitory effect of ER2.7 fraction was similar to that of Dexamethasone (
