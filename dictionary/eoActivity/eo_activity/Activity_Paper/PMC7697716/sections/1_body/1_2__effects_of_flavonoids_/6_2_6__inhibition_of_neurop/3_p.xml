<p>A fat rich diet with a combination of streptozotocin induces glucose intolerance in an animal model; this is then followed by beta cell toxins that are engineered to respond to beta cells. The combination results in sciatic nerve injury, oxidative stress and diabetic neuropathy. The proposed model was used to the effect of flavonoid rich fraction of 
 <italic>Helicteres isora</italic> fruits in diabetic neuropathy in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Thirty rats were divided into two groups, the control and the diabetic neuropathy group. The experiment was performed for three weeks where the diabetic neuropathy group was fed with high fat diet and control group was fed with the pellet diet. After the end of experimentation, the glucose intolerance test confirmed the insulin resistance. This was then followed by dose dependent injection of streptozotocin. Ten days later, the diabetic rats were again grouped into control and FRFHI feed rats. The oral dosage of the extract for further three weeks was continued and then the diabetic neuropathy was assessed by body weight, biochemical parameters and behavioral parameters such as cold, heat, locomotion, and walking test. The FRFHI feed rats restored their body weight, and had reduced blood glucose and cholesterol levels. The FRFHI fed rats also had improved paw and tail withdrawal to heat and cold sensation with improved walking and locomotor activity. The nitric oxide (NO) induced oxidative stress was also noted to be reduced by the extract [

The compound was introduced into the mice which induced peripheral neuropathy; the flavonoids rutin and quercetin reduced the production of ROS species by acting as an antioxidant agents and reduced the side effect induced by oxaliplatin [
