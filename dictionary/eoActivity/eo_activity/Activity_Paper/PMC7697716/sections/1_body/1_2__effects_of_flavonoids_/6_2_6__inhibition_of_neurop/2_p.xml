<p>Diabetes is associated with a number of complications that includes nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease [

Diabetic neuropathy is a complication that is most commonly faced by 50% diabetes patients, with development of burning sensation to complete loss of sensation of heat and cold in legs and feet, and the loss of peripheral nerve fibers [

The animals were divided largely into two groups of diabetic and non-diabetic. After the end of the experiment, the blood serum of used animals were assayed for cholesterol, insulin, etc., determination, while the sacrificed animals were studied for biochemical and molecular investigation immediately after removing the sciatic nerve. Dose dependent reduction in body weight of treated rats were observed at the end of week 8 with
