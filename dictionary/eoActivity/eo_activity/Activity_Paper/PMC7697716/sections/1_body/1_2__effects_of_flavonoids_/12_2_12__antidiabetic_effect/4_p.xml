 <italic>Warionia saharae</italic> is a flavonoid rich plant. Its extract was used on animal model to prove its antidiabetic properties. Treptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats were used as test subject and normal rats were used as control group. Oral administration of the extract was continued for 15 days and its histopathological examination of liver along with glucose tolerance test was performed. The state of the liver and pancreas was found to be improved with the test group rats and had the potential to act as an antioxidant as well as an efficient antidiabetic agent [

In order to overcome the absorption and bioavailability issues of flavonoids, novel strategies should be developed for their maximum absorption. In one such study, baicalin, which is hydrophilic and poorly absorbed glycosylated flavonoid, was loaded inside nano-structured lipid carriers [
