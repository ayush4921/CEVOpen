<p>Flavonoids are groups of various compounds found naturally in many plants, such as fruits and vegetables, along with plant products such as coffee, chocolate, and tea. It had been repeatedly reported that flavonoids possess a wide range of health benefits. For example, flavonoids are rich in antioxidants, providing our body with natural immune protections from daily environmental and endogenous toxins. Different classes of flavonoids are so far isolated with several significant biological activities such as anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-diabetic, antimalarial, neuroprotective, cardio-protective, anti-inflammatory. Thus, including different types of flavonoids in daily diet is highly recommended to stay healthy and to reduce the risk of serval life threatening diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cancer as well as lowering the risk of having stroke and heart attack. The therapeutic effects of flavonoids have been proved in majority of pre-clinical studies in murine models. Different approaches should be used in clinical trials so that the absorption and bioavailability of flavonoids are not compromised. Their production should be increased through expression of their biosynthetic pathway enzymes in other plants and species with rapid growth. The funding agencies should facilitate research on flavonoids due to their versatile role in health and wellness. Further, the conjugates of flavonoids with other important drugs may enhance the potency of those compounds. Decisively, more research work is needed to resolve more the structures opf more flavonoids and to investigate their therapeutic applications. Flavonoids structures will always inspire research for the design and synthesis of new effective drugs for different types of diseases.</p>
