<p>In the current study, the molecular docking study was performed in order to rationalise the obtained

 <bold>6a</bold> with the active site of DHFR were explored using MOE (Molecular Operating Environment) software 10.2008

The molecular docking protocol was verified by re-docking of the original ligand in the vicinity of the active site of DHFR indicating that the docking protocol used is suitable for the intended docking study. This is shown by the score energy of −11.68 kcal/mol, the small root mean standard deviation (RMSD) between the experimental co-crystallised inhibitor pose and the docked pose of 0.88 Å and the highly noticed superimposition between them (
