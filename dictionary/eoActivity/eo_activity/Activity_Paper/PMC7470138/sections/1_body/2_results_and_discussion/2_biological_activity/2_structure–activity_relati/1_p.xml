<p>By inspection of the previous data, it was clear that all derivatives having benzene sulphonamide moiety showed higher and remarkable antimicrobial activity than those having naphthalenyl one. Incorporation of 3-methyl-5-oxopyrazoline with hydrazinyl open chain at p-4 displayed noticeable and excellent antimicrobial activity especially against 
 <italic>S. pneumonia</italic>, 
 <italic>A.</italic>
 <italic>fumigates</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> in compound 
 <bold>3a</bold>. Fusion of the 3-methyl-5-oxopyrazoline with pyridazine moiety giving 6-amino-7-cyano-3-methyl-5
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrazolo[4,3-
 <italic>c</italic>]pyridazine improved the potency to the highest value in 
 <bold>6a</bold> against almost strains in comparison with references. However, 
 <bold>6b</bold> revealed approximately the same excellent potency of 
 <bold>3a</bold>. Replacement of pyridazine with triazine or triazole moieties caused drop in the antimicrobial activity in 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>9a</bold>, respectively.
