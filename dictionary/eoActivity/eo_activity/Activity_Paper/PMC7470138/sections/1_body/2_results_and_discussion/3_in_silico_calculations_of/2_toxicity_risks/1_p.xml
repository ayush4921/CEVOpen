 </xref>. The data given in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, displayed that all compounds are expected to be non-irritating and high risk of reproductive effects. Also, compounds 
 <bold>3b, 6b, 6d, 8b</bold> and 
 <bold>9b</bold> have shown the non-mutagenic and non-tumorigenic effects. The aqueous solubility of a compound significantly affects its absorption and distribution properties. It is well known that more than 80% of the drugs on the market have estimated solubility values greater than −4. From 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, it was noted that compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold>, 
 <bold>3b</bold>, 
 <bold>6b</bold>, 
 <bold>9a</bold> and 
 <bold>9b</bold> exhibited solubility values above −4 and they are expected to have good aqueous solubility which significantly affects their absorption and distribution characteristics. Osiris programme was used for calculating the fragment-based drug-likeness of the synthesised compounds; a positive value indicates that the designed molecule contains fragments that are frequently present in commercial drugs. The results indicated that all target compounds have drug-likeness values except 
 <bold>6c</bold> and 
 <bold>6d</bold> in the comparable zone with that of the standard drugs. The drug score combines drug likeness, miLogP, solubility, molecular weight, and toxicity risks in one handy value that may be used to judge the compound’s overall potential to qualify for a drug
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>39</sup>
 </xref>. A value of 0.5 or more makes the compound a promising lead for future development of safe and efficient drugs. The overall drug score values for the synthesised compounds were calculated and compared to those of the standard drugs. Compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold>, 
 <bold>6b</bold> and 
 <bold>9a</bold> own good drug score values (
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
