<p>By analysing the obtained data, it can be concluded that there are linear correlations between the lipophilicity and the activity of the new derivatives and all of them are fully in agreement with the Lipinski’s rule. All the tested compounds have the number of rotatable bonds in the range of 1–3, with the values ranging from 2 into 3 allowed to the most bioactive compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold>, 
 <bold>3b</bold>, 
 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6b</bold>, 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>9a</bold> and therefore, obviously exhibiting small conformational flexibility. Results shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> indicated that all of the analysed compounds have Topological polar surface area (TPSA) values 
 <bold>˂</bold>140 Å
 <sup>2</sup> except for compounds 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6b</bold> have values 153.59 and 147.54, respectively, and therefore are candidate for good solubility, capacity for penetrating cell membranes and intestinal absorption. Compounds with n
 <sub>OHNH</sub> value (H-bond donors) less than 5 exhibited increased solubility in cellular membranes and all the test compounds have n
 <sub>OHNH</sub> value in the range of 0–4 which is less than 5. Compounds have n
 <sub>ON</sub> value (H-bond acceptors) in the range of 5–9 and molecular weight in the range of 249.28–398.47. Molecular volumes of the compounds in the series increased as increasing MW and ranged from 216.61 to 317.53. The partition coefficient is vital to examine the physico-chemical properties associated with biological activity. The milogP values for all compounds under investigation are less than 5, outlining good lipophilicity (as defined by the pH-partition hypothesis) with various possible biological sites reasonable oral absorption and lower permeation across biological membranes but higher aqueous solubility especially for compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold>, 
 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6b</bold>, 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>9a</bold> that are most bioactive compounds. Higher solubility is a good factor in drug formation and might generally be reduced in more highly hydrophobic compounds. The greater lipophilicity of these compounds may protect against ROS damage and is due in part to their smaller polar surface area which is another useful descriptor of the oral bioavailability and drug transport properties. As can be seen, compounds 
 <bold>3b</bold> and 
 <bold>6c</bold> that contains the nonpolar naphthyl substituent exhibited greater lipophilicity (milogP = 2.54 and 2.63, respectively) as compared to compound 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> (milogP = 0.07 and −0.04) with polar group (sulphonamide). Also, the same phenomena were observed in compounds 
 <bold>6d, 8b, 9b,</bold> that contains naphthyl substituent exhibited greater lipophilicity (milogP = 2.48, 3.94, 2.70, respectively) as compared to compounds 
 <bold>6b, 8a, 9a</bold> (milogP = −0.02, 1.27, 0.03) with polar group (sulphonamide). Our study revealed that compounds 
 <bold>6c, 6d, 8b</bold> and 
 <bold>9b</bold> (greater lipophilicity) are biologically either inactive or less active, but compounds 
 <bold>6a, 6b, 8a</bold> and 
 <bold>9a</bold> (least lipophilicity) are highly active against the tested bacteria and fungi, while compound 
 <bold>3a</bold> are highly active than 
 <bold>3b</bold>. Our results exhibited that there is a clear relationship between lipophilicity and antimicrobial activity. The most active compounds against all microbial strains were 
 <bold>3a</bold> (milogP = 0.07), 
 <bold>6a</bold> (milogP = −0.04), 
 <bold>6b</bold> (milogP = −0.02), 
 <bold>8a</bold> (milogP = 1.27) and 
 <bold>9a</bold> (milogP = 0.03). In the light of the above results, we achieved that all tested compounds satisfy the “Rule of five” and meet all criteria for good permeability and bioavailability.
