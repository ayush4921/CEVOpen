 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> as examples of Gram-positive bacteria, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as examples of Gram-negative bacteria and for their Antifungal activities against 
 <italic>Aspergillus fumigates</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, respectively. Solutions of concentrations (1 µg/mL) of the target compounds were used. The agar media were inoculated with different microorganism’s culture tested after 24 h of inoculation at 37 °C for bacteria and for antifungal tested after 72 h of inoculation at 28 °C. Ciprofloxacin and amphotericin B were used as standard antibacterial and antifungal drugs, respectively. The diameter of inhibition zone (mm) was measured for the biologically activity using the diffusion technique

 <bold>3b</bold>, 
 <bold>6a</bold>, 
 <bold>6b</bold>, 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>9a</bold> were further investigated to determine their antimicrobial activity expressed in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the modified agar well diffusion method that mentioned above. The different concentrations (triplicate) of each compound were tested and compared with standard drugs.
