<p>Dissolve either (2.81 g, 10 mmol) of 
 <bold>3a</bold> or (2.52 g, 10 mmol) of 
 <bold>3b</bold> in absolute ethanol (30 ml), and then add 0.5 ml of triethylamine. Each of the solutions was treated with phenylisothiocyanate (1.35 g, 10 mmol). The reaction mixtures were heated under reflux for 8 h then cooled. The so formed precipitate during heating in each case was collected by filtration and recrystallised from dioxane to give 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>8b</bold>, respectively.
