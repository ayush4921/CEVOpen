<p>In a preliminary screening experiment, we used the root extract of 
 <italic>P. scoparia</italic> to assess the potential antibacterial activity of its chloroform, methanol, and aqueous extracts against seven different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species related to burn wounds. The results showed the presence of active antibacterial compounds in the methanolic extract of the plant contrary to its aqueous and chloroformic extracts. Based on the MIC and MBC values, the methanolic extract of the plant was designated as a potential antibacterial agent.
