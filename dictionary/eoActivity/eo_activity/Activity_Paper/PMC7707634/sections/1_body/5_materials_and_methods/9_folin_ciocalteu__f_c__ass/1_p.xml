<p>Briefly, 500 µL of different concentrations of the plant extract fractions in water was mixed with 1.5 mL of prediluted Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, gallic acid, (40 μL, Merck, Germany). The mixture was then incubated at room temperature for five minutes. Sodium bicarbonate (1.2 mL, 7.5% w/v) was added, and the mixture was again incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. Then, the absorbance of the mixture was measured at 765 nm. For calibration, several concentrations of gallic acid (10-500 mg/L) were used, and the measurements were expressed in mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per g of the sample.</p>
