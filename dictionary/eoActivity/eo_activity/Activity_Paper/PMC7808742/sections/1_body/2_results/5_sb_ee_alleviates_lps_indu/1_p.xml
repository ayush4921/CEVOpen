<p>We further evaluated the anti-inflammatory activity of Sb-EE in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> peritonitis and gastritis mouse models. Peritonitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg/kg LPS after oral administration of Sb-EE for five days. To assess the inhibitory effect of Sb-EE against peritonitis, we performed an NO assay and immunoblotting analysis with macrophages obtained from the peritoneums of peritonitis-induced mice. The NO assay showed that Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) suppresses NO production in peritonitis mice (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> results. Next, we induced gastritis in mice by oral administration of HCl/EtOH for 1 h after orally injecting Sb-EE or ranitidine, a positive control, three times at 12 h intervals. We then observed haemorrhagic mucosal damage to determine the degree of gastric mucosal inflammation. Bleeding and redness of the gastric mucosa was reduced in both the ranitidine and Sb-EE-treated groups (
