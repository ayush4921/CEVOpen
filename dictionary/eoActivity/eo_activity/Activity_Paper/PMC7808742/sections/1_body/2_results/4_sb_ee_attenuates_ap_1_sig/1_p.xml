<p>Since Sb-EE suppressed AP-1 luc activity and nuclear translocation of the AP-1 subunit, we explored the effects of Sb-EE on AP-1 signalling regulators, such as ERK, JNK and p38 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2(C,D)</xref>). To identify the target of Sb-EE among the signalling molecules passing through the AP-1 pathway, we stimulated Sb-EE-pre-treated RAW264.7 cells with LPS for various times. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that phosphorylation of ERK is blocked by Sb-EE after 30 min of LPS simulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>). Sb-EE also inhibited phosphorylation of JNK and p38 five min after LPS treatment without changing the total levels of each enzyme (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>). Phosphorylated MEK1/2, an upstream regulator of ERK, was inhibited by Sb-EE at 15 and 30 min after LPS stimulation. In the case of MKK4/7, a JNK regulator, and MKK3/6, a p38 activator, phosphorylation was suppressed 5 min after the LPS trigger (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>, left and right panel). As TAK1 is an indispensable kinase that activates MKK4/7 and MKK3/6 in the TLR-AP-1 signal pathway (Kishimoto et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), we evaluated whether Sb-EE controls TAK1. Sb-EE blocked p-TAK1 levels at all indicated time points (5, 15, 30 and 60 min) in LPS-triggered RAW264.7 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>, left and right panel). We further assessed modulation of IRAK1/4, the most upstream regulators of the TLR4-dependent AP-1 pathway (Gan and Li 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Interestingly, LPS-induced degradation of IRAK1 was restored by Sb-EE at 3 min, which suggests that IRAK1 might be a target of Sb-EE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(C)</xref>). Our hypothesis was verified by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay. As we expected, Sb-EE decreased the kinase activity of IRAK1 by 68% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(D)</xref>). These results indicate that Sb-EE directly inhibits IRAK1, leading to an anti-inflammatory response.
