<p>RAW264.7 cells and HEK293 cells were treated with Sb-EE at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Then, 10 μL of MTT solution was added and incubated for 3 h and the reaction was stopped using stopping solution (15% SDS), as reported previously (Hong et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The samples were then incubated overnight. The absorbance of MTT formazan was measured at a wavelength of 540 nm.
