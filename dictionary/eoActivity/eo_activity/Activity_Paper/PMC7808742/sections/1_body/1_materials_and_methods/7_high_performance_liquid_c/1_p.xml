<p>To characterize the phytochemical characteristic of Sb-EE, HPLC analysis was performed as described previously (Almela et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol were utilized as standard compounds. Solvent A (0.1% H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> in H
 <sub>2</sub>O) and solvent B (acetonitrile) were used as elution solvents. For analysis, a system equipped with a KNAUER (Wellchrom) HPLC-pump K-1001, a Wellchrom high-speed scanning spectrophotometer K-2600, and a four-channel deaerator K-500 and a Phenomenex Gemini C18 ODS (5 μm) column was used.
