<p>Previous drugs have targeted a single protein or enzyme, thereby reducing off-target effects and minimizing side effects. However, given the increasing evidence that chronic and intractable diseases – including chronic inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer – are caused by multiple genetic or environmental factors, the development of multi-target medications is accelerating (Medina-Franco et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Kumar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). In particular, ingredients extracted from natural products are in the spotlight in the multi-drug development field due to their therapeutic efficacy and safety, which has been proven by their longstanding usage as herbal medicines (Hoffmann

 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Mevalotin, which is used for treatment of hyperlipidaemia, and tacrolimus, an immunosuppressive agent, are both medicines based on natural products (Calixto
