  <p>Suppressive activity of Sb-EE against NO production in RAW264.7 cells. (A) To examine the effect of Sb-EE on NO release, Sb-EE pre-treated-RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS (1 µg/mL) for 24 h, and NO levels in supernatant were assessed by NO assay. (B, C) To test the cytotoxicity of Sb-EE, RAW264.7 cells (B) and HEK 293T cells (C) were dose-dependently treated with Sb-EE for 24 h, and then MTT assay was performed. (D) Active phytochemical elements in Sb-EE were assessed by HPLC. The profiles of Sb-EE were compared with standard profiles containing quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol. All data are presented as the mean ± SD of experiments.
