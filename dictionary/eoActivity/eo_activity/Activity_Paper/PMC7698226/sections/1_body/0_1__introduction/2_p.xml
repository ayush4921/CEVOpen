 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01577" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These medicinal plants naturally possess bio-surfactant molecules, also called secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, glycosides, and phenols. These compounds have been extensively explored for their potency to synthesize silver nanoparticles. The use of environmentally benign materials like plant extracts, bacteria, and fungi for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles offers several benefits, such as eco-friendliness and compatibility for pharmaceutical and other biomedical applications, as they do not use toxic chemicals [
