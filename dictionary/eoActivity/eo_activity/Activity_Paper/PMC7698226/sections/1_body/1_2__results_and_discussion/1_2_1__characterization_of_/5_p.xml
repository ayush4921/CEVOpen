<p>DLS analysis showed that the synthesized PA-AgNPs were polydispersed with a particle size of 20 to 500 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01577-f005">Figure 5</xref>a). The size of the synthesized AgNPs was found to agree well between the TEM and DLS analysis. This result indicated that plant components were effectively involved in the synthesis and controlled formation of silver nanoparticles. Furthermore, surface zeta potential is one of the essential parameters for characterizing the stability of nanoparticles in water as a dispersant. It can be used for long-term stability prediction, wherein it measures the magnitude of electrostatic charge repulsion or attraction between the particles in a liquid suspension. The stability of the nanoparticles was shown at −17.1 mV (
