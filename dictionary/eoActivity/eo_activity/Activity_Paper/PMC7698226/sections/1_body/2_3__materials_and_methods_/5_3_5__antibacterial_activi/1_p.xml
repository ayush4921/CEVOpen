Various concentrations of (5–20 µg/mL) silver nanoparticles were poured into each well on all the plates after which they were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. After incubation, the clear zone appeared, and it was measured as a zone of inhibition. Standard antibiotic tetracycline was used as a positive control [
