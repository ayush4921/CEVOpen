<p>One of the most fundamental knowledge domains for human survival is ecological knowledge (cultural adaptations to ecological environments) because in pre-industrial societies this knowledge can make the difference between life and death [

 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Medicinal plants also support biocultural diversity, since at least 18,000 plant species are used for medicine- more species than any other type of ecological knowledge, including food and construction [
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, understanding the distribution and transmission of ecological knowledge has critical implications for conservation, health, and economy, and exploring fundamental theories about social learning. However, no studies have tested whether hypotheses derived from both homophily and prestige can predict the configuration and learning patterns of medicinal plant knowledge networks [
