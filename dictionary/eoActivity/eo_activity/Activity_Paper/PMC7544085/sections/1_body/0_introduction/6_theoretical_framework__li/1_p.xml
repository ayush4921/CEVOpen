<p>Here, we explore how homophily and prestige relate to social learning of ecological knowledge, and how these processes affect which nodes of a network are connected and specific patterns of network connections. By explaining the implications of these social learning processes, we develop hypotheses that are tested using structural signatures in a network of medicinal plant knowledge sharing. To test our hypotheses, we compare the frequency of relevant network statistics in our observed data with the distribution of statistics to random graphs of the same structure as the observed data, called ERGMs (exponential random graph models), which control for simultaneous effects of multiple social processes [

It is critical to recognize that ERGMs do not directly observe the exact mechanisms of social learning, such as the personal motivation for requesting medicinal knowledge from specific individuals. However, if prestige and homophily affect knowledge sharing, specific network configurations will be more common or rare than in a random network [
