<p>To our knowledge, this is the first application of ERGM to medicinal plant knowledge networks and first test of how isolated nodes, directed triangles, intermediate connectivity, or reciprocity affect ecological knowledge networks. We analyzed medicinal knowledge sharing to test whether prestige and homophily affect network structure and learning patterns. We find multiple pieces of evidence for all four hypotheses, and these patterns are consistent across all five types of medicinal knowledge (
