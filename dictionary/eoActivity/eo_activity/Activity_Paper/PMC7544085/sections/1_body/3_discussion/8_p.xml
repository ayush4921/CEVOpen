<p>We are confident that our results are valid within the study area because our sampling effort was high (&gt;90%; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0239345.s018">S1 Table</xref>) and rarefaction curves show &gt;99% coverage of medicinal plant species cited by study participants (

We are also confident that study participants learned most of their medicinal plant knowledge via social learning because 97% of participants reported learning about medicinal plants exclusively other people. Study participants never mentioned learning from mass media influences (e.g., books, TV, internet). In all villages, cell phone service is intermittent and phones owned by residents are unable to use the internet. Video players are common, but only play downloaded content (i.e., movies). Radios and books are uncommon and do not include information about local plants. Participants only mentioned two methods of learning about plants through direct experimentation- sensory information and dreams. In this region, it is not uncommon for people to dream about specific plants, then experiment with what illness to treat with the plant [
