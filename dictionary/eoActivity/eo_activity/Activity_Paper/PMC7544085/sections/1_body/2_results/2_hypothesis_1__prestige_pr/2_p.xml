<p>Consistent with H1c, estimates for isolated nodes are consistently positive, indicating that more people in the observed network are not socially learning medicinal plant knowledge than would be expected in a random network. These estimates are roughly the same across M1-7 (70–75% change of a node being isolated), which suggests that the likelihood a person not sharing or learning medicinal knowledge in these villages remains the same, regardless of edge and node effects. In contrast to H1d, estimates for OTP triangles are consistently negative, but not significant. Consistent with H1e, estimates for intermediate connectivity are consistently negative, indicating that medicinal plant knowledge sharing tends to be absent (leaving many nodes isolated or poorly connected) or redundant (with clustered edges that connect a few nodes). These estimates are similar across M1-7 (31–35% change of intermediate connections between nodes), which suggests that the likelihood of intermediate connective remains the same, regardless of edge and node effects.</p>
