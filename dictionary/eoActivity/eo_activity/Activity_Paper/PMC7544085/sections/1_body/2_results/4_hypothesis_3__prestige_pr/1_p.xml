<p>Both of the non-medicinal prestige variables are significant in all models (
 <xref rid="pone.0239345.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Estimates are similar across M2-7, which suggests that the likelihood of learning based on prestige remains the same, regardless of whether they know about medicinal plants. Consistent with H3a, gender-popularity estimates were consistently positive, indicating that people are more likely to learn about medicinal plants from men (59–63% chance). Consistent with H3b, age-popularity estimates were consistently positive, indicating that people are more likely to learn about medicinal plants from older people (51% chance). Consistent with H3c, knowledge-popularity estimates were consistently positive, indicating that people are more likely to learn about medicinal plants from more knowledgeable people (51–100% chance). These estimates are stronger in M3-5 (51–54% chance) than in M6-7 (100% chance), which suggests that “experts” in medicinal plants do not just know more than other people, they know uses and species that are not known by others in their social group. This result also supports the fundamental assumption that prestige is associated with skill or success [
