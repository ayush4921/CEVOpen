<p>Our study populations are four Indigenous forager-horticulturist villages in Solomon Islands. Solomon Islands is in the South Pacific, northeast of Australia (

Research villages were selected because most residents share the same kinship lineage, which means that they are blood descendants from a single ancestor. Residents of two villages (Kolofi and Binaoli) 1.5 kilometers apart are descended from families who left their homeland region ~200 years ago because of inter-family conflict, and primarily speak Baelelea language. Residents of the other of two villages (Irobulu and Lagoe) 1 kilometer apart are descended from the families who remained in their homeland region and primarily speak Baegu language. Residents in each pair of villages are aware of their relationships with residents in the other pair, but rarely visit each other because they are 26 kilometers apart. Five native languages are commonly spoken in north Malaita, as well as Solomon Islands Pijin, and most residents can understand several languages [
