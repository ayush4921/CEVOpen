<p>Reviewer #3:Â The authors show how prestige and homophilia are strong structurers of social learning patterns, for this they use networking tools to visualize the complexity of ethnobotanical systems using abstract models. In this way, the approach allows detecting interactions and components not observable with the naked eye, revealing highly relevant aspects in ethnobotanical theory. The work stands out for its logical coherence and supports each of its hypotheses and reflections with a theoretical framework of evolutionary ethnobiology and network theory, clearly reflected in the reference bibliography. The data is surveyed using current ethnobotanical methodological techniques, complies with the guidelines of the code of ethics and the analyzes have adequate statistical support.</p>
