<p>Authors consider that the flow of medicinal plant information through social networks in these communities have the same behavior that the flow of ecological knowledge information. I suspect that they are very different to make inferences about to improve biocultural conservation. Significant differences in governance processes of natural resources can be expected among networks experiencing structural differences in terms of density of relations, degree of cohesiveness, subgroup interconnectivity, and degree of network centralization, but there are different rules in indigenous communities that shapes communal decisions, that are very different to individual decisions. Please, clarify this topic.</p>
