<p id="Par22">The purpose of our study was elaborately explained to each informant and verbal consent was taken to avoid any misunderstanding. We have also taken permission from the local authority to conduct the survey. As our study only dealt with the medicinal plants with no intention to conduct any trials on human, formal institutional consent for this study is not required. In addition, Bangladesh Medical Research Council Ethical Guidelines for Conducting Research Studies Involving Human Subjects deemed ethics approval unnecessary for this kind of study on page 39, section 10.5.2.</p>
