<p id="Par54">The plant 
 <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic> was selected for further study as this has been used most commonly to treat diarrhea in the tribal areas. The stem part of the plant was collected and processed into powder and examined to assay its antibacterial activity against several diarrhea-causing bacteria. From the trials, the highest inhibition zone was seen by ethanolic extract against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which was 21 mm. In contrast, another research work with medicinal plants showed that the chloroform extract of 
 <italic>P. sagitatta</italic> plant showed an inhibition zone of 16 mm against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Comparing the two, the 21 mm inhibition zone from the ethanolic extract seems very significant. However, no zone was observed against 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> both in methanolic and ethanolic extract. Additionally, the aqueous extract showed results only against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Although the activity for commercial antibiotics is much higher than herbal plants, the use of medicinal plants should be encouraged as the overuse of antibiotics will eventually lead to the development of superbugs which will hinder proper treatment. As the extract of our medicinal plant was not purified and yet we found a comparable value (21 mm in ethanolic extract and 27 mm in commercial antibiotic against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>), we believe purification of the plant extract will increase its activity significantly.
