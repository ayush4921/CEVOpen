<p id="Par74">The MBC/MIC ratio was determined for 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> extract to determine whether the extract was bactericidal or bacteriostatic at the tested concentrations. The MBC/MIC ratio greater than 4 is usually considered to be a bacteriostatic effect; whereas values less than 4 show bactericidal effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Accordingly, 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> extract was shown to have bactericidal effects against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC27853, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolate, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> isolate, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolate and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> isolate; but bacteriostatic activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, MRSA ATCC® 43300TM, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC27853, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> ATCC700603, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolate and 
 <italic>S. algae</italic> isolate. Generally, the activity is considered to be high when MIC is less than10 μg/mL, moderate when MIC is between 10 and100 μg/mL and low when MIC is greater than 100 μg/m [
