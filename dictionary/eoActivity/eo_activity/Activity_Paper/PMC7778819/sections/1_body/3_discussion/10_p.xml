<p id="Par71">In this study, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> leaves showed high antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> at 400â€‰mg/mL, and low activity against the other strains at tested concentrations. Next to 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC was found to be more susceptible than the clinical isolate. Except for the 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> strain, this finding agrees with the report of Taye et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], in which gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than gram-negatives to the plant extracts, perhaps due to the nature of their cell walls. Gram-negatives have phospholipid membranes carrying structural lipopolysaccharide components that makes their cell wall impermeable to some antimicrobial substances [
