<p id="Par59">The methanol extracts of the three plant leaf extracts showed different levels of MIC against all tested bacteria. There was no inhibition of growth of bacteria in the negative controls (medium and bacterial suspension, and media DMSO and bacteria). The colorimetric broth microdilution assay showed that the methanol extract of 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> inhibited the growth of eleven tested microorganisms within the concentration ranges of 1.5 ± 1.4 to 12.5 ± 0.0 mg/mL. Whereas, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranged from 12.00 ± 0.0 to 83.3 ± 28.9 among the strains.
