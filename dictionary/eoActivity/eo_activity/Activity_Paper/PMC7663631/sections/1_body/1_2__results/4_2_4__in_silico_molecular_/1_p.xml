<p>In silico docking analysis was conducted using molecular operating environment (MOE) to elucidate the binding profiles of phytochemicals identified in extract, with pancreatic lipase. The results were compared with that of orlistat (FDA approved standard drug for lipase inhibition). All compounds revealed good interaction with the amino acid residues present in active pocket of pancreatic lipase. Most of the compounds exhibited lower binding energy than orlistat which illustrated that they may inhibit pancreatic lipase activity to considerable extent. The binding affinities of all possible phytochemicals in extract and their interactions with amino acid residue of 1LPB are presented in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04935-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The bonding energies ranged from −8.6208 to −16.2939 kcal/mol. Isomangiferin and myricetin showed considerable binding energies, i.e., −16.2939 and −15.1097 kcal/mol, respectively.
