<p>Modification in lipid metabolism occurred in mice treated with plant extracts which was reflected in improved lipid profile. The currently observed lowering of TC was most probably due to phytochemicals present in extract. The phyto-constituents being an important entity of plants, executed their ability to increase lipid metabolism in liver to reduce body weight [

 <italic>T. officinale</italic> indicated that most compounds were flavonoids in nature. Flavonoids are well known for their hypolipidemic impacts in living system. Flavonoids were reported to reduce TC and LDL levels by activating Î²-adrenergic receptors to burn fats and also inhibit adipogenesis by inducing apoptosis in preadipocytes of mice [
