<p>The antioxidant activity of plants is a prior indication of their possible medicinal potential. Antioxidants defend the body against disorders including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, cancer, atherosclerosis and obesity. A low dietary intake of antioxidants is problematic, creating oxidative stress-oriented health disorders. A workable approach to this problem is the development of foods enriched with effective antioxidants from safe source like plants. The food fortification with natural and safe antioxidants can display an essential role in scavenging the ROS to mitigate oxidative stress and related complications [

 <italic>T. officinale</italic> leaves. The leaf extracts of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> having high phenolic and flavonoid contents exhibited stronger DPPH scavenging which showed that polyphenols were the major contributing factor towards antioxidant properties. Again, the role of solvent system was of imperious nature to extract high polyphenols from leaves of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> and this impact was reflected in antioxidant potential of leaf extracts. However, it was observed that the antioxidant activity of plant extracts followed dose-dependent behavior. High extract amounts may have greater antioxidant potential probably due to high concentration of active ingredients. A recent study on 
 <italic>Conocarpus lancifolius</italic> confirmed that 60% ethanol was the most appropriate solvent system to get maximum amounts of phenolics and flavonoids for maximum antioxidant output and antidiabetic properties [
