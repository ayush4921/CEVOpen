<p>The results of DPPH scavenging and pancreatic lipase inhibition are given in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04935-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results indicated that 60% ethanolic extract exhibited lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for DPPH scavenging which differed slightly from IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for 80% ethanolic extract. However, this difference of activity was statistically significant (
