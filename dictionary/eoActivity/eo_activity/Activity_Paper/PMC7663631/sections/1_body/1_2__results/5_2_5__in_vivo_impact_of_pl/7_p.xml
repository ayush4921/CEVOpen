<p>The HFD fed mice showed significantly higher AST and ALT levels than ND fed mice. Comparatively, higher levels of AST and ALT of HFD mice were most probably due to obesity generated metabolic abnormality in liver of obese mice [

The gene expression analysis was reported to play an important role to improve the blood biochemistry including lipid profile in adipogenesis. A study indicated that mRNA expression levels of PPAR-γ and C/EBPα were significantly downregulated which may be responsible for reduction in AST and ALT blood concentration [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The variation in AST and ALT concentrations were also of enormous consideration in living system suffering from obesity. The AST and ALT were reported to be transferred to plasma due to obesity operated oxidative damage to tissues [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-04935" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Another study reported that AST and ALT were toxicity indicators and phytochemicals present in various plants reduced their plasma concentrations by improving liver and kidney functions [

The antioxidant role of phytochemicals is of pivotal nature which not only reduced obesity by improvising multiple site oriented metabolic processes, but also normalized the organ’s function. The phytochemicals especially polyphenols are well reported to improve the antioxidant defense line of body to mitigate obesity and related inflammations [

 <italic>T. officinale</italic> leaf was reported to have antiobesity and hypolipidemic activities. Metabolite profiling of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> extract revealed the presence of many kaempferol derivatives. Kaempferol and its derivatives are well known biologically functional molecules of plants. Kaempferol glycosides purified from Jindai soybean were reported to exhibit antiobesity properties by downregulation of PPAR-γ and SREBP-1c in high fat diet fed mice. Similarly, daphnetin was also reported to reduce lipid accumulation by upregulating the PI3K expression. Daphnetin was also responsible for lowering of reactive oxygen species in hepatocytes. The phytochemicals identified in 60% ethanolic extract probably exerted their synergistic impact to exert the antiobesity attributes of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> [
