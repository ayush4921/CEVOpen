<p>This study confirms the hypolipidemic attributes of 60% 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> extract, which not only improved the lipid profile, but also lowered the AST and ALT concentration of obese mice. Sixty percent ethanol was the most appropriate choice to increase extract yields to a significant level. Sixty percent ethanolic extract also exhibited comparatively higher phenolic and flavonoid contents. The DPPH-radical-scavenging and pancreatic lipase inhibition was also determined in terms of IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. Sixty percent ethanolic extract posed lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value which reflected highest antioxidant property and pancreatic lipase inhibitory potential. The UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS-based metabolite profiling confirmed the presence of numerous compounds of pharmacological significance belonging to diverse classes of phytochemicals. Molecular docking tool also confirmed the pancreatic lipase inhibitory action of identified secondary metabolites. The majority compounds showed stronger bindings with lipase enzyme than standard compound orlistat in terms of binding energies. The in vivo trials revealed that there was substantial improvement in lipid profile and blood biochemistry of obese mice treated with 300 mg/kg body weight dose of 60% 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> leaf extract. The plant extract also imparted its impact on body organ weights. The 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> can be employed as a potential candidate for the naturopathic approach to manage obesity and functional food development with enormous biological properties. The currently presented information may be extended regarding isolation of phytochemicals for their individual antiobesity properties.
