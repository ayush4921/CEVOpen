<p>The effect of pyrazolo[4,3-
 <italic>e</italic>]tetrazolo[1,5-
 <italic>b</italic>][1,2,4]triazine derivative on the viability of colon adenocarcinoma cell lines DLD-1 and HT-29 was assessed with MTT assay. The study showed that the tested compound has a much higher cytotoxic potency than the reference drugs in both cell lines. In DLD-1 and HT-29 cells, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 3.1 µM for 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>, while for RSC and 5-FU, it was above 10 µM (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(a,b)</xref>). To confirm the antiproliferative effects of the new synthesised compound, its effect on DNA biosynthesis in DLD-1 and HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma cells was investigated. The estimation was made by measuring the incorporation of radioactive labelled thymidine into the DNA of the cancer cells after 24-h incubation with various concentrations of the tested and reference compounds (1 µM, 3 µM, and 10 µM). The results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(c,d)</xref>. 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> was able to inhibit the growth of human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines in a concentration dependent manner. The concentration of 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> needed to inhibit the incorporation of [
 <sup>3</sup>H]thymidine into DNA in DLD-1 cells by 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was 1.6 µM, whilst in HT-29 was 2.3 µM. This effect was stronger than that of RSC and 5-FU in both cell lines.
