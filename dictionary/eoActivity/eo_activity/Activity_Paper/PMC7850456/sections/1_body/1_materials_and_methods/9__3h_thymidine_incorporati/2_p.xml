<p>DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were cultured in six-well plates and treated with various concentrations (1 µM, 3 µM, and 10 µM) of the tested compound and reference drugs, RSC and 5-FU, for 24 h. Following the incubation, the cells were treated with 0.5 µCi of radioactive [
 <sup>3</sup>H]thymidine (specific activity 6.7 Ci/mmol) for 4 h in optimal growth condition. Afterward, the medium was removed and cells were washed two times with 1 mL of 0.05 M Tris–HCl buffer containing 0.11 M NaCl. In the next step, the cells were washed twice with 1 mL of 5% TCA acid and then dissolved in 1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH containing 1% SDS. Following 5 min of incubation, the obtained cell lysates were transferred to scintillation vials previously filled with 2 mL scintillation fluid. The radioactivity was quantified on Scintillation Counter (Packard Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Counter 1900 TR, Perkin Elmer, Inc., Waltham, MA). [
 <sup>3</sup>H]thymidine uptake was expressed as dpm/well. The intensity of DNA biosynthesis in the control was taken as 100%. The values from the samples were obtained from three independent experiments done in duplicate (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6) and presented as a percentage of the control cells.
