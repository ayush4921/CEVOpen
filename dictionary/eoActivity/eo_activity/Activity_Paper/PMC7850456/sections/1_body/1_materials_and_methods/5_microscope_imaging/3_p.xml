<p>Cells were plated in 96‐well culture plates optimised for imaging applications at 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well. After treatment, the cells were fixed with a 3.7% formaldehyde solution at room temperature for 15 min and permeabilised with a 0.1% Triton X‐100 solution at room temperature for 10 min. Then, non‐specific binding was blocked (3% BSA). After that time, the cells were rinsed, incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies against phospho BTK (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, Cat# 44-1355G RRID:AB_2533598) for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the cells were rinsed and incubated with FITC conjugated secondary goat polyclonal antibody against mouse (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, Cat# F0257, RRID:AB_259378) for 60 min in the dark. After washing, the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/mL). Cells were analysed using confocal microscope BD Pathway 855 using a ×20 objective.
