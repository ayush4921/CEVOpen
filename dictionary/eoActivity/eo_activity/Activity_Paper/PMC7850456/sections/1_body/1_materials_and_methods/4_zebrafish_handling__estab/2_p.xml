<p>Colon cancer DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were transfected before transplantation. The zebrafish embryos (wild-type AB, Experimental Medicine Center, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland) were manually dechorionated 36 h post-fertilisation (hpf), and after another 12 h were anaesthetised by placing in 0.04 mg/mL ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate tricaine, which is a water soluble, fast-acting anaesthetic agent. Zebrafish embryos were then transfer to a thin film of low-melting-point agarose to stabilise the fish in a lateral position. Colon cancer cells were loaded into a borosilicate glass needle pulled by a P-1000 Next Generation Micropipette Puller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA). A suspension containing about 100–200 cells was injected into the inferior section of the yolk sac in a single injection by using an electronically regulated air-pressure microinjector (Narishige IM-300 Microinjector). After injection, the zebrafish were washed once with fish water and transferred to six-well plate containing 2 mL of fresh fish water. DLD-1 and HT-29-xenografts (72 hpf) were incubated at 33 °C with 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> (10 µM) and 5-FU (50 µM) and a combination of these drugs for 48 h. Zebrafish embryos develop successfully to hatching from 22 to 32 °C. The temperature experienced during early development has effects that persist into adulthood on energy metabolism pathways and acclimation capacity
