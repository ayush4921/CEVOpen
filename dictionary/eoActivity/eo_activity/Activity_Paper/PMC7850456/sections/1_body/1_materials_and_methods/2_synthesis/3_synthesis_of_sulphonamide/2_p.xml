 <italic>cis</italic>-4-hydroxy-
 <sc>l</sc>-proline methyl ester hydrochloride (296 mg, 1.75 mmol) was added. Then, sodium bicarbonate (147 mg, 1.75 mmol) was added to the resulting mixture. The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature, and then the reaction mixture was concentrated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> to afford the crude sulphonamide, as a yellow solid. The residue was purified on silica gel using a mixture of CH
