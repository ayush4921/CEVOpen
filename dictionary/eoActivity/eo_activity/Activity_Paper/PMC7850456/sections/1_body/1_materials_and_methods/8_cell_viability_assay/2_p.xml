<p>Cytotoxicity of newly synthesised derivative was estimated by MTT assay as we described in an earlier article

 </xref>. Briefly, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were seeded in six-well plates “Nunc” at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well and incubated for 24 h in optimal growth conditions. Subsequently, 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>, and reference drugs, RSC, 5-FU, at concentrations 1, 3, and 10 µM were added in duplicate and the plates were incubated for another 24 h. Next, the plates were washed with PBS three times. Then, 1 mL PBS and 50 µL of 5 mg/cm
 <sup>3</sup> MTT solution were added and the incubation was continued for 4 h. MTT tetrazolium is converted in viable cells into purple crystals of formazan. The conversion does not occur in dead cells. After the required time, the supernatant was removed and formazan crystals were dissolved in DMSO. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength 570 nm. The absorbance result obtained in the control was taken as 100% and the viability of the cells incubated with the tested compounds was showed as a percentage of the control cells. The values from the samples were obtained from three independent experiments done in duplicate (
