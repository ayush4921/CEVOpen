<p>Sulphonamide derivative (
 <bold>3</bold>) with a methylsulfonyl group (164 mg, 0.33 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol (5 mL), and sodium azide (21 mg, 0.33 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was refluxed until the substrate disappeared (control TLC). Then, the solvent was evaporated and the crude product was purified using column chromatography and CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>:MeOH (50:1) mixture as eluent to give the final compound as a yellow solid.
