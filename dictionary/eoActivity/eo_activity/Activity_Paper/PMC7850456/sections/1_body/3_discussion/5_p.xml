<p>An antiproliferative and antitumor activity of new triazine derivative was also confirmed in the zebrafish embryo model. Genetic similarities with humans cause that zebrafish are often used as a strong and cost-effective animal model for cancer research and the discovery of cancer drugs. The small size, transparency of zebrafish embryos, easy manipulation, short testing period, and small amount of tested drugs are undoubtedly important aspects giving zebrafish and advantage over the mouse/rat model of cancer. A preliminary screening test showed that 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> possesses the most biological activity; therefore, we decided to use it for further studies. This compound blocked cell division in a zebrafish embryo model at the four-cell stage of embryonic, development and these disorders were noticeable earlier than in the case of RSC or 5-FU. Two hours of incubation led to complete cell fusion and lysis in groups exposed to 
 <bold>MM-129</bold>. Cell division blockade and developmental arrest caused by this compound were irreversible.
