<p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anticancer potential of new pyrazolo[4,3-
 <italic>e</italic>]tetrazolo[1,5-
 <italic>b</italic>][1,2,4]triazine sulphonamide (
 <bold>MM-129</bold>), which has a similar chemical structure to RSC and may be found applicable in the treatment of patients with colorectal carcinoma. Undoubtedly, this kind of cancer is a significant problem, both from the medical and social point of view. For this purpose, preclinical studies were conducted on new 1,2,4-triazine derivative using cell lines and a zebrafish cancer model.
