<p>The anticancer action of 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> was investigated in a zebrafish embryo xenograft model. The xenograft experiment using DLD-1 and HT-29 human CRC cells grafted into the zebrafish yolk showed a significant antitumor effect of 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> with a 56% (DLD-1 xenografts) and 64% (HT-29 xenografts) reduction in the number of cancer cells compared with the control group. A basic element of colon cancer treatment is surgery, which is aimed at obtaining intestinal tissue free of cancer. Chemotherapy complements surgical intervention and is based mainly on 5-FU. For chemo, either the FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or CapeOx (capecitabine and oxaliplatin) regimens are used most often, but some patients may get 5-FU with leucovorin or capecitabine alone based on their age and health needs (NCCN Guidelines 2018). It should be emphasised that 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> turned out to be more potent in inhibiting tumour development compared with 5-FU in both DLD-1 and HT-29 xenografts. Furthermore, 
 <bold>MM-129</bold> clearly showed synergistic anticancer effects when used in combination with the latter.
