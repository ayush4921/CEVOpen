<p>Apple extracts display dose-dependent anti-cell proliferation activity in Caco-2 colon cancer and Hep G2 liver cancer cells and shows maximum inhibition of 43% and 57% at 50 mg/mL, respectively. It was also concluded that due to a higher amount of phytochemical nutrients in apple peel, peels alone have more efficiency in inhibiting Hep G2 cell proliferation than whole apple [

In studies, it has been found that polyphenols present in apples played a significant role in affecting signalling pathways that control growth, cell survival, and proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Phloretin has the efficiency to inhibit human hepatoma (Hep G2) and human colorectal cancer cells through inhibition of type 2 glucose transporter (GLUT2). This inhibition of intracellular glucose uptake was the main reason behind killing the cancer cell because these cancer cells depend on aerobic glycolysis for energy production. Also, in colorectal cancers, nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activate through lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that binds to the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Modification of polysaccharide components present in apple changed the LPS/TLR4/NF-kB pathway; consequently, supplementation of apple polysaccharide significantly inhibited the migratory ability in vitro on the LPS/ TLR4/NF-kB pathway in colorectal cancer cells (HT-29 and SW620 cells). Also, it has been reported that consumption of one apple in a day reduces the risk of colorectal cancer and consumption of more than one apple daily reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 50% [
