Studies have shown that the total phenolic, flavonoid content of apple peel polyphenol extract (PAP) is significantly higher than that of apple fleshes (PAF). Mice administered with 250 mg/kg of PAP and PAF for 28 days showed lower blood pressure, improved endothelial function, ameliorated lipid homeostasis, and decreased insulin resistance. Furthermore, they inhibit atherosclerosis, and PAP exhibited much more potent cardioprotective effects than PAF in mice [
