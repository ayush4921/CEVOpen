<p>Apple polyphenols include phenolic acids, dihydrochalcones, and flavonoids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01408-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Phenolic acids are mainly chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01408-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Caffeic acid is a derivative of cinnamic acid (Hydroxycinnamic acid). Chlorogenic acid exists in the form of coffee quinic acid in apples, and caffeic acid is produced after hydrolysis. Dihydrochalcones contain phloridzin, phloretin, and phloretin-2′-xyloglucoside. Flavonoids include mainly catechins, epicatechins, proanthocyanidins (B1, B2, B5, C1), quercetin, and quercitrin (

An American study on eight apple varieties grown in Ontario has revealed that the greatest amount of polyphenols is contained in the cultivars Red Delicious and Northern Spy, and the smallest amount is in the cultivar Empire. The higher concentration of polyphenols was in the peel, but the peel contains, in comparison with apple pulp, a higher concentration of substances from environmental pollution [

Esters hydroxycinnamic acids, phloretin glycosides, and flavan-3-ols were found both in the pulp and in the peel, while quercetin glycosides were almost exclusively contained in the peel. Cyanidin 3-galactoside was only present in the peel of red apple varieties. Other researchers such as Andre et al. (2012) have analyzed phenolic compounds in 109 apple varieties, and they have discovered that their total amount in the whole fruits ranged between 29 and 7882 mg/kg and in the peel between 733 and 4868 mg/kg of fresh weight. The main phenolic constituents were epicatechins and procyanidins and from triterpenes ursolic acid (44.7 up to 3522 µg/g) and linoleic acid (47.2 up to 838 µg/g) [

In many different ancient Tuscan apple varieties such as Nesta, Panaia-red, and Cipolla, phenolic content and antioxidant activity have been studied and found that the Panaia-red have the highest amount of phenolic content and possess good antioxidant activity as compared to the commercial golden delicious variety [

Also, the study on ancient apples from Siena revealed that the Solaio’ and ‘Campo Pianacce’ contain highest polyphenol contents (8.72 mg GAE/g FW and 2.25 mg GAE/g FW, good antioxidant potential, and suggest us to take as a functional food [
