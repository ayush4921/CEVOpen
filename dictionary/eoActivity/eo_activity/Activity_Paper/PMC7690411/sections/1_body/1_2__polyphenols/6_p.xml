<p>Apple polyphenols have a radiation protection effect by inhibiting radiation-mediated degradation of 2-deoxyribose (2-DR) in a dose-dependent manner. Apple polyphenols also reduce the damage caused by radiation through scavenging hydroxyl free radicals, which can inhibit single- and double-strand breaks induced by radiation in mouse thymocytes [

The apple polyphenols could reduce visceral fat, and the procyanidin oligomers in apple polyphenols can inhibit pancreatic lipase activity in the body, which lead to suppression of triglycerides. Apple polyphenols also help to inhibit glucose transport, decrease blood glucose levels and increase satiety. These findings indicate that apple indeed has a vital effect on losing weight [

Apple contains polyphenols, including anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, dihydrochalcones, flavonols, and flavan-3-ols. However, procyanidins were found at their maximum in apple (40–89%) [

Dihydrochalcones containing Phloretin (Phlor) and phloridzin (Phldz) possess anti-cancer, anti-obesity, anti-diabetic, antioxidant, anti-ageing, stress, hyperglycemia, anti-microbial, and melanogenic activity and have the efficiency to counteract liver, lung, and intestinal inflammation [

Ursolic acid (UA) (3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic-acid), is a pentacyclic triterpenoid carboxylic compound (C30H48O3) that possess a wide range of pharmacological activities. It shows anti-cancer, hypoglycemic, analgesic, gastroprotective, anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperlipidemic, hepatoprotectory, anti-ulcer, anti-HIV, anti-atherosclerotic anti-androgenic, cardiovascular, antibacterial, antioxidant, diuretic, and cyanogenic activity [
