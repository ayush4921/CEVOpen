<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> were collected from the Gondar and Gedo districts in October 2018. A taxonomist (Professor Sebsebe Demissew) authenticated the plant, and a voucher specimen (number AD002 and AD002) was deposited at the National Herbarium of Addis Ababa University for future reference. The collected leaves were cleaned using tap water to remove dust particles. Later on, the leaves were dried under shade at room temperature and then rumpled to a coarse powder using a mortar and pestle.
