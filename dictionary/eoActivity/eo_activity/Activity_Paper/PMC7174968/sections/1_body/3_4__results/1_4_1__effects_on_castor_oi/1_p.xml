<p>In the castor oil-induced diarrheal model, the crude leaves extract of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> leaves significantly prolonged the time of diarrheal onset and the frequency of stooling at 200 mg/kg.bw and 400 mg/kg.bw tested doses. Besides, the present study revealed that the percentage of diarrheal inhibition compared to controls was 23.6% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 51.31% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg.bw, respectively. In addition, at the maximum tested doses (400 mg/kg.bw), the crude extract of 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> produced almost comparable effect (51.31%) with loperamide (62.8%). Nonetheless, at the dose of 100 mg/kg.bw, the extract did not have significant antidiarrheal effect in this model (
