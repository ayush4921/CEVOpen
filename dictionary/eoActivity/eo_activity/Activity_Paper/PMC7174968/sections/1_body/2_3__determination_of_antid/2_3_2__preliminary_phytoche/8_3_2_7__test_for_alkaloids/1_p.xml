<p>0.5 g of the extract was diluted to 10 ml with acid alcohol, boiled, and filtered. To 5 ml of the filtrate, 2 ml of dilute ammonia and 5 ml of chloroform were added and shaken gently to extract the alkaloidal base. The chloroform layer was extracted with 10 ml of acetic acid. This was divided into two portions. Mayer's reagent was added to one portion and Dragendorff's reagent to the other. The formation of a cream (with Mayer's reagent) or a reddish brown precipitate (with Dragendorff's reagent) was regarded as positive for the presence of alkaloids.</p>
