<p>The crude leaves extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> had shown significant antidiarrheal activity by extending the onset of diarrhea and reducing the frequency of defection only at a maximum tested dose (400â€‰mg/kg.bw). This could probably suggest the low potency of this medicinal plant as compared to the 
 <italic>Ruta chalepensis</italic> leaves extract. Contrastingly, the lower and middles doses of the extract did not have significant antidiarrheal activity on castor oil-induced diarrhea as compared to the negative control, which could be probably due to low concentration of bioactive metabolites at lower and middle tested doses.
