<p id="Par24">Bioinformatics tools provide a great support to pharmaceutical companies in the process of drug discovery in a short duration of time with less cost using all primary information obtained from in vivo and in vitro analysis. In silico molecular docking in one of the greatest methods to determine new ligand for proteins of identified structure and thus play an important role in structure based drug discovery. Investigators worldwide use computer docking programs to discover and investigate the binding affinity for compounds that fit a binding site on the protein. The structure of the protein and ligand should be three dimensional

 </sup>. The study and documentation of structural compounds from different medicinal plant species are gaining interest and importance. In the structure based drug design, molecular docking is generally used to predict and inter molecular complex between the drug compounds with its target protein

 </sup>. In the present study, a total of 25 bioactive compounds were identified from 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> leaf and rhizome extracts by GCâ€“MS analysis and used for molecular docking studies. Further, the compounds were analyzed for bioactivity against the target proteins. Serverogenin acetate is the lead compound and exhibited antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. Computational simulation studies revealed that serverogenin acetate compound recorded better affinity with low binding energy in comparison with other compounds. The docking study results also showed that various energy sources are consistent and contribute to the overall strength to the binding interactions of serverogenin acetate for each target proteins.
