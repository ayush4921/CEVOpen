<p id="Par31">Initially, all the target proteins and compounds were prepared by assigning hydrogen bonds, bond orders, charges and flexible torsions. Screening of these compounds for protein ligand interactions was carried out using the iGEMDOCK program with the preset parameters: population size of 150 was set with 60 generations and two solutions were selected for customized docking parameter. From the customized docking study, the probable binding conformations of phytocompounds were determined based on the iGEMDOCK total energy.</p>
