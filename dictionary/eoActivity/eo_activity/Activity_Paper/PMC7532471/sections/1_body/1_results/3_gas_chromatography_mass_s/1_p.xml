<p id="Par10">The GC–MS chromatogram of methanol and ethyl acetate leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> recorded a total of 15 peaks corresponding to the bioactive compounds that were recognized by relating their peak retention time, peak area (%), height (%) and mass spectral fragmentation patterns to that of the known compounds described by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library. Results revealed that 9 and 6 compounds were identified in methanol and ethyl acetate 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> leaf extracts, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> &amp; 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The GC–MS chromatogram of the methanol extract from 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> rhizomes recorded 10 peaks (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Overall, the structure of 25 phytocompounds identified in the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from leaves, and from the methanol extract from rhizomes of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> along with their retention time.
