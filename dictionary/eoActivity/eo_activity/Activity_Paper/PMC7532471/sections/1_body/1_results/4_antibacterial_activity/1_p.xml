<p id="Par13">Antibacterial activities of leaf and rhizome extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> were tested against different bacterial pathogens at different concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg/mL). Maximum zone of inhibition of 21.43 mm was recorded with ethyl acetate leaf extract against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and highest zone of inhibition was observed for methanolic rhizome extract against 
 <italic>Ralstonia solanacearum</italic> with 20.72 mm at 100 mg/ mL as compared to other tested concentrations (Fig.
