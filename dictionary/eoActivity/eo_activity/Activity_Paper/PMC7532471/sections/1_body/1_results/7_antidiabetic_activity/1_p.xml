<p id="Par16">A dose dependent inhibitory action on α-amylase activity was observed from the leaf and rhizome of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> extracts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a). Among the extracts, ethyl acetate extract exhibited maximum α- amylase inhibition with 77.22% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 76.53 µg/ml), followed by 68.22% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 89.43 µg/ml) recorded for methanolic leaf extract and methanolic rhizome extract showed 55.12% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 99.38 µg/ml). The standard Acarbose showed α-amylase inhibition of 87.17% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.32 μg/ml). A dose dependent activity of α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition was noticed with standard Acarbose (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b). The ethyl acetate leaf extract exhibited maximum α-glucosidase inhibition was 85.26% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 72.54 µg/ml), followed by the methanol leaf extract with 78.34% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 87.32 µg/ml) and methanolic rhizome extract 71.66% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 99.46 µg/ml). While, standard Acarbose showed α-glucosidase inhibition of 89.54% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.46 μg). Among extracts, the methanolic leaf extract showed highest 87.22%inhibition of aldose reductaseas compared to other extracts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>c). In case of ethyl acetate leaf extract and methanolic rhizome extracts, a inhibition of 81.31 and 73.66% of aldose reductase was documented in the present study. The aldose reductase inhibition with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value from ethyl acetate, methanol leaf and methanolic rhizome extracts revealed 77.54, 48.7 and 99.32 μg/ml respectively. While, Quercetin recorded best activity of 7.95 μg/ml with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value.
