  <p>In silico molecular docking shows the binding interaction of serverogenin acetate ([3,12-diacetyloxy-10,14-dimethyl-13-oxo-15-(5-oxo-2H-furan-3-yl)-2-oxapentacyclo[9.7.0.01,3.05,10.014,18]octadecan-7-yl] acetate) compound with α-glucosidase target protein (5nn3) based on the binding energy generated by AutoDock program. (
   <bold>a</bold>) A hydrogen-bond interaction is formed by O3 in ALA284 (bright green arrow) in the serverogenin acetate compound. (
   <bold>b</bold>) A close-up view of serverogenin acetate compound that binds to the α-glucosidase target protein. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Binding pose of α-glucosidase target protein with serverogenin acetate compound.
