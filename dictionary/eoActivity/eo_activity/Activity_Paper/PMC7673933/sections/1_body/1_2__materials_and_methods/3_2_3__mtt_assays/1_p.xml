<p>Cytotoxicity assays were carried out utilizing a typical MTT method based on the standard protocol. To be brief, RAW264.7, LO
 <sub>2</sub>, and HSC-T6 cells were cultured in 96-well cell culture microplates with a density of 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well for LO
 <sub>2</sub> and HSC-T6 cells and 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well for RAW264.7. After cell adhesion, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of culture medium with established concentrations of RTA, RTB, or equal volume of DMSO replaced the original medium, and then, the cells were further incubated for 24 h. 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added to all wells and coincubated for 3 h. After removing the medium, DMSO (150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was subjected to the wells to dissolve the formazan crystals. The solution was monitored using a microplate reader (Thermo, Massachusetts, USA) at 490 nm.
