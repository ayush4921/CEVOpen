<p>NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B is one of the most significant signal pathways regulating proinflammatory genes whose productions in return give rise in the persistent activation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway and further exacerbate inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In resting cells, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B is normally present in the cytoplasm in formation as an inactive I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>p</italic>50/
 <italic>p</italic>65 heterotrimer. Stimulated by activators such as LPS or TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IKK
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> is phosphorylated and activated IKK
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> triggers phosphorylation of I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic> and release of p65 from the complex [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Dissociative p65 once translocated into the nucleus would initiate transcription of downstream genes inducing those coding proinflammatory cytokines [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To determine whether RTA and RTB achieve their anti-inflammatory effects via NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway, western blot analysis was launched to identify expressions of related proteins. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"> Figure 4(a)</xref> shows that compared with the blank control group, the productions of p-IKK
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> and p-p65 along with p-I
 <italic>κ</italic>B
 <italic>α</italic> in total lysate and p65 in the nucleus were significantly increased in the LPS-model group, while RTA and RTB remarkably suppressed the levels of these proteins in RAW264.7 cells. Similarly, the increase of p-p65 induced by TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was also inhibited by RTA and RTB in LO
 <sub>2</sub> cells. Consistent with our expectations, both RTA and RTB showed suppression of activated NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B pathway both in macrophages and hepatic cells.
