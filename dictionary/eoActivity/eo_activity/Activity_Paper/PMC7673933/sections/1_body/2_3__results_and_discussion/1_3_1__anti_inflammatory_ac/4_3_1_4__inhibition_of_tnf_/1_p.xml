<p>TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 are two essential proinflammatory cytokines in inflammation, and their high expressions are commonly found in liver injuries [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In order to further clarify the anti-inflammatory effects of RTA and RTB, we detected the productions of these two proinflammatory cytokines in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and IL-6 in TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>-stimulated LO
 <sub>2</sub>. The results are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The productions of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 in the medium supernatant after treatment with different concentrations of RTA or RTB were lower than those only treated with LPS in a dose-dependent manner proving that these two compounds could reduce the productions of critical proinflammatory cytokines.
