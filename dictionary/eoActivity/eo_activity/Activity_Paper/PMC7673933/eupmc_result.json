    "Rosanortriterpenes A-B (RTA and RTB), two nortriterpenoids, are characteristic constituents in the fruits of <i>Rosa laevigata</i> var. <i>leiocapus</i>. However, pharmacological studies on these compounds are still scarce. In the present study, we aim to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms associated with the effects of RTA-B in RAW264.7 macrophages and LO<sub>2</sub> cells by detecting cell viabilities, nitric oxide (NO) production, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-<i>α</i>), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. Simultaneously, the anti-inflammatory action mechanisms of these two compounds were illustrated through western blot assay. Besides, the antihepatic fibrosis activities of these compounds have also been explored. The results demonstrated that RTA and RTB inhibited the production of NO, TNF-<i>α</i>, and IL-6 and suppressed liver fibrosis. RTA and RTB treatment also greatly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB (NF-<i>κ</i>B) pathway. Our study confirmed the promising anti-inflammatory and anti-liver fibrosis actions of RTA-B, suggesting that they might be developed as alternative and promising drugs for the treatment of hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases."
