<p id="Par37">This study has investigated a tiny part of the TEK of Kune speakers, and found that there are signs of a weakening of knowledge transmission in two domains. It is clear from previous studies (such as [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]) and the authorâ€™s own interactions with Kune speakers, that many plant species potentially known to, and used by, Kune speakers were not included in the stimulus sets. The most significant group omitted from this study is that of the various yams produced by a range of local species; while these plants may no longer be staple foods, they are nevertheless eagerly sought after, and dug up whenever an opportunity presents itself. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that younger Kune speakers, who are otherwise fluent in their mother tongue, are no longer able to recall the names for a number of common plant and bird ethnotaxa.
