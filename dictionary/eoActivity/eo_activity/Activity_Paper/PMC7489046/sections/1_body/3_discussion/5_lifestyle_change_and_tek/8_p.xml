<p id="Par30">As with the plants, there was some tendency among younger participants to generalize the name for a single well-known ethnotaxon to include other, similar-looking birds. This happened most frequently with the name 
 <italic>dedded</italic>, which the oldest participant used to label the Rainbow Lorikeet only. Among the responses of the younger participants, 
 <italic>dedded</italic> was offered as a name for a variety of colourful birds, such as parrots, lorikeets and rosellas. The labels 
 <italic>korloddoddok</italic> (Peaceful Dove) and 
 <italic>bokkodjbokkodj</italic> (Bar-shouldered Dove) were also frequently used by younger participants to label other pigeons and doves.
