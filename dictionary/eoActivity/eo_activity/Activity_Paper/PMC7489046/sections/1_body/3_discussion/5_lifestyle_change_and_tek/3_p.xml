<p id="Par25">It is likely that prior to achieving regular access to mainstream foods, Kune people had to rely on a much larger array of plant and animal species for food, medicine and raw materials than they do today. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows that the vast majority of plant species included in the stimulus set have potential uses for indigenous people. Note, however, that most of the plants with edible fruit (i.e. a resource that is relatively easy to find and gather) could be identified and named by the majority of participants. The plants further down the table, that could be identified by only one, or a handful of, participants, tended to be used more for medicinal, construction or other purposes. It is likely that potential famine foods, that often require arduous or time-consuming labour for a small reward, are among the first plants to be overlooked by younger people. An example of this would be 
 <italic>Acacia holosericea</italic>, the seeds of which can be ground to make flour, which is in turn baked to produce damper [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. While this species can be found at Buluhkaduru, and was called 
 <italic>man</italic>-
 <italic>merrulk</italic> by the oldest respondent, the author has never seen any Kune person collect or consume the seeds of any 
 <italic>Acacia</italic> species. Smith also notes that certain species of 
 <italic>Acacia</italic>, such as 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>holosericea</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>auriculiformis</italic>, provide treatments for ailments such as skin sores, and contain saponins which help in washing hands or clothes; the leaves of these plants can also be crushed and thrown into small water bodies to stun fish. The therapeutic uses of such plants have nowadays been taken over by modern medicines and artificial soaps, whereas fishing is done almost solely with a hook and line. Moreover, specialist knowledge about the medicinal or magical uses of this and other plants may have resided within ‘clever men’, an Aboriginal English term for what anthropologists call ‘sorcerers’ or ‘medicine men’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Most published accounts on ‘clever men’ from the Northern Territory focus on people who have passed away (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] for some examples), and the likelihood is high that few, if any, such people are currently practicing their art. It is perhaps not surprising then, that younger Kune people no longer distinguish between the different species (and ethnotaxa) of 
 <italic>Acacia</italic>, preferring instead to use the umbrella term 
 <italic>man</italic>-
 <italic>djoh</italic> (which for older people, is the name for 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>difficilis</italic> only). Incidentally, 
 <italic>man</italic>-
 <italic>djoh</italic> was probably chosen as the prototypical ethnotaxon because it is the most common local 
 <italic>Acacia</italic>, such that the place name Buluhkaduru (which is actually 
 <italic>buluh ka</italic>-
 <italic>duru</italic> in the neighbouring Rembarrnga language) can be translated as ‘
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>difficilis</italic> stands (here)’.
