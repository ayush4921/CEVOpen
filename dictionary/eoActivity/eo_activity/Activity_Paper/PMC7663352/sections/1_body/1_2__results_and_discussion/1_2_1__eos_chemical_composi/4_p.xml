<p>In this work, chemotyping of EOs was performed by studying the chemical variability between the samples and transforming the original correlated variables into new, reduced, artificial, and orthogonal ones, called principal components (F1 and F2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05126-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The score-plot shows the relationship between different EOs (the observations) and the loading plot shows how strongly each characteristic influences a principal component (other variables). Graphically, EOs close to each other in the score-plots have similar chemotype. In this regard, the first two principal components (F1 and F2) had the highest share of the total variance (33.6%), due to the relatively high number of variables analyzed (177 compounds). In fact, twelve principal components would explain 100% of the total variation. It is, however, worth noting that the number of principal components depends on the number of variables, as the percent of total variance increases with lower number of variables. Generally, by increasing the number of variables, the proportion of total variance decreases.
