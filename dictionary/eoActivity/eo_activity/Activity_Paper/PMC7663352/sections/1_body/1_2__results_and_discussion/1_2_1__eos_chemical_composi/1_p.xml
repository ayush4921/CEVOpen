<p>The chemical composition of the 14 EOs was determined by gas-chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) analysis. 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05126-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the list of compounds in order of their elution time. A total of 177 compounds were detected, with a number of identified molecules ranging between 7 and 62 for the individual EO. The most abundant components belong to the monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenes. In the clove EO, we detected fewer components, while the pepper EO was found to be the richest one, with 62 compounds identified.
