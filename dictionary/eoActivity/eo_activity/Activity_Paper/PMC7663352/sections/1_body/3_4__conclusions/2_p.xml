<p>Overall, the 14 EOs studied were classified into six different chemotypes according to their chemical compositions and their relative abundances. The exploratory PCA technique allowed us to visualize, by reducing the dimension of the original data, and provide phytochemical relationships among all the EOs studied. Summarizing our results, amongst the 14 EOs studied, clove showed the highest antioxidant activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.36 µL/mL, followed by Chinese yin yang, oregano and ylang ylang. Moreover, oregano had the greatest antiyeast properties, inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> with an MIC of 10 µL/L, followed by clove, palmarosa, bitter orange, eucalyptus and Japanese yin yang EOs. Therefore, considering the EOs studied here, clove for its high antioxidant activity and oregano for its great antiyeast activity may have potential uses in the food and beverage sectors to increase shelf life and avoid deterioration.
