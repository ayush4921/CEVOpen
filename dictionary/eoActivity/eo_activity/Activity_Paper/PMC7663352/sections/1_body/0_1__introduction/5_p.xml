<p>Here, we studied fourteen widely used EOs (clove, eucalyptus, fennel, lavender, oregano, palmarosa, pepper, star anise, tea tree, turmeric, Chinese yin yang, Japanese yin yang, and ylang ylang) extracted from five different medicinal plant families: 
 <italic>Apiaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae, Poaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Rutaceae</italic>. These medicinal plant families are of considerable interest because they are rich in phenylpropanoids [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05126" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Volatile phenylpropanoids have multifaceted effects, which include antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Thus, antiyeast and antioxidant activities alongside with their chemical compositions of the above EOs were investigated in order to evaluate their potential applicability as natural preservative agents in food and cosmetic industries, as well as in the human health field.
