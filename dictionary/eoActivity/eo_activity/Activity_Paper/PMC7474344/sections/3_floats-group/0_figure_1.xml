   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 compared with the control or PBS group. There is concentration-dependent inhibition by administration of 
   <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> extract 48 h after treatment on U87 cell lines. Significant (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) antiproliferation is observed from 3 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on U87 and 10 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml in U251 cell lines. PBS was used in 
   <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic>, and DMSO (≤1:1000) was used in all other extracts. U87 cells were exposed to 
   <italic>A. inermis</italic> at 25, 50, and 100 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml with significant inhibition at 50 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The concentrations are different from the one in the figure and could not be presented together.
