<p>The result of antiproliferation of 5 plant extracts on U87 cell line is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Concentration-dependent activities of 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> extract 48 h after treatment with significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) antiproliferation were observed from 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (11.2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> ± 1.3) when compared with the negative control well (21.1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> ± 1.5). The other extracts inhibited proliferation with significant activities from 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>A. senegalensis</italic> and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> while 
 <italic>P. polyandra</italic> produced nonsignificant inhibition. The activities of the extracts on the proliferation of U251 as presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicated that all five extracts were significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) active from 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml with the exception of 
 <italic>P. polyandra</italic> that showed significant activities at 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml only as compared with that of the respective control wells. 
 <italic>Securidaca longepedunculata</italic>, 
 <italic>A. senegalensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> recorded concentration-dependent antiproliferative activities on U251 cell line. The respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined and presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> as 8 and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> on U87 and U251, 20 and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>A. inermis</italic> on U87 and U251, 60 and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>A. senegalensis</italic> on U87 and U251, 90 and 8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> on U87 and U251, and 100 and 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 
 <italic>P. polyandra</italic> on U87 and U251.
