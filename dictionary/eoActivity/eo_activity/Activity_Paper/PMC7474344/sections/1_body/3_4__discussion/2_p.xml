 <italic>Securidaca longepedunculata</italic> produced concentration-dependent significant activities from 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on U87 and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on U251 cell lines 48 h after treatment. When these extracts were tested for their effects on invasion using collagen V-coated membrane, all extracts significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) inhibited the invasion of U251 cell line within 8 h of invasion with 
 <italic>A. inermis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> producing greatest effects. The effects of the extracts on proliferation and invasion may be why the plants are useful to TMPs in the management of cancers. The previous study conducted showed that 
 <italic>S. longepedunculata</italic> root aqueous extract has cytotoxic effects on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 67 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] which is much higher than the results from this study with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8 and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml on U87 and U251, respectively.
