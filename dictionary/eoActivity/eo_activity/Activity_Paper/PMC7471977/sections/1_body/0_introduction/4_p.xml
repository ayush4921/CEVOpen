This species is known in Santiago Huaclilla, Oaxaca, with the common name of ‘mirto morado’ (purple myrtle).

 <italic>S. semiatrata</italic> aerial parts, two 
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodane diterpenoids have been isolated and characterized, one of them was semiatrin and the other was 7α-hydroxy-
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodan-3,13-dien-18,19:15,16-diolide (Esquivel et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Soriano-García et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). From the root extract, the diterpenoids tilifolidione, horminone and 20-norinuroyleanol were also identified (Esquivel et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Regarding biological activities, antifeedant effects of tilifolidione and horminone have been reported (Simmonds et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), as well as cytotoxic for tilifolidione (Esquivel et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and antifungal and antibacterial for horminone (Ulubelen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Bufalo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
