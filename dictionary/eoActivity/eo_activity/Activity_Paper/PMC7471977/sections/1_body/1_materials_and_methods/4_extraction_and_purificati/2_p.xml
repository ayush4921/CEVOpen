<p>Subfraction 30 eluted with the hexane–ethyl acetate mixture (3:7 v/v) was allowed to obtain a white crystalline precipitate with melting point (m.p.) 205–206 °C as measured in a Fisher-Johns apparatus (compound 
 <bold>1</bold>). Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was crystallized with methanol–acetone and analysed by ATR-IR, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR (Advance DPX400 Bruker Spectrometer, Billerica, MA) at 400 MHz, Circular Dichroism (Jasco J-1500, JASCO Inc., Easton, MD) and crystallography (Bruker Smart APEX II model diffractometer, Billerica, MA).
