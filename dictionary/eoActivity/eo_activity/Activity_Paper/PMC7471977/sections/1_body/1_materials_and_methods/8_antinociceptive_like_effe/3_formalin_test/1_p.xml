<p>This test consisted of an intraplantar injection of 20 µL of 1% formalin in the right posterior paw of the mice to produce licking behaviour as painful reaction. Then, the time spent in licking the limb administered with the nociceptive agent was counted as a pain-like behaviour for 1 min every 5 min for a 30 min period. Two stages of licking behaviour, considered as painful response, were recorded in this test. The first was the early or neurogenic phase (0–10 min) and the second was the late or inflammatory phase (10–30 min) (Tjolsen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). The decrease in licking behaviour in either phase was interpreted as an antinociceptive effect.
