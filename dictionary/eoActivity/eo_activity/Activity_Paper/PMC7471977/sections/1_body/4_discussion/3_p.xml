<p>Anxiolytic and sedative-like activities in 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> species and their bioactive metabolites have not been enough explored in preclinical or clinical studies. Nevertheless, anxiolytic-like effects for the essential oil of the 
 <italic>S. miltiorrhiza</italic> aerial parts (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) using the plus-maze test in rats (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) have been reported. While, this effect has also been observed in the hydroalcoholic extract (100 mg/kg, i.p.) of the 
 <italic>S. reuterana</italic> aerial parts (Rabbani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) and the flowers and leaves of 
 <italic>S. elegans</italic> tested at 50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o. in mice, using both the plus-maze and open field tests, where ambulatory activity was not modified (Herrera Ruiz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). An interesting case was that observed in 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic> leaves by an electroencephalography study in rats, which produced depressant activity and potentiation of the sodium pentobarbital-induced sleep. 
 <italic>S. divinorum</italic> was prepared as hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts and tested at doses of 10, 30 and 100 mg/kg, i.p. Its central effects were emphasized due to the presence of diterpenes such as salvinorins isolated in the medium polar extract (González-Trujano et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
