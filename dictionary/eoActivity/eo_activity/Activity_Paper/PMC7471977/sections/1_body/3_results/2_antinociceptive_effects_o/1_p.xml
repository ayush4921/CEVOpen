<p>Much clinical pain occurs in deep muscle tissues and/or visceral organs, because of that, the acute and tonic pain models to specifically study muscle or visceral nociception are the writhing and formalin tests. To select the most active extract during the preliminary screening of the antinociceptive effect of the 
 <italic>S. semiatrata</italic>, it was evaluated each in a single dose of 300 mg/kg, p.o. using both, writhing and formalin tests. In the writhing test, it was observed that all the extracts at 300 mg/kg, p.o. and the ketorolac (reference drug at 10 mg/kg, p.o.) produced significant reduction (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the nociceptive behaviour compared to mice treated with the vehicle (

 <italic>S. semiatrata</italic> extracts produced a significant reduction in the nociceptive response in both neurogenic (
