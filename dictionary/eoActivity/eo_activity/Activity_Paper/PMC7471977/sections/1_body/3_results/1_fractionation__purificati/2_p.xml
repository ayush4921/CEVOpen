<p>The compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was isolated and crystallized as white rectangles grown by slow solvent evaporation from a chloroform solution, m.p. (205–206 °C). The compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was considered pure according to 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra (

 <italic>Baccharis</italic> species (Asteraceae), such as 
 <italic>Baccharis trinervis</italic> Pers. (Kuroyanagi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), 
 <italic>Baccharis trimera</italic> (Less.) DC. (Herz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>) and 
 <italic>Baccharis gaudichaudiana</italic> DC. (Akaike et al.

 <sup>−1</sup>). Here in, we reported for the first time full structural details of the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-neoclerodane diterpene 
 <bold>1</bold> by X-ray single-crystal analysis (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> shows a perspective view of the molecular structure of 
 <bold>1</bold> where the compound crystallized in a monoclinic system with the P2
 <sub>1</sub> space group. The cyclohexene and cyclohexanone rings are 
 <italic>trans</italic>-fused and adopt twist boat and chair conformations, respectively. The γ lactone has an envelope conformation and the 13(16H) furanone ring is practically planar. The absolute stereochemistry at C-5, C-8, C-9 and C-10 was determined as S, S, R and R, respectively, based on the comparison of the calculated and experimental circular dichroism (ECD) spectrum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>), as well as the Flack parameter was 0.06. The molecular models for the most stable conformers (

 <bold>1</bold> were used to calculate the ECD spectrum. The experimental ECD spectrum for this compound showed two negative Cotton effects at 244 and 295 nm, which were in good agreement with those displayed for enantiomer 
 <italic>5S8S9R10R</italic>. The methyl substituent at C-17 is axial and the methyl group C-20 occupies the more sterically favoured equatorial position. The crystal structure is stabilized by weak CH⃛O contacts forming infinite chains as it is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. The C(6...O(3) and H(6)...O(3) distances are 3.67(4) and 2.69(6) Å and the angle C(6)-H⃛O(3) is 168.6 (5)°.
