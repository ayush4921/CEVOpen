<p>From the pharmacological evaluation of the extracts, it was obtained that the medium polar extract showed the highest yield, being 5- and 2-fold more abundant than the hexane and methanol, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The chromatographic separation of the ethyl acetate extract lead to the isolation of the of the most abundant metabolite, identified as 7-keto-
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodan-3,13-dien-18,19: 15,16-diolide (
 <bold>1</bold>), a 
 <italic>neo</italic>-clerodane diterpene. This compound was purified for the first time from 
 <italic>S. semiatrata</italic> as a crystalline form (
