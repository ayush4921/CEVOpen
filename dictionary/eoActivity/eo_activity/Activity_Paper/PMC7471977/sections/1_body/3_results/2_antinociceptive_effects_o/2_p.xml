<p>Regarding compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, it was purified for the first time from the 
 <italic>S. semiatrata</italic> aerial parts as a crystalline form. According to the temporal course curves, the nociceptive response after administration of 
 <bold>1</bold> was significantly reduced using doses of 0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg, p.o. (
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>4,25</sub> = 46.35, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), it was observed from the first 5 or 10 min after administration of the algogenic agent (time:

 <bold>1</bold>. The effect was maintained throughout the entire period of the experiment resembling the antinociceptive response of the reference drug tested at the same dosage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>). Antinociceptive response of 
 <bold>1</bold> in the writhing test was observed in a dose-dependent manner producing an ED
