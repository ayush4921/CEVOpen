<p>Inspired by the aforementioned findings and as part of our research work on the discovery of efficient anticancer candidates, herein we report in details the synthesis and anticancer activities assessment for a new series of non-fused 3,6-disubstituted pyridazine derivatives 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). In this context, the anticancer actions for the 3,6-disubstituted pyridazine derivatives here reported; 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> will be evaluated against three human cancer cell lines, namely, T-47D and MDA-MB-231 (breast cancers), and SKOV-3 (ovarian cancer) cell lines utilising the protocol of SRB assay. Thereafter, the most potent anti-proliferative pyridazines will be selected to explore their plausible mechanism of action through cell cycle analysis as well as Anx V-FITC apoptosis assay in both breast cancer (T-47D and MDA-MB-231) cell lines. Finally, an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study suggested CDK2 as a probable enzymatic target for the herein reported 3,6-disubstituted pyridazines 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> and explored their binding interactions within the vicinity of CDK2 binding site, thereafter, target pyridazines will be explored for their potential inhibitory activity against CDK2.
