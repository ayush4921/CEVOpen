<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reports on 3,6-disubstituted pyridazines as anticancer CDK inhibitors. Herein, a new series of 3,6-disubstituted pyridazines 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> has been synthesised, characterised and evaluated for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anticancer activity against three human cancer cell lines, namely, T-47D (breast cancer), MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer) and SKOV-3 (ovarian cancer) cell lines by the SRB assay. While, the examined pyridazines elicited good activity against T-47D cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range: 0.43 ± 0.01 − 35.9 ± 1.18 µM) and MDA-MB-231 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> range: 0.99 ± 0.03 − 34.59 ± 1.13 µM), they exerted weak activity against SKOV-3 cells. Uniquely, the methyltetrahydropyran-bearing pyridazine 
 <bold>11m</bold> showed a submicromolar growth inhibitory potency towards both breast T-47D and MDA-MB-231 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.43 ± 0.01 and 0.99 ± 0.03 µM, respectively) cell lines. In addition, the biological results indicated that pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> exerted an efficient alteration in cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis in both T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells, alongside, with their good mean tumour selectivity indexes (13.7 and 16.1, respectively) upon assessment of their cytotoxicity towards non-tumorigenic breast MCF-10A cells. Based on a suggestion from a conducted 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study, pyridazines 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold>, 
 <bold>11l</bold>, and 
 <bold>11m</bold> were selected to be evaluated for their ability to inhibit CDK2, where they exerted good inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 151, 43.8, 55.6 and 20.1 nM, respectively). Finally, the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> study implied that target pyridazines 
 <bold>11</bold> exhibited not only an efficient anticancer activity but also an acceptable ADME, physicochemical and druglikeness properties, specifically pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold>. Overall the obtained results from this study quite sustained our strategy and gave us a robust opportunity for further development and optimisation of 3,6-disubstituted pyridazine scaffold to enrich therapeutic arsenal with efficient and safe anticancer CDK inhibitors.
