<p>The target pyridazine derivatives (

 <bold>8a</bold>, 
 <bold>8e</bold> and 
 <bold>10a–d</bold> in refluxing 1,4-dioxane in the presence of Hünig’s base in order to furnish target pyridazines

 <bold>11a–r</bold> with low to good yields; 36–79%. In the second route, ethyl 6-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazine-3-carboxylate (
 <bold>6</bold>) was subjected to a nucleophilic substitution with morpholine in boiling 1,4-dioxane in the existence of Hünig’s base to furnish ethyl 6-morpholino-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazine-3-carboxylate (

 <bold>11m</bold> and
