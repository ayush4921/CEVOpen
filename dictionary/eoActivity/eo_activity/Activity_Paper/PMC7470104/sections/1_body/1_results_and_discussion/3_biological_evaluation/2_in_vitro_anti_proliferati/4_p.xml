<p>Concerning the anti-proliferative activity of target pyridazines 
 <bold>11a–r</bold> against breast cancer T-47D cell line, the results indicated that the growth of the T-47D cells was effectively inhibited by all pyridazines reported here with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s spanned in the range 0.43 ± 0.01 − 15.76 ± 0.51 µM, except for 
 <bold>11j</bold> and 
 <bold>11r</bold> which weakly inhibited the T-47D growth (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 35.9 ± 1.18 and 24.80 ± 0.81 µM, respectively). Outstandingly, two pyridazines displayed submicromolar potency against T-47D cells were identified, that were the butyl-bearing pyridazine (
 <bold>11i</bold>) and methyltetrahydropyran-bearing pyridazine (
 <bold>11m</bold>), whose IC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 0.44 ± 0.01 and 0.43 ± 0.01 µM represent the best growth inhibition here reported for T-47D cells (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, both pyridazines 
 <bold>11i</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> are decorated with morpholine moiety at C-6 position. Moreover, pyridazines 
 <bold>11b</bold>, 
 <bold>11e</bold>, 
 <bold>11f</bold>, 
 <bold>11h</bold> and 
 <bold>11l</bold> showed excellent cytotoxic activity against pyridazines 
 <bold>11m</bold> T-47D cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values equal 1.37 ± 0.04, 2.62 ± 0.08, 1.94 ± 0.06, 1.60 ± 0.05 and 1.57 ± 0.05 µM, respectively.
