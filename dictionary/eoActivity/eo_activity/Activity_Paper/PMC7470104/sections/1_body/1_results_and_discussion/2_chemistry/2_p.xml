<p>The target 5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazine-3-carboxamide derivatives (
 <bold>11a–r</bold>) were prepared through several synthetic steps (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001 SCH0002 SCH0003">Schemes 1–3</xref>) starting from the commercially available ethyl 3,3,3-trifluoropyruvate. With respect to 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>, ethyl trifluoropyruvate (
 <bold>1</bold>) reacted with acetone in the existence of L-proline and DMF following a reported method

 </xref>. Compound (
 <bold>3</bold>) was then subjected to oxidation process using potassium chromate and sulphuric acid at room temperature to give 6-oxo-5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,6-dihydropyridazine-3-carboxylic acid (
 <bold>4</bold>). Fischer esterification was then carried out for compound (
 <bold>4</bold>) through reflux with ethanol in the presence of sulphuric acid (catalytic amount) in order to afford the corresponding ester derivative (
