<p>On the other hand, the cytotoxic action for pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold>, the most potent anti-proliferative agents with dual growth inhibitory activities towards T-47D and MDA-MB-231, against non-tumorigenic human breast (MCF-10A) cells has been assessed by the use of the MTT assay in order to explore the selectivity and safety for target pyridazines reported here towards the non-tumorigenic normal cells. The obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were displayed in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, in addition to the calculated mean tumour selectivity index (S. I.); IC
 <sub>50</sub> for MCF-10A/ IC
 <sub>50</sub> average for (T-47D and MDA-MB-231). As results indicated, examined pyridazines 
 <bold>11l</bold> and 
 <bold>11m</bold> displayed good mean tumour S. I. values of 13.7 and 16.1, respectively, which discloses good safety profile for target pyridazines as antitumor agents.
