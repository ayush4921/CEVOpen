<p>For this study, the 
 <italic>E. pudingense</italic> was sampled from the Puding County of Guizhou province (China; 29°19′ N, 105°44′E). A voucher specimen (Guo0348) was deposited at the Herbarium of the Institute of Medicinal Plant (IMPLAD), Beijing, China. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the fresh leaves of 
 <italic>E. pudingense</italic> using the modified CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). The high-quality DNA was sheared to the size of 300 bp for the shotgun library construction. Genome sequencing was performed using Illumina Novaseq PE150 platform (Illumina Inc, San Diego), and 150 bp paired-end reads were generated. We assembled the chloroplast genome using the program GetOrganelle version 1.6.2 (Jin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) with 
 <italic>E. acuminatum</italic> chloroplast genome (GenBank accession number: NC_029941) as a reference. The annotation of chloroplast genome was conducted through the online program CPGAVAS 2 (Shi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), and assisted with careful manual correction. The annotated genomic sequence was registered into GenBank with an accession number (MT506232).
