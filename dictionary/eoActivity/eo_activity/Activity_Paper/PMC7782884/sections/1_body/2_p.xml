 <italic>Epimedium pudingense</italic> is a rare species only distributed in the Puding County of Guizhou Province in China, and it is used as herba epimedii by local people. Furthermore, 
 <italic>E. pudingense</italic> is a medicinal 
 <italic>Epimedium</italic> germplasm resource peculiar to the Guizhou Province in China (He etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In this study, we present the first complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>E. pudingense</italic>. The results will provide more useful information for phylogenetic and evolutionary research of the genus 
 <italic>Epimedium</italic>.
