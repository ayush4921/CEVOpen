In the pairwise distances analyses, the positions containing gaps and missing were eliminated from the data set (complete deletion option). Phylogenetic trees constructed with the Neighbor-joining (NJ) method according to Kimura 2-Parameter (K2P) model was assessed by the MEGA 7.0

 </sup>. The clade reliability in these trees using the NJ methods was tested by bootstrapping, in which 1000 repeated sampling tests were performed to obtain the support values of the clade nodes. Polymorphic site, genetic diversity indices and neutrality tests [Fu’s
