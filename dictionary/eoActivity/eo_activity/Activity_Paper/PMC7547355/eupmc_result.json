    "The use of plants or their isolated bioactive components for the prevention and treatment of various disorders has been developed. Here, we aim to identify effective medicinal plants for relief of cough and respiratory symptoms in children. The data of this review article were obtained from published articles in scientific databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, until December 2019. The keywords, including \"<i>Zataria multiflora</i> Boiss.\" OR \"<i>Portulaca oleracea</i> L.\" OR \"<i>Ferula assa-foetida</i> L.\" OR \"<i>Nigella sativa</i> L.\" AND \"respiratory symptoms\" OR \"airway inflammation\" OR \"smooth muscle relaxant effects,\" were searched individually or combined. The mentioned medicinal plants decreased total white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, and eosinophils counts of blood and lung lavage in animal model-induced respiratory disorders. These plants also have protective effects on serum immunoglobulin, antibody titer, eosinophil count, and proinflammatory cytokines. Evidence from the studies indicated that the abovementioned medicinal plants have smooth muscle relaxant properties (bronchodilator effects) via stimulation of <i>Î²</i>-adrenoceptor or inhibition of muscarinic receptors (<i>in vitro</i>) and also improved the pulmonary function test in clinical settings. These medicinal plants are safe and easy to use. Based on the anti-inflammatory, anti-antispasmodic, and immunomodulatory effects, the clinical benefit may be assumed, therefore considering a place for these medicinal plants in relieve of chronic cough and symptoms of children's allergy, asthma, and common cold."
