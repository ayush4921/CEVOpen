<p>The aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> (0.08 and 1.4 g/kg, respectively) showed antinociceptive activities against xylene (0.03 ml) induced acute and acetic acid-induced (0.7%, i.p.) chronic inflammation [

 <italic>Z. multiflora</italic> (500 mg/kg, and 0.3 mL/kg, i.p., respectively) showed antinociceptive effects in the acetic acid-induced writhing test in rats [
