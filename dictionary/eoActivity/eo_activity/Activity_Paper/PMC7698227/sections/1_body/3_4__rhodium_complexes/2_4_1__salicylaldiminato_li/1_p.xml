 <bold>55b</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold> (RI = 0.22–0.85). The uncomplexed ferrocenyl azine ligands 
 <bold>56a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold> were less potent, signifying the favourable pharmacological effects of introducing the organometallic Rh(I)COD unit. Mechanistic examination using the NP40-mediated β-hematin assay suggests disruption of the heme detoxification pathway as a possible mode of action. Before these studies, Rh(I)ClCp* congeners 
 <bold>57a</bold> and 
 <bold>58a</bold> exhibiting reversible redox character were investigated for their antiplasmodial effects on the CQS NF54 parasites along with their Ir(III)ClCp* (
 <bold>57b</bold> and 
 <bold>58b</bold>) and Ru(II)Cl(
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) (
 <bold>57c</bold> and 
 <bold>58c</bold>) derivatives [

 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In both studies, the Rh(I)ClCp* complexes displayed comparable activities to the Ir(III)ClCp* and Ru(II)(
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene) derivatives, placing the rhodium metal as an attractive alternative to the extensively studied iridium and ruthenium metals for the generation of bioactive organometallic compounds. Again, the bimetallic complexes were significantly superior in activity to their respective ferrocenyl ligands. Introducing aqueous solubility to complexes 
 <bold>58a</bold>–
 <bold>c,</bold> by incorporation of a water-soluble sulfonate group at position C5 of the benzene ring, led to a decrease in the activity of the complexes, and no discernible β-hematin binding affinity was observed at the maximum tested concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 μM). The latter observation would seem to suggest that the observed inhibitory action of the water-soluble sulfonate compounds on the screened strain proceeds via alternative modes of action such as the generation of reactive-oxygen species (ROS) in which the ferrocene unit plays a pivotal role by undergoing reversible Fenton-type redox processes inside the DV of the malaria parasite [
