<p>On the other hand, organometallic complexes of the related congener metal, palladium, are more prevalent in the literature. The coordination chemistry of palladium complexes closely resembles their platinum counterparts more than any other metals within the PGM block [

 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Moreover, the faster ligand-exchange and aquation rates (more than 10
 <sup>5</sup> times) of palladium complexes lead to higher solubility relative to their platinum congeners, making them attractive for application in biological systems [

Hence, interest in their biological potential is only logical considering the success of the structurally similar platinum complexes in anticancer treatment. Consequently, there have been various studies on the biological activity of palladium complexes since Graham and Williams proposed the investigation of palladium complexes as anti-infective agents and promising anticancer alternatives to platinum in their pioneering studies [
