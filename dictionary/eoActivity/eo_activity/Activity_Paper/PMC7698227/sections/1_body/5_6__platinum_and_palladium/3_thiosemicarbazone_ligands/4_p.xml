<p>A follow-up study incorporating PTA (
 <bold>88a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>) and 2-phosphinobenzylamine (
 <bold>89</bold>) coordinating ligands led to the identification of mononuclear cyclopalladated TSC complexes possessing improved antiplasmodial activities in the low micromolar range (1.59–2.69 μM) against CQS NF54 and CQR Dd2 strains, with low resistance indices often observed (

 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Similar to the previous findings, the mononuclear complexes were superior in activity to their corresponding free TSC ligands, and the tetranuclear complexes (
 <bold>85a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>) were impotent on both strains. Expansion of the bisphosphino bridge with a bulky three-benzene linker for the binuclear complex 
 <bold>90</bold> did not enhance the antiplasmodial effects of the resulting compound.
