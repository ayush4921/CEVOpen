<p>Like cisplatin, ruthenium complexes possess a significant affinity for binding to nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) through a different mechanism, leading to the disruption of several essential biological processes vital for the survival of the targeted pathogen, which subsequently induces cell death [

 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Consequently, elucidation of a probable mechanism of action of the complexes (
 <bold>49</bold>–
 <bold>50</bold>) was carried out on herring sperm DNA (HS-DNA) using various biochemical protocols: UV/vis titration, viscosity (or hydrodynamic volume) measurements, agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE), and in silico docking simulations [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The authors demonstrated that the complexes exhibit strong DNA-binding affinity via intercalation with binding constants in the range 0.30 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>–6.25 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> L/mol. Intriguingly, compound 
 <bold>49c</bold>, which emerged as the most toxic candidate against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasitaemia in the study, displayed the highest affinity for HS-DNA, thus suggesting a correlation between activity and DNA interaction. The second cohort of polycyclic [Ru(III)ClCp*] complexes, featuring tri-arylated pyrazoline ligands (
 <bold>51a</bold>–
 <bold>g</bold>), was also active against the clinical isolates in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 0.54–2.15 mg/mL, with compound 
 <bold>51a</bold> exhibiting the highest activity [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The complexes interacted with DNA in a similar manner to the quinolinyl complexes 
 <bold>50</bold>–
 <bold>51</bold> and the binding constants were in the same order of magnitude.
