<p>Ru-arene complexes of bioactive motifs, such as thiosemicarbazones (TSCs), tetraoxanes, and salicylaldimines, have been shown to possess antiplasmodial activity over the years. Krettli and colleagues coordinated a ruthenocenyl entity into the scaffold of a tamoxifen-like compound (
 <bold>36</bold>), which displays structural similarities to the anticancer drug, tamoxifen (
 <bold>32</bold>) [

 <bold>33</bold>–
 <bold>35</bold>) were synthesized, which displayed antiplasmodial activity against the CQR W2 strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between 5.9 and 16.5 μM (

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Most notably, the ruthenocenyl derivatives were superior in activity to the parental organic ligand (
 <bold>36</bold>), which were shown to be inactive against the tested strain. This further supports the potential of metal incorporation to not only improve the biological activity of bioactive organic scaffolds, but also confer new biological activities.
