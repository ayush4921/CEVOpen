<p>DNA is integral in an array of biochemical processes, from the coding of genes necessary for regulation of normal cellular functions to the expression of proteins that are pivotal in the pathology of diseases. Considering the substantial variations between human and plasmodial genomes, particularly nucleotide base composition, it is possible and sensible to devise chemical agents that target the malarial parasites over normal human cells by exploiting these differences. Most noteworthy in these variations is the abnormal adenosine- and thymine-rich content in the DNA of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites [

 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. This alteration affects the structure of plasmodial DNA and potential binding sites for external compounds, offering medicinal chemists an opportunity to formulate chemotypes that can selectively target these sites to inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites, as has been demonstrated in the literature [

 <xref rid="B103-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>,
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Ruthenium organometallic complexes have been tested for DNA interaction as a possible mechanism of action for inducing antiparasitic effects.
