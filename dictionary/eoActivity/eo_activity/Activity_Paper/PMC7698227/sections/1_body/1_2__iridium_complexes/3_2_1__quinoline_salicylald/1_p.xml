<p>In 2016, Nordlander and co-workers investigated the antiplasmodial activity of 
 <italic>N^N</italic>- and 
 <italic>N^O</italic>-coordinated IrCp* complexes, based on chloroquine analogues of salicylaldimine (
 <bold>7a</bold>–
 <bold>h</bold>), 2-picolamine (
 <bold>8</bold>), and 2-aminomethylimidazole (
 <bold>9</bold>) as ligands (

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The uncoordinated ligands, as well as the corresponding complexes, were screened for their antiplasmodial activity against the chloroquine-sensitive (CQS) NF54 strain and the chloroquine -resistant (CQR) Dd2 strain of the malaria parasite, 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Generally, the complexes exhibited activity in the sub-micromolar range (0.030–0.677 μM), albeit lower than that of the corresponding ligands, with higher selectivity for the NF54 CQS strain. However, the majority of the tested complexes interestingly showed lower resistant indices (RI) compared with the ligands, which is a good indication of reduced cross-resistance upon complexation, with compounds 
 <bold>7e</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold>–
 <bold>h</bold> displaying increased efficacy against the chloroquine-resistant Dd2 (CQR) strain, compared with their corresponding ligands. Elucidation of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of the salicylaldiminato IrCp* complexes (
 <bold>7a</bold>–
 <bold>h</bold>) revealed no clear trend for the CQR strain, however, a linear correlation depicting an increase in activity upon substitution with electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) was observed for the CQS strain. It should also be noted that the salicylaldimine ligand was more favorable for plasmodial potency, relative to the picolamine and imidazole ligands. A subsequent study, reported in the following year by the same research group, revealed that coordination with a pyrazine amide ligand (
 <bold>10</bold>) was detrimental for antiplasmodial activity, as the resulting complex was inactive at the highest tested concentration against the NF54 parasite strain (
