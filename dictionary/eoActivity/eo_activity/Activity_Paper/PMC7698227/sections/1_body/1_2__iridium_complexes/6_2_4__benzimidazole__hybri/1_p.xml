<p>Recently, the research group of Smith reported a series of neutral, cyclometallated Ir(III)Cp* complexes (
 <bold>25</bold>), based on the 2-phenylbenzimidazole scaffold (
 <bold>24</bold>), showing in vitro antiplasmodial activity against NF54 and K1 strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05276-f006">Figure 6</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The synthesized complexes displayed activities in the low micromolar range against the tested strains. Most noteworthy was the significant increase in activity observed upon metal complexation of the ligands (
 <bold>24a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold>) with IrCp*, which enhanced the activity of ligands 
 <bold>24a</bold>–
 <bold>24c</bold> by 10- to 18-fold. Complexation of 
 <bold>24d</bold>, however, resulted in compound 
 <bold>25d</bold> being approximately 117 times more active than the uncoordinated ligand against the CQS NF54 strain, further highlighting the medicinal benefits of incorporating organometallic fragments into organic scaffolds. The complexes (
 <bold>25a</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold>), however, were less selective for the CQR K1 strain, as indicated by their lower activity. Evaluation of substituent effects on activity shows that substitution with CF
 <sub>3</sub> is generally more tolerated for efficacy compared with other substituents. Compound 
 <bold>25b,</bold> endowed with this substituent, possessed higher selectivity for the CQR strain over the CQS strain, implying a higher resistance index. Furthermore, preliminary evaluation of the compounds for their potential binding affinity to hematin, which is a common target for antimalarial drugs, suggests a mechanistic modality independent of the hemozoin inhibition pathway.
