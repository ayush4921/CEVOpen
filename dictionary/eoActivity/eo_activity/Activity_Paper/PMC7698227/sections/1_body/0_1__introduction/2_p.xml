<p>The application of bioactive metallic compounds has been extensively explored, in contemporary drug discovery, as nonconventional therapeutic chemotypes possessing novel, and sometimes unique modes of action, compared with their traditional organic counterparts [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The success of metallodrugs was accentuated by the seminal discovery of the platinum-based anticancer agent, cisplatin, which has had tremendous success within cancer treatment regimens [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Concerning its pharmacological applications, platinum is the archetype for a group of related metals, known as platinum-group metals (PGMs), i.e., iridium, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium, platinum, and palladium, which share many similarities in both their physical and chemical attributes [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05276" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The ability of PGMs to form multiple coordination bonds with electron-rich atoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, from various ligands, allows for the incorporation of these metallic centres into known chemical scaffolds. Consequently, PGM complexes are a diverse group of compounds, which can be easily fine-tuned, resulting in widespread potential applications. These complexes have been the subject of much research interest within fields of catalysis and biomedical applications, particularly cancer, having reported many success stories [

Their biomedical applications, in particular, have been exhaustively covered in the literature, with recent reviews comprehensively summarizing the biological activity of PGMs, including their anticancer, antibacterial, and antiviral properties [
