<p>HPLC identification and quantification of four triterpene compounds of SECA accessions were made based on their retention time (RT) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectra at 206 nm (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03353-f002">Figure 2</xref>Aâ€“D show a chemical profile of CA accessions and the reference standards of madecassoside, asiaticoside, madecassic acid, and asiatic acid. Simultaneous quantification of triterpenes in CA has also been achieved using this method. It has been reported that asiaticoside and madecassoside are the most abundant triterpenes found in CA; however, the concentrations of these compounds may vary depending on geographical factors such as environment, origin, harvesting time, as well as the extraction method used [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the present study, the content of madecassoside was found to be the highest among the accessions, followed by asiaticoside. This finding is in agreement with previous the study on the CA extract from Thailand containing about 80% triterpenoids glycosides such as madecassoside (53.1%), and asiaticoside (32.3%) [
