<p>In Malaysia, there are more than 15 accessions of CA with each having variation in their bioactive constituents [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Zainol et al., (2003) observed two accessions of CA that have variation in their active constituents in different parts of plants such as the root, petiole, and leaf of CA and showed high antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In a different study, 14 accessions of CA were identified and from HPLC fingerprinting analysis. It was observed that madecassic acid was highest in one of the accessions [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In other findings, five accessions of CA from India showed variations in secondary metabolites due to the difference in altitude and geographical location of the plant [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03353" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although many pharmacological effects of CA have been reported, the AChE inhibitory activity among accessions of CA in Malaysia has not been fully investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting analysis and AChE inhibitory activity of triterpenes among the CA accessions. In addition, a molecular docking study was also carried out to investigate the binding interaction of targeted compounds against AChE.
