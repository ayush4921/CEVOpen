<p>The present study demonstrated the potential of two extracts of accessions of CA (SECA-K017 and SECA-K018) as potential sources of AChE inhibitors. The results from the in vitro studies indicated the very good interactions of asiatic acid and madecassic acid with the active sites and fulfilled the docking parameters against AChE. Asiatic acid and madecassic acid, which are present in the accessions, showed a favorable AChE inhibitory profile and, therefore, can be used as markers to guide further studies on CA as a potential natural product for the treatment of AD.</p>
