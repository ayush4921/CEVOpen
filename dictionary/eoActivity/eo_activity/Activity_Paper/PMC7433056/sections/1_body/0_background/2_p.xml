<p id="Par16">PHS has long been known to possess hypothermic and remarkably hallucinogenic properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The main chemical constituents of PHS are alkaloids, flavonoids and anthraquinones. Harmaline and harmine are the two main alkaloidal constituents in PHS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which can accumulate in dry seeds at 4.3 and 5.6% (w/w). Harmaline and harmine are primary toxic alkaloids in the PHS. The toxicity of harmaline is almost twice than harmine and in moderate doses causes tremors and clonic convulsions, but with no increase in spinal reflex excitability [

Peganumine C, peganumine D, and peganumine I were found to have selective inhibitory activity against AChE respectively. Peganumine G and peganumine H showed significant cytotoxicity against a ZR-75-1 cell line respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. So far, relevant reports on the toxicity of PHS are hardly available. At present, there are few studies on the toxic mechanism of PHS. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the toxicity effects of PHS by

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Harmaline and harmine could effectively ameliorate memory deficits in scopolamine-induced mice, both of them exhibited an enhancement in cholinergic function by inhibiting AChE [
