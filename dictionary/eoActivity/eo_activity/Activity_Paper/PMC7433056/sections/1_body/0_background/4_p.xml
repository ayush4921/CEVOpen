 <italic>C. elegans</italic> system was used to evaluate the toxicity of PHS ethanol extract in vivo. In addition, we also explored the possible mechanism of PHS toxicity to 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Our data here will help understand the possible mechanisms of PHS toxicity and in turn confirms that the 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is an effectual model when used for assessing adverse effects of Chinese medicinal materials.
