<p id="Par32">We used TRIzol®Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to extract total 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> RNA. Using total RNA as template, cDNA was synthesized by invitrogen reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The process of fluorescence quantitative PCR includes design and synthesis of primers, fluorescence quantitative PCR, PCR product agarose electrophoresis (Bio-rad Sub-Cell®Model 192 Cell,USA), preparation of melting curve (ABI PRISM 7500, USA). qRT-PCR was used to determine the relative quantification of the targeted genes in comparison to the reference 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene, and the results were expressed as the relative expression ratio (between targeted gene and internal control 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic>). The designed primers for targeted genes and reference 
 <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene were shown as follows (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
