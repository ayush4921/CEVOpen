 <italic>C. elegans</italic> synchronized in the L4 stage was placed in NGM containing different concentrations of drugs, 3 NGM per group, 10 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> per NGM, and control group was set up. We measured 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> survival when exposed to paraquat. After 24 h of development, the 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> were transferred to the NGM containing 50 mM paraquat, and the survival number of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was recorded every 2 h until all the 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> died. The death standard is described above [
