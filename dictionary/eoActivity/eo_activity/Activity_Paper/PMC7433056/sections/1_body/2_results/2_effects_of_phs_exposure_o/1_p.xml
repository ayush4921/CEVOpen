<p id="Par37">The evaluation indexes of development of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> include three aspects: body length, body width and abnormal development. Changes of body length reflect the growth rate and physiological state of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In this study, we chose body length as a development evaluation indicator. Prolonged exposure to 0.25 mg/mL of PHS did not obviously influence the body length of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but prolonged exposure to 0.50, 1.00 mg/mL of PHS significantly reduced the body length of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Fig.
