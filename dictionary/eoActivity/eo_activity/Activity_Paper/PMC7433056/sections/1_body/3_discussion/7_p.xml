<p id="Par57">Previous studies have shown that 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be used for toxicity assessment of metal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], organic contaminants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], pharmaceutical compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] or specific components extracted from plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In the present study, our data further suggests that 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be utilized to toxicity assessment of Chinese medicinal materials. Therefore, 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be used to estimate the beneficial effects and adverse reactions of Chinese medicinal materials. We first evaluated the toxicity of PHS using 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Since most Chinese medicinal materials still lack detailed toxicity data, 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> will be a fast and systematic system for assessing the toxicity of Chinese medicinal materials.
