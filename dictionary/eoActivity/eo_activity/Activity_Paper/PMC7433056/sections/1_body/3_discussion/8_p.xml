 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is largely different from the human species and lack organs such as heart, kidney, lung, etc. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] Therefore 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> cannot completely replace traditional animal toxicology experiments such as rats. In the prepared PHS solution, there may be various chemical components. We only studied the toxicity of ethanol extract on 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> which means that our data may not fully reflect the biological effects of PHS prepared by other extraction methods. The toxicological effects of PHS and related toxicological mechanisms are rarely documented. For these reasons, extensive pharmacological and chemical experiments, as well as human metabolism, should be the focus of future research.
