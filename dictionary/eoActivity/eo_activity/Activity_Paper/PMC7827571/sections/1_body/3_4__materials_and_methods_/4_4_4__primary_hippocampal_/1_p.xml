<p>A primary culture of hippocampal neurons was prepared following previously described methods [
 <xref rid="B16-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Briefly, hippocampi were dissected from C57BL/6 mice pups at 17–18 gestational days; then, neurons were isolated and subsequently cultured in vitro, following standard procedures. The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in poly-D-lysine hydrobromide (150 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)-coated 24-well plates with B27 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)-supplemented Neurobasal A (Invitrogen) containing 100 units/mL of penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin, and 0.5 mM of glutamine (Invitrogen). All cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cultures were then treated with a 5 μM TMT solution at 7 DIV and assessed 24 h after. To evaluate the cytoprotective effect of the PBWE on the TMT-induced damage on mature hippocampal neurons, the PBWE (0–100 μg/mL) was added 1 h before the TMT treatment (
