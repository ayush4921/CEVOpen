<p>Moreover, to additionally confirm that the specimens belonged to our species of interest, we amplified and sequenced the mitochondrial COI DNA barcode regions, a universal DNA barcode used for identifying animal species, from five randomly selected larvae. Then, we compared the sequence identity with other COI sequences registered in the GenBank using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, to confirm the sequence identity and species of the sampled larvae, comparative sequence analysis was carried out between the COI sequences of the five samples and other closely related insect species registered in the GenBank, including 
 <italic>Protaetia brevitarsis</italic> (KC775706), 
 <italic>P. affinis</italic> (KM286290), 
 <italic>P. speciosissima</italic> (KM286124 and KJ964255), 
 <italic>P. lugubris</italic> (KM286218, KU908751, and KU916955), 
 <italic>P. marmorata</italic> (KJ964464), 
 <italic>P. cuprea</italic> (DQ295301), 
 <italic>P. aurichalcea</italic> (KM033437), and
