<p>Uncontrolled ROS accumulation and oxidative stress in the brain may be implicated in the progression of various neurodegenerative diseases [

 <xref rid="B31-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In TMT-induced neurotoxicity, oxidative stress is also thought to be one of the main mechanisms underlying seizures and neurodegeneration. Previous studies have reported that TMT treatment induces the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, protein carbonyl (a marker of protein peroxidation), malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxynonenal (markers of lipid peroxidation) in both in vivo and in vitro models [

 <xref rid="B33-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This oxidative stress condition could affect behavioral abnormalities and homeostasis imbalance of the antioxidant system, and consequently lead to neuronal cell death in TMT-intoxicated animals [
 <xref rid="B7-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Further, endogenous compensatory antioxidative responses are simultaneously activated for spontaneous recovery in various neurodegenerative states, such as TMT intoxication. Earlier studies have shown that Nrf2 signaling, a major transcriptional activator of genes coding enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase, is activated in the hippocampus of TMT-treated mice [

 <xref rid="B35-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We also observed the increased expression of Nrf2 in response to TMT-induced damage, which is consistent with previous studies; however, pretreatment with the PBWE reduced the expression of Nrf2 in the hippocampus of TMT-treated mice. Moreover, we identified that the PBWE has free radical scavenging potential as a non-enzymatic antioxidant, similar to that of nitric oxide and ROS-removal capacities of the PB larvae that has been reported in other studies [

 <xref rid="B37-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Previous publications have reported that the administration of non-enzymatic antioxidants, including vitamin C, lycopene, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) alleviate TMT neurotoxicity by decreasing levels of the biomarkers of oxidative stress and consequently neuronal death [
 <xref rid="B33-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Gallorini, et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that Nrf2 expression was decreased in the presence of NAC in 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-induced oxidative stress state when compared to that in subjects who had not received NAC. The underlying hypothesis was that NAC participates in the scavenging of ROS and supports the synthesis of glutathione, one of the non-enzymatic antioxidants. Similarly, the drastic decrease of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; Nrf2-regulated downstream gene) expression in the presence of NAC implicated that its antioxidant activity was effective enough to modulate the cellular redox balance apart from that of the enzymatic antioxidants produced by the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in bilirubin-induced oxidative stress state of neuroblastoma cells [

 <xref rid="B41-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, we thought that the PBWE could also present a similar antioxidant capacity with regard to the activation of Nrf2 signaling, and the antioxidative effects of the PBWE could ameliorate TMT-induced seizures and neurodegeneration.
