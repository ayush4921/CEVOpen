<p>A chemical investigation of the PBWE led to the isolation of six major compounds by chromatographic separation methods. The structures of the isolated compounds were identified through interpretation of their spectral data including one and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and comparison with reported values. The isolated compounds were identified as adenine (

 <xref rid="B19-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], hypoxanthine (
 <bold>2</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B19-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], uridine (
 <bold>3</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B20-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], adenosine (
 <bold>4</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], inosine (
 <bold>5</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B21-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and benzoic acid (
 <bold>6</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B22-ijms-22-00679" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All compounds except benzoic acid (
 <bold>6</bold>) were purine or pyrimidine derivatives. The UPLC chemical profile of the PBWE and chemical structures of each peak are shown in
