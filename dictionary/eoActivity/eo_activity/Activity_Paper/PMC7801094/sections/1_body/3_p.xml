<p>To analyze the phylogenetic position of 
 <italic>Lophatherum gracile</italic>, 17 complete chloroplast genomes from the same 
 <italic>Gramineae</italic> family were downloaded from the GenBank database, and these genomes were aligned using MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using Mega-X v10.0.5 software (Kumar etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) with maximum likelihood method and 1000 bootstrap replicates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The phylogenetic tree shows that 
 <italic>Lophatherum gracile</italic> formed a distinct clade which was separated from 
 <italic>Cenchrus americanus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cenchrus longispinus</italic>. These results facilitate the identification of 
 <italic>Lophatherum gracile</italic> and its taxonomic study, which will help us collect resources, culture them, study their pharmacological activities, and develop some functional products.
