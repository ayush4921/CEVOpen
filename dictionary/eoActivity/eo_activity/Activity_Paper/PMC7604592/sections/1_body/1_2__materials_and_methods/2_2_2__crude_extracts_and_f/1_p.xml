<p>The aerial parts of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> were dried in a ventilated room and crushed to a fine powder. The crude extract was prepared by soaking 500 g of the dry powder in 3 L of ethanol for 48 h. A rotary evaporator was then used to concentrate the crude extract (60 g) which was then partitioned using different solvents, including 
 <italic>n-</italic>hexane (Hex), chloroform (CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>), and 
 <italic>n-</italic>butanol (ButOH) producing 8 g, 13 g, and 22 g of dried extracts, respectively.
