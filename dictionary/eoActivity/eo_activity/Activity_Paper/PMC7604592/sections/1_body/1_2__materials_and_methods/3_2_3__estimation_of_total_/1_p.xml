<p>The crude extract and fractions of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> were quantitatively examined for total phenolic content using the standard Folin-Ciocalteau spectrophotometric method [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For this procedure, 0.5 ml of each sample was added to 0.1 ml of Folin-Ciocalteau reagent (0.5 N) and mixed thoroughly. Subsequently, 2.5 ml of sodium carbonate (Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>) was added, and the mixture was left to stand for 0.5 h after mixing. Optical density was measured at 760 nm. Total phenolic contents were presented as milligram equivalents of GA (GAE)/g of the extract.
