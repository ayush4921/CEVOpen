<p>Many of the compounds identified in these plants have previously been described in some medicinal plant extracts. 1-monolinoleoylglycerol, which is found in 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> has been described in the extract of 
 <italic>Datura stramonium</italic> and 
 <italic>Salvadora persica</italic> and the extracts of these plants have shown antimicrobial and anticancer activities [

 <xref rid="B44-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Certain sugars were detected in both 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> and 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> plant extracts notably sucrose, glucose, glycerol, and fructose. These sugars were shown to possess antibacterial activities [

 <xref rid="B46-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Ethyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate detected in 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> and other derivatives of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid have been identified in medicinal plant 
 <italic>Mitracarpus scaber</italic> and have demonstrated antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], and 
 <italic>Anarcadium occidentale</italic> (cashew gum) also has been synthesized and evaluated for antioxidant and enzyme inhibition [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. 6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid phenylmethyl ester was found in the extract of 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic>, and this compound was detected in 
 <italic>Croton bonplandianum</italic> extract which possesses anti-inflammatory and enzyme inhibitory potentials [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. 3-hydroxyspirost-8-ene-11-one, which was detected in 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic>, has been previously described in 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, and this plant extract studied showed antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B50-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Ursodeoxycholic acid was identified in 
 <italic>M. myristica,</italic> and this compound has been synthesized from a natural source [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Hexadecanoic acid contained in 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> has been described in many plants and this compound has good medicinal properties including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and enzyme inhibitory activities including anticholinesterase activity [
 <xref rid="B52-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The compound 2-Hydroxy-4-methylbenzoic acid present in 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> has been detected previously in 
 <italic>Hemidesmus indicus</italic> and mangrove fungus and has displayed anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B55-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In the extract of 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic>, abietic acid was identified, and this compound has been detected in 
 <italic>Isodon wightii</italic>, which displayed antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticholinesterase activities [
 <xref rid="B57-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A major component of eucalyptus called eucalyptol or 1,8-cineole identified in 
 <italic>X, aethiopica</italic> extract has been detected in many species of eucalyptus, whose extracts possess antimicrobial and antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B58-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The volatile compound 3-carene was detected in the extract of 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> and has been described as an antimicrobial compound [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. From these analyses of previous studies, it can be understood that the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and enzyme inhibitory activities of these extracts of 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> and 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> can be attributed to these chemical compounds that they contain.
