<p>The investigation of bioactivities of food extracts and food-derived substances is attracting much attention because of their considerable and known safety. These food substances are exploited for their medicinal properties besides their nutritive values especially to combat food-borne infections resulting from various food pathogens. The emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains nowadays threatens the use of conventional antibiotics in order to treat bacterial infections and diseases. New strategies such as biofilm inhibition and quorum-sensing disruption are therefore necessary to overcome persistent infections especially those that involve resistant biofilm formation by the pathogens. Both food spices 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> have shown biofilm inhibitory potentials and also violacein inhibition and swimming/swarming motilities inhibitions. These traits are quorum-sensing-mediated processes which help to increase the resistance of bacteria and virulence of their infections. Both extracts displayed low to moderate anticholinesterase activities and tyrosinase and urease inhibitory potentials, which is interesting for these natural food spices. As an added value to the antimicrobial properties of these two natural food spices, they can be desirable as enzyme inhibitors which may present no or milder side effects than conventional synthetic drugs used for this purpose. The bioactivities of these extracts opens a space for the search of the bioactive molecules contained in them.
