<p>The seeds of 
 <italic>Xylopia aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>Monodora myristica</italic> were purchased from the Bamenda food market. Both spicy plants were identified by Mr. T. Fulbert, a botanist working at the National Herbarium of Cameroon and compared with existing voucher specimens 28725/SRF Cam. (
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic>) and 49544/HNC (
 <italic>M. myristica</italic>). Of each of the seeds, 200 g were powdered and subjected to maceration extraction. Then, 2 L of dichloromethane/methanol mixture in the ratio 1:1 was used as the solvent for extraction process and the mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 48 h with intermittent stirring. After this, the supernatant was carefully decanted and filtered using a Whatman number 1 filter paper. This filtrate was evaporated on a Rotary evaporator to remove the solvent. This process was repeated three times for each sample to yield crude extracts of 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> (27 g) and 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> (41 g).
