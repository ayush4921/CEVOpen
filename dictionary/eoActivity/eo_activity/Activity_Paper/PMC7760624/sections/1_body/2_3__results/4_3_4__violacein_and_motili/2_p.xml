<p>The swimming and swarming inhibition assay was carried on 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 at 100 µg/mL, 75 µg/mL, and 50 µg/mL, and the results are given in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01768-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The anti-motility activity of these plant extracts were low at test concentrations. In both models, 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> showed higher motility inhibition than 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
