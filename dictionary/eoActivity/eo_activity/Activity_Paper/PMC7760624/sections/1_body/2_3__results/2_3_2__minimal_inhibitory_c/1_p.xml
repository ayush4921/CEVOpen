<p>The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of both extracts are reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01768-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Both plants 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> had the same MIC values of 0.625 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL on 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, respectively. However, 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> had better activity than 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> on 
 <italic>S. aureus,</italic> while 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was more susceptible to 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> than 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic>. The lowest MIC value was 0.1325 mg/mL, exhibited by 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
