<p id="p0190">For instance, after the first outbreak of SARS-CoV, reported that Glycyrrhizin, a saponin from Liquorice roots, can inhibit the replication of SARS-associated coronavirus with EC
 <sub>50</sub> value ranging from 300 to 600 mg/L (during and after virus adsorption, respectively). The CC
 <sub>50</sub> was recorded to be higher than 20,000 mg/L. This means that at a dose of 20,000 mg/L, there was only 20–30% reduction of cell viability recorded thus indicating the low cytotoxicity of the compound. It was demonstrated that glycyrrhizin given to infected cells at 4000 mg/L, completely blocked replication of the virus (

The study also indicated that Glycyrrhizin is a safer alternative to other antiviral compounds such as Ribavirin which is usually responsible for hemolysis and a drastic reduction of haemoglobin in SARS patients (Cinatl et al., 2003b). Although there are certain side effects to using untested herbal products and every product should be properly tested, phytochemicals are usually intrinsically safe based on their biocompatibility, lesser toxicity than xenobiotics and environment-friendliness. At the time of SARS outbreak in 2002, the mechanism of action of phytochemicals like Glycyrrhizin wasn't exactly clear. Further studies on Glycyrrhizin attempted to decipher the mechanism of action and produce a more potent form of the phytochemical against coronaviruses. 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Hoever et al. (2005)</xref> showed that addition of 2-acetamido-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosylamine into the glycoside chain of glycyrrhizin results in a 10-fold increase in its activity against the virus. The spike proteins (S-proteins) of coronaviruses are heavily glycosylated. This study showed that the addition of glycyrrhizin (with the added 2-acetamido-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosylamine) blocks the entry of the virus into the cells. Glycyrrhizin has also been shown to disappear from the blood plasma of treated subjects after oral administration of 100 mg glycyrrhizin. This might be because it is metabolized to glycyrrhetinic acid by intestinal bacteria which contain β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucuronidase (
