<p id="p0180">Among the many compounds, there are many of them used against respiratory viruses. For instance, theaflavin has been shown to inhibit hemagglutinin and neuraminidase in H1N1 influenza virus, curcumin disrupts the envelop of H1N1 and H9N2 influenza viruses (

 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> has been found to be highly 
 <italic>anti</italic>-hRSV-specific compound. The study showed that carnosic acid inhibited both A- and B- type hRSV, while it did not affect the replication of influenza A virus and thus could be used as a more specific treatment for hRSV (

Focusing on the scope of the current review and to have a deep insight into herbal medicine against coronaviruses, we will now highlight the phytochemicals that are previously employed against coronaviruses and thus bears potential against COVID-19.
