<p>Diabetes mellitus is characterized by progressive metabolic derangement, hyperglycemia, and morphological changes in the liver, kidney, retina, pancreas, and other organs [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In all these abnormalities, oxidative stress is a major risk factor [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hepatic injury as a result of hyperglycemia leads to enlargement of sinusoids, dilation of cisterns, as well as a loss of rough endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes in the liver cells [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, the changes in the activities of serum liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and ALP) as well as morphological and histopathological lesions found in the livers of the animals in this study are attributed to diabetes-induced chronic stress.
