<p>Immunohistochemical staining of the liver revealed a high expressions of caspase-9 and IL-1β in the alloxan-induced diabetic rats. However, there was reduced expression of these proteins in the liver of MLEMC treated rats. Caspase-9 is an initiator caspase [
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which is activated during programmed cell death (apoptosis). Downregulation of caspase-9 expressions by MLEMC may imply that the extract protects the hepatic tissue against TNF-receptor-activated apoptosis. This may establish the anti-apoptotic potential of MLEMC. IL-1 beta is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine, which induces prostaglandin synthesis, neutrophil influx, and activation. It has been shown that increase in the level of IL-1β is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes [
