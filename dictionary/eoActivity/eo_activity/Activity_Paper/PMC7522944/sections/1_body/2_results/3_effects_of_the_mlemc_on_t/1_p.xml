<p>In this study, diabetic rats showed a reduction in the level of PSH and NPSH in the hepatic post-mitochondrial fractions (PMF) compared with the control (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table-3</xref>). The level of protein and NPSH thiols significantly (α
 <sub>0.05</sub>) increased in the hepatic PMF of MLEMC treated groups compared with the diabetic rats. Furthermore, administration of alloxan resulted in significant (α
 <sub>0.05</sub>) decrease in the content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the hepatic post-mitochondrial fractions of the diabetic rats compared with the control group (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table-3</xref>). Treatment with MLEMC and glibenclamide induced significant (α
 <sub>0.05</sub>) increase in the content of GSH compared with the diabetic group (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table-3</xref>).
