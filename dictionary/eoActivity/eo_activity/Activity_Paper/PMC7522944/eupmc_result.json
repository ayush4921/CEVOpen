    "<h4>Background and aim</h4><i>Momordica charantia</i> is a highly valued plant, widely distributed in the tropical and subtropical regions. The plant is reported to have a wide range of medicinal uses. This study was designed to explore the ameliorative potential of <i>M. charantia</i> methanol leaf extract in alloxan-induced diabetic animal model with a particular focus on the liver.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Hepatoprotective effect of methanol leaf extract of <i>M. charantia</i> was assessed in alloxan-induced toxicity in 50 rats divided into five groups (A-E) (n=10). Group A normal control, Group B was toxicant group, and Group C animals received glibenclamide treatment while Groups D and E received extracts at 200 and 400 mg/kg doses, respectively. The experiment lasted for 28 days. Histopathological changes, blood glucose level, and serum enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase, oxidative status and caspase-9, and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Extract-treatment caused a decreased blood glucose level, markers of oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Treatment of rats with leaf extract of <i>M. charantia</i> resulted in increased levels and activities of protein thiols, non-protein thiols, glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase indicating its antioxidant potential. The liver section revealed mild distortion of the hepatic architecture compared to the toxicant group, while decreased expressions of caspase-9 and IL-1β in extract-treated groups was observed.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The plant extract exhibited antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory effects, thus showing its hepatoprotective property."
