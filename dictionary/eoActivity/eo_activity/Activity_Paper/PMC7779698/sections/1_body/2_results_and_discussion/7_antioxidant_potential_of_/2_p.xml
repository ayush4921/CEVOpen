<p id="p0140">For determining the antioxidant activity (AOA) of CCF extracts, various 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> analytical methods were employed to measure various oxidation products, i.e., measuring the decrease in absorbance of the sample containing DPPH free radical after being exposed to radical scavengers (DPPH radical scavenging activity); measuring the decrease in color intensity of ferrozine-Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> complex in presence of chelating agents (Ferrous ions and Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> chelating activity); measuring the conversion of Fe
 <sup>+3</sup> ions in ferric chloride to Fe
 <sup>+2</sup> ions (Reducing power activity) and measuring the color intensity of MDA-TBA complex (Inhibition of lipid peroxidation). The result of AOA of CCF extract as obtained by above mentioned methods is presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and showed concentration dependent AOAs irrespective of the method used suggesting that the flower possesses powerful antioxidant properties. The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>C. cristata</italic> flowers has been reported previously which clearly support our findings (
