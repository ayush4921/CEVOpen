<p id="p0125">The results for fatty acid composition, total saturated fat, monounsaturated fat and polyunsaturated fat of CCF are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and the chromatograms are presented in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. Linoleic acid (C18: 2c), a polyunsaturated omega 6- fatty acid, was the most predominant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) present in the flower sample (2.02g/100g) followed by α-linolenic acid (C18:3c). The fatty acids belonging to n-3 and n-6 series are reported to have beneficial health effects. Among monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), oleic acid (C18:1c, 0.89g/100g) was found in moderate amounts. The saturated fatty acid (SFA) fraction consisted mainly of palmitic acid (C16:0, 1.3g/100g). The results of fatty acid profiling of CCF are in accordance with those reported by other authors where, linoleic and palmitic acids predominated the PUFA and SFA fractions in edible flower sample (
