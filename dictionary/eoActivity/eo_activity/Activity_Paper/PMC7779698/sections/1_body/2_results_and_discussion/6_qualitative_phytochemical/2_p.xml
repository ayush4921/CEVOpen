<p id="p0135">Our investigation revealed the presence of various primary and secondary metabolites in the CCF and the results are provided in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. These bio-active components are proven anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial and anti-cancerous agents. Steroids, anthocyanins, anthraquinones and terpenoids were not found in the sample. The flower contained higher amounts of flavonoids and saponins. The results are in agreement with those reported previously (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2011</xref>). Earlier studies have reported that alkaloids, tannins, and phenolic compounds might be responsible for anthelmintic properties exhibited by plant extracts (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Suman et al., 2011</xref>), explaining its use as an anthelmintic. Flavonoids and saponins possess numerous health benefits like ability to scavenge free radicals, blood lipid modulation, reducing inflammation, thus supporting its use as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory agent and in reducing the risk of CVDs, The amount of total phenols in CCF extract was 47.29 mg GAE/g which was more than that stated in previous reports on the same flower (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Woo et al., 2011</xref>) as well as other edible flowers (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Rachkeeree et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings are in agreement with the authors who have reported almost same values for total phenolic content in aqueous and alcoholic extracts of
