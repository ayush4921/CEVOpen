<p id="p0145">The DPPH radical scavenging activity assay is an easy and accurate method for testing the anti-radical activity of a wide range of compounds in a relatively short time. The CCF extract exhibited dose- dependent DPPH radical scavenging ability. The overall percentages of DPPH scavenging activity ranged from 68.7% to 79.9% at different concentrations (100–1000 μg/ml). The ability of CCF extract to quench free radicals may be linked to presence of hydrogen- donating betalain compounds (
