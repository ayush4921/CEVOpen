<p id="p0055">A reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic method was adopted to analyze amino-acid content of fresh CCF. The sample was derivatized for volatility suitable for amino-acid analyzing using FMOC-Cl (9- fluorenylmethylchloroformate) as derivatization reagent and analyzed using Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC System (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) (

The sample was injected onto a C-18 column (4.6mm × 250 mmi.d., 5μm) equipped with a guard column of the same material (Merck). The column operated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using acetonitrile and water (90:10) as eluent A and sodium acetate (50mM) as eluent B.
