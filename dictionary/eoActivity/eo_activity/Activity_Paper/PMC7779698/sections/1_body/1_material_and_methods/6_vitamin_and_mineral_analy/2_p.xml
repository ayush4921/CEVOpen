 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">AOAC Method 967.21 (2007)</xref>. For determining the content of Vitamin B- complex, the sample preparation was done by adopting Ultrasonic assisted extraction method (UAE) which enhanced the extraction efficiency of B-complex vitamins. The prepared sample was analyzed for quantification of B- complex vitamins according to AACC Method 86–90.01 (1995), using UPLC coupled with Xevo TQD MS (Acquity, H- Class System, Waters Corporation, Massachusetts, United States). An Acquity UPLC BEH C-18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm i. d., 1.7μm) was used for chromatographic separation of B-complex vitamins. The Binary Eluent composed of acetonitrile and water containing 0.1% formic acid. For Vitamin A (retinol) and E (a-tocopherol) analysis, the methodology illustrated by 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Rizzolo and Polesello (1992)</xref> was adopted. The sample was saponified with 50% ethanolic KOH with the addition of pyragallol as antioxidant and refluxed for 1 h. After cooling tetrahydrofuran (THF) mixed with water (1:1) was added and the mixture was kept for 24hours at room temperature (27 °C). Separation and quantification were achieved by reversed phase HPLC- DAD (Agilent 1260 Infinity Diode Array Detector, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA) loaded with C-18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm i. d., 5μm). Methanol:Water (96:4) was used as a mobile phase. 20μl injection volume was used for determination and 1.5ml was transferred into the autosampler. The run length of the method was 14 min.
