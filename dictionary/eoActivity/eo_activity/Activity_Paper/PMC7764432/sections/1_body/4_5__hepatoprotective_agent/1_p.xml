Since liver injury may result in fatty liver, hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer, this is considered as a serious health concern. Accumulated studies have reported that herbal compounds possess numerous medicinal properties. Natural products and nutraceuticals have shown potent therapeutic activity in liver injuries caused by several toxicants and drugs [
