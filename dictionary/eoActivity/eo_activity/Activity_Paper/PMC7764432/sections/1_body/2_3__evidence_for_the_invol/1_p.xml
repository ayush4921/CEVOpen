<p>Early observational studies have shown the elevation in hepatic enzymes, including aspartate transferase, alanine transferase, and total bilirubin in COVID-19 patients [

In another study of 1099 patients from 552 hospitals, Guan and colleagues found elevated AST levels in 112 (18.2 percent) patients with non-serious disease and 56 (39.4 percent) patients with severe disease [

Correspondingly, Huang et al. recorded that the proportion of ICU patients with liver damage (61.5%) was higher than non-ICU patients (25.0%) (25.0%) [
