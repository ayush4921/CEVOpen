Moreover, several COVID-19 patients have experienced some type of liver injury, particularly those with serious or critical cases [

This prompted hepatologists to collaborate with other physicians, such as internal medicine and emergency departments, to protect the health status and avoid the adverse effects of COVID-19 in people with liver disease. Given the global burden of chronic liver disease, this pandemic could further worsen the treatment of patients at risk [
