<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a global crisis in public health. As noted in COVID-19 patients, liver injury is very common, caused by either direct or indirect damage to organs, including the overshooting inflammatory response. Importantly, the drug-induced liver injury should not be overlooked during coronavirus infection treatment and should be carefully studied. Ultimately, it is imperative to find alternative methods for hepatoprotection. This review provides information on the medicinal plants used for various hepatic disorders over several decades. It also highlights the pathways that these plant-based medicines can seek to reduce the burden of disease. The potential efficacy of these bioactive nutraceuticals should be explored in COVID-19 patients and at-risk populations.</p>
