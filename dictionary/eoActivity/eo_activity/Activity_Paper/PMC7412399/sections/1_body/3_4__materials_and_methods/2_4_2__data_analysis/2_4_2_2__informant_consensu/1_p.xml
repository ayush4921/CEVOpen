<p>The medicinal categories treated by gingers were compared using the Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) [

 </disp-formula> where Nur represents the number of use reports in a use category and Nt is the number of species with ethnomedicinal properties in that category. When ICF is equal to 1, it indicates that all informants agree on the use of the plant for a particular treatment. It also suggests that traditional knowledge has been exchanged among informants, or that the purpose of plant selection was well-defined. It may suggest the efficacy of the plant for the treatment. On the other hand, the lowest ICF value (equal to zero) suggests that informants do not agree on the use of a particular plant for the treatment, or that it is a randomly selected plant used as medicine.
