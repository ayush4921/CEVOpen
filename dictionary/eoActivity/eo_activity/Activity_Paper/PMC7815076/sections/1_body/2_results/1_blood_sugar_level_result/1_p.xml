<p>After IP administration of Alloxan monohydrate, the fasted blood glucose level except the NC group raised above 126 mg/dL in all experimentally induced diabetic groups. Only rats having fasted blood sugar level more than 126 mg/dL were considered diabetic. Blood sugar level at Day 0 significantly increased when compared with NC. Administration of 
 <italic>Moringa stenopetala</italic> (Baker f.) leaf aqueous extract to diabetic rats showed remarkable reduction in blood glucose concentration, there were significant (P&lt;0.05) differences on Day 21 and 28 when compared with DC . Moreover, treatment with both doses of MS extract to diabetic rats produced significant reduction in the blood glucose levels of rats when compared with diabetic control group as indicated in the following
