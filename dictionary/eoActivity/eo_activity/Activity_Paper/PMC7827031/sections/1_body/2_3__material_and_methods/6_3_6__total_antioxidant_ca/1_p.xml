<p>Briefly, samples of dry extracts or standard ascorbic acid, dissolved in MeOH/distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O (50:50), were combined with 3.0 mL of reagent solution (0.6 M sulfuric acid, 28 mM sodium phosphate and 4 mM ammonium molybdate) to achieve a series of eight final concentrations in the range of 12–450 μg/mL. The tubes were capped and incubated in a boiling water bath at 95 °C for 90 min. The samples were cooled to 22 °C and absorbance was measured at 695 nm against the blank using the cited UV-Visible spectrophotometer. From each series of measures, a sigmoidal curve was obtained by data interpolation and the EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of each sample was calculated as the concentration corresponding to 50% activity. The blank contained 3.0 mL of the reagent solution and 0.3 mL of MeOH/distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O (50:50), and it was incubated under the same conditions as the samples. Each analysis was carried out in triplicate and the mean ± SD (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) was calculated. The TAOC values were expressed as μg ascorbic acid equivalents/μg extract (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00264-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). They were calculated using the formula: EC
 <sub>50</sub> (μg/mL) ascorbic acid)/EC
 <sub>50</sub> (μg/mL) extract. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of ascorbic acid used in TAOC calculation was 26.12 ± 0.56 μg/mL.
