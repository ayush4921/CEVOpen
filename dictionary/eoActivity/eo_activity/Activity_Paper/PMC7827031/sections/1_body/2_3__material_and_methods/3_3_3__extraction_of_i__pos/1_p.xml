<p>Powdered aerial parts and rhizomes (200 g each) were separately soaked in hexane (800 mL) with occasional shaking in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min, then left in the same solvent for 5 h under continuous stirring at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was decanted and filtered. This procedure was repeated three times for each part. Defatted rhizomes and aerial parts were subsequently separately suspended in MeOH (800 mL) n an ultrasonic bath for 20 min and then left in the same solvent for 5 h under continuous stirring, at room temperature. The procedure was repeated three times for each vegetable part. The mixtures were then filtered, and the solvent removed under vacuum in a rotary evaporator to afford two crude residues: IPA (2.6 g) from aerial parts and IPR (5.5 g) from rhizomes.</p>
