<p>It is now generally accepted by scientists that excess oxidants and radicals, especially oxygen radicals, through damage and mutation of DNA and other biomolecules, play a major role in degenerative processes that may cause the insurgence and progression of inflammatory processes, cancer, cardiovascular and atherosclerotic diseases, neurodegeneration, and aging [

 <xref rid="B76-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Antioxidants isolated from natural sources could thus become important chemotherapeutic agents in defense mechanisms against these toxic agents. Therefore, with the aim to give some scientific evidence to the traditional use of 
 <italic>I. postii</italic> in the treatment of inflammations and in search of a new source of natural antioxidants, two simple tests were performed in vitro to determine the total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) of the crude extracts (see text) and the antiradical activity of the extracts and the isolated compounds. The TAOC values of the extracts were determined by the phosphomolybdate method (adjusted from references [

 <xref rid="B79-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]), using ascorbic acid as the standard. The assay was based on the reduction of hexavalent molybdenum Mo (VI) to the pentavalent form [Mo (V)] by an antioxidant, and the formation of a green phosphate/Mo (V) complex at acidic pH and at high temperature. The TAOC values were expressed as Âµg ascorbic acid equivalent/mg extract (

 <italic>n</italic>-butanol sub-extract of the methanolic extract of the rhizomes (IPRB) exhibited the highest total antioxidant activity. Moreover, comparing the TAOC of the IPA extract with that of the dichloromethane sub-extract (IPAD), it appears that highly antioxidant compounds, likely very polar, were not adequately extracted by CH
