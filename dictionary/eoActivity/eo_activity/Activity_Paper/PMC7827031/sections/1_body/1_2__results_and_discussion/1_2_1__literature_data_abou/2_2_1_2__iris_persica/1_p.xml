 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of air-dried flowers, leaves, rhizomes, and fresh bulbs were investigated by GC–FID and GC–MS; moreover, the oil antifungal activities were determined [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00264" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The major constituents of the flower essential oil were phenylethanol (24.8%) and furfural (13.8%). This aldehyde was also the main component of the leaf and rhizome volatile fractions, with percentages of 39.0% and 22.2%, respectively. Phenylacetaldehyde (37.1%) was the main constituent of the volatile fraction from the bulbs. The oils exhibited moderate antifungal activity in vitro against strains of the human pathogenic fungi 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Microsporum canis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes</italic>, the plant–fungal pathogen 
 <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic>, and the fungal food contaminant 
 <italic>Aspergillus carbonarius</italic>. The highest activity was exhibited by the essential oils isolated from leaves and flowers, so that they could be considered natural antimicrobial agents.
