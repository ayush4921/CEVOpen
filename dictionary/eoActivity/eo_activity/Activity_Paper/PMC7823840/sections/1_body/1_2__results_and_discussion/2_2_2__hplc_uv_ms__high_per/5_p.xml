<p>Similar results were obtained by HPLC/DAD/MS (High-performance liquid chromatography—Diode array detection—Mass Spectrophotometer) on ethanol extracts of wild chicory fresh leaves by Innocenti et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00064" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Other studies reveal that cichoric acid is the most abundant compound in chicory from the Chioggia region (0.33–0.61 mg cichoric acid/g d.w.) and from the Treviso region (1.40–1.53 mg cichoric acid/g d.w.) respectively, representing between 10–15% of the total polyphenols content [

 <italic>C. intybus</italic> with a range of concentrations between 0.87–6.14 mg/g dry plant [
