<p>About 200 mg of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> seed (POS) extract was added with 1 mL of 0.5% (w/v) hexamethylenetetramine, 20 mL acetone, and 2 mL of 25% HCl, hydrolyzed by refluxing the extract within 30 min. The mixture was filtered and collected. The residue was re-refluxed with 20 mL acetone for 30 min, filtered, and collected. Acetone was added to reach volume at 100 mL. About 20 mL filtrate was transferred into separating funnel, added with 201 mL water, and extracted three times with each 15 mL ethyl acetate. Ethyl acetate fraction was collected and added with another 50 mL ethyl acetate in a volumetric flask. The reference solution of quercetin was prepared by taking 10 mL of stock solution, added with glacial acetic acid to reach volume at 25 mL. The sample solution was prepared by taking 10 mL of stock solution, added with 1 mL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> and glacial acetic acid solution to reach volume at 25 mL (Baba and Malik 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Sembiring et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Quercetin and sample measurements were done 30 min after the addition of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> using a spectrophotometer at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 425 nm. Total flavonoid content was expressed as mg quercetin equivalent (QE) per 100 g dried sample.
