<p>About 25% of paracetamol is bound to plasma proteins and partly metabolized by liver microsome enzymes. Paracetamol can be conjugated with glucuronic acid in the liver. At therapeutic doses, 5–15% of paracetamol will be converted by cytochrome P450 to a highly reactive metabolite, 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-
 <italic>p</italic>-benzoquinonymin (NAPQI). NAPQI will be quickly detoxified by conjugation with cell glutathione (Ohba et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This reaction results in the formation of cysteine and mercapturic acid excreted in the urine. At the time of paracetamol intoxication, the amount and speed of NAPQI formation exceed the ability of the liver to replenish glutathione reserves. Glutathione depletion causes NAPQI to bind covalently to the cysteine group in proteins. The main target is the mitochondrial protein, which results in damage to ATP production. Mitochondrial dysfunction will also produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which results in oxidative stresses. These oxidative stresses cause hepatotoxicity (Moyer et al.
