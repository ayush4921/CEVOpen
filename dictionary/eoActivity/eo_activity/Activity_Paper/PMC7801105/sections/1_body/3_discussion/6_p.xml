<p>Serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) is a liver enzyme that helps produce protein. This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from aspartate to α-ketoglutarate to produce oxaloacetate and glutamate. In addition, this enzyme is also found in other organs such as the heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and kidney. The damage to one of these organs can cause an increase in the enzymes in the blood. Normal SGOT levels are in the range of 7–40 U/L. This enzyme also helps in detecting liver cell necrosis. However, it is considered to be a less specific marker for liver cell damage due to this enzyme can also describe abnormalities in the heart, skeletal muscles, brain, and kidneys (Lin et al.
