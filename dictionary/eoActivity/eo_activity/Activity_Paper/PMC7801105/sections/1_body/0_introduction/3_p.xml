<p>Bioactive constituents may serve as primary compounds for further development as hepatoprotective agents from toxic effects of paracetamol (Girish et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Antioxidant compounds such as tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, and polyphenols are known to improve liver function damaged by paracetamol (Abirami et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). The antioxidant compounds can reduce free radicals produced from the metabolism of paracetamol and prevent liver damage (Ramadan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Indonesia is widely available for the natural diversity of plants that can be used as raw material for herbal medicine (Antons and Antons-Sutanto

 <italic>Pandanus</italic> (Pandanaceae) can be found ranging from sandy beaches to the jungle plateau at an altitude of about 3500 m above sea level, and from secondary forests and meadows with shades of various soil from wet humus soil fertile, lime, peat bogs to the sandy soil where it is relatively dry and poor nutrient substances (Rachma et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). There are about 700 species in the genus 
 <italic>Pandanus</italic>, 16 species are found on Java island (Callmander et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Susanti et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Four types of 
 <italic>Pandanus</italic> were discovered in Ujung Kulon, Indonesia (Susanti et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Species of 
 <italic>Pandanus odoratissimus</italic> Linn. (Pandanaceae) is a type that has long been used by Indonesian people for a variety of purposes, ranging from spices to medicinal purposes (Raj et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Gurmeet and Amrita 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). 
 <italic>Pandanus</italic> sp. have been reported to contain tannic compounds that have high antioxidant activities derived from the flavonoid compounds such as catechin and kaempferol, which can be used to fight free radicals in the body and prevent the pathological changes of liver disease (Okaiyeto et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Thus, our study examined the hepatoprotective activity of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> in order to provide a scientific basis for the further usage of 
 <italic>P. odoratissimus</italic> to have liver health benefits.
