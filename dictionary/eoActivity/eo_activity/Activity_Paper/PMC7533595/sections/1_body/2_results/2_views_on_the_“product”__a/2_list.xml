  <p>The Dutch EUPATI course helps create an incentive for patient involvement in medicines development and policy in the Netherlands. “
   <italic>It is important to consult patients. For example, we need to know which outcomes are relevant: what do patients consider as relevant topics for research, what are the needs of patients? Patient representatives are therefore needed for experiential panels, for assessment of research projects”</italic>.

  <p>The Dutch EUPATI course will increase the relevance of medicinal products for patients.</p>
  <p>“
   <italic>In doing so, we could avoid the development of medicinal products that are not really interesting for patients. It is important to know patients' experiences with medicines: is it comfortable for patients to use them or do they experience it as an excessive burden? Do the medicinal products fit with patients' needs and preferences? Patient involvement is needed to accelerate and improve important solutions</italic>.

  <p>The Dutch EUPATI course increases the capacity of expert patient representatives available for patient involvement in medicines R&amp;D.</p>
  <p>
   <italic>The process of medicines development is quite complex. Patient representatives who are trained in this topic and who have knowledge of the process of medicine development are better equipped to provide good advice. EUPATI makes sure that patient representation is as professional as possible and that more patient representatives are trained. Usually the same patient representatives—often with a medical background—are involved in working groups. small patient groups can be better represented too</italic>.

  <p>The Dutch EUPATI course increases the “soft skills” of patient representatives.</p>
  <p>
   <italic>Trained patient representatives are better equipped and probably less intimidated by other professional experts in the world of medicinal products. That will let them represent the interests of patients more effectively. Patient representatives need to work together wisely with the pharmaceutical industry and soft skills (e.g., conversation skills) are needed in addition to knowledge. Patient representatives should be able to make sure that other parties see their interests and the interests of patients who cannot represent themselves</italic>.
