<p>The stakeholders addressed the various challenges for the network. One of the perceived challenges concerned transparency and openness of individual interests: “
 <italic>While some interests could oppose each other—for example those of the pharmaceutical industry vs. other stakeholders—stakeholders should explain their motives for joining the EUPATI network immediately and discuss how to deal with potential differences, with an open mind and willingness to understand divergent values</italic>.” In addition, due to the dense network of patient organizations in the Netherlands, one stakeholder warned against an “exclusive” and isolated network of expert patients and urged aiming for close relationships with the existing network of patient organizations. Finally, although some reservations about close relationships with the pharmaceutical industry were voiced, the stakeholders unanimously identified the industry as an essential partner for the Dutch EUPATI course. A public private partnership will need to be built by all stakeholders based on mutual trust and respect, with a well-thought through governance structure. The stakeholders identified the following conditions for collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry that should be made explicit in a written agreement: (1). any suggestion of being a “mouthpiece” of the pharmaceutical industry should be avoided; (2). only umbrella organizations of pharmaceutical companies should be involved in the steering group; (3). Existing codes of conducts should be followed when designing the public private partnership structure.
