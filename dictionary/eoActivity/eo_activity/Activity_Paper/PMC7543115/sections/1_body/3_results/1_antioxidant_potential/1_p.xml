<p>Antioxidants are molecules with reduction capacity for the substrates during oxidative processes. Oxidation reactions produces free radicals that competes with natural antioxidant defensive mechanism of the body causing impairment in the bodyâ€™s natural defense system leading to oxidative stress. Antioxidant potential of tested plants extract and urinile tablet has been determined through different antioxidant assays and the results are given in 
 <xref rid="table1-1559325820946934" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Variation in the concentration of total phenolics and flavonoids has been observed in different plants extract and urinile tablet. Total flavonoids and total phenolics contents were found increased in combined formulation than in individual plants extract. Urinile showed highest antioxidant potential indicating an increase in the antioxidant activity of polyherbal formulation compared to individual plants extract which is an indication of the synergistic effects of combined formulation. DPPH radical scavenging assay showed highest inhibition percentage of free radicals in urinile tablet in comparison with individual plants extract and is comparable with the scavenging potential of Vitamin C, a known antioxidant used as standard.
