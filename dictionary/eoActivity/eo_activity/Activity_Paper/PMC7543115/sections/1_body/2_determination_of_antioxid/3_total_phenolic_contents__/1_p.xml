 </sup> Gallic acid was used as the standard and standard curve was constructed using varying concentrations of gallic acid and the results were expressed as gallic acid equivalents. Plants extract (10 mg/mL) and standard solution (1 mL) were mixed with Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (5 mL) and Sodium carbonate (20%; 4 mL) incubating the mixture for 1 hour. The reaction absorbance was measured at 765 nm.
