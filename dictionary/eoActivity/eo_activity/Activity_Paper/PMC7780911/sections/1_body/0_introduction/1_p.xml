 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>). Currently, these biological medicinal products have no synthetic equivalents in cost-effectiveness for tissue repair and reconstruction (Zorzi and Miranda 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2012</xref>). The cell and tissue donation should always be based on a clinical evaluation, considering the risks versus the benefits and taking into account all available therapies for treatment selection (World Health Organization 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2006</xref>). Health service professionals involved in transplantation must take all the necessary measures during the evaluation of the donor in order to procure, store, process and distribute cells and tissues within levels of safety according to local regulations (World Health Organization 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2010</xref>). In addition, any institution involved in this process must implement a comprehensive quality management system, which must be carried out, monitored and constantly improved to ensure best safe practice methods and availability of donations for most needed therapies and research development (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM)
