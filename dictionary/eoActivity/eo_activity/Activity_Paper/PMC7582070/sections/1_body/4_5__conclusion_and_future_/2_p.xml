<p>More importantly, some issues still need to be taken into consideration; these include (1) the extraction method used for SFP preparation, which is currently exclusively hot-water extraction; (2) the lack of uniformity in raw materials and extraction and purification methods, implying SFP with differences in structure and biological activities; (3) the effects on human tissues that need to be studied, as 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell experiments cannot completely reflect the complexity of a real organism-level response; (4) unclear bioactive components which are responsible for each bioactivity; (5) the fact that the development of the physiological activity of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> extracts also presents its own limitations; therefore, future developments with respect to novel SFP extraction techniques (such as ultrasound, ultrahigh pressure, and multitechnology combination) are needed. Standard separation and purification methods also need to be established to obtain a homogeneous product, i.e., polysaccharides with high purity, high bioactivity, and high reproducibility. Moreover, in order to better determine the authenticity of 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> extracts on human health, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and clinical studies must be performed. Furthermore, in order to employ 
 <italic>S. fulvellum</italic> for a wider range of applications, we recommend prompt screening and isolation to develop novel functional compounds from this seaweed.
