<p>Antimicrobial and synergy tests were performed against three 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. strains: 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (AIDS6; fluconazole resistant clinical strain isolated from a HIV patient), 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> (FLU 43976; resistant to fluconazole), and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 24433; from American Type Culture Collections; sensitive to fluconazole). The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Fungicidal Concentration (MFC) of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> EO and fluconazole (positive control) were determined through microdilution method using 96-well microtiter plates [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], properly modified according our previous research [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Synergistic evidence of anti-
 <italic>Candida</italic> activity was checked through checkerboard test using EO and fluconazole at the same experimental conditions employed for MIC and MFC determination, as previously described. The synergistic activity was expressed as fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC
 <sub>index</sub>) and was calculated as follows, 
 <disp-formula>FIC
  <sub>index</sub> = FIC
  <sub>EO</sub> + FIC
  <sub>fluconazole</sub>
 </disp-formula> where FIC
 <sub>EO</sub> = MIC
 <sub>EO+fluconazole</sub>/MIC
 <sub>EO</sub>; FIC
 <sub>fluconazole</sub> = MIC
 <sub>fluconazole+EO</sub>/MIC
 <sub>fluconazole</sub>. FIC
 <sub>index</sub> values ≤ 0.5 mean the presence of synergistic effect, 0.5 &lt; values ≤ 2 mean additive or indifferent effect, values &gt; 2 mean antagonistic effect [
