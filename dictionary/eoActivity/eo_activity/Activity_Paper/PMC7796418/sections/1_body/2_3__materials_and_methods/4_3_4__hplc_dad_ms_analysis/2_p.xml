<p>The mass experiments were performed on a FinniganMAT LCQ (ThermoQuest Corp./FinniganMAT; San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer module, equipped with an ion trap mass analyzer and an ESI ion source electrospray, in negative ion mode. For ESI-MS and MS
 <sup>2</sup> experiments, the parameters were set as follows; the capillary voltage was 3.5 kV, the nebulizer (N
 <sub>2</sub>) pressure was 20 psi, the capillary temperature was 300 °C, the auxiliary gas (N
 <sub>2</sub>) flow was 9 L/min, and the skimmer voltage was 40 V. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion mode in the m/z range 100–1500. Standard commercial molecules of quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-rutinoside (rutin), caftaric, chlorogenic and rosmarinic acids were used to confirm the experimental data and to quantify these molecules in the extracts through the construction of calibration curves with solutions of concentrations from 1 to 50 μg/mL for rutin, 1 to 50 μg/mL for caftaric acid, 1 to 50 μg/mL for chlorogenic acid, and 10–350 μg/mL for rosmarinic acid. All standards were purchased by Extrasynthese (Cedex, France). The two dried extracts of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> were, respectively, solubilized in hydroalcoholic solution (ethanol 70%) at concentration of 4.0 mg/mL and in methanol at concentration of 2.5 mg/mL.
