<p>Before proceeding with the alcoholic extraction, the dried aerial parts of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> (350 g) were milled through a 2 mm sieving ring of a Variable Speed Rotor Mill (Fritsch, Idar- Oberstein, Germany). Afterwards, 50 g of powdered crude drug was added to 500 mL of methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy), while another 50 g to 350 mL of absolute ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy) and 150 mL of distilled water to obtain a 70% ethanolic solution. The extraction was performed by means of an ultrasonic bath (Branson Bransonic CPXH Digital Bath 3800F, Emerson, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 min at a temperature of 30 °C. The extracts were filtered and the methanolic solution were evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator (RV 10 digital, IKA
 <sup>®</sup>-Werke GmbH &amp; CO. KG, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany), while the ethanolic one was evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized to eliminate residual water. All the extractions were performed in triplicate and dried extracts stored at −20 °C. The EO content was calculated on a moisture-free basis as average.
