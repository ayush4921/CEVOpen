<p>The DPPH assay was performed following the method by Cheng et al. (2006) [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]: briefly, the DPPH solution was placed on a 96-well plate containing different concentration of extract or pure compounds for 30 min in the dark at room temperature, then the microplates were analyzed with a microplate reader (680XR, Bio Rad, Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and the absorbance was read in triplicate against a blank at 515 nm. The DPPH inhibition in percent was determined by the following formula: IDPPH% = [1 − (A1/A2)] × 100, where A1 was the DPPH absorbance with the extracts and A2 without extracts. Eight different concentrations (range: 20–0.16 μg/mL) of Trolox were prepared and used as positive control. The activity of the extracts was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub>, concentration providing 50% inhibition of the radical. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
