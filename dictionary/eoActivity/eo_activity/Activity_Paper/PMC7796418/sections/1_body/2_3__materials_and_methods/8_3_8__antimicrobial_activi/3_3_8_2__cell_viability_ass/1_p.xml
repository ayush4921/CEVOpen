<p>Cell viability was determined by MTT colorimetric assay [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] as reflected by the activity of succinate dehydrogenase. Briefly, cells were seeded at the density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well on a 96-well plate. After 24 h, cells were exposed to different concentrations of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> EO (1–500 µg/mL), 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> 70% ethanolic extract (10–200 µg/mL), 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> methanolic extract (10–200 µg/mL), eugenol and rosmarinic acid (1–100 µM) in a final volume of 200 µL of culture medium. Control culture was exposed to only vehicle (medium containing 2% FBS). After 24 h of incubation, 20 µL of MTT (5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) was added in each well and the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and replaced with 100 µL DMSO to dissolve the formazan crystals. The extent of MTT reduction was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm using a microplate reader (680XR, Bio Rad, Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).
