<p>EO, MeOH and 70% EtOH extracts of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> were subjected to the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-
 <italic>2H</italic>-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] for the evaluation of their cytotoxic effects on lung carcinoma (A549) during 24 h of exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00084-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The obtained data were compared with the values of the medium with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 0.1% (negative control), and doxorubicin was used as positive control (concentration range 0.1 to 20 μg/mL, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.92 ± 0.12 μg/mL).
