 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, the extraction yield (EO content) was 0.71 ± 0.01% and thirty-one compounds were identified corresponding to 97.1% of the total. The most abundant component (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00084-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was the monoterpene eugenol (43.6%), followed by 1,8-cineole (4.4%); among the sesquiterpenes, we detected β-caryophyllene (10.8%), β-elemene (8.1%), δ-elemene (4.2%), and bicyclogermacrene (2.9%), which is consistent with results reported by other authors [
