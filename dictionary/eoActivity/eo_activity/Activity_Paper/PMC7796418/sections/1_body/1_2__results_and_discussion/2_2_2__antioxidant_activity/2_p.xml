<p>As for the other extracts, the hydroalcoholic one exhibited a bioactivity close to the one of EO, while the methanolic displayed a weaker activity when compared to the previous. Both ethanolic and methanolic extract are rich in rosmarinic acid, showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values close to Trolox, confirming previously data of literature [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00084" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but the ethanolic one showed a slightly higher content of the other identified phenolic acids and flavonoids (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00084-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) than the methanolic extract. Probably, the reasons for the modest result of radical scavenger activity of the latter phytocomplex could also be attributed to this factor. However, the results confirmed very promising antioxidant properties for all extracts. The positive evaluation of the direct antioxidant activity through two techniques (DPPH and ABTS tests), the considerable presence of rosmarinic acid and eugenol (well known in the literature for their health potential), and the studies already underway to exploit the high antioxidant potential of the latter two molecules suggest that these results can be considered reliable to predict good future prospects for the use of
