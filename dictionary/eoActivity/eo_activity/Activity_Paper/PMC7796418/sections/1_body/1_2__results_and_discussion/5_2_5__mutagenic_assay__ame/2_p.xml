<p>All tested concentrations showed a number of treated/control colonies ratio less than 2, both in presence and in absence of S9 mix microsomal fraction (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00084-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Therefore, none of the texted extracts were considered potentially mutagenic. As regards the EO, a cytotoxic effect is noted at the highest concentrations. Our results pointed out the safety of 
 <italic>O. campechianum</italic> extracts and EO with regard to genotoxicity [
