<p>Photomicrographs of the cross‐sectional view of the rat stomach are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The normal architecture of gastric mucosa, submucosa, and muscular in G1 indicates regularity. The gastric epithelium is normal and intact. Gastric pits along with gastric glands also showed regularity. Small disruptions in the gastric epithelium layer were observed in gastric tissues of G2. Gastric pits increased in size and there was no regularity observed in them. Ulceration in the mucosal surface can also be seen along with congestion. Muscularis mucosa is not regular as well. The photomicrograph of rat stomach from group G3 depicts little congestion in the mucosal and muscular mucosal surface. However, gastric pits and gastric glands are normal and regular. Muscularis mucosa is also regular in a pattern. The microscopical view of tissues from G4 exhibited no sloughing and the epithelial layer remained undamaged. A small increase in gastric pits was observed. Gastric glands remained normal. Muscularis mucosa and gastric epithelium were also normal and regular, some infiltration of cells observed in the mucosa. The gastric mucosal layer remained undamaged with minor pathological modification or sloughing in gastric tissues of G5
 <sub>.</sub> Gastric pits are normal and regular, gastric glands show normal arrangement. The mucosal and submucosal surface is normal some congestion is also seen.
