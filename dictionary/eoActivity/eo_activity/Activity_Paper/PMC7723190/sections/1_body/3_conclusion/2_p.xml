<p>The biochemical and histopathological explorations indicate that okra 
 <italic>A. esculentus</italic> has gastroprotective potential against aspirin‐induced acute gastric lesions due to the presence of bioactive components. Okra helped in reducing congestion, irregularity in the muscular layer, increased gastric pits size, gastric ulcer area, ulcer scores, and ulcer area. Okra extract dose of 500 mg/Kg of body weight showed better results than 250 mg/Kg of body weight. Reduction in gastric ulcer by 500 mg/Kg of body weight was comparable to the drug omeprazole. However, more advanced research is required to highlight the fundamental mechanism of the gastroprotective potential of okra, to get more advantageous and fruitful outcomes in this respect.
