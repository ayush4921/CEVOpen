<p>The use of high-pressure homogenization to load the 
 <italic>Saccocalyx satureioides</italic> Coss. et Durieu hydrodistilled oil in nanosystems has affected the volatile composition of the oil and its nanoemulsions and led to a difference in tested biological activities. It has a positive effect on antioxidant and anticancer activities, which makes this technique applicable and useful in several areas, such as pharmaceuticals, cancer treatment, and food biopreservation. The oxygenated terpenes were affected dramatically by such homogenization techniques, while an inverse relationship has been observed among different compounds.
