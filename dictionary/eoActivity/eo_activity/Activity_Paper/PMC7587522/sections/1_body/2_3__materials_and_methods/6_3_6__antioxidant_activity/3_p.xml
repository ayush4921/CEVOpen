<p>The ABTS free radical–scavenging assay: The antioxidant activity of the HD oil and its nanoemulsion was determined by their ability to decolorize the radical cation (ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>) as previously detailed [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04756" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The method comprises the addition of 180 μL of ABTS solution to 20 μL of sample solution in methanol at different concentrations. After 10 min, the percentage inhibition at 734 nm was calculated for each concentration relative to a blank absorbance (methanol). The scavenging capability of ABTS was calculated using the following equation:
