<p id="Par42">Medicinal plants 
 <italic>A. sieberi</italic>, 
 <italic>B. persicum</italic> and 
 <italic>R. pallasii</italic> play important role in ecosystem sustainability due to having the highest ecological value. Overexploitation of these species may endanger supplying other medicinal plants, because loss of important ecological species can consecutively destruct the ecosystem balances and influence the dynamics and structure of populations or even drive other species to extinction
