<p>The mobile phase consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B). The gradient was 5% to 100% B in 30 min, followed by washing with 100% B for 10 min. The flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. Fractions of 1 min each were collected from minute 1 to minute 40, resulting in 40 microfractions in total. Microfractions of two successive injections of a given sample were collected into the corresponding wells of a 96-deepwell plate. Plates were then dried in a Genevac EZ-2 evaporator (
