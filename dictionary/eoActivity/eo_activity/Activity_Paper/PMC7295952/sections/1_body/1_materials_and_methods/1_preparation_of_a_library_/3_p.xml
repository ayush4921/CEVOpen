<p>Dried plant material was milled to coarse powder in a hammer mill. 100-500 g of powdered material was extracted for 24 h with 500 ml of 70% ethanol in a magnetic rod stirrer. Extracts were filtered through Whatman no. 1 filter paper and concentrated by solvent removal in a rotary vacuum evaporator. Crude extracts were suspended in water and partitioned consecutively with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. Crude extracts and their respective fractions were allowed to dry at room temperature, weighed, and reconstituted in DMSO (10 mg/ml) to serve as stock solutions for antiparasitic testing. This resulted in a library of 235 samples.</p>
