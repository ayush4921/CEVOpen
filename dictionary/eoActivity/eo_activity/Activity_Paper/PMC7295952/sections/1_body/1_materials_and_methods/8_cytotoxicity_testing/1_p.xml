<p>L6 rat skeletal myoblast cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1.7 µM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine. The cells were allowed to attach overnight, then test compounds were added. After 72 h of incubation, 10 µl of resazurin solution (see above) was added, and the plates were incubated for an additional 2 h. Plates were read in a fluorescence scanner at 536 nm excitation and 588 nm emission wavelength. Podophyllotoxin was used as reference. All assays were performed in two independent replicates at least.
