<p id="p0105">GC polysaccharides displayed excellent antimicrobial activity on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> relative to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.06 and 0.56 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. GC polysaccharides reportedly disrupted the inner membrane of the pathogens tested. The GC polysaccharides also displayed strong dose-dependent behavior in all antioxidant evaluates relative to the normal antioxidant, and exceptional performance for scavenging of ROS could be attributable to the large volume of hydrophilic phytochemicals. Moreover, higher anti-mutagenic effects of GC polysaccharides of both cervical and hepatic carcinoma cell lines were observes. The present findings suggest that GC polysaccharides may be investigated as a likely antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-mutagenic agent in the drug and food industries. Additional studies are desirable to investigate the clinical effects of such findings. Consequently, the present results provide a scientific basis for the use of plant extracts in home-made remedies and their possible use in microbial-induced disease care. Further studies may result in their use as natural alternatives to synthetic antimicrobial and cytotoxic. Over the last decade, there has been incredible attention in developing the anti-cancer drugs from polysaccharides. Some in vitro studies seem to be helpful, but 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies need to be performed to validate these outcomes. More effective and economical methods to the modification and preparation of polysaccharides remain major challenges and therefore an important field of research is yet to come.
