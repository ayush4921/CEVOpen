<p id="p0065">Cancer cell lines of human cervical (HeLa, ATCC, Rockville, USA) were maintained in a culture flask in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in biological oxygen demand (BOD) incubator with 95% of O
 <sub>2</sub> and 5% of CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline- Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (PBS-EDTA) (1x), trypsinised with (trypsin 0.25%), neutralization was carried out with DMEM. Cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was taken out and remaining pellet was suspended in DMEM for cell culturing. Viability of cells was measured by MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) dye. In 96-well plates (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) cells/ml in each well were transferred and were incubated overnight. The cells were treated with different concentrations (250 and 500 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of GC polysaccharides for 48 h, and MTT (5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was added, and incubated for 4 h. The medium was aspirated and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were added to solubilize the crystals. The optical density (OD) of purple formazan was measured after 5 min of color development by Bio-Rad 680 model colorimeter at 570 nm (

Hepatoprotective activity (in vitro) of GC polysaccharides was evaluated against the liver damage induced by D-GalN in HepG2 cells (ATCC, Rockville, USA). The cells were placed at a density of (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>) cells/well in a 96 well plate supplemented with 100 µl of MEM medium with 10% of FBS in each well. HepG2 cells along with (D-GalN (50 mmol) were treated with different GC polysaccharide extract concentration (250 and 500 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) for 8 h and the cell viability was assessed by MTT assay (

 <sup>−1</sup>) was used as the reference standard. The percentage protection was measured to quantify the cell viability assay.
