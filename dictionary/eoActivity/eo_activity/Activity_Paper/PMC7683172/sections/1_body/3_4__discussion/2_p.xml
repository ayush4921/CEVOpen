<p>The level of parasitemia is reduced in a dose-dependent manner which is an indicator of the antiplasmodial activity of the plant. According to Adugna et al. [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Trigg and Kondrachine [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], an extract is consider effective if it can have more than 30% suppression of the parasitemia as compare to the control group, which is in agreement with this study findings. This study demonstrates that 
 <italic>E. cylindricum</italic> ethyl acetate extract has very high and dose-dependent chemosuppression. The same observations were made by LÃ©a et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] whereby extracts of 
 <italic>Guiera senegalensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Bauhinia rufescens</italic> leaves produced a significant reduction of parasitemia.
