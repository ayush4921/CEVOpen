<p>The curative activity was evaluated using Ryley and Peter's method [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the first day, 30 mice (male and female) were infected intravenously with 1x10
 <sup>7</sup>
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> parasitized erythrocytes. Chloroquine (5 mg) (n =6) and 10% Hypromelose (n =6) were used as positive and negative control, respectively. The third group (n =6) received 500 mg/kg of crude extract. The 4
 <sup>th</sup> group (n =6) was non-infected and non-treated and was considered as the neutral control group. The mice were treated once daily for 7 days and the parasitemia monitor by the May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining technique after 72 h of infection. The mean survival time was determined as in the suppressive test for 30 d (D0–D29). The mean reduction rate was calculated as: % reduction =100 × [(C – T)/C], Where T and C represent the average parasitemia of the treated and control group.
