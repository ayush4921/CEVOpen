<p id="p0015">Because of its diverse physiographic and climatic conditions, Ethiopia is endowed with enormous plant diversity of which some, especially spices, are used for food and/or medicinal value. In Ethiopia, spices are either cultivated or collected from the wild for daily use as food or remedy for human ailments. In Ethiopia, Koseret (
 <italic>Lippia adoensis</italic> [Otto &amp; A. Dietr] Cufod. Verbenaceae), Tikurazmud (
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> L., Ranunculaceae), Timiz (
 <italic>Piper capense</italic> L.f., Piperaceae), Tosign (
 <italic>Thymus schimperi</italic> L., Lamiaceae) and Netchazmud (
 <italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic> (L.) Sprague ex Turrill, Apiaceae) are the well-known spices used for the preparation of several foods and beverages. Several ethnobotanical studies (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Tefera and Kim, 2019</xref>) conducted in Ethiopia showed that these plants are also used in traditional medicine in different parts of the country. Aqueous and ethanol extracts from leaves of

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Debell et al., 2005</xref>). The antioxidant properties in tandem with terpenoid contents of the essential oil of some of these spices have been reported by some researchers (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Debebe et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Simur, 2018</xref>). However, antioxidant properties of these spices were not comparatively investigated from a standpoint of their phenolic contents. Thus, the aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the phenolic contents of aqueous and methanolic extracts of these spices and correlate with their antioxidant potentials.
