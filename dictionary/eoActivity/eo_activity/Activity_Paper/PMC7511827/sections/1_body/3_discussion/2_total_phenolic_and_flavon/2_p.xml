<p id="p0095">In the view of the up surging interest in the health benefits of the spices, we examined the radical scavenging and antioxidant properties of the most commonly consumed spices in Ethiopia by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> standard methods. Prior to antioxidant activity assays, we analyzed the amount of total phenolics and total flavonoids contents in methanolic and aqueous extracts of the spices. Here, our interest was not to detect/quantify the complete phenolics profile and single out potent antioxidant compound(s), but gross quantification of phenolics that often are reported to have antioxidant property (

Results of chemical analysis showed that total phenolics and flavonoids contents varied between the tested spices' extracts obtained using the same extraction solvent, suggesting the presence of varied amount of extractable phenolic compounds by the solvent used. Most probably, variation in total phenolic contents of these spices is attributed to their difference in genetic makeup (
