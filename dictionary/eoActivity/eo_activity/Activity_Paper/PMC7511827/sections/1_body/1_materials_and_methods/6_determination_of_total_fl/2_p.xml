<p id="p0040">The total flavonoid content in the methanol and aqueous extracts of the spices was determined by aluminum chloride colorimetric method based on the method indicated by 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ordonez et al. (2006)</xref>. Briefly, a volume of 0.5 mL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>ethanol solution (2%) was added to 0.5 mL of extract. After one hour incubation at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 420 nm using UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The analysis was performed in triplicate. The total flavonoid content was estimated from a quercetin standard curve and the results are expressed as mg quercetin equivalents (mg QE/100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> Extract DW; r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9675).
