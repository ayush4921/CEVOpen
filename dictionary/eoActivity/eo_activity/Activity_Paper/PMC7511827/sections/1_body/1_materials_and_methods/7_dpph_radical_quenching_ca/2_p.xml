<p id="p0045">The determination of DPPH stable radical scavenging activities of the extracts and standards were evaluated based on the method described by 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al. (2002)</xref>. Extracts (1mL) of the different concentrations (i.e., 10–1000 μg/mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) made by reconstituting in respective solvents were added to DPPH solution (5 mL, 0.1 mM) in methanol and vortexed. After 20 min of reaction at 25 °C, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm against a blank (methanol) in a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2401PC). Methanolic DPPH solution (5 ml) without antioxidant was used as control. The DPPH scavenging activity of the extract was expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (inhibitory concentration), that is, the concentration of the extract at which DPPH radicals were quenched by 50%. Ascorbic acid and Butyl Hydroxy Toluene (BHT) were used as standard antioxidants.
