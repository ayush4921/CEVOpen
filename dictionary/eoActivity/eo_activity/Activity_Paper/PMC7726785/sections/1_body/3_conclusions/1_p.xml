<p>Using biological materials as antimicrobial agents is a promising approach. ME and SE showed good activities against different microbes, from which 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was the most affected. Morphologic changes and cell elongation were detected for microbes treated with ME and SE when compared with untreated controls that might be related to the increase in membrane permeability and the accumulation of fluids or influx of the plant extract inside the cell.
