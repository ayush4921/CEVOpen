<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a microdilution method in NB by addition of 0.2 mL of a microbial strain at a concentration of 1.5 Ã— 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL bacteria to 10 mL of NB, individually. Aqueous extracts at different concentrations were added to bacterial strains, and incubation for 24 h was allowed. After incubation, the MIC was assessed by examining the turbidity of bacterial growth. The lowest concentration that killed the test microbes completely was considered to be the MIC.
