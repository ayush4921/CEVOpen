<p>Pathogenic microbes that infect humans (
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>) were isolated from patients. Isolates were suspended in 0.85% saline to produce a turbidity identical in number to the 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard. Incubation at 37 °C for 24 h was undertaken for prepared cultures after dilution to 1:10 to obtain a density of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL culture. Preparation of microbial cultures was undertaken at the Department of Biology, College of Science, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
