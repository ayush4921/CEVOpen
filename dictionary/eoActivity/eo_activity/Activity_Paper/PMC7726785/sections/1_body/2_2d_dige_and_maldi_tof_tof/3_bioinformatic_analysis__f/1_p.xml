<p>Bioinformatic analysis using STRING v11.0 provided the interaction network of the differently expressed proteins (
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>
 </xref>). The protein analysis through evolutionary relationships (PANTHER) system was used for the classification of identified proteins according to their molecular function (
 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>
 </xref>A) and location (
 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 
  <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>
 </xref>B). The functional category showed that most of the differentially expressed proteins identified were transcriptional regulatory proteins (52%), followed by binding proteins (33%). Also, 85% of the identified proteins were located in the cytoplasm.
