<p>The expression of five ribosomal proteins was increased: elongation factor G, T1, and S1; S7 from the ribosomal small subunit; and RNA polymerase-binding transcription factor DksA. Conversely, the expression of 50S ribosomal protein L10 and elongation factor Tu 2 was downregulated in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME. The expression of some 30S and 50S ribosomal proteins besides elongation factor G and DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit alpha was downregulated, suggesting suppression of protein synthesis as a response to SE. The expression of protein L7/L12 from 50 ribosomal proteins has been shown to be downregulated in bacteria treated with the antimicrobial agent Ag-MNP.
