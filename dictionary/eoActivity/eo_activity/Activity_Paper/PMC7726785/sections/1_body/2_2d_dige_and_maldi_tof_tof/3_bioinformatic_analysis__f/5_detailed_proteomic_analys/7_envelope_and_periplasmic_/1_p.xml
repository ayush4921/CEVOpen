<p>Outer-membrane proteins are important for the integrity of bacterial membranes. This is achieved via their connection with cell-wall peptidoglycans as well as their role in cell conjugation.

 </sup> The expression of outer-membrane porins F and W as well as the putative outer-membrane porin protein NmpC was upregulated in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> treated with ME (
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="other">6</xref>
 </xref>). This upregulation suggested their role in defense mechanisms, and such a response has also been observed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> responding to the antibiotic tetracycline.

 </sup> However, Lok 
 <italic>et al.</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>) speculated that an increase in expression of the precursor of the envelope protein leads to weakening of the outer membrane of the cell and results in cell death as a response to the stress caused by the antimicrobial agents AgNPs. The expression of all outer-membrane porins was downregulated in SE-treated 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. An identical trend was recorded by Leung 
 <italic>et al.</italic>(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>) when 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was treated by antimicrobial MgO NPs, suggesting that downregulation of the expression of outer-membrane components is an indication of cell-membrane instability. The expression of membrane-related proteins could be a response to the adherence of biomolecules in extracts to the cell surface before entering the cell. Therefore, we might comment that bacterial cells are affected inside and outside the cell membrane. Some unknown proteins were detected (
