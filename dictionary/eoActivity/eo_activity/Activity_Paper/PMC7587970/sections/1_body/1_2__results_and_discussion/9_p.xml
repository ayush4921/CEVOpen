<p>All of the new compounds had their inhibitory activities tested against NO production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW264.7 cells. Their cell viabilities were firstly examined by the CCK-8 method. As compounds 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> showed strong cytotoxic effects against RAW 264.7 cells at the concentration of 60 μM, they would not be conducted, following anti-inflammation evaluation. Except compounds 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold>, other tested compounds showed NO inhibition lower than 60 μM. The results indicated that compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibited significant inhibitory activities against NO production in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values at 33.0 and 25.4 μM, compared to that of positive control dexamethasone (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.35 μM).
