<p>In addition, the cyclooxygenase (COX-2) inhibitory activities of these new compounds were evaluated using the in vitro assay kit [

 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> showed COX-2 inhibitory activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values at 30.1 and 42.3 μM, compared to that of positive control naproxen (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.2 μM).
