<p>With the exception of the 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic> preparation, the decoctions were also potent inhibitors of HeLa cell proliferation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>) and were generally more potent inhibitors against this cell line than against Caco2. As for Caco2 proliferation, the 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was the most potent inhibitor of HeLa cell proliferation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Indeed, the 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction blocked 100% of the HeLa proliferation during the screening experiment, and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 85 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was calculated when the decoction was tested across a range of concentrations. The 
 <italic>C. equisetifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta</italic>, and 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic> decoctions were also strong inhibitors of HeLa cell growth, inhibiting proliferation by 60–90% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>). Furthermore, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against HeLa of 450, 588, and 126 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL were calculated for these decoctions, respectively.
