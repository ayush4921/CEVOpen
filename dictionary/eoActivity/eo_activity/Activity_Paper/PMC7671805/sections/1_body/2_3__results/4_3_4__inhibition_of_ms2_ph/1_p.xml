<p>Whilst MS2 phage is not infective in humans, it has previously been used as a safe and rapid test for antiviral activity against other human-infective RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, the MS2 phage plaque reduction assay may indicate inhibitory activity against gastrointestinal viral pathogens such as 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic>. It was therefore used in this study as a preliminary screen for potential gastrointestinal antiviral activity. Four of the decoctions tested in this study displayed strong antiviral activity in this bioassay. The 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was a particularly good inhibitor of MS2 reproduction, inhibiting MS2 phage production by approximately 98%. This is noteworthy and is substantially more potent than the 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> positive control (∼90% inhibition). The 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was also tested across a range of concentrations and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 427 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was determined, indicating strong antiviral activity. The 
 <italic>B. obovata, E. tetrodonta</italic>, and 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic> decoctions were also good inhibitors of MS2 phage replication, inhibiting viral replication by 60–80%. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values determined for these decoctions (2283, 1140, and 2950 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively) (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) also indicate noteworthy activity. In contrast, the 
 <italic>C. equisetifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>P. careya</italic> decoctions were completely devoid of anti-MS2 phage activity.
