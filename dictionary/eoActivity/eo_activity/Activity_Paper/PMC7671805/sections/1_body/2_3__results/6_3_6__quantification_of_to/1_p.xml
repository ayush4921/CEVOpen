<p>All extracts were initially screened at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL in the 
 <italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii lethality bioassay as LC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt;1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL have previously been defined as nontoxic [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Potassium dichromate was also included in the bioassay at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL as a positive control. Potassium dichromate was rapid in its induction of mortality, with significant mortality noted by 4 hours of exposure (unpublished results). The decoctions were substantially slower at inducing mortality, with ≥12 hours needed for mortality induction to become evident. Furthermore, except for the 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta</italic> decoction, the traditional medicines did not induce 
 <italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii mortality significantly different to that of the artificial seawater control following 24 h exposure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, substantial mortality was evident when nauplii were exposed to the 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta</italic> decoction. As LC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt;1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL have previously been defined as being nontoxic [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], only the 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta</italic> decoction displayed apparent toxicity. Interestingly, the observed mortality substantially increased compared to that of the negative control for all decoctions except the 
 <italic>V. vexillata</italic> decoction following 48 h exposure. As only the 
 <italic>E. tetrodonta</italic> decoction induced significant mortality at 24 h, only this extract was further evaluated across a range of concentrations, and LC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Notably, LC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1654 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was determined for this decoction, and it was therefore also deemed to be nontoxic. All decoctions were also screened for toxicity in an HDF cell viability assay. Exposure of the HDF to all decoctions resulted in &gt;50% cell viability at 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, thus confirming that all decoctions were nontoxic.
