<p>Identification of the specific components responsible for the antimicrobial activity reported in the plant decoctions tested herein was beyond the scope of our study, although all decoctions were abundant in phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins. Many studies have reported potent growth inhibitory activities for a wide variety of flavonoids against extensive bacterial panels [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Similarly, several tannin compounds have bacterial growth inhibitory activity. Gallotannins have been reported to inhibit the growth of a broad spectrum of bacterial species [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] through a variety of mechanisms including binding cell surface molecules including lipoteichoic acid and proline-rich cell surface proteins [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and by inhibiting glucosyltransferase enzymes [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Ellagitannins are also highly potent inhibitors of bacterial growth, with MIC values as low as 63 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Ellagitannins have also been reported to function via several antibiotic mechanisms including interaction with cytoplasmic oxidoreductases and by disrupting bacterial cell walls [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Thus, it is likely that multiple compounds within the tested decoctions contribute to the antimicrobial properties of these extracts.
