<p>Groote Eylandt is the largest island in the Gulf of Carpentaria and lies approximately 50â€‰km off the coast of mainland Australia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). It is within the Arnhem Land region of Australia and experiences tropical weather conditions for the entire year. Despite its proximity to the mainland and the close relationship of the Warnindhilyagwa people with the Nunggubuyu people on the mainland, the Warnindhilyagwa tribe have retained their own unique identity and much of their traditional knowledge.
