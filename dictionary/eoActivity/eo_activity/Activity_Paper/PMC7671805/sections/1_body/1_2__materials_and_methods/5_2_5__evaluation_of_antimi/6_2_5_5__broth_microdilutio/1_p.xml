<p>The MICs of the extracts were evaluated by standard broth microdilution methods [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, overnight bacterial cultures were added dropwise to fresh nutrient broth, and the turbidity was visually adjusted to produce a McFarland number 1 standard culture. This was subsequently diluted 1 in 50 with nutrient broth, resulting in the MIC assay inoculum culture. A volume of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L sterile broth was added to all wells of a 96-well plate. Test extracts or control antibiotics (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were then added to the top row of each plate, and doubling dilutions were prepared in each column of wells by transferring 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L from the top well to the next well in each column, etc. A growth control (without the extract) and a sterile control (without the inoculum) were included on each plate. A volume of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of respective bacterial culture was added to all wells except the sterile control wells and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. 
 <italic>p</italic>-Iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Australia, and dissolved in sterile deionised water to prepare a 0.2 mg/mL INT solution. A 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L volume of this solution was added into all wells, and the plates were incubated for further 6 h at 37°C. Following incubation, the MIC was visually determined as the lowest dose at which colour development was inhibited.
