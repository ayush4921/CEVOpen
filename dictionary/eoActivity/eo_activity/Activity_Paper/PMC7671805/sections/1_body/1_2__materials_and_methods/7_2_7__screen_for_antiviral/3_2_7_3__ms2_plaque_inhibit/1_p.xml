<p>The MS2 bacteriophage plaque reduction assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, 490 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each plant extract dilution was inoculated with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of MS2 virus (containing approximately 10
 <sup>10</sup> plaque-forming units/mL) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The solution was added to 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The mixture was subsequently added to 3 mL soft-agar overlay and poured over premade agar plates (2.8% w/v nutrient agar). Once set, the plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. The following day, the number of plaques was counted and expressed as the % untreated control. Extract dilutions were tested, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined by linear regression. Nutrient broth was used as a negative control, whilst a 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> water extract and UV irradiation (microwave of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L for 4 × 30 sec) were used as positive controls.
