<p>Toxicity was tested using a modified 
 <italic>A. franciscana</italic> nauplii lethality assay [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of seawater containing approximately 52 (mean 51.8 
 <italic>n</italic> = 125, SD 11.2) 
 <italic>A. franciscana</italic> nauplii was added to wells of a 48-well plate and immediately used for bioassay. A volume of 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of diluted plant extracts or the reference toxin (1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL potassium dichromate) was transferred to the wells and incubated at 25 ± 1°C under artificial light (1000 lux). A negative control (400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L seawater) was included on each plate. All treatments and controls were performed three times (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9). The wells were checked at regular intervals, and the number of dead was counted. After 24 h, all nauplii were sacrificed and counted to determine the total % mortality per well. LC
 <sub>50</sub> with 95% confidence limits for each treatment was calculated using probit analysis.
