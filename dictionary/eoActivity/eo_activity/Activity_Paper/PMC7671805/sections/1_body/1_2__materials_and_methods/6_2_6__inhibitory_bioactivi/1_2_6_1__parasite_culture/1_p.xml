<p>The 
 <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> S-2 (sheep strain 2) trophozoite strain used in this study was a gift from Professor Ann McDonnell, Griffith University, Australia. The trophozoites were maintained and subcultured anaerobically at 37°C in TYI-S-33 growth media supplemented with 1% bovine bile (Sigma), 10% Serum Supreme (Cambrex Bioproducts), and 200 IU/mL penicillin/200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, USA). Confluent mid-log phase cultures were passaged every 2 days by chilling the cultures on ice for a minimum of 10 min followed by vortexing to dislodge the adherent trophozoites from the walls of the culture vessel. Fresh culture media (5 mL) were seeded with approximately 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> trophozoites for each passage.
