<p>We followed the methods of Rabadeaux et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of the plant extracts. Briefly, 70 
 <italic>μ</italic>L aliquots of the individual carcinoma cell suspensions were aspirated into the wells of a 96-well plate. 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the plant extract dilutions or controls was added to individual wells, and the plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cisplatin (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, Australia) was used as a positive control, and fresh media were included as a negative control. Following 12-hour incubation, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution (Promega, Australia) was added to each well. The absorbance was recorded at 490 nm as a measure of cellular proliferation following further 3 h incubation at 37°C. The antiproliferative activity of each test was recorded as a percentage of the negative control.
