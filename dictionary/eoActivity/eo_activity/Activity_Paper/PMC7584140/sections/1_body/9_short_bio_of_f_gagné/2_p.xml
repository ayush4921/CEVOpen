<p>François Gagné is a Senior biochemical toxicologist at Environment and Climate Change Canada since 1994. He received his academic training in biochemistry and toxicology and earned his PhD (1996) in environmental toxicology at the University of Metz in France. He has published more than 250 papers (Scopus h index 46) in the area of biochemical ecotoxicology in international scientific journals, a book chapter and recently produced a book of methods in biochemical ecotoxicology (Elsevier Inc.). He is an associated professor at the Marine Science Institute at the University of Québec at Rimouski. His research interests reside in the area of toxicity of substances of emerging interest and the development of new approaches for risk assessment for new and exotic chemicals in the context of global warming. The use of non-linear approaches to study the oscillatory behavior and the fractal behavior of molecular changes in cells exposed to ultrafine plastic nanoparticles or other space-altering xenobiotics is currently of interest.</p>
