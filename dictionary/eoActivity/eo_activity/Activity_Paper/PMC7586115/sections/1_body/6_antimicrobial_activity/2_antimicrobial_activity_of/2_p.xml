 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Peixoto Neto et al. (2002)</xref> reported the antimicrobial activity of methanol extract of the roots of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic>. The extract displayed high antimicrobial activity against six different strains of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> displaying inhibition areas between 10 and 18 mm even against resistant strains. Different solvent extracts and alkaloid fraction of different parts of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity by 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Baldȇ et al. (2015)</xref>. Crude alkaloidal fraction was significant against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, moderate against 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Candidas albican, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Gardnerella vaginalis</italic> and weak against 
 <italic>Streptococcus viridans.</italic> Furthermore, crude fraction of the alkaloids displayed the highest cytotoxicity (6–25 μg/ml) among the tested extracts against 
 <italic>herpes, poliomyelitis</italic> and 
 <italic>semliki</italic> forest viruses (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Baldé et al., 2015</xref>). Different solvent extracts of 
 <italic>B. veriticillata</italic> leaves were assessed for their antidermatophytic and antidrug resistant pathogens by some authors. The extracts were tested to identify various secondary metabolites present and were evaluated against some gram-positive organisms (
 <italic>B. subtilis, S. aureus</italic>), gram-negative organisms (
 <italic>Escherichia. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>) and dermatophytic infections are caused by some fungi i.e. 
 <italic>Epidermophyton flocossum, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes</italic>. The study shows that the plant possesses activity against dermatophytic and drug resistant pathogens and also significant antimicrobial activity (
