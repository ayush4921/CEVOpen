<p id="p0100">Both alcoholic and ethyl acetate fractions of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> were evaluated for antinociceptive activity employing 
 <italic>in silico</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. The i
 <italic>n-vivo</italic> studies includes the paw edema test, tail flick test, writhing test, formalin test. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assessment were carried out on Wistar rats and Swiss mice. Ursolic acid (
 <bold>21</bold>) was the compound with best effect among the nine compounds identified. The study concluded that antinociceptive effect of 
 <italic>B. verticillata</italic> might be because of the secondary actions which include the contribution of anti-inflammatory constituents. Ursolic acid (
 <bold>21</bold>) is the major bioactive constituent and may be the favourable basis of COX-2 inhibitors and NMDA receptor antagonists (
