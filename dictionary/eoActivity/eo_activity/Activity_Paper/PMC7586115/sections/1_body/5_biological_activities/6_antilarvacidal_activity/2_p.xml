<p id="p0115">The antilarvacidal effect of solvent-derived extracts of 
 <italic>Borreria verticillata</italic> (Linnaeus) on 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (Say) was investigated. The bioassay of the extracts on late third larval instars of 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> was investigated in the laboratory employing 2, 4, 6 and 8 (mg/l) concentrations. The study recommended that 
 <italic>Borreria verticillata</italic> may be employed in the management of noxious mosquito species i.e. larvae and function as option in replacement of harmful synthetic insecticides (
