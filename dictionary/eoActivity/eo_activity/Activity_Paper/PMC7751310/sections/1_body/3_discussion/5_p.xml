 <italic>F. sur</italic> was studied for presence of a variety of secondary metabolites. In a previous study, the quantitative phytochemical analysis carried out on aqueous leaf extract of 
 <italic>F. sur</italic> showed presence of flavonoids (1367.42 mg/100 g), terpenoids (1280.39 mg/100g), tannins (687.64 mg/100g) and alkaloids (422.12 mg/100g) in larger amounts; whilst saponins, steroids, and glycosides are in trace amounts.
