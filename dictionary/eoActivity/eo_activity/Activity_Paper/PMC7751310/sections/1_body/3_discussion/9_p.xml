<p>Quantitative determinations of potassium ion in both extracts of 
 <italic>F. sur</italic> showed very low concentration suggesting, the diuretic effect of the plant extract was not due to its content of potassium salt, rather due to intrinsic ability of the plant. In addition, potassium, the effect of extracts on sodium was evaluated. Sodium retention and increased amount of water are key players in hypertension pathogenesis, as well as in edematous conditions such as heart failure and cirrhosis.
 <xref rid="cit0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> The effect of the extracts on urinary electrolyte excretion was clearly observed by the water and sodium excretion which reinforces the idea that the diuretic effect of 
 <italic>F. sur</italic> was of the saluretic type.
 <xref rid="cit0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In addition, this saluretic diuretics activity of 
 <italic>F. sur</italic> was similar to the result observed on 
 <italic>Ficus glumosa</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Based on the finding, the diuretic action of the plant might be through inhibition Na
 <sup>+</sup>–K
 <sup>+</sup>–2Cl
 <sup>–</sup> cotransporter 2. Nevertheless, future studies should explore the mechanism of action at molecular level. It was noted that both extracts exhibited a weak excretion of potassium less than the standard suggesting that it has potassium-sparing diuretic activity as well.
