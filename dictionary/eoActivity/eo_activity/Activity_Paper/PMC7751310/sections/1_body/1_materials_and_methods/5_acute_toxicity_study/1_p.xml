<p>For acute toxicity test, healthy nonpregnant Wistar albino rats (age of 8–12 weeks) weighing 200–245 g was used. The test was done according to the OECD 425 Guideline with a limit dose of 2000 mg/kg. Ten rats, five for each extract were used. On day one, a rat (from each group) was given an oral dose of 2000 mg/kg. Then rats were closely observed for behavioral or physical changes during the first 30 min (with special attention during the first four hours), thereafter for 24 h. After 24 h, another four rats (from each group) were given the same dose and observed for general sign of toxicity.</p>
