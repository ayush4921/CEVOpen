<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used all over the world for their analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects [

They cause—to a greater or lesser degree—the same side effects, including gastric and renal toxicity. Recent studies have shown that there are at least two types of COX isoenzymes: COX-2 and COX-2. COX-1 is constitutive and produces prostaglandins that protect the stomach and kidneys from damage. COX-2′s mechanism of action is the production of prostaglandins (that are responsible for pain) when induced by inflammatory stimuli, such as cytokines. Therefore, selective COX-2 inhibitors should be anti-inflammatory without side effects on the kidneys and stomach (although selective COX-2 inhibitors may cause other side effects). For example, COX-2 is thought to be involved in ovulation and labor. Additionally, the well-known protective effect of aspirin on colon cancer may be through the way it affects COX-2, which is expressed in this disease. It is also known that NSAIDs delay the progress of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, selective COX-2 inhibitors are thought to be promising agents in many diseases [
