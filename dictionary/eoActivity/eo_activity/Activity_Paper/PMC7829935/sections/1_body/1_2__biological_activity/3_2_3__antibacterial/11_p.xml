<p>Structures derived from heterocyclic β-amino acids also can be found in the group of β-lactamase inhibitors. This aspect became very interesting since bacteria developing resistance to β-lactam antibiotics has been established as a major threat to human health in the 21st century [

The basic mechanism of resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins is the production of β-lactamase enzymes by bacteria. β-lactamases are a class of the serine-amidase group of enzymes that have been widely studied, with their primary mode of action being the hydrolysis of the β-lactam ring of the antibiotic, leading to a ring-opening and inactivation of the drug [
