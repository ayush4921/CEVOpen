<p>The authors concluded that the synthesized compound 
 <bold>A-87380</bold> might serve as a valid lead and set out to optimize the structure to discover clinically effective oral neuraminidase inhibitors. The tri- and tetrasubstituted pyrrolidine moiety-containing derivatives were obtained using combinatorial chemistry techniques, particularly high-throughput parallel synthesis, leading to the discovery of 
 <bold>A-192558</bold> (
