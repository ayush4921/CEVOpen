<p>In an investigation of a highly selective agonist of the human adenosine A
 <sub>3</sub> receptor, DeNinno et al., synthesized different amino nucleosides containing a β
 <sup>2,3</sup>-amino acid motif. Among all of the obtained compounds, Compound 
 <bold>32</bold> and Compound 
 <bold>33</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) exhibit moderate levels of selectivity and potency [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], whereas CP608039 (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, Compound 
 <bold>34</bold>) binds to the human A
 <sub>3</sub> receptor with a K
 <sub>i</sub> of 5.8 nM and possesses over 1000-fold selectivity versus the human A
 <sub>1</sub> receptor. The introduction of an amino group at the 3′ position of the nucleoside improved not only the selectivity but also the aqueous solubility of the synthesized derivatives.
