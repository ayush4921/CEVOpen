 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) exhibited the highest anti-HSV-1 activity, with the esters generally being more effective inhibitors than the corresponding acid. This observation led authors to conclude that the introduction of the ester group at C-5 in the 1

Authors infected Vero cells (lineage of cells used in cell cultures) with HSV-1, Mayaro virus, and VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) to calculate the selective or therapeutic index of each compound for antiviral activity. Other derivatives (
