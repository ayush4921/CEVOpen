<p>Zomerpirac (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Compound 
 <bold>12</bold>), a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, is the sodium salt of 5-(4-chlorobenzoyl)-1,4-dimethyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrrole-2-acetate dehydrate, containing β-amino acid moiety. It is a pyrrole-acetic acid that is structurally related to tolmetin (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00438-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, Compound 
 <bold>13</bold>). Studies demonstrated zomepirac to be more effective than aspirin or codeine alone and to be as effective as analgesic combinations containing codeine or other opioids [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00438" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Tolmetin converts arachidonate into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), a committed step in prostanoid synthesis. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, tolmetin inhibited disease activity similarly to aspirin but caused more gastrointestinal side effects [
