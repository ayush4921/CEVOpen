<p>This manuscript provides an overview of the current state of knowledge about selected β, β
 <sup>2</sup>, β
 <sup>3</sup> and β
 <sup>2,3</sup>-amino acid moiety-containing heterocycles. In recent years, they have been successfully applied as antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial compounds, ALK inhibitors, agonists and antagonists of the receptors and their state-of-the-art applications in these fields have expanded enormously, proving their utility. Until now, more than 200 different heterocycles containing a β-amino acid moiety have been synthesized and characterized in regard to their biological activity. Research on these compounds has significantly increased the knowledge of their synthesis and activity alike. Currently, most of them are promising agents for medicinal chemistry and new drugs. Due to this, there is still a strong need for the development of new methods of their synthesis. They may serve as a scaffolding for designing and synthesizing new biologically active compounds, drug precursors and even drugs themselves. It may also be speculated that most of the presented β-amino acid moiety-containing heterocycles can be applied as new, nonproteinogenic amino acid residues in peptide synthesis. This may make it possible to prepare a new class of biologically active compounds and new types of enzyme substrates or inhibitors. Therefore, this field of heterocyclic chemistry is still under extensive investigation.
