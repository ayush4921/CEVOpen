<p>The antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs were investigated against the growth of nine reference bacterial strains obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (ATCC 700221, USA), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 13883, UK), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853, USA), 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> (ATCC 25931, USA), and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923, USA). In addition, diagnostically proven clinical isolates 
 <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) were tested. Four antibiotics were used to test the sensitivity of bacterial strains: azithromycin, levofloxacin, cefuroxime, and doxycycline; the antibiotics were dissolved in a suitable solvent according to solubility test to obtain stock solution [

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The antifungal activity of VOs was examined against the growth of two fungal strains acquired, from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 90028, USA) and 
 <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic> (ATCC 52066, UK). The antifungal agents (terbinafine and tinidazole) were used for susceptibility tests to 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, used with 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of three VO samples was determined using broth microdilution method described in Jaradat et al. [
