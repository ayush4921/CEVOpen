<p>The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs from different regions of Palestine were reported in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The majority of Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacterial strains were sensitive to 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs at MIC of 3.13 mg/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in activity against nine bacterial strains between 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs from the three regions in Palestine. There were significant differences of Hebron VO sample compared to Nablus and Ramallah VO samples against the American Type Culture Collection 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> (ATCC 25931), 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, and the VO sample from Hebron had the highest potency at a MIC value of 1.56 mg/mL. There were significant differences in Hebron and Ramallah VO samples compared to Nablus VO samples against two clinical isolate of Gram (+) bacterial strains, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and MRSA, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, the VO sample from Nablus provided the lowest potency at a MIC value of 6.250 mg/mL. To evaluate the sensitivity of bacterial strains, four antibacterial drugs were used: azithromycin 250 mg, levofloxacin 500 mg, doxycycline 100 mg, and cefuroxime 250 mg. The MIC values of the drugs were in the range 1.28∗10
 <sup>−6</sup> mg/mL–22.5∗10
 <sup>−3</sup> mg/mL; 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> lists the MICs for drugs. In addition, the antifungal activity against the fungal strains was tested for sensitivity to 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs; the yeast was the most sensitive followed by the fungus; the American Type Culture Collection 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (ATCC 90028) yeast was found to be the most sensitive to 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VO samples at a MIC value of 0.206 mg/mL followed by the fungus 
 <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic> (ATCC 52066) at a VO MIC value of 0.78 mg/mL (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). To evaluate the sensitivity of fungal strains, two antifungal dugs were used: terbinafine 250 mg and tinidazole 500 mg, and the MIC value of antifungal drugs was 18.52 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL.
