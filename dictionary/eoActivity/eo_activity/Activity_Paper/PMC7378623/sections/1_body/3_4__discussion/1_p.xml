<p>Natural antioxidants have been widely investigated to find protective compounds against damages and diseases developed from free radicals and oxidative stress. 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> species were identified as a rich source of antioxidant agents [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Different results were reported by Güllüce and coauthors in Turkey in which the antioxidant activity of the VOs of 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> was observed with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 98.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The study showed that VOs abundant with oxygenated monoterpene such as pulegone have antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, this result may support the antioxidant potency of Ramallah sample VOs, which contained the highest amount of total oxygenated compounds and pulegone (89.88 and 86.04%, respectively) among the three samples of VOs.
