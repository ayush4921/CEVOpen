<p>P‐hydroxybenzoic acid is noted as the basis for the preparation of its esters, named parabens, and they are employed as preservatives in cosmetics and some ophthalmic solutions. This material was one of the other predominant phenolic acids in the 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> observed in all phenological stages in this experiment. According to the obtained results, the maximum value of 16.8 mg/g extract was obtained at the flowering stage, while the seed maturing stage had the lowest amount (0.8 mg/g extract). The amount of this phenolic acid decreased significantly by entering the seed into the sowing stage. Rosmarinic acid is an ester of caffeic acid called 3,4‐dihydroxy phenyl lactic acid (Goleniowski et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1991</xref>). This compound has many pharmaceutical properties such as antimicrobial, anti‐rheumatism, and anticancer and was present in all phenological stages of the 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic>. The highest (13.3 mg/g extract) and the lowest amounts (3.6 mg/g extract) of this compound were obtained in the vegetative stage and the immature seed stage, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> can be considered as a plant rich in phenolic acids, which content was different in different phenological stages. Phenolic compounds were at the lowest rate in the floral budding stage while the maximum content was recorded at the seed mature stage. An increase in phenolic acid levels during flowering stage recommended a higher expression level of the phenylalanine lyase enzyme (Andreotti et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>), and it is also an indication of enzyme activity reduction with plant maturation. These changes that occur in the process of primary metabolites adsorption are a result of starch synthesis in the middle stages of seed maturation, and this phenomenon can affect the biosynthesis of phenolic acids (Ma et al.,
