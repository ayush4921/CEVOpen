 <italic>H. persicum</italic> extracts content in different growing stages. According to our results, there was a significant difference between the extracts content in different phenological stages and the maximum extract content percentage was obtained in the floral budding stage (10.4%) followed by full flowering stage (10.2%). However, with the plant reaching the seed setting stage the extracts percentage decreased, as the lowest percentage of extracts were obtained at mature seeds stage at the rate of 5.1%. Based on the results, there were no significant differences between the flowering and floral budding stages. The situation was the same between vegetative and mid‐mature seeds stages.
