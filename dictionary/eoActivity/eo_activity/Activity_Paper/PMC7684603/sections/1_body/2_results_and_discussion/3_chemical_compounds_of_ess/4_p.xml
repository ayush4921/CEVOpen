<p>The study of essential oil constituents indicated that α‐pinene and β‐pinene were predominant in the early growth stages. According to the results (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the highest α‐pinene value was observed at the full flowering stage (4.9%), but we did not see the same results at the immature seed stage. Moreover, β‐pinene was detected in the vegetative stage and at the time of flower opening. With entering into the seed set stage, values of these two compounds decreased significantly.
