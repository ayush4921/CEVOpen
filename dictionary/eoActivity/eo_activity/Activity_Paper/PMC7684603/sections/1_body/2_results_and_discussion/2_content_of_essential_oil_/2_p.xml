<p>Medicinal plants have different capacities to produce essential oil at different phenological stages (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). To achieve their goal, breeders must consider the proper harvest time to reach the best yield for their target purposes, such as pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries applications. For this reason, the essential oil content was studied in different phenological growth stages of 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic>. Statistical analysis of this experiment showed that the essential oil content was significantly different in various phenological stages of this plant (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The results indicated that the obtained essential oil yield in the vegetative stages, floral budding stage, full flowering stage, early development of seeds stage, mid‐mature seeds stage and, final stage, or late‐mature/ripe seeds stages were 0.45, 0.72, 0.50, 1.00, 3.50, and 2.20%, respectively. According to these data, the greatest yield was observed at the mid‐development stage of the seeds, while the minimum yield was associated with the vegetative stages (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Other medicinal plants such as the 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> family, including 
 <italic>Oliveria decumbens</italic> (Esmaeili et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>),
 <italic>Trachyspermum Ammi</italic> (Soltani Howyzeh et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), and 
 <italic>Echinophora tenuifolia</italic> (Şanli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>
 <italic>)</italic>, followed the same pattern and produced different essential oil content at various growth stages. This can be due to different physiological activities of these plants at various stages of development and its interaction with environment condition. These plants had low essential oil content in early growth stages, while the highest essential oil content was obtained at seed setting and seed phase. Less moisture content and lower activity of some essential enzymes which are necessary for biosynthesis of specific compounds at seeding stage lead to less essential oil production at early stages of growth (Hazrati et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>; Şanli et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Soltani Howyzeh et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies showed essential oil content was not the same in different plant organs. Results of the study on 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> showed 0.4 to 5.2% difference in essential oil content of various organs such as stem and seeds (Sefidkon et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). In our experiment, we observed a low content of the essential oil in vegetative and flowering stages and high essential oil content in seeds at setting stage. According to this, we can conclude that possibly, 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> plants spend most of their produced photosynthetic materials to create vegetative organs instead of synthesis of useful biological active compounds at the early stages of its growth in comparison to later stages.
