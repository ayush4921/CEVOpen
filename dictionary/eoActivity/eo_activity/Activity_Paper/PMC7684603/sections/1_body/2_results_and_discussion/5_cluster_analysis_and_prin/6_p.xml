<p>Classified phenological stages based on all the studied characteristics in this experiment using cluster analysis method are shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. Based on the dendrogram obtained by cluster analysis, different phenological stages were segregated into four separate groups. Primary growth stages consisted of the vegetative stage (S1) and floral budding stage (S2) and they were more similar to each other in terms of characteristics. The middle phenological stages, including full flowering (S3) and early seed development (S4), were placed in a separate group, and the mid‐mature stage of seed (S5) and matured seed (S6) were individually grouped. Hazrati et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) used the cluster analysis method to classify the target treatments based on identified phytochemical compounds (Hazrati et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). The results of the cluster analysis based on different phenological stages showed that two primary and intermediate stages of physiological processes were highly correlated with each other, but were strongly influenced by the plant physiological stage while were separately placed in a separate group. Based on the dendrogram obtained from the cluster analysis, it was observed that the 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic> was affected by the genetic and the environment in the final stages of phenology more than the primary and middle stages. Pretti et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) stated that principal component analysis and cluster analyses can be used to determine the optimum phenological stage and to achieve the best yield of phenolic acids and essential oil compounds from plants (Pretti et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31916-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). This research illustrated in the vegetative phase and in the beginning of the generative phase; the rate of phenolic acids was high. The current research confirmed that the different phenological stages had affected the phenolic acids contents and essential oil compounds of 
 <italic>H. persicum</italic>. However, the mechanisms in which these changes have been made will require further studies.
