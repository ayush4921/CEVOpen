 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>Histone lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) has emerged as an attractive molecule target for the discovery of potently anticancer drugs to treat leukaemia. In this study, a series of novel chalcone derivatives were designed, synthesised and evaluated for their inhibitory activities against LSD1 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>. Among all these compounds, 
  <bold>D6</bold> displayed the best LSD1 inhibitory activity with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 0.14 μM. In the cellular level, compound 
  <bold>D6</bold> can induce the accumulation of H3K9me1/2 and inhibit cell proliferation by inactivating LSD1. It exhibited the potent antiproliferative activity with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 1.10 μM, 3.64 μM, 3.85 μM, 1.87 μM, 0.87 μM and 2.73 μM against HAL-01, KE-37, P30-OHK, SUP-B15, MOLT-4 and LC4-1 cells, respectively. Importantly, compound 
  <bold>D6</bold> significantly suppressed MOLT-4 xenograft tumour growth 
  <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating its great potential as an orally bioavailable candidate for leukaemia therapy.
