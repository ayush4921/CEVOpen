<p>Total RNA was isolated from MOLT-4&amp;shControl and MOLT-4&amp;shLSD1 cells with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), the protocol was followed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and RNA was quantified with Nanodrop (Tianjin XinZhou Science and Technology Co., Ltd, Tianjin, China). Quantitative real-time PCR assays were carried out on the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio™ Real-Time PCR detected system (Thermos Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) using the Q-PCR kit with SYBR green dye (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China). The primer sequences were as follows: LSD1 forward primer sequence (5′-3′), GTGGACGAGTTGCCACATTTC; LSD1 reverse primer sequence (5′-3′), TGACCACAGCCATAGGATTCC; gapdh forward primer sequence (5′-3′), GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC; gapdh reverse primer sequence (5′-3′), TGGTGAAGACGCCAGTGGA.</p>
