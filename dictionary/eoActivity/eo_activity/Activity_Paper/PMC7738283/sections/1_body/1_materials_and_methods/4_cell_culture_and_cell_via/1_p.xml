<p>Cancer cell lines (Hela, 22RV1, Caco-2, BEL-7402, MOLT-4, OVCAR-3, HCT-8, HIC, IMR-32, HAL-01, KE-37, P30-OHK, SUP-B15 and LC4-1) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Hyclone, Los Angeles, CA, USA) with 10% foetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Los Angeles, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone, Los Angeles, USA) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37 °C. All cell lines were purchased from the China Centre for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC, China). Control containing sequence specific for LSD1 (GGCGAAGGTAGAGTACAGAGA) was described. The shRNA constructs were transfected into MOLT-4 cells using the Lonza Group nucleofector technology in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions

 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. After the incubation for 24 h, cancer cell lines were cultured with the chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> at different concentrations. Then, 20 μL of MTT (3–(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (5 mg/ml) was added and the cells were incubated for 4 h. The absorbance was measured using a microplate reader (DeTie Technology Co., Ltd, NanJing, China).
