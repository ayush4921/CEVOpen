<p>All molecular modelling studies were performed with the Autodock software (The Scripps Research Institute, San Diego, CA, USA). The crystal structure of LSD1 (PDB code: 5l3e) was downloaded from the RCSB protein database. The targeted compound was first generated using Pymol software. Following generation, the files were converted to the.pdbqt format using OpenBabel. It was then docked using AutoDockTools. The docked conformations and information were then docked and their resulting conformations were visualised using Pymol.</p>
