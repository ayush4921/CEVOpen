<p>Based on the above experiments, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> has been identified as a novel LSD1 inhibitor. In the current work, molecular docking methodologies were also used to explore any molecular interaction exist between chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> and residues lies in the active site cativity of LSD1. We have used Autodock as an automated tool to perform docking and selected PDB code 5l3e (Resolution: 2.80 Å). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref>, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> formed three hydrogen bonds with residues His532, Asn535 and Asp556, respectively. In addition, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> formed hydrophobic effects with residues Leu386, Phe382 and Phe538. These results explained that chalcone scaffold was a promising unit for targeting LSD1. Based on the reported reference [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], 
 <bold>E11</bold> as a reference compound was docked using the same protocol and compared with chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold>. In the 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref>, the reference compound 
 <bold>E11</bold> (yellow structure) was docked into a similar pocket as chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> (magenta structure).
