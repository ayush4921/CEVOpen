<p>The LSD1 inhibitory activity of all synthesised compounds 
 <bold>C1</bold>∼
 <bold>C4</bold> and 
 <bold>D1</bold>∼
 <bold>D7</bold> was examined according to reported references [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Their results of inhibitory activities against LSD1 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were summarised in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In this work, 
 <bold>Dithiocarbamate 26</bold> and chalcone 
 <bold>4</bold> were used as reference compounds. The replacement of the chlorine atom by the dithiocarbamate fragment resulted in a powerful improvement of LSD1 inhibitory activity for chalcone-dithiocarbamate derivatives 
 <bold>D1</bold>∼
 <bold>D7</bold> compared with the corresponding chalcone analogues (
 <bold>C1</bold>∼
 <bold>C4</bold>). Especially, compound 
 <bold>D6</bold> showed the potently inhibitory effect with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.14 μM (&gt; 100-fold more potent than 
 <bold>C3</bold>). This result suggests that dithiocarbamate moiety may play a synergistic role in determining activity.
