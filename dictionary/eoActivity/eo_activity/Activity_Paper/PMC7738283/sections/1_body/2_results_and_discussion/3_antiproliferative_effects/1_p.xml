<p>Based on the screening activity results of all synthetic derivatives, the most potent chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> was prioritised to perform further experiments for evaluating its antiproliferative potential. In addition, Hela (cervical cancer cells), 22RV1 (prostate cancer cells), Caco-2 (colon cancer cells), BEL-7402 (liver cancer cells), MOLT-4 (leukaemia cells), OVCAR-3 (ovarian cancer cells), HCT-8 (cecal adenocarcinoma cells) and IMR-32 (neuroblastoma cells) were treated with compound 
 <bold>D6</bold> at different concentrations (control, 4 μM, 8 μM, and 16 μM). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> displayed the potential antiproliferative effects against 22RV1, Caco-2, MOLT-4 and IMR-32 cells. Among them, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> showed the most potent antiproliferation efficiency around 80% for 48 h at 4 μM against leukaemia MOLT-4 cells. These results indicated that chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> might be a broad-spectrum antitumor agent.
