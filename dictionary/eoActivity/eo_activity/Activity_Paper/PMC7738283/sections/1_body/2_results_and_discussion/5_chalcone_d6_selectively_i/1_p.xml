<p>LSD1 belonged to the FAD dependent monoamine oxidases family including MAO-A and MAO-B, and shared the similar enzymatic mechanism of MAO-A/B

 </xref>. Thus, the selectivity of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> against homologous proteins MAO-A/B and CDK1/2 was explored in this work. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> at 400 nM weakly inhibited MAO-A, MAO-B, CDK1 and CDK2 with the rates of only 16.3%, 17.7%, 16.3% and 19.0%, respectively, while it showed about 99.3% of inhibition against LSD1. These findings indicated the high selectivity of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> on LSD1 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Then, time-dependent experiments were also performed and results showed that chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> inhibited LSD1 in a time dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(B)</xref>). Importantly, the dialysis experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(C)</xref>) and dilution assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(D)</xref>) indicating that chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> was a reversible LSD1 inhibitor. To further confirm the potential binding manner of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> against LSD1 recombinant, the centrifuge experiment was also carried out. With the aid of 10 kDa ultracentrifuge filter, reversible compound was supposed to be removed from LSD1 by centrifuge. So, chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> was characterised as a reversible LSD1 inhibitor as split of chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> by ultracentrifuge may rescue the activity of LSD1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(E)</xref>). All these results showed that chalcone 
 <bold>D6</bold> could selectively inhibit LSD1 in a time dependent and reversible manner.
