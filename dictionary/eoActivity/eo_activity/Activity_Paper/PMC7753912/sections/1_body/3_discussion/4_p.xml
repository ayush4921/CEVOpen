 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin resulted in an elevated lipid peroxidation, indicating that the major mechanism of toxicity of these compounds is via lipid peroxidation. Obviously, when free radicals are produced at a level beyond the antioxidant capacity of the system, they constitute a major threat to health. By virtue of their chemistry, free radicals are highly reactive because of an unpaired electron in the shell. In an attempt to gain stability, free radicals abstract protons from chemically stable macromolecules such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and lipids, wrecking havocs. Polyunsaturated lipids, a major component of the biomembrane are more susceptible to ROS. Hence, an oxidative attack on membrane lipids could result in compromise of critical membrane functions. It has been suggested that malondialdehyde (MDA) produced during lipid peroxidation is responsible for organ damage (
