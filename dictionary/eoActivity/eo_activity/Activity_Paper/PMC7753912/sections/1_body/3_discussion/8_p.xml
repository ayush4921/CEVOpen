<p id="p0170">Administration of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin respectively caused a marked derangement in lipid profile both in the tissue homogenates and serum and of albino rats. Specifically, total cholesterol level was markedly increased relative to negative control. This increment can be attributed to the activation of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis (

 <italic>P. amarus,</italic> total cholesterol in the liver and kidney as well as serum markedly reduced to a level comparable with animals treated with standard drug. This decrease in cholesterol can be linked to 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> triggered increase in HDL-C- which is responsible for the transport of cholesterol to the liver (

 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin respectively triggered a marked increase in LDL-C level of experimental rats. Treatment with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extract attenuated the LDL-C level and reversed it to level comparable with animals treated with the standard drug. The ameliorative effect of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> on the deranged lipid profile can be attributed to the polyphenols and flavonoids in the extract. Flavonoids have been reported to modulate the metabolism of lipid by the inhibiting acyl coenzyme A: cholesterol O-acyltransferase and 3-hydroxy- 3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase in albino rats (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kurowska et al., 2000</xref>). Specifically, quercetin which is abundant in 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extract, has been reported to ameliorate hyperlipidemia, by enhancing lipolysis and upregulation of beta oxidation pathway at the level of gene transcription (
