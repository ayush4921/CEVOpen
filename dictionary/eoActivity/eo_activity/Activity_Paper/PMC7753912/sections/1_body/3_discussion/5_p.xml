<p id="p0155">Reduced glutathione is an intracellular non-protein thiol that coordinates the biochemistry of antioxidants defense. It is the major source of cellular reducing power, acting as free radicals scavenger, thereby arresting oxidative stress. It is also the model substrate for major enzymes of phase II detoxification of xenobiotics. Routinely, level of GSH has been used to predict the health status of an organism. The present study indicates that, administration of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin caused a significant depletion of GSH in the serum and tissue homogenates. This is an indication that the two compounds (CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin) at the stated doses generated enough ROS that overwhelmed the endogenous antioxidant capacity of the animals. However, treatment with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extract markedly raised intracellular GSH concentration, thereby boosting the biochemical antioxidant pool of the cell. Generally, flavonoids had been reported to increase the concentration of reduced glutathione in the intracellular milleu via an up-regulation of glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of GSH (
