<p id="p0160">Superoxide dismutase has been suggested as the most vulnerable hepatic antioxidant enzyme in the event of an oxidative attack on the liver (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Kharpate et al., 2007</xref>). It is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of ROS to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and eventually to water. Exposure to CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and rifampicin caused a marked depletion in GSH relative to the negative control animals, suggesting toxicity. This marked depletion is traceable to the production of superoxide anion, in excess of the antioxidant capacity of the experimental animals (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee, 2002</xref>). However, treatment with 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> extract restored SOD activity to a level comparable with the negative control and silymarin treated animals. This can be attributed to 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic>-triggered up-regulation in the synthesis of mitochondrial SOD via enhanced transcription of its DNA.
