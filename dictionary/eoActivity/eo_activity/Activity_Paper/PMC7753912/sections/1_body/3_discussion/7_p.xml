 <sub>2</sub> to water and oxygen thereby preventing its accumulation in the cell. In the present study, exposure to rifampicin and CCl
 <sub>4</sub> resulted in a marked decrease in catalase activity both in the serum and tissue homogenates of albino rats. Depletion in catalase activity as a result of exposure to both toxicants is traceable to a decrease in NADPH or increased lipid peroxidation or both (
