 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Ohkawa et al. (1979)</xref>Ohkawa et al. (1979) using Randox kits. One hundred microliter each of kidney and liver homogenates as well as serum were mixed separately with 2.5 mL reaction buffer and incubated for 1 h at 100 °C. After cooling, the mixture was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min and decanted to obtain a supernatant. Absorbance of the supernatants was then read at 532 nm. Malonidialdehyde (MDA) level in the supernatant was expressed as μmole MDA per mg protein taking the molar absorptivity of MDA-thiobarbituric chromophore as 1.56×10
