 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Reitman and Franke (1957)</xref>. One hundred microliter each of serum, liver and kidney was added to phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.4), α-oxoglutarate (2 mM) and L-aspartate (100 mM). The resulting mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Five hundred microliter of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (0.02 M) was then added to the reaction mixture and left for 20 min at 25 °C. Five milliliter of 0.4 M NaOH was then introduced to the mixture and its absorbance at 546 nm was read after 5 min against the reagent blank.
