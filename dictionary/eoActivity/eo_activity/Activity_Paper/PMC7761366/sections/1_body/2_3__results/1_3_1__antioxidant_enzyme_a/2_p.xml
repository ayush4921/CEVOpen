<p>The effect of Zn intake was observed in the activity of total SOD and Cu/Zn SOD (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001, respectively) in the duodenal mucosa, with the highest activity recorded in lambs fed Zn alone over those fed the CON diet. Neither the total SOD nor Cu/Zn SOD activity in jejunal and ileal mucosa was influenced by the experimental diets.
