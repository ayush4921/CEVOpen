<p>All tissue and feed samples were dried (105 Â°C for 48 h), ground and digested with a concentrated HNO

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (30%) mixture (3:1) using closed pressure vessels in a MWS 4 Speedwave microwave (Berghof Company, Eningen, Germany). The serum samples were only diluted with 0.05% Triton X-100 solution [
 <xref rid="B32-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Trace element (Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn) concentrations were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry in an air-acetylene flame using a double beam atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AA-7000 Series, Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan) with deuterium background correction. The certificate reference material of lyophilized human plasma ClinCheck Control (Recipe, Munich, Germany), bovine liver BCR-185R and pig kidney ERM-BB186 (Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements, Geel, Belgium) were routinely run in each analysis to verify the precision of the analysis. Mineral concentration in all tissue samples and dietary components was expressed as mg/kg DM and in serum as mg/L.
