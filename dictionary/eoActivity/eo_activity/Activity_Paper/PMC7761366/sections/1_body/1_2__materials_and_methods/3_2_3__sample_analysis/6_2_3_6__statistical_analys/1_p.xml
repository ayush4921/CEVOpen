<p>All statistical analyses were performing using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2., GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Differences between diets with and without additives were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Experimental data were analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial in a randomized complete block design representing two main factors: Hmix (with and without) and zinc (with and without), followed by the Tukey post-hoc test for pairwise multiple comparisons, where appropriate. The Least Significant Difference test (Fisher’s LSD) was applied post-hoc to determine significant differences among the treatments in case of a significant interaction (Hmix × Zn). For each analysis, the individual lamb was considered as an experimental unit. The data presented are the mean values and pooled standard errors of the mean (SEM). Differences were considered significant when
