<p>A modified fluorometric TBARS method was used to determine lipid oxidation in the serum and tissues, as described by Jo and Ahn [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Samples (250 µL) of serum or tissue homogenates were mixed with 100 µL of sodium dodecyl sulfate (8.1%), 750 µL of HCl (0.5 M), 750 µL of thiobarbituric acid (TBA, 20 mM), 25 µL of BHT (7.2 %) and 250 µL of DDW in test tubes and incubated for 15 min in a water bath at 90 °C. After cooling for 10 min, 2.5 mL of n-butanol/pyridine solution (15:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and 0.5 mL of DDW was added and the samples were centrifuged at 3000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The fluorescence of the upper layer was read at 520-nm excitation and 550-nm emission in a fluorometer (Shimadzu RF-1501, Kyoto, Japan). A standard curve was prepared using 1,1,3,3-tetramethoxypropane (malondialdehyde-bis), and the extent of lipid peroxidation was expressed as µmol of malondialdehyde (MDA) formed per L of serum or nmol MDA per g of tissue protein.
