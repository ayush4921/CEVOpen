<p>A total of 24 female lambs (Improved Valachian), 3–4 months old and weighing an average 15.12 ± 1.58 kg, were housed in common stalls with free access to water. At the onset of the experiment, the animals had 7 days to adapt to the environment and consumed meadow hay (ad libitum) and the same commercial concentrate (500 g dry matter (DM)/day/animal). The concentrate was composed of 370 g/kg of wheat bran, 200 g/kg of soybean meal, 230 g/kg of rolled oats and 200 g/kg of maize meal, and the daily ration was divided into two portions offered at ca. 7:00 AM and 3:00 PM. The chemical composition of the meadow hay, concentrate (with and without Zn supplement) and herbal mix are summarized in

 <xref rid="B23-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Subsequently, parasite-free lambs were experimentally infected with approximately 5000 third-stage larvae of 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> administered orally to each lamb. For infection, we used the MHco1 strain of 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>, which is susceptible to all the main classes of anthelmintics. The infection was successful in all infected animals, as was previously shown by Váradyová et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thereafter, all infected lambs were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatment groups of six animals in each. The number of animals used in the experiment was assigned according to VICH GL13 guidelines proposed by the European Medicines Agency. The diets included the unsupplemented control diet (CON) and this diet further supplemented with either a Herbal mixture (Hmix), Zn-chelate of glycine hydrate (Zn), or both additives (Hmix + Zn). The animals were housed in collective stalls according to the dietary treatment (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6/stall) and the experimental period lasted 70 days (during summer).
