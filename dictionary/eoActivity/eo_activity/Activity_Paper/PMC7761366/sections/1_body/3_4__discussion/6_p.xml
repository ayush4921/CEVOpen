<p>Various studies have been carried out in animals [

 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and cell culture systems [
 <xref rid="B53-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] to determine the effect of bioactive plant compounds on mineral absorption. Stef and Gergen [
 <xref rid="B51-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported generally moderate or poor correlation between total phenols and the accumulation of minerals (Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn) in the liver and muscles of chickens receiving medicinal herbs rich in a different type of polyphenols (flavonoids, phenol acids, benzoic acid derivate, phenylpropanoids derivate, and condensed tannins). Supplementation of the diet with polyphenol-rich plant products for 4 weeks had a marginal effect on the status of Zn, Fe, and Cu in piglets with a nutritionally adequate supply of those microelements [
 <xref rid="B52-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Afsana et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] demonstrated no effect of tannic acid supplementation on Zn, Cu, and Mn absorption in rats, but Fe absorption was reduced. There is great variability in the extent to which polyphenol-metal chelation may affect mineral bioavailability. It has been shown that the content and type of polyphenols present in the feed may have a specific influence on the accumulation of microelements in tissue [
 <xref rid="B51-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In the present work, the tissue concentration of Zn, Cu, Fe and Mn was not affected by the intake of Hmix, indicating that medicinal plants containing flavonoids (54%), diterpenes (27%), and phenolic acids (19%) had no negative effect on microelements uptake in the tissues and serum of infected lambs.
