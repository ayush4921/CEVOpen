<p>Due to their redox properties and chemical structure, flavonoids and other phenolic compounds exert antioxidant activity by means of several mechanisms precisely described mainly in vitro [
 <xref rid="B9-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the antioxidant effect of polyphenols/flavonoids in biological systems may depend on the efficiency of their absorption and extensive metabolic transformation, the active concentration of flavonoids and their metabolites accumulated in the target tissues as well as on surrounding chemical environment, which varies according to tissues and physiological conditions [
 <xref rid="B10-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For these reasons, the effect of medicinal herbs, rich in plant secondary metabolites with bioactive properties, on the gut antioxidant status and animal health in general needs further elucidation.
