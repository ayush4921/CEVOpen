<p>We assessed the effects of the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> stem bark on the development of hypertension in L-NAME-induced hypertension rat models. The extract prevented or mitigated the hypertension-like changes in hemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters, serum lipid profile, and oxidative stress markers, as well as aorta, heart, and kidney histopathological signs. Altogether, these findings suggest the aqueous extract of stem bark 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> has antihypertensive and antioxidant properties, and justify its use in folk medicine against cardiovascular disorders.
