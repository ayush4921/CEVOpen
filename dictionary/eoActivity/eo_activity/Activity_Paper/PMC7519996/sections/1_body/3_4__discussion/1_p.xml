<p>The results of the present study suggest that the aqueous extract of stem bark of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> had preventive effects on the development of hypertension in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats. Treatment of animals with L-NAME resulted in significant increases in heart rate and systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures, as well as a reduction in weight gain in hypertensive control animals, which is in accordance with the available information on this model [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Concomitant treatment of animals with L-NAME and either the extract of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril mitigated the blood pressure increase and prevented the reduction in weight gain observed in hypertensive control animals. L-NAME-induced dyslipidemia, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in this model [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], was not observed in animals concomitantly treated with L-NAME and either 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> extract or captopril in the present study, unlike hypertensive control animals that displayed marked decrease in blood HDL-cholesterol level and significant increases in blood levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. These observations suggest that, as captopril, the extract of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> mitigated the development of L-NAME-induced hypertension in rats.
