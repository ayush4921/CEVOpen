<p>It is well-known that the liver is the centre for metabolism of various drugs and chemicals which makes it very susceptible to tissue damage by these compounds. Hence, these drugs and chemicals induce liver damage and alter the architecture of hepatocytes. Increased specific liver enzymes like alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can be used as markers for the diagnosis of drugs and toxin-induced hepatotoxicity. Further, the discharge of mitochondrial enzymes from the liver might be a clear evidence of hepatic necrosis [
