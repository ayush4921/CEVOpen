<p>Many herbs and their products have been used in the treatment of diseases due to their medicinal properties. Ginger or 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> is a traditional dietary ingredient with notable medicinal properties like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antihyperglycemic, antitumorigenic, and hepatoprotective activities [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 6
 <italic>-</italic>Gingerol is the chief pharmacologically active phenolic compound found in the rhizomes of ginger and has been demonstrated to exhibit a variety of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, and antimutagenic activities [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, 6-gingerol has been reported to exert a therapeutic effect in osteoarthritis by means of attenuating oxidative stress as well as downregulation of proinflammatory mediators 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Recently, 6-gingerol had been shown to induce cell death in the cancer cell line via caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and autophagy [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Further, 6-gingerol inhibits the metastasis of cancer cells and induces apoptosis in cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Henceforth, the present experimental study was accomplished to investigate the hepatotoxicity of DEN in rat liver and the protective ability of 6-gingerol against DEN-induced hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammation.
