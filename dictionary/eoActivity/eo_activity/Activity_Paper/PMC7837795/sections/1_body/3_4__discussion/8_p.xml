<p>A previous study had exhibited that IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>-induced inflammation and oxidative stress becomes attenuated by 
 <italic>S</italic>-[6]-gingerol in HuH7 cells. This observation was supported by a decrease in mRNA levels of inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and IL-8. Further, S-[6]-gingerol was found to reduce both IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>-induced COX2 upregulation and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B activity [

In another study, 6-gingerol was shown to forestall the increase in inflammatory markers such as myeloperoxidase, NO, and TNF-alpha in the brain, ovaries, and uterus of rats treated with chlorpyrifos. Besides, 6-gingerol was noticed to restrain the LPS-induced increment in levels of GFAP and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> in the rat brain [
