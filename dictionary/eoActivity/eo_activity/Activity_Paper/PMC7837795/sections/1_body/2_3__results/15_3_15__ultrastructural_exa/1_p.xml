<p>To further investigate the hepatoprotective effects of 6-gingerol, ultrastructural examination of liver tissue was conducted by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>). In control group rats, numerous mitochondria (M) were found to be spherical and round-shaped, depending on the location within the cell. Besides, clumps of glycogen surrounded (Gy), adipocytes (A), lysosomes (L), and dense granulated cytoplasm were noticed in the control group rats. In the DEN-treated group rats, tissues showed few mitochondria (M), some of them were losing their shape (DM), and some were swollen mitochondria (SM). Further, the presence of a glycogen clump (Gy) and broken SER was also noticed in liver tissues of DEN-treated rats. The tissues of rats treated with both DEN and 6-gingerol also exhibited some alterations such as the nucleus (N) with the initial stage of chromatin disintegration (Nc) and few mitochondria (M), and some of them were shown to lose their shape (DM). Other features in tissues of this group included the presence of glycogen clump (Gy), well-developed SER-ER tubules, few lysosomes (Ly), and the presence of few peroxisomes (P). However, the severity of changes in this group was lesser as compared to that in the DEN-treated group (
