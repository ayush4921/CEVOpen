<p>Ginger has been reported to possess significant anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. 6-Gingerol is a chief component of ginger. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory activity of 6-gingerol was investigated by using inhibition of albumin denaturation [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] using ibuprofen as a standard reference drug. In short, 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 1% aqueous solution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) was added to Eppendorf tubes having 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of various dilutions of 6-gingerol (100-600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) or standard ibuprofen (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). The pH of the solutions was adjusted to 7.4, and the tubes were first incubated at room temperature for 20 min. After the completion of 20 min, the tubes were heated at 71°C for 30 min. The reaction mixtures were left to cool down, and the turbidity of the reaction samples was determined by measuring absorbance spectrophotometrically at 660 nm against distilled water as the blank. The experiment was run in triplicates. The percentage inhibition of albumin denaturation was calculated by using the following equation.
