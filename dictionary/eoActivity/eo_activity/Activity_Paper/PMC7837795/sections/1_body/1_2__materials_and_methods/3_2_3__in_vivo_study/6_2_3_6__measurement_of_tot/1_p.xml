<p>The total antioxidant capacity of each sample was measured according to the manufacturer's protocols using a commercial kit (Abcam, UK). Total antioxidant capacity assay can be used to measure either the combination of both small molecule antioxidants and proteins, or small molecule antioxidants only in the presence of a protein mask. In brief, both small molecules and protein antioxidants reduce Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> ion to Cu
 <sup>+</sup>. However, the presence of the protein mask prevents reduction of Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> by proteins. Thus, the protein mask allows the assay of small molecule antioxidant molecules only. The reduced Cu
 <sup>+</sup> ion chelates with a colorimetric probe and gives a broad absorbance peak around 570â€‰nm which is proportional to the total antioxidant capacity of a sample.
