<p>The diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay was utilized to determine the free radical scavenging ability of 6-gingerol. Briefly, 10 mg/ml stock solution of the 6-gingerol was serially diluted in water to prepare a series of different concentrations (600-50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Now, 1 ml of 0.3 mM DPPH working solution was prepared in absolute methanol and was mixed with 2.5 ml of various aqueous dilutions of 6-gingerol separately. The mixtures were kept in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature. Then, the absorbance of various incubation mixtures was measured at 517 nm with a spectrophotometer against absolute methanol. To prepare the control, the 6-gingerol was replaced with methanol. All the experiments were run in triplicates. The percentage of free radical scavenging activity was calculated in line with the accompanying equation.
