<p>The antiproteinase action of 6-gingerol was determined by the modified method of Sakat et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For this purpose, 0.06 mg trypsin, 1 ml 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 7.4), and 1 ml 6-gingerol of varying concentrations (100-600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) or diclofenac sodium (100 and 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) in 2 ml reaction mixture were first incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes. After completion of incubation, 1 ml of 0.8% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) casein was added. The mixture was incubated for an additional 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, the reaction was arrested by the addition of 2 ml of 70% perchloric acid, and the cloudy suspension was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 2500 rpm. The absorbance of the supernatant was recorded at 210 nm using a buffer as the blank. All the tests were run in triplicates. The percentage inhibition of proteinase inhibitory activity was calculated.
