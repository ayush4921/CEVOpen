<p>After blood collection, the serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at room temperature. Specific biochemical parameters which have been known to be altered due to hepatotoxins were evaluated to investigate the hepatoprotective activity of 6-gingerol. In the serum, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were spectrophotometrically assayed utilizing a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's protocol.
