<p>Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>) is an important cytokine and inflammatory mediator produced during inflammation. The expression pattern of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was evaluated through immune-histochemical staining as per the previously described method with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Concisely, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut into 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thick serial sections. The sections were deparaffinised, rehydrated, and rinsed in phosphate buffer saline. Antigen retrieval was made in a citrate buffer (pH 6.0) using the microwave method followed by incubation in 3% H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 20 minutes to block endogenous peroxidase activity. The sections were then incubated in a blocking agent for 1 hour at room temperature, followed by incubation with TNF-alpha primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. This step was followed by using secondary biotinylated antibody for 1 hour. Sections were washed in phosphate buffer saline and then incubated with streptavidin peroxidase for 45 minutes. Then, diaminobenzidine (DAB) and chromogen were used, sections were counterstained with haematoxylin, and the results were interpreted under a light microscope.
