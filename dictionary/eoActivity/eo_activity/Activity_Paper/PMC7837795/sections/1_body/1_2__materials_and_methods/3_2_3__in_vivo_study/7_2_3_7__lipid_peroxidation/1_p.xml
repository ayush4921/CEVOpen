<p>Lipid peroxidation was measured in liver tissue using a lipid hydroperoxide assay. Briefly, in the lipid hydroperoxide assay, lipid hydroperoxide was extracted from each experimental group sample as per the manufacturer's instruction. The chromogenic reaction was carried out at room temperature, the absorbance of each sample well was checked at 530 nm, the degree of lipid peroxidation was measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and the result was expressed as 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol of MDA equivalents per mg of protein.
