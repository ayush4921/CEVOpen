<p>Masson trichrome staining was used to assess the collagen fiber of the liver using a Masson Trichrome Staining Kit (Abcam, UK). Concisely, sections were deparaffinised, and preheated Bouin's fluid had been added for one hour convoyed by a 10-minute cooling period. The slides were washed in tap water till the section became completely clean. The slides were stained with working Weigert's iron haematoxylin for five minutes. Biebrich Scarlet-Acid Fuchsin Solution was applied to the slides for 15 minutes. The differentiation in phosphomolybdic/phosphotungstic acid solution was performed for 10-15 minutes. Without rinsing, aniline blue solution was applied to the slides for 5-10 minutes. Acetic acid solution (1%) was applied to the slides. Dehydration was performed very quickly in 2 changes of 95% ethyl alcohol, followed by 2 changes of absolute alcohol, and the slides were cleared via xylene and mounting was done.</p>
