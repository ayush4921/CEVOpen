<p>The phytochemical screening of the four extracts revealed the presence of various phytochemical constituents, ie, phenols, flavonoids and terpenoids (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Phenols were reported to possess antipromastigote activity. For instance, rosmarinic acid tested against 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes resulted in altered membrane integrity of the mitochondria and the cells.
 <xref rid="cit0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Flavonoids were also found to exert significant antileishmanial activity against 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In an attempt to decipher the mechanism of antileishmanial activity of flavonoids, catechins; type of flavonoid were found to form complexes with the parasite cell wall to influence processes requiring cell linking, and hence inhibit the parasite growth.
