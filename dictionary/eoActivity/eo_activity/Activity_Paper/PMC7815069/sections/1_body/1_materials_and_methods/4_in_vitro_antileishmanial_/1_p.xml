<p>Each of the plant extracts was added to a separate 96-well microtiter plate containing 100 µLcomplete culture medium to achieve a final concentration of 100 µg/mL. Then, a suspension of 100 µL of the parasites (3.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> promastigotes of 
 <italic>L. aethiopica</italic> or 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic>) obtained from the previous culture was added to each well. After that, parasites were incubated for 72 hrs at room temperature for promastigotes of both strains, at 31°C and 37°C for axenically cultured amastigotes of 
 <italic>L. aethiopica</italic> or 
 <italic>L. donovani</italic> respectively, in the presence of various concentrations of extract. Next, resazurin (0.125 mg/mL) was added to 20 µL suspension (10% of the total volume of each well). The mixture was covered with aluminum foil, and left at the previously stated temperature. Fluorescence intensity was measured using Victor 3 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer, MA, USA) at excitation wavelength of 544 nm and emission wavelength of 590 nm. The assay was conducted in triplicate and compared to negative controls (1% DMSO and Media alone) and reference drug (Amphotericin B, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). During the assay, cell viability was monitored by measuring fluorescent signal. The fluorescence intensities produced are proportional to the number of viable cells.
