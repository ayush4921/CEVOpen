<p>Folin–Ciocalteu’s method was used to determine the total phenolic content of the extracts. Serial dilutions of the standard (gallic acid) were prepared in distilled water with concentrations 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.75 and 3.375 µg/mL, to establish calibration curve. 1 mL of the standard was then transferred into test tubes. After that, 5 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of Folin–Ciocalteu’s reagent were added into the test tubes. 5 minutes later, 1.5 mL of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (20%) was added and the volume made up to 10 mL with distilled water. It was allowed to stand for 90 minutes at ambient temperature. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 760 nm using a UV spectrophotometer (Jenway Model 6500, England). Every experiment was conducted in triplicate. Similar procedure was also followed for the extracts (100 µg/mL) and the blank solutions. The total phenolic content was determined using a standard curve of gallic acid (y = 0.0075x - 0.0862, R2 = 0.9665). The calculated total phenolic results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent per 100 g of extracts.
