<p>To measure the serum MDA level, 0.5 g of thiobarbituric acid was mixed with 80 mL of 20% acetic acid and then, the PH was adjusted to 3.5 using NaOH and its volume was increased to 100 mL by adding 20% acetic acid. Also, 100 µL of the serum sample was mixed with 100 µL of 8.1% SDS and 2.5 mL of the working solution. The samples were left in a bain-marie for 60 min and cooled, and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm. The optical absorbance of the supernatant was recorded at 523 nm wavelength. In order to measure the brain MDA level, 1 g of the brain tissue was dissolved in cooled 2.5% KCL and the resulting solution was homogenized at 10% w/v ratio, and then it was incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 60 min in a metabolic shaker. Then, 1 mL of 5% tetrachloroacetic acid and 1 mL of 67% thiobarbituric acid were added to the solution and it was perfectly mixed after each addition. The content of each vial was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min. Then, the supernatant was transferred to another tube and left in a bain-marie. 10 min later, the tubes were cooled and the optical absorbance was recorded at 535 nm (Karatas et al.
