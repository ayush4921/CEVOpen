<p>The flavonoids and phenolic compounds, found in the herb extract, were detected by comparing the inhibition time of the samplesâ€™ peak levels with flavonoids and phenolic compounds standards, and the amounts of the compounds were calculated through calculating the sub-peak level. Five flavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, naringenin, quercetin, and rutin) and one phenolic acid (caffeic acid) were identified and their amounts were measured by the lowest and highest inhibition time obtained for caffeic acid and quercetin, respectively (
