<p>There were significant differences in two-way ANOVA between different groups (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Bonferroni post hoc test showed that, latency to find the platform on day 3 was significantly lower in the groups receiving the extract with concentrations of 100 and 300 mg/kg and the group treated with rutin (10 mg/kg), compared to the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively), but there was no significant difference between the group receiving the extract with the concentration of 30 mg/kg and the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). There was also no significant difference in latency between the groups receiving 100 and 300 mg/kg of the extract and the group receiving rutin, but there was a statistically significant difference between the group receiving the extract with concentration of 30 mg/kg and the group receiving rutin (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). There was also a significant difference between two of the extract groups (30 and 300 mg/kg) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
