<p>The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> showed varied antifungal activity (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01418-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Our results indicate that the extract exhibited a moderate inhibitory effect against unicellular yeast (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, ATCC 10231, 
 <italic>C. vaginalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> ATCC 14116) and low activity against filamentous fungi (
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> ATCC 204305 and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>). By comparing the results obtained in the presence of Amphotericin B, we observe that only for 
 <italic>C. vaginalis</italic> (clinical strain, 136) the diameter of inhibition zone is higher that the used control. Based on the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC)/MIC ratio, antifungal compounds present in our extract acts as fungicidal agents against the tested fungi.
