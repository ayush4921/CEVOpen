<p>The effects of increasing concentrations of the methanolic germander extract (50, 75, and 100 μg/mL) were tested against the swarming/swimming motility of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 strain was tested as previously reported by Noumi et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-plants-09-01418" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. For the swimming activity, the optical density of an overnight culture of PAO1 strain was adjusted at 0.4 OD at 600 nm and point inoculated at the center of 0.3% agar medium. For swarming assays, 5 μL of the same PA01-adjusted culture were inoculated at the center of the 0.5% agar medium. Then, the inoculated Petri dishes were incubated at 30 °C in upright position for 16 h. The reduction in swimming and swarming migration was recorded by measuring the swim and swarm zones of the bacterial cells after 16 h. Each sample was tested in triplicate and the mean zone of inhibition was recorded.
