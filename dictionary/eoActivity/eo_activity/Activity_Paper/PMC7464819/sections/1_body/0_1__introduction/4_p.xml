<p>There is still a knowledge gap regarding the effect of UV irradiation on mushroomsâ€™ bioactive properties. Nevertheless, it is known that UV radiation can promote photo-oxidation via two major routes. The first of these involves direct photo-oxidation arising from the absorption of UV radiation by chromophores, thereby generating excited state species (singlet or triplets) or radicals as a result of photo-ionization. The second major process involves indirect oxidation of targets via the formation and subsequent reactions of singlet oxygen (
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub>). Antioxidant enzymes that eliminate 
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub> have not evolved. Instead, the highly reactive 
 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub> can interact with potential targets by either physical quenching or a chemical reaction. The former results in energy transfer and de-excitation of the singlet state but no chemical change in the energy acceptor. The latter causes modification of the target and in the initiation of radical type reactions [
