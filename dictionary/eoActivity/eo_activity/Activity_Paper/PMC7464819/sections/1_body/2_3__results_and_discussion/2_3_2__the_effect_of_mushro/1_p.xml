<p>Considering the variety of mushroom compounds that can act as antioxidants, various extraction procedures have been proposed to study the antioxidant activity of mushrooms. Comparing the yields of ethanol and hot water extractions for various mushroom species, it was observed that ethanol only accounted for 5.89–18.89% of solids, while hot water fraction accounted for 38.3–57.2% of total solids [

 <italic>P. citrinopileatus</italic> have shown a greater bioactivity in vitro of the cold aqueous extract compared to the hot water extract due to protein denaturation and degradation of phenolic compounds at high temperatures [

 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> were studied to assess the effects of UV irradiation. The water-soluble fraction of 
 <italic>P. ostreatus</italic> accounted for 54% of solids, while the ethanol-insoluble fraction was 7.2% of solids (

 <italic>A. bisporus</italic>, i.e., 69%, but the percentage of ethanol-insoluble fraction was lower, i.e., 3.3% (
