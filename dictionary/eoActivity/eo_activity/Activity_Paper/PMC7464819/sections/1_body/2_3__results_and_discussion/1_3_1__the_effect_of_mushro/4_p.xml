<p>To perform this simulation, three studies were considered to define the most appropriate target foods and fortification levels, namely, a study in line with the regulation dealing with vitamin D fortification in the United States and Canada [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a study considering the European regulation scenario on vitamin D fortification [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and a study aimed at exploring food matrices for vitamin D fortification in low/lower-middle income countries [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-09-01087" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These latter studies defined somewhat different fortification strategies due to different dietary habits and needs of the populations involved and to different regulations of the countries of interest. In any case, it can be observed that very low fortification levels of mushroom powder, in the range 0.03 to 0.38 g/100 g of food, could lead to the target fortification level, thus confirming the potential role of irradiation technology in increasing the intake of vitamin D (
