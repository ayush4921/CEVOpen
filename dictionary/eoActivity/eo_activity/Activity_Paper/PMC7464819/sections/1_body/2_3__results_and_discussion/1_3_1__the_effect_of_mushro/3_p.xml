<p>The yield of vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> formation upon irradiation was previously found to depend on conditions that can be controlled during processing, such as the light source, the distance between the lamp and the mushroom, temperature and the duration of the irradiation. However, the yield also depends on factors that cannot be controlled, such as the shape of mushroom, which conditions the surface exposed to light and the moisture levels, that varies during drying [

 <sub>2</sub> content by mixing the treated powder with untreated powder. Hence, considering a target final value for vitamin D
 <sub>2</sub> of 40 Âµg/g d.w., a simulation was conducted to calculate the amount of irradiated powder that could be necessary to fortify vehicle foods in order to achieve health benefits (
