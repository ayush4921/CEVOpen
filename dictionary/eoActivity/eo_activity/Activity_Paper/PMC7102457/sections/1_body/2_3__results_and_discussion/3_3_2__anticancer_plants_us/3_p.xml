<p>In addition, some of the plant species recapitulated have been documented in the treatment of cancer globally; for example; 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> L., 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (L.) G. Don, and 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> (Hook.f.) Kalkman were reported to be used for traditional treatment of cervical, colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers [

 <italic>Albizia coriaria</italic> Welw. ex Oliver, 
 <italic>Capsicum frutescens</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Kigelia africana</italic> (Lam.) Benth. has been reported for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma, throat, and breast cancers in Kenya [

 <italic>Zanthoxylum chalybeum</italic> Engl. is used in Ethiopia and Tanzania for the treatment of breast and cervical cancers [

 <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>], 
 <italic>Blighia unijugata</italic> Baker is used for the treatment of breast and cervical cancers in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>], while 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (DC.) Stapf is used against colorectal cancer in Kenya [
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. Interestingly, some of these plants are consumed as food spices; for example, 
 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> (DC.) Stapf is used by most communities in Northern Uganda who cannot afford tea (
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (L.) Kuntze) leaves, and 
 <italic>Beta vulgaris</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Daucus carota</italic> L. are common ingredients in Ugandan culinary recipes [
