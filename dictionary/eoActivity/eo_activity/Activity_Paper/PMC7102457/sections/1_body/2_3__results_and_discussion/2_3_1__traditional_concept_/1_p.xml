<p>From the electronic survey, it is clear that local communities in Uganda have some information about cancer. Not all Ugandans are fully aware of cancer because most information on it is disseminated through television and radio stations which not all have access to.

 <italic>Arachis hypogea</italic> L.) pastes as substitutes for refined cooking oil and vaseline with the belief that the latter are carcinogenic is known. Unfortunately, recent reports have pointed out that some of these food items are contaminated with mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxins which are potential carcinogens [
