<p>At present, clinical trials utilizing standardized extracts of anticancer plants reported in Uganda or their bioactive compounds have not been done with the exception of 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> (Hook.f.) Kalkman and 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (L.) G. Don. which have been investigated in other countries [
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>]. Prostafx, Tadenan, and Pygenil are some of the herbal preparations of 
 <italic>Prunus africana</italic> (Hook.f.) Kalkman on the market. Due to the paucity of data generated from preclinical tests (pharmacokinetic and toxicological studies) and the regulatory requirements for clinical studies, the safety and efficacy of traditional anticancer plant preparations used in Uganda remain a secret yet to be unveiled. Although there are many research institutes such as Uganda Virus Research Institute, Natural Chemotherapeutic Research Institute, Uganda Industrial Research Institute, and National Agricultural Research Institute, none is designed to have an in-depth focus on drug discovery and development to the level of commercialization. Thus, the government of Uganda should establish an institute that handles drug discovery and development to enhance the utilization of medicinal plants in Uganda.
