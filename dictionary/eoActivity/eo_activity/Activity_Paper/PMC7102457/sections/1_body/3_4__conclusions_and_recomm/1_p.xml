<p>The inventory of plants utilized by Ugandan communities presents considerable potential for the treatment of cancer. 
 <italic>Cyperus alatus</italic> (Nees) F. Muell, 
 <italic>Ficus dawei</italic> Hutch
 <italic>, Ficus natalensis</italic> Hochst, and 
 <italic>Lovoa trichilioides</italic> Harms are some of the plants with claimed anticancer potential that have been hardly studied and therefore warrant further investigations. More ethnobotanical surveys should be done in the unsurveyed districts to identify other potential anticancer plants. 
 <italic>Albizia coriaria</italic> Welw. ex Oliver which doubles as an antivenin plant will be investigated for its anticancer potential in a penultimate study.
