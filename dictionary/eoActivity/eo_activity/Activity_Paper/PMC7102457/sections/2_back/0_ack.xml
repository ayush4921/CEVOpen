 <p>TO, DMN, PN, LNK, AJ, AM, BJK, IM, CKN, and MKC are grateful to the World Bank and the Inter-University Council of East Africa for the scholarship awarded to them through the Africa Center of Excellence II in Phytochemicals, Textiles, and Renewable Energy (ACE II PTRE) hosted at Moi University that prompted this concerted ethnomedical communication. The authors commend preceding authors for their useful quest for knowledge on medicinal plants in Uganda, the reports of which this study was based.</p>
