<p>In this study, we used a semi-structured questionnaire to conduct the interviews. The target subjects were shops that sold self-prepared qīng-căo-chá tea according to information found on the internet or provided by various local medicinal plant-related organizations. The studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Regional Research Ethics Center (CRREC-107-019). The patients/participants provided their written informed consent to participate in this study. Among a total of 86 visited shops, 42 participated in a complete interview, whereas 27 refused to participate in the interview, 13 only provided public information on the formula used in the shop, and 4 did not sell qīng-căo-chá tea. During the interview, in addition to written records, audio and video recordings were made, and photographs were taken with the permission of the interviewees. The origins of all medicinal materials (samples retained at the Department of Pharmacy, China Medical University) were identified by Dr. Shyh-Shyun Huang (Associate Professor, School of Pharmacy, China Medical University). The herbarium voucher is placed in the department of Chinese Pharmaceutical Sciences and Chinese Medicine Resources, China medical university.</p>
