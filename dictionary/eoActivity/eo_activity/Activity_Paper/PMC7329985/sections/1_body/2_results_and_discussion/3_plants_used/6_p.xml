<p>In addition, in this study, we found that some raw materials used for qīng-căo-chá tea were prepared from different plant species (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 3</bold>
 </xref>) that were often mixed. For example, 
 <italic>Artemisia capillaris</italic> Thunb. and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. were both used as source plants of the oriental wormwood herb, and both 
 <italic>Oldenlandia diffusa</italic> (Willd.) Roxb. and 
 <italic>Oldenlandia corymbosa</italic> L. were the source plants of the spreading hedyotis herb without differentiation. This use habit is a common source of confusion in Taiwan's medicinal material market. These plants are still being mixed up, probably due to their similar appearance or common name, and no safety concern has been reported regarding their use. The confusion of some closely related species appears to be a major feature in the use of medicinal materials in Taiwan.
