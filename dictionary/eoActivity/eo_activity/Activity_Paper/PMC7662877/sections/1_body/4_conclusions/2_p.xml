<p id="p0180">These data suggest that methanol extract from 
 <italic>Piper capense</italic> fruits is non-toxic at doses lower than 1000 mg/kg body weight/day but could nevertheless be toxic at doses above 1000 mg/kg body weight/day; therefore, we strongly discourage its consumption at higher doses for therapeutic purposes. Finally, this edible plant is a potential pharmaceutical agent that deserves further in-depth toxicity studies. One of the limitations of this study is the characterization of the phytochemical constituents, and mostly the bioactive as well as potentially toxic constituents of the tested methanol extract. However, this work is ongoing and constitutes the aim of our further investigations.
