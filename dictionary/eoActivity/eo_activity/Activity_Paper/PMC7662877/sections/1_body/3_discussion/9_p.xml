<p id="p0160">The primary function of the kidneys is to eliminate toxic waste produced by the normal functioning of the body and transported by the blood. Therefore, the evaluation of its excretory products accompanied by histological studies give enough information on the proper functioning of the kidneys. Also, an abnormal increase in creatinine or serum urea level would be the consequence of a renal damage caused by

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Palm and Lundblad, 2005</xref>). In this study, no significant difference was observed in serum creatinine levels between the control and test groups in either sexes. The amount of urea did not differ in female rats (no significant difference) between the control and the test groups, while there was a significant increase at different treatment doses compared to the control group in male rats. We also observed a significant decrease in urinary protein levels in female rats and in urinary creatinine levels in male rats. These results suggest a possible renal alteration of male rats following the consumption of 
 <italic>P.Â capense</italic> fruits extract.
