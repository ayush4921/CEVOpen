<p id="p0030">The plant was ground and the powder obtained macerated in methanol in the proportions 1:3 (w/v) for 48 h at room temperature followed by filtration using Whatman No. 1 paper. The filtrate obtained was evaporated using a rotary evaporator (BÜCHI R-200) at 65 °C allowing recovery of a crude extract that was stored at -25 °C; after evaporation of the solvent in the rotary evaporator, the extract was dried in an oven for 4–6 h to allow complete vaporization of the residual solvent.</p>
