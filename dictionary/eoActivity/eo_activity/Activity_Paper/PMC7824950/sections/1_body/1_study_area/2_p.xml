<p id="Par24">Kisantu and Mbanza-Ngungu are predominantly inhabited by the Ntându and Ndibu ethnic groups, respectively, which are part of the Kongo people who inhabit an area that stretches from Congo-Brazzaville to Angola [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. They share the same culture inherited from the ancient Kongo kingdom. The use of herbal medicine is well-rooted in their customs and habits. However, the Ntându culture has been strongly influenced by westernization and Christianity, whereas the Ndibu people have remained much attached to the traditional, ancestral Kongo religious practices [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Kisantu and Mbanza-Ngungu are interconnected, influence each other, and therefore share most socio-economic and cultural realities. They are both located in a Province where poverty is general and widespread. The health indicators for this province show a very worrying situation. These include the low coverage and precariousness of the health system (one general reference hospital for 126,700 inhabitants, one doctor for 17,356 inhabitants, one pharmacist for 131,069 inhabitants, one hospital bed for 514 inhabitants, one reference health center for 50,013 inhabitants) and low utilization of health services (49% for curative care) [
