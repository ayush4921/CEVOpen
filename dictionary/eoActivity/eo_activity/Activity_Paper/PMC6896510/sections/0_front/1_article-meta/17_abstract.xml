 <p>Although paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity has been demonstrated to be a reliable biomarker of various diseases, clinical studies have been based only on relative comparison of specific enzyme activities, which capture differences mainly due to (usually unknown) PON1 concentration. Hence, the aim of this report is to present for the first time the simple evaluation method for determining autonomous kinetic parameter of PON1 that could be also associated with polymorphic forms and diseases; i.e. the Michaelis constant which is enzyme concentration independent quantity. This alternative approach significantly reduces the number of experiments needed, and it yields the results with great accuracy.</p>
