 <italic>miltiorrhiza</italic> with 112 up-regulated and 175 down-regulated, and they mainly belong to lipids and lipid-like molecules, phenylpropanoid and polyketides, and Benzenoids. And these differential metabolites are mainly enriched in the pathway of linoleic acid metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Total of 80 metabolites exclusively detected mainly belong to carboxylic acids and derivatives, polyketides, fatty acyls and flavonoids. Among them, 31 and 49 are detected in SSM and NSSM, respectively. A total of 23 metabolites that belong to tanshinones and salvianolic acids had been identified, and 11 metabolites content was changed significantly after
