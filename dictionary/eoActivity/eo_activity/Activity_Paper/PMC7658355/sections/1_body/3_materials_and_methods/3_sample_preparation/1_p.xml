<p id="Par27">The powdery samples (80 mg) after being precisely weighed were transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, and two small steel balls were added to each tube. Two internal standards 17:0 Lyso PC (1-heptadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), 0.01 mg/mL; (20 μL each) (L-2-chlorophenylalanine), 0.3 mg/ mL, both of them were prepared with methanol and 1 mL mixture of methanol and water (3/7, v/v) were added to each sample, and the samples were pre-cooled at − 20 ℃ for 2 min. Then the samples were ground at 60 Hz for 2 min, and stood under ultrasonication at ambient temperature for 30 min, and placed at − 20 ℃ in refrigerator for 20 min. Samples were centrifuged at a speed of 13,000 rpm, 4 °C for 10 min. 300 μL of supernatant in a brown glass vial was dried in a freeze concentration centrifugal dryer, and then added 400 μL mixture of methanol and water (1/4, v/v) to each sample, vortex for 30 s, and ultrasonicated for 2 min. Samples were centrifuged again at 13,000 rpm, 4 ℃ for 10 min. The supernatants (about 150 μL) from each tube were collected using crystal syringes, filtered through microfilters at 0.22 μm and transferred to LC vials, and stored at − 80 °C for LC–MS analysis. QC samples were prepared by mixing aliquots of 6 SSM and 6 NSSM to be a pooled sample, and used to balance the chromatography-mass spectrometer system.</p>
