<p id="Par22">Tanshinones and Salvianolic acids are the two kinds of characteristic bioactive compounds possessing magnificent bioactivities in Danshen. In this untargeted metabolomic study, a total of 23 specific compounds of Tanshinones and Salvianolic acids had been detected (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">6</xref>), and there was significant difference in content of 11 of them. And among these 11 characteristic differential metabolites, 7 metabolites content increased while 4 decreased in SSM compared with NSSM. In addition, there was the largest increase in the Salvianolic acid G content while the greatest reduction in the 3, 4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde content of SSM compared to NSSM. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Correlating our previous study on Chromatographic Fingerprint of 10 target characteristic metabolites

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>, we can come to the conclusion that there was a change in most of Tanshinones and Salvianolic acids content after 
 <italic>“Sweating”</italic>. We suggest that a transcriptomic (We had confirmed there was no degradation in total RNA after “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>”) or a proteomic study should be performed to investigate the change in genes or enzymes of Danshen during “
 <italic>Sweating</italic>” processing to explain the change of metabolites content of SSM.
