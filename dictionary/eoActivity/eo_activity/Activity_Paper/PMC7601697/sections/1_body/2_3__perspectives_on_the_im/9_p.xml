<p>For example, the use of hydroxyapatite-based dental composite in the dental sector requires the development of tailored occupational exposure scenario. This paste can be grinded, polished or shaped during the application by the dentist, who could be exposed to airborne nanoparticles if not adequately protected [

This and similar exposure scenarios involving processing of artificial joints during replacement surgeries are of potentially high concern and their possible risks should be investigated, especially in the case the relevant exposure routes are different from those already assessed for intentional administration/use of the products by patients.
