<p>In the paragraphs above, the RMF has been presented from a life cycle perspective, however it is worth considering that the strategies composing the framework can play different roles and can be applied at different levels of detail across the stages of the innovation process. The R&amp;D phases of a medicinal product include the non-clinical discovery phase (identification of target and preliminary candidates, pre-clinical studies for the optimisation of candidates and selection of a drug candidate for clinical testing), the clinical phases (phase I, II, III) and the post-marketing pharmacovigilance [

In the early non-clinical discovery phase industries typically rely on existing data and/or less expensive screening-level assessments by means, for example, of in silico modelling or in vitro testing approaches. For instance, data read-across from similar materials or applications can be used to identify suitable candidates for further testing, or to remove potentially toxic materials from a candidate shortlist. Later, benefit-risk analysis methods are applied to support regulatory decisions about authorisation of new MD or ATMP, when they are used to integrate data gathered through pre-clinical tests and clinical trials. In the post-marketing stage, benefit-risk analysis may be required again to weigh and integrate evidence provided by pharmacovigilance of new products. In general, approaches and methods used for risk assessment and management and benefit-risk analysis could be used in an iterative way along the innovation processes, providing at each stage new information which can support further development and assessment of the product and its production processes.
