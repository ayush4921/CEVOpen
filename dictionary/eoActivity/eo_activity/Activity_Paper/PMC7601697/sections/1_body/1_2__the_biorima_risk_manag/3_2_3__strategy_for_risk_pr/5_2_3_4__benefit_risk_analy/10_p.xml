<p>In 2009, EMA established a 3-year research program whose purpose was ‘to develop and test tools and processes for balancing multiple benefits and risks as an aid to informed regulatory decisions about medicinal products’ [

According to the results of this study, the prominent form of benefit risk analysis framework is multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), although these have been mostly academic to date. The EMA has participated in the development of MCDA frameworks such as PrOACT-URL (problem formulation, objectives, alternatives consequences, trade-offs, uncertainties, risk tolerance) [

Additionally, the pharmaceutical industry has also developed benefit-risk assessment such as the PhRMA BRAT framework (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Benefit-Risk Action Team), a six step process that focuses on documenting rationale for decisions [

However, ideally a systematic, transparent and structured regulatory decision-making process is required that is of use to all stakeholders. The development of the UMBRA (Universal Methodology for Benefit-Risk Assessment) framework makes steps towards this structured regulatory decision-making process as it incorporates several frameworks (PrOACT-URL, PhRMA BRAT and FDA 5-step framework) [
