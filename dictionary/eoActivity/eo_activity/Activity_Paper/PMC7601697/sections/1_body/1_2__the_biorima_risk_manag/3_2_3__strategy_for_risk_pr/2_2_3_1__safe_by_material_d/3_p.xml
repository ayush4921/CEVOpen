<p>Overall, the SbMD approach addresses safety issues at the early design stage of nano-enabled products. These issues should be formally assessed at the appropriate ‘Design Reviews’, mandatory for EMA and FDA compliance and ‘Best Practice’ for new product developments. Nevertheless, safety is not an intrinsic property of materials and the goal of safer materials can only be achieved if predictive risk assessment tools are also available that are robust and easily implementable to guide material selection and product design. These concepts are not new in both (a) drug discovery and developments and (b) ATMP where early in vitro or in silico screening is used as part of an overall risk reduction or risk mitigation strategy. It is expected that they can be successfully introduced into NBMs manufacturing processes prior to addressing detailed toxicological testing and regulation. Within the hierarchy of controls, SbMD can be allocated at the substitution level where a more hazardous material is replaced by a less hazardous material.</p>
