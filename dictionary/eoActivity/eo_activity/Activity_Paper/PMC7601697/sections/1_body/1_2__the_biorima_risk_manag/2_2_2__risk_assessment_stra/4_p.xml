<p>The IATA are also strongly influenced by the type of NBM to be investigated as well as the exposure route. The exposure/administration route and frequency determine important parameters such as relevant timepoints, dispersant/matrix and controls to be used in experimental testing. Each IATA is therefore tailored to address the physicochemical characteristics of the NBM, the likely route(s) of exposure or environmental compartments, the frequency of exposure and the needs of the risk assessor (e.g., regulator or developer during early innovation). </p>
