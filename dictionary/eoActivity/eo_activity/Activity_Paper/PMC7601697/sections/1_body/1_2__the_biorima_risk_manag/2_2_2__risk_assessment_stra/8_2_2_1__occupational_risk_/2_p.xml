<p>The detailed characterisation of intrinsic physicochemical and extrinsic properties of the NBMs and medicinal products made thereof is essential to understand and predict their emissions/release and exposure, and to interpret the available toxicological data [
 <xref rid="B33-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) provided a recommended list of nanomaterial properties that should be measured as part of a Chemical Safety Assessment for nanomaterials [
 <xref rid="B34-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and the characterisation methods to measure physicochemical properties of manufactured nanomaterials [
 <xref rid="B35-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] are generally applicable also to NBMs used in medicine.
