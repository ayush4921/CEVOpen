<p>Since 2003, pharmaceutical companies have adopted the FDA scheme for process analytical control (PAC) of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To control complex batch or continuous processes to manufacture API, a large number of inputs from low-functionality process sensors (e.g., pressure, temperature, flow, level and massâ€”P, T, F, L and M) is collected. These are linked to electrical controllers in nested hierarchical systems which may contain several distributed control systems coordinator control systems and in the case of very large manufacturing plants, super coordinator control systems. </p>
