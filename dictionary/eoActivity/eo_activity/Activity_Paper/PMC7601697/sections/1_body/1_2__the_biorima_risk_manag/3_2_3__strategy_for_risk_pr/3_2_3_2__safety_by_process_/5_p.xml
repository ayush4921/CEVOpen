<p>In PAC strategies it is essential to have specific high-information content analysers on-line at critical stages in the process. These are coupled to closed-loop control systems. Such analysers might be Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman and infrared (IR) spectrometers, or mass spectrometers. They could also involve process tomography or automated sample and flow injection analysis through ‘lab-on-a chip’ biosensor devices or particle sizers. During the pilot plant development stage, the process parameters (P, T, F, L and M) together with reagent quantities and additives, are varied to enable the process to be optimised simultaneously for product yield, quality and process profitability. Importantly, in silico methods (e.g., nano-QSARs) are included in these calculations to minimise risks. Once optimised and tested by multivariate process modelling for the full-scale plant, all manufacturing specifications and control set points are then fixed. This guarantees that both ‘pilot’ and ‘full scale’ process plants will produce products of identical quality. These approaches collectively form the core part of safe-by-process design. It allows batches of products to be prepared for: (i) safety (‘

This work can continue while the full-scale plant is being built and commissioned, thus shortening the time to market but guaranteeing the best possible products within a process intensification perspective [
