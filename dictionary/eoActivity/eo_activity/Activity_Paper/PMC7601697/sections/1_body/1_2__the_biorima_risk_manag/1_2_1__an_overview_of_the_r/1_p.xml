<p>The RMF is outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="materials-13-04532-f001">Figure 1</xref>. It is designed to facilitate risk-benefit analysis of NBMs applied in MD and ATMP for patients, as well as assessment of their occupational and environmental risks from a life cycle perspective. In cases of unacceptable risks, the RMF supports the identification of adequate risk control measures. The life cycle stages are not listed in the typical order (i.e., synthesis &gt; formulation &gt; use &gt; end-of-life treatment), but rather according to different exposure assessment targets: on the left side the stages where unintentional exposure of workers or environmental targets can occur, including unintentional exposure of medical professionals; on the right side the use stage where patients are intentionally exposed for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.
