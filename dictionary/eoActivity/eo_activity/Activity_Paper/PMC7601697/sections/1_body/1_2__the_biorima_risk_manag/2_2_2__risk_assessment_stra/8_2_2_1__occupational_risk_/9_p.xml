<p>For any biomaterial or NBM intended for clinical use, the issue of testing for endotoxin content is of paramount importance [
 <xref rid="B60-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The BIORIMA project has focused considerable efforts on the evaluation of assays for endotoxin testing, including the conventional Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. Furthermore, the concept of the bio-corona (i.e., the adsorbed surface layer of proteins and other biomolecules) is being evaluated using biofluids that are representative of different biological/anatomical compartments. The bio-corona has received a great deal of attention in recent years in the nano-bio research field and it is known to affect the interaction of NMs with cells and tissues [
