<p>However, as pointed out by Halamoda-Kenzaoui et al., 2019 [
 <xref rid="B10-materials-13-04532" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], for some endpoints such as drug release/loading and the interaction of nanomedicines with the immune system no standards are available so far. This creates a potential Catch-22 situation inasmuch as the anticipation of standardisation needs require a good understanding on the regulatory information for nanomedicines while, on the other hand, robust datasets allowing firm conclusions in regard to regulatory demands are not yet available [

Efforts are currently being made across several EU-funded projects including BIORIMA to develop robust test methods for hazard assessment of NBMs to set the stage for standardisation of NBMs in MD and ATMP while the REFINE (Regulatory Science Framework for Nano(bio)material-based Medical Products and Devices) project recently issued a report to highlight regulatory needs in nanomedicine [
