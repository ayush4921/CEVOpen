This work is based on a comprehensive review of regulatory requirements and research trends related to the risk management of nano(bio)medical technologies, which was performed with the aim of collecting information and data to inform a subsequent expert discussion. Selected experts from the BIORIMA consortium formed three working groups, namely (a) human health and ecological risk assessment, (b) benefit-risk analysis, (c) risk prevention, control and monitoring, depending on their field of expertise, and each group worked on developing/describing the corresponding parts of the framework. The draft framework was presented to stakeholders during the 1st BIORIMA Stakeholder Workshop held in Valencia in November 2018 that brought together more than 40 participants from industry, research and regulatory institutions (cf.

Workshop participants were asked to comment on the proposed framework through guided discussions during three break-out sessions and a final plenary discussion and this resulted in constructive feedback by the stakeholders, which was incorporated in the current version of the RMF, presented here.
