<p>All analyses were performed on isolate LN303 and finally backed up by results from 
 <italic>Akanthomyces</italic> spp. originating from two other plant individuals (LN276, LN528). Additionally, isolates LN401 and LN427 were screened for compounds 
 <bold>1–3</bold> using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analyses. Emestrin was produced by all 
 <italic>Akanthomyces</italic> isolates in different concentrations; however, akanthenin A and B remained exclusive to LN303. After fermentation on rice media, dichloromethane:methanol (2:1) extracts yielded 2.593 g of dry matter for LN303 (from 20 flasks), 0.412 g for LN276 (from 5 flasks), 0.229 g for LN528, 0.363 g for LN401, and 0.252 g for LN427 (from 1 flask each). Antibiotic bioassays with LN303 total extract yielded an interesting broad-spectrum antibiotic profile against all fungal test organisms—
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> ,and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>—and against the Gram-negative bacterium 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. No activity was detected against Gram-positive 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The total extract was subjected to analytical and semipreparative reversed-phase high pressure LC (HPLC) using a C-18 column and antibiotic bioassays. Initial fractionation yielded seven fractions, of which fraction 4 was antibiotically active (
