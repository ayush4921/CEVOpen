The only known natural product matching this accurate mass and sum formula is emestrin, alternatively named emestrin A, a mycotoxin produced by several unrelated fungi such as multiple

 </sup> Structure elucidation of 
 <bold>3</bold> by 1D NMR indicated a polycyclic ring system consisting of a sulfur-bridged diketopiperazine moiety, an unsaturated bicyclic ring system, and two trisubstituted benzene substructures. Further analysis by 2D NMR methods (COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) proved that the structure of 
 <bold>3</bold> was identical to that of emestrin (

 </sup> We recorded NMR data in the latter solvent because it can be readily evaporated, and the compound can be used in bioassays (purity &gt; 95%). The obtained
