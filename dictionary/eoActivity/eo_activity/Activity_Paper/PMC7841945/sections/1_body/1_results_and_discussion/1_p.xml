Genomic DNA was isolated from pure fungal cultures, and the large ribosomal subunit region (LSU) was sequenced and referenced to the GenBank database using the Basic Logical Alignment Search Tool (BLASTn). Phylogenetic analysis including closely related reference strains from the family Cordycipitaceae identified the fungal isolates as 
 <italic>Akanthomyces</italic> spp.

 <italic>Akanthomyces</italic> spp. are known as entomopathogenic fungi which symbiotically defend their host plant against insect herbivores. 
 <italic>Akanthomyces</italic> spp. can colonize insects rapidly and form fruiting bodies (stromata) with sexual spores.
