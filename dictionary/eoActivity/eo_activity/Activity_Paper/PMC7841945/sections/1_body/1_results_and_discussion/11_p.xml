<p>LC–MS analyses of the total extracts of the five studied 
 <italic>Akanthomyces</italic> sp. strains demonstrated that emestrin is present as an abundant compound in all five isolates. Interestingly, an isomer was detected that eluted at minute 20.0 from the C-18 HPLC column shortly before emestrin did, which eluted after 20.2–20.4 min. The relative abundance of this isomer compared to emestrin decreased significantly in the order LN276 &gt; LN303 &gt; LN528 ∼ LN427 &gt; LN401 (

Despite the identical sum formula and very similar polarity, the fragmentation patterns differed significantly between the two isomers (

Unfortunately, attempts to isolate this isomer did not yield sufficient amounts for structure elucidation.
