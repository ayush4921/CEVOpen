<p>Antibiotic activity of extracts and fractions was evaluated using 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> strain 168 (Gram-positive), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain DH5α (Gram-negative), 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> BY4742 (yeast), and 
 <italic>F. graminearum</italic> CBS 112.30 as well as 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> CBS 110271 representing filamentous fungi. Methanolic total extracts, fractions, or pure compounds were applied onto a previously autoclaved paper disc (Whatman GE Healthcare Life Sciences, USA) and dried under sterile conditions before being placed onto specific growth media inoculated with the test organisms. Both bacteria were grown on luria agar at 37 °C for 12 h, yeast was cultivated on yeast extract peptone dextrose agar (YPD) at 28 °C for 12 h and both filamentous fungi were grown on PDA at 24 °C for 96 h before inspection. Activities were recorded as partial or complete inhibition zones and the respective diameter of inhibition zones along with positive (antibacterial bioassays: tetracyclin 10 μg; antifungal bioassays: nystatin 500 μg) and negative controls (methanol). 50 μL of total extracts, fractions, and the negative control methanol was applied; in the case of pure compounds, 100 μg was administered.
