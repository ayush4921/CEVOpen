<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>O. integrifolia</italic> were collected from Tulu Dimtu, North West Shewa, Oromiya, around 29 km southeast of Addis Ababa, in December 2017. The plant was authenticated by a senior botanist and a voucher specimen (AD001) was kept at the National Herbarium, College of Natural and Computational Sciences, Addis Ababa University. The leaves were cleaned under a running tap water and dried under shade. Then a grinder was used to coarsely powder the dried leaves.
