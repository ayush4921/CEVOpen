<p>As depicted in the result, the hydroalcoholic extract of 
 <italic>O. integrifolia</italic> possess important phytochemicals which might explain the above pharmacological activities of the extract. For instance, quercetin and rutin are flavonoids which exhibit substantial anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity via inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) in immune cells and activating nitric oxide mediated ATP-dependent potassium channels signaling pathways in neuronal cells.
