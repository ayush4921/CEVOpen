<p>During the observation prolonged reaction time was recorded for the experimental groups (OI200 and OI400) and positive control (MO10) in the hot plate test (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However the lower dose (OI100) compared to the negative control showed no significant change in the latency time. The latency time observed was variable across the experimental groups. MO10 and OI400 significantly enhanced the latency time with 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 at 30 min compared to DW group. At 60 min all the mice receiving the test substance were bettered by the positive control (MO10). However, the OI200 and OI400 at 90 and 120 min revealed significant upturn in latency. At 120 min OI400 and MO10 bring about significant rise (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.01) in latency compared to negative control.
