<p>The 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> of each drug was extracted using IrGO (Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology), and stored in a separate table called “DrugMizaj.” Currently consisting of an ontology for 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic>, IrGO was used to determine the 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> type and degree of drug monographs based on the existence of the keywords in the “Mizaj” field. For each drug with a “Mizaj” description, one or more rows, depending on whether other scholars' views were quoted in the text, were added to “DrugMizaj.” The resulting table contains information regarding the ID of drugs, the scholar from whom the specified 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> was quoted, “
 <italic>MizajType</italic>” and hotness, coldness, wetness, and dryness degrees collectively named “
 <italic>MizajDegree</italic>.” The extracted types and degrees were linked to the IrGO database.
