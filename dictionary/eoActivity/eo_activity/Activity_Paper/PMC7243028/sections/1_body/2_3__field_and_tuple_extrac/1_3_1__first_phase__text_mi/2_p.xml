<p>Each drug and its description were separated using regular expressions and stored in the “Drug” table. Aghili has used certain words to demarcate the beginning of each part in the drug monograph description, which were used to separate the information of each field. Following extraction of the mentioned fields from the text, the string (a sequence of characters) not pertaining to any of those keywords was labelled as the “Expression” field of that drug, which mainly consisted of the pronunciation and synonyms. The descriptive pronunciations in the “Expression” field were manually translated into International phonetic alphabets (IPA) and stored in the “Pronunciation” field. The abovementioned fields, namely, “DrugName”; “Mizaj”; “Identity”; “Substitute”; “AdverseEffects”; “Actions&amp;MedicinalUses”; “Dosage”; and “Remarks” constituted the primary fields for each drug monograph. To determine the synonyms provided for each drug monograph, a list comprising all languages, dialects, and scholar names mentioned in the text was prepared, and subsequently, terms that followed the words in this list in the “Expression” and “Identity” fields were determined as the synonyms of drug monographs and stored in the “Synonym” table.</p>
