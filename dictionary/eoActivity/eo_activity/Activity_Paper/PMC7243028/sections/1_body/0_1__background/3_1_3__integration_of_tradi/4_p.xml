<p>To address the data integration problem, we created Universal Natural Products Resource (UNaProd), a database of medicinal substances consisting of 2696 drug monographs based on an encyclopedia of ITM 
 <italic>materia medica</italic>, i.e., 
 <italic>Makhzan al-Advieh</italic>, a foundation on which more comprehensive databases of ITM can be built. This database will help exploit knowledge from ITM resources in a number of ways. Firstly, ITM may be expressed in a terminology that can be used by modern medicine. Second, the relationships between ITM concepts will be more precisely determined, which will in turn unveil the underlying biological system of this medical school. Third, providing justifications for traditional use of plants by linking them to their associated compounds will facilitate integration of ITM with both allopathic medicine and other traditional medical systems including TCM. Fourth, it will provide an extensive range of options for discovery of new drugs. As a time- and money-consuming process, new drug discovery will indeed be facilitated through utilizing the connections ITM has established between a medicinal substance and a specific disease.
