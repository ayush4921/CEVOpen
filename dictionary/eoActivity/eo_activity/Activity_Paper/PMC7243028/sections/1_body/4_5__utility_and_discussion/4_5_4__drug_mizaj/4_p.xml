<p>The 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> type and degree of UNaProd drug monographs have been also demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in more detail. The active quality lies in a range from coldness in maximum fourth degree to hotness in maximum fourth degree, while passive quality ranges from dryness in maximum fourth degree to wetness in maximum fourth degree. There are a number of instances where Aghili has only described the 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> type but not the degree. For example, 
 <italic>Khatai</italic> tea has a hot and dry 
 <italic>Mizaj</italic> but neither the degree of hotness nor dryness has been specified. To demonstrate these drug monographs in the scatter plot, DNS factors have been added to each axis (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Out of the total 1249 hotness degrees and 441 coldness degrees, 448 and 227 were unspecified, respectively. Regarding passive qualities, there were 148 and 442 unspecified degrees out of the 386 and 1480 existing degrees for wetness and dryness degrees, respectively.
