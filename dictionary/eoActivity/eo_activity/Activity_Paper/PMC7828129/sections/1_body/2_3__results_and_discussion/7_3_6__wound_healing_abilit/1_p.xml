<p>Foot ulcer is one of the threatening complications of DM, which could be serious if left untreated. About 14–25% of diabetic patients have the complication of foot ulcer. The fibroblast cells-based wound scratch assay is one of the inexpensive and well-recognized techniques to understand the wound-healing efficiency of natural products [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. There are plenty of plant extracts playing an astonishing role in accelerating the healing process. But the possible mechanism behind their mode of action is still not understood properly. With this information, the cell migration assay was performed in fibroblasts of NIH 3T3 cells. Herein, the cells were treated with different concentrations (25, 50, 100 µg/mL) of Ht-EAF with an incubation period of 48 h. The cell-migration ability was captured for initial (0 h), mid (12 h and 24 h), and end of experimental period (48 h) and the wound closure distance was calculated using ImageJ software (

The untreated control cells showed a natural rate of cell migration, whereas the Ht-EAF showed a time-dependent manner of cell migration activity in NIH 3T3 cells. In all the cases, the natural rate of cell migration was notably lower than that of the tested concentration. A notable wound closure activity was noted for 100 µg/mL concentration of the extract.
