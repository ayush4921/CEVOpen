<p>Based on the findings of the GC-MS and antioxidant profile of the 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic>, the in-silico docking studies were also performed by ArgusLab 4.01 and the results were interpreted using BIOVIA discovery studio visualizer V20. Based on the Lipinski’s hypothesis [
 <xref rid="B71-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], the following phytocompounds of neochlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, 3-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)propan-1-amine, and feruloylquinic acid were selected as ligands (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-10-00099">Supplementary Table S2</xref>)The docking analysis was performed by calculating the binding free energy (δG) based on varying electrostatic, C-H bond, hydrogen bond, and hydrophobic interactions and van der Wall effects. All the docking scores lie within −6.99116 to −10.7399 kcal/mol (i.e., low energy value). The binding energies of neochlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, 3-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)propan-1-amine, and feruloylquinic acid against were −7.45264, −6.99116, −9.86082, −7.09424, and −8.61385 kcal/mol, respectively, with α-amylase and −10.7322, −8.28569, −10.632, −10.7379, −7.34669, and −9.31426 kcal/mol, respectively, with α-glycosidase.
