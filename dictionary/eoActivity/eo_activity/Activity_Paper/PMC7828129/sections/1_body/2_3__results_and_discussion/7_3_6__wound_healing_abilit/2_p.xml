<p>The elevated levels of glucose in diabetic patients cause physiological dysfunction leading to delayed wound-healing process. The major factors affecting the wound-healing mechanism are colonization of aerobic bacterial species and generation of excessive amount of ROS, which extend the inflammatory phase [

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus mutans, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are commonly associated with diabetic foot ulcer [
 <xref rid="B43-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The zone of inhibition studies and Live/Dead
 <sup>TM</sup> BacLight
 <sup>TM</sup> bacterial viability assay were performed to strengthen the findings of the wound-healing assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00099-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). The results were compared with standard antibiotic of tetracycline and all tested solvent fractions of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> exhibited marked antibacterial activity. The zone of inhibition was measured in the range of 1.24 to 17.35 mm. Among the tested fractions, ethyl acetate showed higher activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (17.35 ± 1.34) followed by 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (16.34 ± 1.09), 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (12.48 ± 1.27), and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (8.26 ± 0.61). These findings have also been confirmed by Live/Dead
 <sup>TM</sup> BacLight
 <sup>TM</sup> bacterial viability assay. Similar trend of results was also observed in case of ethyl acetate fraction treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00099-f004">Figure 4</xref>d). The above findings confirmed that ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> shows a significant antibacterial activity. This led us to know that phenolic content in the ethyl acetate fraction is responsible for its antibacterial activity. There are several literatures evidences for the anti-bacterial activity of the flavonoid-rich fraction of plants [
