<p>Based on the antioxidant and antidiabetic assays, the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> (Ht-EAF) was used for the GC-MS analysis (Agilent 7890A, 5975C integrated with a Saturn 2000 mass spectroscopy detector, temperature limits: 60–325 °C, ionization voltage: 70 eV, columns: Agilent J&amp;W GC columns (DB-5MS, 30 m × 0.25 mm with 0.25 µM thickness)). An aliquot of 1 µL of the sample was injected into the GC/MS apparatus. The operation conditions were: column oven program 60 °C (isothermal for 1 min) to 230 °C (isothermal for 3 min) at 3 °C/min and 250 °C for injection, detector temperature 300 °C. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1.2 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The W8N05ST.L mass spectral library was used to identify the phytochemical constituents.
