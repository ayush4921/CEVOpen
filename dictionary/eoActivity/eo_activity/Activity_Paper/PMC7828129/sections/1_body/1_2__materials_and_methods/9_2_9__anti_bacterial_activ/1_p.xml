<p>The antibacterial activity of Ht-EAF was screened by agar well diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B27-antioxidants-10-00099" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The bacterial cultures such us 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> were used to support the wound-healing activity. The bacterial samples were uniformly placed onto the surface of the MHA plate. Then, 20 µL of Ht-EAF sample (mg/mL) was carefully added to each well. The plates were incubated in upright position for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the zone of inhibition was recorded using a ruler. In addition, the Live/Dead
 <sup>TM</sup> BacLight
 <sup>TM</sup> bacterial viability assay (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) was performed to strengthen the results obtained from previously discussed methods. The assay was performed following manufacturer’s instructions. The microphotograph was documented by phase contrast microscope using a green filter (Olympus CKX53, Tokyo, Japan).
