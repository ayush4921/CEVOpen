<p>This study explored the QTOF-MS- and GC-MS-based phytochemical analysis of 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> extracts and documented in vitro antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and wound-healing properties. The preliminary phytochemical studies revealed that the extract was enriched with phenolic and flavonoid compounds, which are responsible for their antioxidant activity. In addition, α-amylase and α-glycosidase inhibition assays were performed to document the anti-diabetic index of the 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> methanolic extract and its active fractions. In vitro findings showed that ethyl acetate fraction of the 
 <italic>H. tuberosus</italic> did not show any remarkable cytotoxic features and there was no damage to the cell integrity tested with NIH3T3 cells. Besides, the ethyl acetate fraction has been shown to trigger the glucose uptake in IR-HepG2 and thereby reduce the diabetic condition. Our results suggest that the identified phytocompounds could reduce diabetes-related complications. As a future study, individual antidiabetic phytocompounds will be isolated and their anti-diabetic effects will be explored.
