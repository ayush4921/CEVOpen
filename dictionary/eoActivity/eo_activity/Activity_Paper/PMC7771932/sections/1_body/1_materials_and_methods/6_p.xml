<p>Gas chromatography mass spectrometric analysis was performed employing a GC coupled to Mass Hunter workstation software (Agilent 7890B GC with 5977A MSD, USA). Phenyl methyl siloxane %5 column, under pressure 6.0799 psi, the column temperature gradient was initiated at 40°C and a linear gradient was obtained by raising the temperature from 50 to 280 °C at the rate of 10°C/min. The injector was maintained at 290°C and 4 min solvent stopped. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Type of injection: pulsed splitless, molecular weight test range 35-650 m/z, test rate 1562 (N2). The extracts were filtered through syringe filters and 1 μl of ethanol extract was injected into the GC column and analyzed according to NIST library.</p>
