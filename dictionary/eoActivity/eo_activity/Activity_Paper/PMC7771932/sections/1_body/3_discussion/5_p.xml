<p>To our knowledge, itâ€™s a first report of apoptosis and cell cycle of S. monoica extracted by MAE against liver cancer cells HCAM. IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 
 <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> used to detect early and late apoptosis of HCAM cancer cells for 24h. The results showed late apoptosis (Q2= 48.5%,) higher than the control value of untreated cells (Q2= 42.1%,) and reduced early apoptosis value (Q1). Maybe the time of extract exposure could play a function in increasing of late apoptosis ratio in time independent. In addition, G1, S, G2 phases of HCAM cancer cells cycle identified via IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 
 <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> extract. The results showed reduced of G2 and S ratios, while increased G1 ratio in the treated cells compared with untreated cells. Indicated that 
 <italic>monoica Forssk</italic> ethanol extracted by MAE arrested liver cancer cells cycle at G1 phase.
