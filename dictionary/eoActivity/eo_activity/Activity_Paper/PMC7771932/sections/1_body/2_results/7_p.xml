<p>The prescreening of monoica extract showed an inhibition of growth cells ratio (40-50%) against liver cancer cells (HCAM) by MTT assay. MTT assay used to estimation of IC
 <sub>50</sub> for 24 h. GraphPad prism software used to estimate IC
 <sub>50</sub> and was equal to 541.7 Âµg/ml. Furthermore, AO/EB fluorescent staining used to detect apoptosis form in the morphological changes of treated and untreated HCAM cells, as showed in as shown in (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). AO/EB method supportd by flowcytometric analysis method for estimating early apoptosis, late apoptosis, necrosis, and live cells ratios of IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of monoics extract. The results of flowcytometric analysis showed that value of early apoptosis (Q1=4.9%), late apoptosis (Q2=48.5%), necrosis (Q3=3.28%) and live cells (Q4=43.3%) compared with the control values early apoptosis (Q1=14.7%), late apoptosis (Q2=19.4%), necrosis (Q3=11.4%) and live cells (Q4=54.5%). Likewise, flowcytometric analysis used to estimate and detect the phases (G1, S, G2) in cell cycle, as shown in (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4 (A,B,C,D)</xref>). S and G2 phases of cell cycle for HCAM cells treated with monoica extract showed values lower than the control, while G1 in the treated cells higher than control.
