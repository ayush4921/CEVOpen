 </sup>. Both the extract and its fractions (hexane, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate) produced AuNPs, showing a prominent peak at a range of 523–541 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The optimal extract or fractions concentration to produce AuNPs was also investigated. The high formation of AuNPs was obtained using 200 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of the extract or its fractions. Moreover, we verified a wider SPR band and turbidity signs in the AuNPs dispersion when the red propolis extract concentration was increased twofold (400 μg mL
