 <sup>−1</sup> in the AuNPs dispersions were smaller than the extract FTIR spectra (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), suggesting the oxidation of hydroxyl groups to carbonyl groups. It indicates that the OH groups present in BRP extract or fractions are the main compounds involved in the reduction of Au ions
