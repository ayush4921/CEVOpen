<p id="Par39">The Brazilian Red Propolis hydroethanolic extract and its fractions showed a great potential to produce gold nanoparticles with size range of 8–15 nm. Due to the specific composition of the extract or its fraction, AuNPs with different morphology were produced. Spherical AuNPs were obtained using BRP crude extract and ethyl acetate fraction, while dichloromethane and hexane fractions produced AuNPs with different shapes. All AuNPs showed a crystalline structure with a face-centered cubic (fcc) lattice. FTIR spectroscopy suggested the attachment of bioactive compounds from the Brazilian red propolis extract or its fraction on the surface of AuNPs. These results were confirmed by antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of AuNPs produced. AuNP
 <sub>extract</sub> showed antifungal activity and high cytotoxicity at low concentrations in bladder and prostate cancer cells. AuNPs obtained with dichloromethane and hexane fractions displayed high antibacterial and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity in both cells studied. On the other hand, the nanoparticles prepared with ethyl acetate fraction did not show antimicrobial activity and exhibited the lowest in vitro cytotoxic effect in the cells evaluated. The different phytochemical profiles of BRP extract and its fractions enabled the preparation of gold nanoparticles with distinct properties and interesting for several applications. Therefore, these in vitro results demonstrate the promising therapeutic applications of the biogenic gold nanoparticles in nanomedicine.
