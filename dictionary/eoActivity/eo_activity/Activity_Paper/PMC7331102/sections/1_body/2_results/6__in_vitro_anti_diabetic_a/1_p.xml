<p>In the current study, different concentrations of extract were selected for the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay between 10 mg/ml and 0.0195 mg/ml. Based on the results, the maximum α-amylase inhibition percentage was found to be 72.19±1.26% and 68.14±0.71% for EH aqueous and 70% ethanolic extract, respectively. The minimum inhibition activity is 52.54±1.94% and 50.48±0.82% for TP aqueous and 70% ethanolic extract ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f13">Figure 13</xref>), respectively; this compared to an inhibition percentage for standard acarbose of 99.00% at 10 mg/ml of concentration.
