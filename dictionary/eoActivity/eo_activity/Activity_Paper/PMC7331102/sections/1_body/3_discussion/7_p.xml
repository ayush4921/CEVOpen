<p>In the current investigation, a simple, accurate, and reproducible online HPLC-DAD method has been used and validated for the identification and quantification of phenolics. Phenolics, especially phenolic acids and flavonoids, are conventional natural products found in plants that have significant antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. ROS are produced by various metabolic activities and is a significant contributor to many chronic and oxidative stress-related diseases. Phenolic acids have been demonstrated as potent scavengers of ROS. These are sub-classified as benzoic acid and cinnamic acid backbone structure containing seven (C6-C1) and nine (C6-C3) carbon atoms, respectively. Hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives such as gallic acid, syringic acid and cinnamic acid derivatives like caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, sinapic acid, p-coumaric acid are widely available in plants
