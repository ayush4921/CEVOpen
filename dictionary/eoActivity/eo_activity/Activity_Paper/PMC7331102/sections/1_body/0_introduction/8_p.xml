<p>The therapeutic potential of the wild plants can be determined by measuring their phytochemical constituents, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> medicinal properties and toxicological effect. Therefore, the need arises to estimate and analyze the phytochemical constituents of these five wild medicinal plants leaves which are basically responsible for curing several physiological disorders and complications. The current research investigation aims to quantify the phytochemical constituents, and to evaluate the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activities and other important 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> medicinal properties of the medicinal weeds under study. Next, cytotoxicity of the leaf extracts is to be determined using a cell viability assay and compared. To the best of our knowledge, the comparative evaluations of these medicinal herbs are reported for the first time.
