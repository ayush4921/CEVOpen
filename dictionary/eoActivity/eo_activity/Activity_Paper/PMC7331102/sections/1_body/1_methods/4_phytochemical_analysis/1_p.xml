 </sup> with slight modifications. In brief, 1500 µl of diluted FC reagent was mixed with 300 µL of leaf extract thoroughly. Next, 1200 µl 7.5% Na 
 <sub>2</sub>CO 
 <sub>3</sub> was added to it, vortexed and the total reaction mixture (3 mL) was incubated at dark for 2 h. The absorbance was measured at 765 nm. Gallic acid (SD Fine-Chem, India) was used as standard. The total phenolics contents were expressed in mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight.
