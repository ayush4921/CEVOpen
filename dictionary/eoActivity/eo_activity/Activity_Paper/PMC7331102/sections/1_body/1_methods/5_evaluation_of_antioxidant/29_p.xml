<p>The dissolution percentage of calcium oxalate was evaluated by taking precisely 10 mg of calcium oxalate and 10 mg of the lyophilized extracts/standard (1:1 ratio), packed together in the semi-permeable membrane of the egg. This was allowed to suspend in a conical flask containing 100 ml of 0.1 M Tris buffer (SRL-2049170, India). The 1 
 <sup>st</sup> group was set as blank containing only 10 mg of calcium oxalate. The 2 
 <sup>nd</sup> group was established as a positive control containing 10 mg of calcium oxalate along with 10 mg of the standard drug cystone (The Himalaya Drugs Company, Bangalore, India). The 3 
 <sup>rd</sup> and 4 
 <sup>th</sup> groups, along with 10 mg of calcium oxalate, contained aqueous and 70% ethanol extracts, respectively. The conical flasks of all the groups were placed in an incubator and preheated to 37°C for 3 h. The contents of semi-permeable membranes were removed from each group into separate test tubes, and 2 ml of 1 N H 
 <sub>2</sub>SO 
 <sub>4</sub> was added to each test tube and titrated with 0.9494 N KMnO 
 <sub>4</sub> (Avantor, Maharashtra, India), till a light pink colour endpoint was obtained. In the calculation 1 ml of 0.9494 N KMnO 
 <sub>4</sub> is counted as equivalent to 0.1898 mg of 4 Calcium. The amount of remaining undissolved calcium oxalate is subtracted from the total quantity used in the experiment, in the beginning, to know the total amount of calcium oxalate dissolved by various solvent extracts
