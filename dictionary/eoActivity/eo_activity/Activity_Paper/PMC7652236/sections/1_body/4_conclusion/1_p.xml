<p>The crude extract of V. amygdalina leaves showed antidiarrheal activity in an animal model by decreasing the number of wet feces, gastrointestinal motility, and intraluminal fluid accumulation in the intestine. The antidiarrheal activities may be ascribed to the presence of bioactive secondary metabolites including tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and saponins that bring antidiarrheal effect. These findings provide scientific support for the traditional claim of V. amygdalina as a treatment of diarrheal diseases.</p>
