<p>Fresh leaves of V. amygdalina were collected in March, 2018 from Ambo Woreda, Oromia region, located about 125 km west of the capital Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Then, the plant was identified by a botanist and a voucher specimen (BM-001) was given and deposited at the National Herbarium of College of Natural and Computational Sciences, Addis Ababa University for the future reference. Dust materials were removed from the plant materials by washing with distilled water dried at room temperature under shade for 2 weeks and then pulverized to a coarse powder using mortar and pestle to facilitate the extraction process. Finally, the coarse powder is stored in an airtight container until extraction begins.</p>
