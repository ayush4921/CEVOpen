<p>Eighty percent (80%) methanol leaves extract of the plant materials was prepared by cold method (maceration). Six hundred gram powders of V. amygdalina leaves were macerated with 80% methanol (1:5 (w/v)) for 72 hours in a conical flask with occasional agitation using a mini orbital shaker at room temperature. The first extract was filtered by folded gauze and nylon clothing. Then, the extract was filtered over Whatman filter paper No.1 using a pressurized suction filtration system and the marc was remacerated twice using extra fresh methanol to fully extract the plant material in such a way to increase the yield. Then, filtrates from each extraction were combined and methanol was removed from the extract by evaporation under vacuum using Rotavapor. Then, the filtrates were frozen using a deep freezer and set water-free by using a lyophilizer. The crude extract obtained was stored in bottles at the refrigerator and fresh stock solution was prepared just before the experiment with 2% tween âˆ’80 for oral administration and distilled water.</p>
