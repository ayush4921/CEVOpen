<p>Compared to the negative controls, the three serial doses of 80% methanol extract of the leaves of V. amygdalina significantly inhibited castor oil-induced enteropooling in mice at doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg as revealed by the reduction in volume and weight of intestinal contents. As the data revealed in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the 80% methanol extract decreased the mean volume of the intestinal content by 29.13% (p &lt; 0.001), 46.60% (p &lt; 0.001), and 49.51% (p &lt; 0.001), and the weight of the intestinal content by 22.73% (p &lt; 0.05), 42.05% (p&lt;0.01), and 45.45% (p &lt; 0.001), at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg doses, respectively, compared to the negative controls. However, the highest percentage of inhibition scored by Loperamide was 53.39% (p &lt; 0.001) and 51.14% (p &lt; 0.001), for percent reduction of volume and weight of intestinal contents, respectively.
