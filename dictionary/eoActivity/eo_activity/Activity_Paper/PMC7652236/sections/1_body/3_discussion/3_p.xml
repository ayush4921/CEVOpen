<p>The need for phytochemical screening has become vital importance since many plants accumulate biologically active (secondary plant metabolites) in their tissues that have antidiarrheal activity.

 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In the current study, the preliminary phytochemical screening of crude extracts revealed that the presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, and saponins and these secondary metabolites may be responsible for the antidiarrheal activity of the crude extract.
