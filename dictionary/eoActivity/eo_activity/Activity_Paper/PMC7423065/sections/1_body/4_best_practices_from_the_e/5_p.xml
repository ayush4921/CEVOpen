<p>Within the structure of the EAC MRH initiative, industry representatives do not seem to play a visible role. It is also unclear whether a system is in place for routinely obtaining feedback from industry users regarding the programâ€™s joint assessment or inspection processes. The EAC MRH initiative may want to consider how industry entities, such as the Federation of East African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, could play a more meaningful role going forward, without foregoing their accountability as regulated entities. Legislation and enforcement can play an important role in preventing undue influence by industry.

In the EAC, local laws and regulations could be leveraged to impose appropriate penalties against drug manufacturers who seek to take unfair advantage of regulators and the regulatory process through illegal actions. For instance, if the EAC MRH initiative eventually passes legislation establishing government-sanctioned user fees to support the timely and thorough evaluation of marketing applications, it could use that very same legislation to outlaw and punish bribery, as has been done with similar laws elsewhere in the world.
