<p>We will begin by explaining how this article was written. Representatives of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the EAC MRH initiative’s partners, asked one of us (A. Grignolo) to organize and deliver this independent perspective on the initiative. Dr Grignolo then invited us to contribute, as a team of coauthors with rich and varied experience in regulatory harmonization. We were provided with drafts of the other articles in the Special Collection [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003092.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but otherwise, this perspective was written without input or influence from the other authors or from the EAC MRH initiative or its partners, including the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Information about each author’s background can be found in
