<p>To determine the antibacterial activities of the different extracts, plates were prepared according to the modified Kirby–Bauer by swabbing the Mueller Hinton agar (MHA) (Oxoids UK) plates with the resultant standardized overnight culture of each test isolate before wells were bored into the sets of the inoculated agar medium with heat-sterilized 6 mm cork borer. The wells were filled with 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of different concentrations (0.1, 10, and 100 mg/mL) prepared for each of the extracts taking care not to allow spillage of the solutions onto the surface of the agar. The plates were allowed to stand for at least 30 min before being incubated at 37°C for 24 h [
