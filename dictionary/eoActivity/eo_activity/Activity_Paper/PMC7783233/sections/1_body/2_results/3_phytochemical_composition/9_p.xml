<p id="p0155">In this study, for each sample, seven chemical compounds were quantified using HPLC-DAD technology, and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>. According to this analysis, the most abundant phenolic compound overall was rosmarinic acid, after which follows luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and rutin, whereas the least abundant compound was chlorogenic acid. Among the phenolic acids, the highest amount of rosmarinic acid was found in 
 <italic>Ov</italic> and 
 <italic>Tv</italic> ethanolic extracts, 63.66 and 63.48 mg/mL, the most abundant quantity of caffeic acid was found in 
 <italic>Tm</italic> ethanolic extract, 6.94 mg/mL, while 
 <italic>Ts</italic> ethanolic extract had the highest amount of chlorogenic acid, 2.39 mg/mL. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Tv</italic> ethanolic extract had the highest amount of quercetin, 6.95 mg/mL, and the most naringin was found in 
 <italic>Tv</italic> methanolic extract, 8.84 mg/mL. The amount of rutin in the samples was below 10 mg/mL, however, interestingly, in 
 <italic>Tc</italic> extracts was found up to 23.40 mg/mL (in methanolic extract). The highest value of luteolin-7-O-glucoside was 19.64 mg/mL and that was found in 
 <italic>Ov</italic> ethanolic extract. The plant extracts with the most total phenolics, according to HPLC analysis, were 
 <italic>Tv</italic> and 
 <italic>Ov</italic> ethanolic extracts (100.21 and 92.05 mg/mL, respectively), while 
 <italic>Tm</italic> aqueous extract had the least amount of the tested phenolics (11.42 mg/mL).
