<p id="p0170">Altogether, the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Ov</italic> exhibited the highest DPPH scavenging activity (92.16%), while the lowest activity against DPPH radicals showed the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Tm</italic> (22.55%). Three commercial antioxidants (BHA, BHT and ascorbic acid) at the same three concentrations were used in order to compare the results obtained when using plant extracts. Since ascorbic acid was proven to be extremely efficient against DPPH radical and it could not be measured, we only considered BHA and BHT for comparison with the extracts at the concentration of 0.25Â mg/mL. Eleven extracts (alcoholic 
 <italic>Om</italic> extracts, all three 
 <italic>Ov</italic> extracts, ethanolic 
 <italic>Tc</italic> extract, both alcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>Tm</italic> and 
 <italic>Ts</italic> and also 
 <italic>Tv</italic> ethanolic extract) were more active than BHA and BHT, while the rest of them, mostly aqueous extracts, were less active than the applied standards (
