<p id="p0160">The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant activity was studied for the plant extracts (concentrations of 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL) using DPPH assay. The results showed concentration dependency, however, it was noticed that at the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL the reaction mixture turned yellow showing strong reaction before the incubation time had expired, which was the case for almost all of the tested extracts (except for 
 <italic>Tm</italic> aqueous extract). For this reason, the results obtained at this concentration will not be discussed hereinafter. The results of phytochemical contents of extracts and DPPH assay are presented at 0.25 mg/mL since at this concentration they are best distinguished among each other.
