<p id="p0245">SOS/
 <italic>umuC</italic> assay is based on the adjustment in the induction of SOS response in 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> TA1535/pSK1002, as a consequence of DNA damage. 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> TA1535/pSK1002 carries the plasmid pSK1002 with 
 <italic>umuC</italic> operon fused with the 
 <italic>lacZ</italic> gene responsible for ß-galactosidase activity, hence, by measuring the ß-galactosidase activity, 
 <italic>umuC</italic> induction can be monitored (
 <xref rid="b0230" ref-type="bibr">Žegura et al., 2006</xref>). The intensity of SOS response induction was quantified by the degree of color change in the system since it correlates with the amount of DNA damage in the cell caused by its exposure to hydrogen-peroxide. To the best of our knowledge, the results presented in this paper represent the first report on the antigenotoxic potential of Lamiaceae plant extracts tested in SOS/
 <italic>umuC</italic> assay, underlying the importance of these plants, especially 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> methanolic and ethanolic extracts, as a source of antigenotoxic phytochemicals.
