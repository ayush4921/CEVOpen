<p id="p0235">Due to the obtained correlation, the results presented in 
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> showed that the phenolic compounds contribute significantly to the exhibited antioxidant capacity of the studied species. What’s more, 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Ulewicz-Magulska and Wesolowski (2019)</xref> hypothesized that the displayed antioxidant activity might be due to the presence of rosmarinic acid, known for the ability to inhibit DPPH radical. Interestingly enough, according to our Pearson’s correlation analysis, DPPH assay shows a moderate correlation with rosmarinic acid (r = 0.39) and also luteolin-7-
