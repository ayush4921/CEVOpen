<p id="p0230">DPPH assay is a chemical test, which is based on the color change of the DPPH solution (from purple to yellow) as the DPPH radical receives an electron or hydrogen from the antioxidant agent. Therefore, DPPH assay evaluates the capacity of antioxidants to act as free radical scavengers or hydrogen donors. Briefly, ethanolic extracts showed the best activity in DPPH assay overall, highlighting the activity of 
 <italic>Ov</italic> extract, whereas the aqueous ones had the least potential to inhibit the DPPH radicals, especially the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Tm</italic>. Methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Tv</italic>, 
 <italic>Ov</italic>, 
 <italic>Om</italic> from Poland, in their respected order (50.20, 46.60 and 41.6%), showed higher activity than the aqueous ones (27.20, 28.60 and 25.90%) (

Moreover, ethanolic extracts of several Lamiaceae species grown in Croatia were tested for their scavenging potential and the activity decreased in the following order: 
 <italic>Ov</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Tc</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Tm</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>Tv</italic> (Vladimir-Knežević et l., 2014), which is partially in accordance with our results. Interestingly, it was previously reported that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Tm</italic> originating from Serbia had a higher DPPH activity compared to its methanolic extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> for the aqueous extract was reported to be 0.029 mg/mL, while for the methanolic extract it was 0.045 mg/mL) (
