<p id="p0085">The inhibition of DNA damage induced by hydrogen peroxide in co-treatment with selected extracts was assessed in SOS/
 <italic>umuC</italic> assay, following the protocol given earlier (
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Kolarević et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, the treatment with hydrogen peroxide in the final concentration of 1.68 mM was performed for 2 h at 37 °C in incubation mixtures composed of 10 µL of plant extract (concentrations 0.125; 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL) and 90 µL of bacterial culture of 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> TA1535/pSK1002 in exponential phase. Sterile bidistilled water was used as a negative control, while methanol and ethanol (final concentration of 3.5%) were used as solvent controls. The determination of bacterial growth rate was done at 600 nm on a microtiter plate reader (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, Multiscan FC). On the other hand, β-galactosidase activity (G) was determined using ONPG as a substrate (30 min at 25 °C). The absorption was measured at 405 nm using a reference solution without bacteria. All treatments were performed in triplicates in three individual experiments.
