 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Alimpić et al., 2017</xref>). TPC was calculated from the curve equation of gallic acid and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (mg GAE) per gram of dry extract. On the other hand, TFC was calculated from quercetin curve equation and expressed as quercetin equivalents (mg QE) per gram of dry extract.
