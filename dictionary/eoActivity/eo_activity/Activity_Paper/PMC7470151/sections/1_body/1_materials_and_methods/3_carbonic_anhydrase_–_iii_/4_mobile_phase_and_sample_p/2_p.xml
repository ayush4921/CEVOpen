<p>Each target compounds (
 <bold>12–16b</bold>) was dissolved in a mixture of acetonitrile: phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 (1:9 v/v) to obtain a final concentration of 0.24 mM. Subsequently, filtration and degassing by sonication were conducted for the mobile phase. Three different enzyme (CA-III) concentrations of 1.065, 1.7, and 1.92 mM were prepared from the stock solution (containing 0.865 mg in 10 mL of distilled water) by subsequent dilution method and injected separately in each run in the chromatographic system. All samples were used in duplicate. Vanillic acid was used as a positive control, and toluene was used as a negative control.
