<p>CA-III inhibitory activities of all the 17 target compounds (

 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> were carried out by using size exclusion HDM chromatography

 </xref>. The HDM chromatography was preferred over colorimetric assay of CA inhibitors, due to the susceptibility of the colorimetric methods to the intrinsic acidic or alkaline properties of analytes (inhibitors), including the lower catalytic activity of CA-III in CO
 <sub>2</sub> hydration. Moreover, in HDM chromatographic method, the dilution effect of the mobile phase not only provides comparatively larger space for interaction between the macromolecule (CA-III) and analytes, but also lowers the probability of self-aggregation of macromolecules

 </xref>. The HDM was further optimised prior to use, where mobile phase was buffered to maintain the pH = 6.5 to mimic the physiological condition and to minimise the intrinsic properties of analytes. Moreover, acetonitrile (10%) was used to facilitate the elution of analytes (inhibitors) from the hydrophobic column as well as to prevent the adhesion of macromolecule to the stationary phase of the column. A constant optimised temperature of 37 °C was maintained throughout the chromatographic run, as the increase in temperature could not only influence the protein-ligand interaction but also affect the longevity of the column.
