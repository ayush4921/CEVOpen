<p>In this work, a series of 17 compounds (
 <bold>12–16b</bold>) with 2,4,5-trisubstitutedthiazole scaffold were synthesised and evaluated for their CA-III inhibitory activities using size exclusion HDM chromatography. Compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> with a free amino group at 2-position, carboxylic acid moiety at 4-position, and a phenyl ring at 5-position of the scaffold was found to be the most potent CA-III inhibitor (
 <italic>K
  <sub>i </sub>
 </italic>=0.5 μM). Substitution at the 
 <italic>para</italic> position of the phenyl ring of the scaffold reduced the activity in case of the compounds 
 <bold>13a–15a</bold>; whereas, the replacement of phenyl ring with a bulky benzyl ring completely abolished the activity (compound 
 <bold>16a</bold>, 
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>&gt;500 μM). Interestingly, the presence of a carboxylic acid group at the 4-position of the scaffold was found to be of prime importance for CA-III inhibitory activity, probably by inducing electrostatic interaction at the binding site of the enzyme; as evident from compounds 
 <bold>12–16, 12b, 13b, 14b, 14d,</bold> and 
 <bold>16b</bold> having carboxylic ester group at 4-position with no CA-III inhibitory activities (
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>&gt;500 μM). Furthermore, replacement of the free amino group with amide and urea group resulted in a significant reduction of activity (compounds 
 <bold>13c</bold> and 
 <bold>14c</bold>, 
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic>=174.1 and 186.2 μM). Thus compound 
 <bold>12a</bold> can be considered as a lead molecule for further modification and development of more potent CA-III inhibitors.
