<p>In an RCT Tangen et al. investigated the effects of 
 <italic>Agaricus blazei Murill</italic> supplementation on multiple myeloma patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. They found no statistically significant differences in treatment response, OS and time of treatment between patients supplemented with AndoSan (containing 82.4% of

In the verum group, trends toward a longer median time to the next treatment (37.5 vs. 31.2 months) and a shorter duration of intravenously (IV) antibiotic treatment (8.6 vs. 10.0 days) were observed. Moreover beneficial effects on immunological parameters were found in the verum group only: 1) a significant increase in serum levels of IL 1ra, IL-5 and IL-7, 2) an increased expression of immunoglobulin genes, KIR genes and HLA-genes and 3) in the leukapheresis product harvested after stem cell mobilization, increased percentages of Treg cells (CD4
 <sup>+</sup>/CD127d
 <sup>+</sup>/Cd25
 <sup>+</sup>) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (CD303
 <sup>+</sup>).
