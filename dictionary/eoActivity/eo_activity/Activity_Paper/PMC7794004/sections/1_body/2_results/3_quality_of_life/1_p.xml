Participants in the verum group reported improved emotional, physical, social and cognitive function compared to the placebo group on the European organization for research and treatment - quality of life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQC30) during the treatment. However, this was not statistically significant between the groups. Based on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Hepatobiliary Cancer (FACT-Hep) questionnaire, the lowest values for physical and emotional well-being reported by the subjects in the verum group were on average higher than those reported by patients receiving placebo during the treatment.
