<p>Chay et al. observed no difference in the use of 
 <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic> compared to placebo regarding the primary endpoint TTP in advanced HCC treated with chemotherapy. The median duration of the treatment in the placebo and verum arm was 1.5 cycles and three cycles, respectively. Median TTP was 2.5 (1.4–5.3) months compared to 4.2 (0.4–4.2) months in the verum and placebo arm, respectively, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70 (0.16–3.05 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.634). Median progression-free survival was 2.5 (1.4–5.3) months in the verum and 1.1 (0.4–4.2) months in the placebo arm, HR 0.42 (0.13–1.34, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.144). Median OS was 6.5 (3.3–24.1) and 2.2 (0.8–23.3) months, respectively, HR 0.35 (0.10–1.25, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.105). In addition, the group examined the serum concentration of potentially relevant markers for HCC. They found a decrease in interleukin (IL)17F, MCP-1 and increase in prolactin and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligands in patients with HCC treated with 
 <italic>Coriolus versicolor</italic> compared to placebo (
