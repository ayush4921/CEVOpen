<p>The postulated mechanisms of action are still vague and diverse. Secondary metabolites of medicinal mushrooms may produce health benefits and anticancer effects by activating stress resistance mechanisms, including autophagy, DNA repair and expression of antioxidant enzymes (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Martel et al., 2020</xref>). Medicinal mushrooms are recognized as immunomodulators and anti-cancer agents that are able to disrupt certain cellular signal transmission pathways, which are associated with cancer development and progression (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">De Silva et al., 2012</xref>). The biochemical mechanisms that mediate this biological activity are still not clearly understood. Several pathways, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory effects triggered by medicinal mushrooms have been described (
