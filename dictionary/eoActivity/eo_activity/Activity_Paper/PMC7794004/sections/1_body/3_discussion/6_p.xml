<p>A Cochrane review of five RCTs using 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> showed that cancer patients (especially lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer) in the verum group were more likely to respond positively compared to placebo and chemo/radiotherapy alone (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.90 to 2.51, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) (

 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> alone did not show the same regression rate as the combined therapy.
