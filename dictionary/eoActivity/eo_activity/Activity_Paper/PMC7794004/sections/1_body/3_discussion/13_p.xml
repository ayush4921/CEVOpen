<p>Moreover there is evidence that orally taken medicinal mushrooms have an influence on the microbiome (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al., 2018</xref>). The important sources of prebiotics in mushrooms are indigestible polysaccharides, which can inhibit the proliferation of pathogens by promoting the growth of probiotic bacteria in the gut (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> dose escalation studies were identified. Torkelson et al. conducted a controlled dose escalation study with nine breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy receiving

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Torkelson et al., 2012</xref>). A faster recovery was observed in the medium and high dose patients (6 and 9 g/day). Further research is needed to determine the correct dose of medicinal mushrooms, as well as possible interactions with chemotherapeutic agents, in order to make it a safe treatment during conventional cancer therapy. In addition, the quality of the products is of crucial importance, as contamination with mold, pesticides and heavy metals could be a problem for herbal products from natural sources (
