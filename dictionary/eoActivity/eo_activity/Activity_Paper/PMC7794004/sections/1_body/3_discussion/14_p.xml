<p>There are several relevant limitations to the reviewed studies, particularly the small study populations (ranging from n = 15 to n = 198), short treatment periods (ranging from 3 weeks to 6 months), studies examining various tumor entities (breast, ovarian, endometrial, colorectal, lung, hepatocellular cancer, multiple myeloma), lack of information about the exact ethnicity of the study participants and non-standardized mushroom preparations. The methodological quality of most studies was unsatisfactory and most results were poorly reported in many respects (especially between-group comparisons were missing quite often). Future studies should be reported with the assistance of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. In addition, detailed information about production, composition and bio-active ingredients were mentioned only in a few of the reviewed studies and there only partially. Furthermore, this review included only English publications. It is likely that further studies can be found in Chinese and Japanese databases. Four out of five RCTs of the Cochrane review were in Chinese and were published in Chinese journals (
