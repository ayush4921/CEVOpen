 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2010</xref>), prebiotic properties (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Singdevsachan et al., 2016</xref>). These properties were primarily demonstrated in

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2010</xref>). Higher basidiomycetes mushrooms (pillar mushrooms/stand mushrooms) contain various types of biologically active, high-molecular (e.g., ÃŸ-glucans) and low-molecular compounds (e.g., triterpenes, lectins, steroids) in fruiting bodies, spores, culture mycelia and culture broth, with suggested anticarcinogenic effects (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Wasser and Weis, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Wasser, 2017</xref>). They contain various compounds that intervene in signaling pathways of tumor-specific proliferation, regulation of apoptosis, cancer-specific metabolism, angiogenesis, metastasis and key functions of the immune system (
