<p>During the experiment, the animals were weighed every seven days (day 0, day 7, day 14, day 21, and day 28), followed, and observed individually twice a day (morning and evening). A data collection sheet was prepared for each rat to collect possible signs of toxicity (changes in skin, hair, edema, walking back, respiratory difficulties, morbidity, and mortality). At the end of treatment, rats were deprived of food the last night before sampling. Blood samples (day 0 and day 28) were performed by puncture at the retroorbital sinus for all animals under ether anesthesia. The blood sample is recovered from two types of tubes, one containing EDTA and one dry without anticoagulant. The EDTA tube sample is intended for hematological analysis. Dry tubes were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 minutes, and the serum obtained is kept at −20°C for biochemical parameter analysis. After sampling, two animals in each lot were sacrificed under anesthesia with ether for the collection of organs such as the liver and kidney. These organs were rinsed with a 0.9% saline water and fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde.</p>
