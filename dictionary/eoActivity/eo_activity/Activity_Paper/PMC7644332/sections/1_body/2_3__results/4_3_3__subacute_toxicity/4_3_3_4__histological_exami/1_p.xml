 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the liver histology of treated and untreated animals. From this figure, it appears that the hepatic parenchyma of treated rats has the same appearance as that of control rats. Hepatocytes (arrows) have a normal appearance and are arranged in cords separated by sinusoids (
 <italic>s</italic>). These sinusoids are arranged around the centrolobular vein (
 <italic>V</italic>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"> Figure 5</xref> shows the renal histology of the treated animals and the control group. Analysis of the data in this figure indicates that the renal parenchyma of the treated rats has a typical architecture than that of the control group rats. Glomeruli (
 <italic>G</italic>), distal tubes (DT), and collecting ducts (CD) are well identifiable. So, the extracts did not affect the kidney structures.
