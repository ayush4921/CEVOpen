<p>The sensitivity of 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> larvae to different concentrations of the hydroethanolic extract of the plants studied is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The results show an increasing mortality of 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> larvae as the concentration of extracts from the plants studied increases. The obtained LC
 <sub>50</sub> was 0.203 mg/mL for 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic>, 0.166 mg/mL for 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic>, and 2.773 mg/mL for 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic>, respectively. These LC
 <sub>50</sub> values reported at the scale of Mousseux [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] suggest that at the concentrations tested, the hydroethanolic extract of the plants studied is noncytotoxic (LC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 0.1 mg/mL).
