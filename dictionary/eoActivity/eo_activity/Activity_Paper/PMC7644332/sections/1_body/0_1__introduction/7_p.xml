<p>This study was initiated to fill this gap in the scarcity of scientific data on the repeated dose toxicity of selected plants. It aimed to evaluate larval cytotoxicity and subacute toxicity of 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> roots, 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> whole plant, and 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> leaves in rats to predict its safety in human use. Rats are recommended lower level of animals for toxicity studies to extrapolate to human biology according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) safety study guidelines [
