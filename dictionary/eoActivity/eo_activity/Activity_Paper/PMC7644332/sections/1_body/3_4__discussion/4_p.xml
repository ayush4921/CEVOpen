<p>Concerning 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic>, the results of this study indicated that no alteration of hematological parameters was observed. However, a possible renal impairment is to be reported in view of the increase in uremia. In the literature, no studies were specifically carried out on repeated dose toxicity of 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> roots. This study therefore bridged the gap in data on the toxicological profile of the plant. Moreover, two scientific studies of the subacute toxicity of fruit and the acute toxicity of the bark of the roots of 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> were identified in the literature. Indeed, the studies of Farah et al. [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] showed plant fruit safety at 50 mg/kg but altered hematological and biochemical parameters at 500 mg/kg. Nureye et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] showed that the bark of 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> roots was safe for mice at a single dose of 2000 mg/kg. Moreover, the alterations of the various biochemical and hematological parameters observed in this study may be related to the alkaloids present in the parts of plants studied [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Indeed, some plant alkaloids such as pyrrolizidine, tropane, piperidine, and indolizidine are known to have toxicological effects [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>].
