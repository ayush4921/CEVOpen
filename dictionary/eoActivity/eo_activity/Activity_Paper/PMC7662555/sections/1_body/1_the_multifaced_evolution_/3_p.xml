<p>Notably, the ability to penetrate the TME, the biodistribution, survival, and proliferative features of CAR-T cells need to be considered for the efficient redirection of these cells to tumor cells. The antigen expression and localization on tumor cells is one of the limiting factors for the anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells; nevertheless, the immunomodulatory activity of the TME can influence the fate of immune responses and the outcome. The combination of CAR-T cells with immune checkpoint blockade or other immunomodulatory agents represents a promising therapeutic intervention that is currently under evaluation (
