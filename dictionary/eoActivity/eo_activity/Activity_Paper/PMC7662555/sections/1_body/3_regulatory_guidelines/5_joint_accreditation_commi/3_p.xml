<p>The FACT-JACIE standard is a voluntary standard of excellence and aimed at accrediting and qualifying stem cell transplant programs; therefore institutionally it does not cover the activities for solid tumors. However, an HPC-A transplant program includes several units: the clinical unit that performs the transplant, the aphaeretic collection center, and the cell manipulation laboratory that processes the products. The clinical unit takes care of the therapeutic aspects while the aphaeretic collection unit and the cell manipulation laboratory are not strictly dependent on the clinical hematological activity. The activities of the aphaeretic collection unit and the cell manipulation laboratory are focused on the donor and the cellular product; therefore, these activities can be performed also for oncological clinical units for the CAR-T cell therapy of patients with solid tumors. The requirements of the FACT-JACIE standards related to apheresis and cell manipulation are relevant for the cell product collection and manipulation regardless the type and origin of tumor.</p>
