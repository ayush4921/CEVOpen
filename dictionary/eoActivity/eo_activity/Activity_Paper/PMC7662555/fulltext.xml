In consideration of their complexity, the use of CAR-T requires dedicated clinical setting and health care practitioners with expertise in the selection, treatment, and management of toxicities and side effects. Such issue appears particularly important when contextualized in the rapid progress of CAR-T cell treatment, translating into a constant need of updating and evolution. Moreover, the clinical grade manufacturing of CAR-T cells is complex and implies articulated regulatory and organizational aspects. The main goal of this review is to summarize and provide an accurate analysis of the clinical, logistic, and regulatory requirements of CAR-T cell centers. Finally, we describe a new occupational figure called &#x0201c;CAR-T specialist&#x0201d; devoted to the establishment and coordination of the required facilities and regulatory landscape in the context of cancer centers.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CAR-T cells</kwd><kwd>CAR-T process</kwd><kwd>CAR-T Unit</kwd><kwd>CAR-T Specialist</kwd><kwd>JACIE</kwd><kwd>GMP</kwd><kwd>ATMP</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100007365</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="68"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="6696"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The demonstration that the immune system can control tumor growth has been provided for the first time by Thomas and Burnet (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This evidence has been confirmed after several decades, demonstrating the prognostic role of immune cells infiltrating the tumor lesions (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The crescent knowledge of cancer immunology and immunotherapy has allowed the development of novel biological agents that showed unprecedented clinical results (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These results contributed to turn into reality the paradigm that patient&#x02019;s immune system represents effective &#x0201c;living drugs&#x0201d; against cancer cells. Among these, adoptive cell therapy (ACT) that implies the isolation and expansion <italic>ex vivo</italic> of tumor antigen-specific T lymphocytes and their re-infusion in patients has shown promising clinical activity improving the overall survival of cancer patients (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). T-lymphocytes engineered with Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs), that consist of an antibody-derived domain for antigen recognition linked to T-cell signaling molecules, can recognize in a MHC-independent manner tumor antigens expressed on tumor cell surface (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). These biological drugs are based on the engineering of T-lymphocytes, isolated from patient&#x02019;s or, less frequently, from donor&#x02019;s peripheral blood, with either gamma-retroviral (RV) or lentiviral (LV) vectors encoding CARs linked to co-stimulatory molecules (either CD28 or 4-1BB linked to zeta-chain) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The development of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells and their application in several clinical trials showed durable clinical responses in both adult and pediatric cancer patients with disease relapse or refractory to other therapeutic interventions. Complete responses (up to 70&#x02013;80%) and significant improvement of overall survival (OS) were documented in patients with either acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) or high grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs), including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) and mantle cell lymphoma (ML) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). These clinical trials led to the accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of two CD19-CAR-T cell medicinal drug products, tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta). For the first time, ACT products entered commercial production by few pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless, the clinical grade manufacturing is complex and with relatively long timeline for cell production, requiring the availability of patients&#x02019; or donors&#x02019; peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to be shipped to good manufacturing practice (GMP) facilities, if not locally available, and the return to clinical sites for infusion into patients. One of the challenging factors of CAR-T cells is represented by the short-term associated toxicities arising in patients immediately after infusion. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) represents the most common side effects of this type of therapy with a range of incidence among the different clinical studies of 50&#x02013;90% (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The mechanistic hypothesis behind CRS still needs to be fully dissected; however, it is a life-threatening situation that requires timely and effective interventions (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Other common side effects observed after CAR-T cell therapy for B-cell malignancies involve neurotoxicity, B-cell aplasia and hypogammaglobulinemia (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). CAR-T cells have been also investigated for the treatment of solid tumors with limited clinical responses, thus suggesting that this therapeutic strategy might be promising, but still needs optimization. One of the principal limitations is represented by the choice of target antigens; the majority of solid tumors have epithelial origins with many of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) being shared with normal tissues (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This translates into high risk of inducing off-tumor toxicities following the infusion of CAR-T cells specific for these TAAs. In addition, the homing of CAR-T cells to tumor site for solid tumors showed low efficiency due to the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Multiple studies are aimed at addressing the choice of target molecules, such as IL-13alpha2, B7-H3, CSPG4, CD44v6, MUC1, Mesothelin, EGFRvIII, Her-2, GD2 <italic>etc</italic>., allowing to specifically redirect the CAR-T cells to tumors with selected histological origins (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A remarkable number of clinical trials are ongoing worldwide to assess the clinical activity of these immunobiological drugs against solid tumors and the optimal clinical setting for cancer patients (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>The organizational and regulatory aspects of CAR-T cell clinical center represent novel and challenging topic within a rapidly evolving field. These involve different clinical expertise and departments, regulatory and quality management, laboratory dedicated to the tissue collection, processing and storage, and the accurate and timely coordination of logistics. The complexity of this organization requires personnel with specific background and continuous interactions and coordination among them. This manuscript aims at addressing the clinical, regulatory, and organizational requirements of clinical centers, including hematological and oncological departments, dedicated to CAR-T cell therapies called CAR-T Unit. In this review a model of CAR-T Unit is proposed, as well as the need of a new figure called &#x0201c;CAR-T specialist&#x0201d;. The connection between the CAR-T Unit and the involved facilities, either within the clinical centers (<italic>e.g.</italic>, clinical unit, apheresis unit, processing unit, pharmacy, intensive care unit) or external (<italic>e.g.</italic>, pharma companies, clinical research organizations) is also described.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The Multifaced Evolution of CAR-T Cells</title><p>In order to achieve clinical efficacy, the CAR-T cell therapy should have four features: i) high effect or activity, even in the immunosuppressive tumor environment; ii) high proliferation capacity, even after multiple encountering with cancer cells; iii) long-term persistence; iiii) absence or low degree of toxicity after cell infusion.</p><p>Despite the documented clinical success of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, the broad clinical usage is still limited due to several factors, such as the non-optimal persistence, the low efficacy in solid tumors, the safety profile and the high costs associated with the complex manufacturing. Although anti-CD19 CAR-T cells can lead to complete response rates for B-cell malignancies, a consistent proportion of patients relapse through various resistance mechanisms, including loss of expression of the target antigen (CD19-negative recurrences) (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). To overcome this drawback and reduce the risk of disease recurrence, T cells have been engineered with multiple CARs to target simultaneously two tumor-associated antigens (bispecific CAR-T cells) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This strategy may allow decreasing the toxicity while augmenting the tumor specificity of CAR-T cells. To improve their anti-tumor efficacy, they have been implemented with molecular features that can target the tumor microenvironment (TME). These are represented by the fourth generation &#x0201c;armored&#x0201d; CAR-T cells that include T cells redirected for Universal Cytokine-mediated Killing cells (TRUCK) through the incorporation of genes encoding for cytotoxic cytokines (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Moreover, allogeneic or &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; CAR-T cells are produced from T cells isolated from healthy donors, representing &#x0201c;off the shelf&#x0201d; engineered T cells. This strategy allows the viability of CAR-T cells for a high number of patients and the decrease of the costs regarding clinical grade production (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Great emphasis is also placed in the development of CAR-T cells for the treatment of solid malignancies; to date results showed limited clinical efficacy (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The challenges associated with the effectiveness of CAR-T cells in this setting are: i) the selection of target antigens, specifically expressed by tumor and not by normal cells; ii) the homing of CAR-T cells and their interaction with TME and the vascularization; iii) the production of immunosuppressive molecules; iiii) the high metabolic rate of both tumor cells and TME (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). To date in fact, a candidate target antigen expressed by solid tumors that is comparable to CD19, a lineage antigen over-expressed on B-cell malignancies which counterpart expression on normal cells limited to B cells is not available. Due to the high heterogeneity of cells within solid tumors, the &#x0201c;armored&#x0201d; CAR-T cells allow promotion of a universal cytokine-mediated activation, targeting even those cancer cells that would be invisible to CAR-T cells.</p><p>Notably, the ability to penetrate the TME, the biodistribution, survival, and proliferative features of CAR-T cells need to be considered for the efficient redirection of these cells to tumor cells. The antigen expression and localization on tumor cells is one of the limiting factors for the anti-tumor activity of CAR-T cells; nevertheless, the immunomodulatory activity of the TME can influence the fate of immune responses and the outcome. The combination of CAR-T cells with immune checkpoint blockade or other immunomodulatory agents represents a promising therapeutic intervention that is currently under evaluation (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The <italic>in situ</italic> administration of CAR-T cells could overcome their limited migration to solid tumors (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In neuro-oncology this strategy can be applicable through intralesional and intraventricular administrations of the cells since the peculiarity of the cerebral circulatory system allows the spreading of the CAR-T cells (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>CAR-T Cell Program</title><p>CAR-T cell therapies have been classified in the regulatory category of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) under the definition of a gene therapy medicinal product, although they represent cellular therapies. To assure the reliability and safety of this type of therapy, it is important to define the optimal conditions of administration to patients. Therefore, an organizational structure with accreditation path needs to be identified. In 2009, a specialized committee was created by the EMA, the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) (Regulation (EC) No. 1394/2007of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 13, 2007), aimed at providing opinion on the quality, safety, and efficacy of studies utilizing CAR-T cells. Details of the structure, experience, and regulatory requirements of clinical centers where CAR-T cell therapy can be administered are discussed in the text below. The initial indication has been established for the hematology field, for which approved medicinal products are available. To guarantee the safety of patients, the requirements for CAR-T cells centers have been identified as similar to those for early-phase clinical trials for novel immune therapies, with the designation of clinical centers with documented experience in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) program, from alternative donors and sources, as reference for this type of therapy. This implies the availability of on-site clinical hematology unit, with intensive care unit, neurological department, emergency department, pharmacy, and transfusion center.</p><p>Long-term trained and experienced multi-disciplinary teams working together to care for intensively treated cancer patients are mandatory. Nevertheless, regulatory and logistic landscape of this cell-based therapy displays high complexities. Therefore, an accurate planning of infrastructures and identification of specific guidelines are needed to develop cell-therapy programs. The details of organizational and regulatory requirements are explained in the following paragraphs and sub-paragraphs. Of note, the administration of CAR-T cells to patients with either hematological or solid tumors requires joint transplant programs that include different figures, organization charts, and quality systems. Given the complexity of this scenario, the so called &#x0201c;CAR-T specialist&#x0201d; has great expertise in regulatory aspects and therefore has a relevant role in identifying, controlling, and implementing the specific requirements that a &#x0201c;CAR-T Unit&#x0201d; should obtain.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Regulatory Guidelines</title><p>In order to analyze the regulatory aspects of CAR-T cell therapy, the following premises are of relevant value: i) CAR-T cells have to be considered &#x0201c;Drug Products&#x0201d;; ii) prior to their production, a deep knowledge of the legislation concerning the whole process (from lymphocytes collection to cells infusion). Lymphocytes are both blood components and cells; therefore their manipulation is controlled by legislation on blood components, tissue, and cells.</p><p>Taken into consideration the above points, the process of CAR-T cell generation requires the compliance with the regulation summarized in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Regulatory entities for the production of CAR-T cells.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tissueregulation</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bloodregulation</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ATMP</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">JACIEStandards</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GMPregulation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Collection of tissue and cells</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Production</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CAR-T Infusion</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">X</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4_1"><title>Tissue Regulation</title><p>Lymphocytes are cells and are regulated by the European guidelines for tissue and cells.

This introduces further complexity in the regulatory field of CAR-T cell therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><title>Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT-Europe (JACIE) Standard Requirements and Accreditation</title><p>CAR-T cell production and clinical management have peculiar characteristics that can be associated with HSCT; therefore in most of the Countries in EU the Regulatory Agencies have identified that their administration should occur in a Bone Marrow transplant Unit. This activity is regulated by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy-Joint Accreditation Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) and the European Group for Blood and BMT (FACT-JACIE). The European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) implemented the FACT-JACIE international standards for HSCT programs including specific requirements for CAR-T cell preparation and treatment, intended as guidelines for the usage of this novel therapeutic approach (&#x0201c;<italic>The Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT-Europe &#x00026; EBMT (JACIE) is Europe&#x02019;s only official accreditation body in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and cellular therapy. It promotes high-quality patient care and medical and laboratory practice through a professional-driven and voluntary accreditation scheme</italic>&#x0201d;. JACIE has developed quality standards to evaluate the quality level of the transplant programs in all the phases, including the collection of stem cells, the activities of cell processing, and the infusion in patients. The latest version of the JACIE Standard included the accreditation for the administration to patients of Immune Effector Cells (IEC), including CAR-T cells. It is important to note that the JACIE standard is limited to the qualification of centers dedicated to the <italic>stem cell transplant programs</italic> and for this reason only CAR-T products connected to the stem cell unit and utilized for the treatment of hematological malignancies are included. CAR-T cell products for the treatment of solid tumors are not included, and this can generate controversies in the organization of clinical centers for the CAR-T cell therapy of this type of tumors. According to the JACIE standards, the requirements to apply for the CAR-T products are the following:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Clinical requirements;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Collection requirements;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Processing requirements.</p></list-item></list><p>The FACT-JACIE standard is a voluntary standard of excellence and aimed at accrediting and qualifying stem cell transplant programs; therefore institutionally it does not cover the activities for solid tumors. However, an HPC-A transplant program includes several units: the clinical unit that performs the transplant, the aphaeretic collection center, and the cell manipulation laboratory that processes the products. The clinical unit takes care of the therapeutic aspects while the aphaeretic collection unit and the cell manipulation laboratory are not strictly dependent on the clinical hematological activity. The activities of the aphaeretic collection unit and the cell manipulation laboratory are focused on the donor and the cellular product; therefore, these activities can be performed also for oncological clinical units for the CAR-T cell therapy of patients with solid tumors. The requirements of the FACT-JACIE standards related to apheresis and cell manipulation are relevant for the cell product collection and manipulation regardless the type and origin of tumor.</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><title>Clinical Requirements</title><p>The JACIE standard defines the clinical requirements for the compliance of BMT centers. The clinical requirements for CAR-T cells therapies are: i) donor selection and evaluation; ii) infusion of the IEC product; iii) recipient care; iiii) evaluation and training of the personnel dedicated to the above activities; iiiii) product management.</p><sec id="s4_4_1"><title>Collection Requirements</title><p>JACIE standard provides guidelines to perform the apheresis for the collection of lymphocytes.

According to the Committee for Advanced Therapy, the CAR-T Product is an ATMP product: &#x0201c;<italic>products consisting of cells or tissues may scientifically be at the border between Tissues and Cells directive (Directive 2004/23/EC) and the ATMP regulation&#x0201d;</italic>. The classification of an ATMP as a biological product determines a wider regulatory framework and the subsequent requirements for the development and the marketing authorization. These need to be considered in association with the specific framework for ATMPs, <italic>Regulation 1394/2007/EC</italic>, which was approved on December 30, 2008: &#x0201c;<italic>ATMP are authorized centrally through the European Medicine Agency (EMA). They benefit from a single evaluation and authorization procedure. EMA continues to monitor the safety and efficacy of ATMPs following their approval and commercialization. This Agency also provides scientific support to the developers of these products in the design of pharmacovigilance and risk management systems to monitor the safety of these medicines</italic>&#x0201d;. This regulation provides the overall framework on ATMPs for those products, which are intended to be placed in the market of EU Member States. In addition, <italic>Directive 2009/120/EC</italic> updated the definitions and detailed scientific and technical requirements for advanced therapies. ATMPs are regulated by both guidelines of medicinal products and that of medical devices. On the 25th of May 2017, two additional regulations on medical devices were identified (<italic>European Commission, 2017a</italic>). For the development of advanced therapies in EU, the development and approval of clinical trials are in charge of the individual national competent authorities. However, for marketing authorization, all ATMPs are evaluated through centralized procedures ensuring that they benefit from a single evaluation and authorization across EU. Two committees are responsible for the scientific evaluation and approval of ATMPs: the CAT and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) (European Medicines Agency, 2018a). The CAT is the EMA committee responsible for classifying, assessing the quality, safety, efficacy of ATMP, in order to follow the scientific progress in the field and to provide an opinion on each ATMP application submitted to the EMA, supporting the final decision by the CHMP.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>The CAR-T CELL Process</title><p>The process for the manufacturing and infusion of CAR-T cells is relatively complex not only for the clinical aspects, but also from an organizational and regulatory point of view. The production and infusion of CAR-T cells require a specific organizational structure; the clinical unit task force includes physicians and nurses, and numbers of other clinical and healthcare personnel with long-term expertise in the care of patients with either hematological malignancies or solid tumors and in HSCT procedures. Therefore, it is important to have a detailed list of the personnel and multi-disciplinary expertise involved in this process and their role and relationship.</p><sec id="s5_1"><title>Patient Evaluation and Selection</title><p>The clinical CAR-T unit is in charge of the evaluation and selection of patients eligible for CAR-T cell therapy. This represents a critical task since the demand of patients in need of such treatment will increase overtime while the availability of CAR-T cells are still limited&#x02014;at least so far&#x02014;to a relatively low number of clinical centers. Stringent eligibility criteria are required in order to select those patients that may benefit from CAR-T cell administration. The decision to treat a patient with CAR-T cell therapy should be made in the context of a multi-disciplinary team. The main factors that influence the suitability of a patient to CAR-T cell treatment are represented by the medical history, the clinical conditions, the disease burden, and life&#x02019;s expectancy. In particular, disease burden at the time of evaluation represents a critical consideration, as patients with low tumor burden experience less treatment-related toxicities and have superior clinical responses (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, in real life, most patients have aggressive malignancies that need to be carefully managed along with the timeline and processes, such as insurance authorization, apheresis procedure, and manufacturing, to obtain the medicinal product for infusion. Moreover, clinicians should take into account the risk of disease progression and the related complications that could occur until the expected date of CAR-T cell infusion. Finally, also manufacturing failures should be foreseen, since in this case alternative therapies have to be considered.</p></sec><sec id="s5_2"><title>Lymphocyte Collection</title><p>The apheresis unit is in charge of the patient/donor suitability assessment for the procedure. The collection procedure follows the clinical protocol guidelines. The following steps involve the labeling of the apheresis product and the delivery to the cell processing laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="s5_3"><title>Lymphocyte Processing (Minimum Manipulation)</title><p>The TE may perform the manipulation to isolate and cryopreserve lymphocytes according to standardized and validated procedures. The cryopreserved lymphocytes are then delivered to the good manufacturing practice (GMP) facility that can be either part of a pharmaceutical company or an independent site. Alternatively, fresh collected lymphocytes may be sent directly from the TE to the GMP facility that will proceed to lymphocyte isolation and subsequent processing.</p></sec><sec id="s5_4"><title>GMP Production and Transport</title><p>The GMP facility is responsible for the manufacturing, control, and release of the drug products, according to ATMP regulation. The product is then released and shipped to the CAR-T unit. CAR-T cells are shipped in the form of frozen cells to the clinical center. The pharmacy unit will receive, register, and handover the cells to the TE for temporary storing. The final process involves cell thawing for the administration to the patient. This step may be performed either by the TE that will provide the cells to the clinical unit or directly by the clinical unit.</p></sec><sec id="s5_5"><title>Treatment of Patient Before the Infusion of CAR-T Cells</title><p>CAR-T cell infusion is administered after a brief course of chemotherapy. The aim of such chemotherapy is to control, at least in part, the disease during the period between lymphocyte collection and the final infusion of the CAR-T cell product (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, it is advisable that the treatment with CAR-T cells might be performed before the achievement of disease complete remission, since the target molecules of CAR-T cells might be no longer detectable. &#x0201c;Bridge&#x0201d; chemotherapy plays an important role in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as leukemic blast burden at the time of CAR-T cell infusion correlates with an increased risk of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The overall tumor burden and the involved sites are additional factors to be considered also in lymphoma patients: many regimens are indicated in this phase, and the choice must take into account the type of histology, the burden of disease, previous treatments, and the fragility of the patient. However, the &#x0201c;bridge&#x0201d; chemotherapy should be given only after leukapheresis in order not to affect the quality of CAR-T cell product (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Two to seven days before CAR-T cell infusion, patients receive a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen to get rid of immune cells and factors endowed with immune suppressive properties and to enhance CAR-T cell functions and engraftment (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The optimal conditioning regimen has not been defined yet, but the majority of studies employed a combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. Experiences at the NCI (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) demonstrated that aggressive lymphodepleting regimens are associated with the increase of both CAR-T cell expansion and toxicity. Of note, certain drugs such as check point inhibitors or other biological drugs (<italic>i.e.</italic>, alemtuzumab, daratumumab, and brentuximab vedotin) should be avoided since they may interfere with expansion and persistence of CAR-T cells after infusion (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Infectious complications and organ toxicities should be minimized during bridging chemotherapy (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5_6"><title>CAR-T Cell Infusion</title><p>CAR-T cell infusion requires an appropriate clinical setting with dedicated gene therapy rooms, medical and nursing standard of practice protocols, documentation and verification procedures for administration. CAR-T cells&#x02019; targeted therapies frequently induce toxicities that can be mitigated by a planned hospital organization. Comprehensive training should be provided to all categories of personnel including scientists, nurses, and physicians, and close collaborations with a range of other specialists, especially intensive care unit (ICU) staff and the neurology/neuroimaging services, are required (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Indeed, the management of patients undergoing CAR-T cells requires two necessary conditions: a structured clinical unit with well-established procedures to take in charge of patients developing acute immunological complications and intensive care unit (ICU) close to the clinical unit. Protocols for the interactions between the two units have to be established at each center.</p></sec><sec id="s5_7"><title>Post-Infusion Follow-Up</title><p>During the pre- and early post-infusion period, patients are generally admitted to inpatient unit, as the rapid <italic>in vivo</italic> proliferation of CAR-T cells may be associated with adverse events, such as CRS and neurotoxicity (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Currently, rapid advances have been made in the identification of clinical and biological predictors and in the design of appropriate standards of care to mitigate the severity and long-term consequences of these complications (<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). CRS is the most common side effect following CAR-T cell therapy, occurring in 30 to 100% of cases, with CRS of grades 3&#x02013;4 in 10&#x02013;30% of patients (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). CRS may present with a spectrum of manifestations from low-grade fever to fulminant multiorgan failure (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). In some studies, approximately 10&#x02013;15% of CAR-T cell patients required vasopressor support for hypotension and/or mechanical ventilation (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). The mainstays of treatment for severe CRS include the anti-IL6-R antibody (tocilizumab), anti-IL6 antibody (siltuximab), high-dose steroids, and supportive care delivered in ICU (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Patients treated with CAR-T cells may develop concomitantly with CRS or as an isolated feature, a potentially fatal neurological toxicity, including delirium, encephalopathy, nerve palsies, and seizures, whose mechanism seems to be related to systemic inflammation due to rapid CAR-T cell expansion (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>). Different products have variable rates and patterns of toxicity, and clinical judgement remains the best method to assess CRS. Tisagenlecleucel induced severe CRS (grade 3 or 4 by the UPenn toxicity criteria) in 48% of pediatric and young adult ALL patients in the ELIANA trial (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and 28% of adult patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the JULIET trial (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), while the ZUMA-1 trial reported a 13% rate (by NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) for axicabtagene ciloleucel in adult DLBCL patients (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Nurses and ancillary medical personnel should be adequately trained about the recognition of CAR-T cells&#x02019; specific care and toxicities in order to expedite the evaluation for the transfer to ICU and treatment with tocilizumab. The second most common adverse event is the immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The symptoms and signs are non-specific, and the severity is correlated with the increase of specific biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, ferritin and IL-6 (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). ICANS incidence has been reported in 12&#x02013;55% of cases. Patients are monitored by nursing tools to identify early manifestations of CRS or neurotoxicity. In the latter case, serial cognitive testing and neurological expertise are needed. In addition to infectious events, CAR-T cell recipients are at increased risk of potential medium-term complications, depending on the type of CAR-T cell product, including delayed tumor lysis syndrome, delayed hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome and CRS, B-cell aplasia, hypogammaglobulinemia. Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia are commonly observed in CAR-T cell treated patients, but generally resolve over several months through the administration of growth factors following the observation at early stages of adverse events.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>The CAR-T Unit</title><p>In order to guarantee the processes illustrated above and the regulation compliance, it is necessary to establish a dedicated organization that comprises different units within the clinical center. The clinical unit has the responsibility to select the patient, to evaluate the donor, to perform the infusion of CAR-T cell product, and to manage the follow-up activities. The apheresis unit collects mononuclear cells and transfers them to TE. The TE performs (if required according to the specific protocol) the processing, labeling, and storage of the aphaeretic product and organizes the shipping to the GMP facilities. Under the responsibility of the pharmacy department, the TE receives the CAR-T product, performs the temporary storage, and transfers the product to the clinical unit for infusion. The pharmacy has the responsibility to receive the drug product and to delegate the TE to store the product. ICU supports the clinical unit in the management of the patients in case of adverse events, together with several medical support consultants.The Organizational Model of the CAR-T Unit</p><p>A CAR-T unit can be organized according to either a centralized or decentralized structure. A CAR-T center requires the work of a multi-disciplinary team.</p><p>The centralized CAR-T unit is a model based on the centralization of the activities with a single unit. This structure is functional for the organizational entities where knowledge and different expertise of the staff are in a single unit. Usually in this organizational modality, the CAR-T unit corresponds to the HSCT Program (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This model is useful where there is a single Unit of Hematology or Onco-hematology.</p><fig id="f1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Centralized CAR-T unit This model is based on the centralization of the activities with a single unit, and it is useful for a single unit involved in CAR-T cell process.

This model is implemented in complex organizational structures in which the types of IECs utilized for cell therapy are different and are administered to patients with either blood malignancies or solid tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). This model is useful in Hospitals and Institutes with separate business units for Oncology and Hematology even within a single CAR-T center. This is useful for the current different values of Oncology and Hematology and the continuous evolution of their relationship. Furthermore, this model allows having a CAR-T unit even in the context of subdomain of Oncology, such as Neuroncology.</p><fig id="f2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Decentralized CAR-T unit This model is suitable when cell therapies occur under the responsibility of different subjects (complex organizational structures with separate business unit for Oncology and Hematology).
