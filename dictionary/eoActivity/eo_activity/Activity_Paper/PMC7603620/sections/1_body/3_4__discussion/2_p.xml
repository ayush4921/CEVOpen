<p>The effects of DOX on serum lipids are also significant. DOX has been reported to cause hyperlipidemia (which include increased serum cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-c, and FFAs) [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and increases cardiovascular disease risk [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This hyperlipidemia is thought to be mediated via downregulation of PPAR-
 <italic>γ</italic> and subsequently affect GLUT4 and FAT/CD36 expression resulting in glucose and fatty acid transporters expression and causing hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia [

 <italic>Irvingia gabonensis</italic> seeds have been reported to induce weight loss, antihyperlipidemia, and reduced cardiovascular disease risk factors in both animal [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and human studies [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] which were reportedly mediated via downregulation of the PPAR-
 <italic>γ</italic> and leptin genes and upregulation of the adiponectin gene mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Thus, the results of this study are in tandem with those of earlier studies.
