<p>The GC-MS analysis and phytoscan of 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> are also notably significant. 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> is shown to contain high contents of 4,6-di-O-methyl-alpha-d-galactose, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid, undecanoic acid, 9,12,15-octadecatrienoic acid, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-sitosterol, phytol, neophytadiene, ethyl 9,12,15-octadecatrienoate, stigmasterol, vitamin E, hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester, Phytyl palmitate, campesterol, and lupeol. Phytosterols such as sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, and phytols have been reported to effectively mitigate lipid peroxidation through antioxidant and free radical scavenging mechanisms and physically stabilize cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] as well as effectively lowered cholesterol especially the LDL-c fraction [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>–
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Similarly, stigmasterol, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-sitosterol, lupeol, lupeol acetate, and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amyrin are known to exhibit other important pharmacological activities such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activities [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Lupeol in particular is known to mediate anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, antiproliferative, anti-invasive, antiangiogenic, and cholesterol-lowering activities [
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Phytol is an important diterpene that possesses antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Hexadecanoic acid is known to exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Squalene, a triterpene, is a natural antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], possessing various other pharmacological properties including antimicrobial property [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Neophytadiene is a good analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant compound [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Thus, the presence of stigmasterol, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-sitosterol, lupeol, phytols, and neophytadiene in high amounts in 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> could be responsible for the cholesterol-lowering, antioxidant, and antilipiperoxidation activities of 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> in DOX-mediated cardiotoxic rats. Similarly, flavonoids, steroids, cardiac glycosides, tannin, and saponin have been reported to elicit antithrombotic activities [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>–
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], and more specifically, plant-derived sitosterol has been reported to have anticoagulant and thrombus-preventing activities in mice [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Thus, the presence of these phytochemicals especially steroids and tannin in high amounts in 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> could be responsible for the observed antithrombotic action of 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> in DOX-intoxicated rats.
