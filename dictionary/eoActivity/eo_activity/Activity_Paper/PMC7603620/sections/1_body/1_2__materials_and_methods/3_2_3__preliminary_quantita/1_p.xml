<p>Preliminary quantitative analysis of the secondary metabolites (including phenol, flavonoids, tannin, terpenoids, steroids, reducing sugars, saponin, and phlobatannin) in 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> was done using methods earlier described by Olorundare et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similarly, using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometer (GC-MS) for phytoscan, the relative abundance of the secondary metabolites in 
 <italic>IGESE</italic> was done using the procedures earlier described by Olorundare et al. [
