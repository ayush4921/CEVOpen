<p>The roots of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> were washed, cut into small pieces, sun-dried at room temperature for seven days, and crushed to a coarse powder with the electric marker. The powder (2500 g) was extracted with 96% absolute alcohol in 3 cycles using a soxhlet extractor. The crude extract was filtered with filter paper (Whatman No. 4). The filtrate was dried by a rotary vacuum evaporator at 30°C to obtain 387.2 g dry residue, a viscous brownish-coloured extract. It was stored in an airtight bottle kept in a refrigerator at 4°C till used. The extracted root was then reconstituted in distilled water at a suitable concentration for the experiment. Ojewale et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] stated in their work that the LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> was 5000 mg/kg body weight administered intraperitoneally; hence, the dosage used equivalent to 1/10
 <sup>th</sup> dose (500 mg/kg body weight) was selected as the highest extract dose. The dose used was consistent with the previous investigation on the plant [
