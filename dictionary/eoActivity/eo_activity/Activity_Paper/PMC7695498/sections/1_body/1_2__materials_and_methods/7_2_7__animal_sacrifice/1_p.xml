<p>After six weeks of treatments (7 days after the experimental period), the animals were anesthetized with diethyl ether. The blood was collected through the cardiac puncture into sample bottles devoid of the anticoagulant. The samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes to obtain the sera. The abdominal cavity of each rat was opened up through a midline abdominal incision to expose the heart. The cardiac tissue was excised and weighed; the cardiac tissue was weighed electronically and balanced. Blood was collected with a heparinized tube and was centrifuged within 10 minutes of the collection at 4000 rpm for 5 minutes to obtain blood plasma was analyzed for lipid profile. Each animal's cardiac tissue was fixed in Bouin's fluid for 48 hours before the histological procedure commenced.</p>
