<p>Several studies have examined the antiparasitic activity of mƒÅnuka oil, for parasites with significant impact on plants, humans and animals (

 <italic>Sarcoptes scabei</italic>), house dust mites (
 <italic>Dermatophagoides farina</italic> and 
 <italic>D. pteronyssinus</italic>), stored product mites (
 <italic>Tyrophagus putrescentiae</italic>) and mosquitos (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>). The adsorption of the active ingredients in the oil are suggested to cause fumigant and/or contact toxicity in the parasites. Contact and fumigation assays are generally used to determine the antiparasitic efficacy of essential oils. The compound efficacy would therefore depend on their lipophilic nature, viscosity and vapor pressure. In contact bioassays, lipophilic and viscous compounds are commonly more effective as they penetrate the cuticle layer of the arthropod. In fumigation bioassays, the toxic compounds are inhaled via the respiratory system and are dependent on the vapor pressure exerted by the compound [
