 </sup>. The FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing 300 m/mol acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 10 mM TPTZ solution in methanol and 20 mM ferric chloride solution in the ratio of 10:1:1. To perform the experiment, 2 ml of FRAP reagent was added to 500 μl of the chloroformic fungal extract and 1 ml of distilled water; the reaction mixture was mixed well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Absorbance was taken at 593 nm. Ferrous sulphate (FeSO
 <sub>4</sub>) was taken as a standard to plot the calibration curve. This linear curve is used to calculate the antioxidant potential of the chloroformic extract to reduce the ferric ions. The values were expressed as mM FeSO4 equivalents/100 mg of the chloroformic fungal extract.
