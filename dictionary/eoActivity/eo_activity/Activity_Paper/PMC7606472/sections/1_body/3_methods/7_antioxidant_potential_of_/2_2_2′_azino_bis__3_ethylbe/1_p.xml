 </sup>. A stock solution of ABTS was prepared using 5 ml of ABTS solution (7 m/mol) mixed with 88 µl of potassium persulphate solution (140 m/mol). The mixture was placed overnight in the dark at room temperature to generate ABTS cation. For the preparation of the working solution of ABTS, its stock solution was diluted with methanol to an absorbance of 0.7 ± 0.05 at 734 nm. Then, 20 µl of the chloroformic fungal extract was added to 980 µl of working solution of ABTS and incubated for 10 min in dark. The absorbance was read at 734 nm spectrophotometrically.
