<p id="Par9">ABTS assay was another method used for estimation of antioxidant potential. This is also a discoloration assay in which antioxidants scavenge the free radicals of ABTS
 <sup>+</sup>, produced during the reaction of ABTS and potassium persulfate. The chloroformic fungal extract showed significant scavenging activity of 20.6- 90.5% at the concentration range of 20–100 µg/ml. At a low concentration of 20 µg/ml, the percentage inhibition was 20.6 which increased to 41% at a concentration of 40 µg/ml and further increased to 90.5 at its highest concentration of 100 mg/ml. Whereas ascorbic acid showed the inhibition of 31.88- 91.44% at a concentration of 2 to 10 µg. Thus it showed dose dependent scavenging activity and gave the linear equation with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 50.55 µg/ml (Fig.
