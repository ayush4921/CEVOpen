<p>Khan et al. reviewed the recent advances in the use of active phytochemicals (APs) against cancers by searching relevant keywords in reliable academic databases, selecting twenty medicinal plants to discuss in detail [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

In addition, the anticancer activity of some APs was confirmed using in vivo animal models.
