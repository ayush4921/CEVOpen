<p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a unique geographical and ethnic distribution. Its high prevalence in Asia accounts for over 80% of new cases globally. Liu et al. studied the anticancer activity of asiatic acid (AA), extracted from 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, using two cisplatin-resistant NPC cell lines [
 <xref rid="B10-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They demonstrated that AA significantly reduced the cell viability in both cell lines through p38-Î± mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated phosphorylation and activation of bcl-2-like protein 4 (Bax) in vitro.
