<p>Inflammation undergoes physiological and pathological responses caused by diverse stimuli such as microbial infections, injury, and traumata. Zwirchmayr et al. identified anti-inflammatory compounds that exhibit nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) inhibiting ability from the extract of masterwort (

 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They successfully isolated four furanocoumarins, one coumarin, and one chromone. According to the results presented, they suggest that ELINA is practicable and may effectively accelerate the process of natural product-based drug discovery in the future.
