<p>Inflammation is part of immunity, Yeh and Lin investigated the immunomodulatory potential of steam-distilled essential oils (SDEOs) from 
 <italic>Acorus gramineusand</italic> and 
 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic> cultivated in Taiwan [
 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. They found SDEOs to be rich in flavonoids, polyphenols, and saponins, and additionally, SDEOs, particularly from 
 <italic>Euodia ruticarpa</italic>, possess immunomodulatory ability by shifting the balance of type 1 and type 2 T helper cells in primary splenocytes and inhibiting inflammation in peritoneal macrophages in vitro.
