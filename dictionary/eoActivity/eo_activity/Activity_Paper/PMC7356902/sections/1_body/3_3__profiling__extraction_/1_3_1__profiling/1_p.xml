<p>Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation could induce stress in plants, and consequently, promotes the production of secondary metabolites through elevated defense responses. It has been reported that of the two 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> varieties, 
 <italic>A. mongholicus</italic> has the higher tolerance to UV-B. Liu et al. further profiled the metabolites, particularly the phenolic compounds of 
 <italic>A. mongholicus</italic>, when subjected to UV-B radiation [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-00936" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Overall, they found that UV-B radiation could induce a tissue-specific strong shift from carbon assimilation to carbon accumulation of phenolic metabolism in roots, and it was activated by the upregulation of some relevant genes.
