<p>Phytochemical omics is clearly an interesting topic and has attracted intensive studies focusing on anticancer, anti-inflammation, immunoregulation, anti-oxidative stress, anti-diabetes, fracture healing, and treatments for neurological, liver, and cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, recent advances in profiling, extraction, identification, and biotechnology are included. The findings offered by the contributors to this special issue may greatly aid the progress of phytochemical research. In the future, I hope that with the rapid development of molecular tools and approaches, particularly in integrative multi-omics and genome editing technologies, scientists will be able to further unravel the efficacy of phytochemicals for benefiting human health.</p>
