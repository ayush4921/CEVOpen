<p>The neighbor-joining (NJ) tree was reconstructed using the complete chloroplast genome sequence of 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> with other published 12 species from NCBI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). All the sequences from NCBI were aligned by MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and the NJ phylogenetic analyses were conducted by MEGA X (Kumar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). We used MEGA X with 2000 bootstraps values under the substitution model to reconstruct the NJ phylogenetic tree. At last, the NJ phylogenetic tree was drawn and edited using MEGA X (Kumar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis result showed that 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> was close to 
 <italic>Carnegiea gigantean in</italic> the phylogenetic relationship by the NJ method in this study. The result can be used for the active ingredient of TCM and drug development in this species.
