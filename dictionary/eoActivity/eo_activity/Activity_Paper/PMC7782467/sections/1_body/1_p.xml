<p>The fresh 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> were collected from the Hunan University of Chinese Medicine that located at Changsha, Hunan, and China (112.90E, 28.13 N), which were stored in the −80 °C refrigerator. Total genomic DNA of 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> was extracted from the fresh leaves with a modified CTAB method and sequenced, which was stored in Hunan University of Chinese Medicine (No.HNUCM-001). Here, the quality controlled and removed the sequences used by FastQC (Andrews

 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> was assembled by MitoZ (Meng et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and annotated by geneious (Kearse et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). All the coding and other genes were predicted by CPGAVAS (Liu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and NCBI Blast (
