<p>Studies were included in this review if they were experimental studies (
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>) or clinical studies on the antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> and if they were articles published in English. The 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> plant can be from any parts of the plant and in any form such as extracts, essential oils, fractions, or isolated compounds. Studies were excluded if they met at least one of the following criteria: 1) study models were not accepted as evidence for pharmacological effects (i.e., antioxidant experiments of FRAP, ABTS, DPPH, and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assays), and 2) intervention was not focused on 
 <italic>Gynura</italic>, although the antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects were measured. Review articles and book chapters were excluded from this study, but the references were mined to search for further relevant studies.
