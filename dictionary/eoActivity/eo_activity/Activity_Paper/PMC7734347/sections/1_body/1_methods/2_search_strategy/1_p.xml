<p>The information was obtained through a comprehensive literature search using the electronic databases of PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct from 2000 to March 2020 for journal articles and the databases of e-theses Online Service and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global for theses. The combination of keywords used in PubMed was as follows: [Gynura (Title/Abstract)] AND [antioxidant (Title/Abstract)] OR [oxidant (Title/Abstract)] OR [oxidative (Title/Abstract)] OR [oxidation (Title/Abstract)] OR [antiinflammatory (Title/Abstract)] OR [antiinflammation (Title/Abstract)] OR [inflammation (Title/Abstract)] OR [inflammatory (Title/Abstract)] OR [inflame (Title/Abstract)]. The reference lists of all included papers were checked for other potentially relevant citations. Studies selection was restricted to articles in English because of language barrier, time efficiency, and high cost for translation. However, only four studies were excluded on the basis of not being published in English, which is unlikely to impact our findings. In order to achieve a comprehensive search of relevant studies, university dissertations, and theses were accessed in the selection process. However, the confidentiality of these tools had possibly veiled some important information and results, for example, negative findings.</p>
