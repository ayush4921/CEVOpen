<p>Previous studies on 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species have indicated that several 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species possessed strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that are fundamental to various therapeutic purposes. Hence, 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species are potential continual source of new and useful bioactive compounds. Identification of the bioactive compounds in the plants contributing to the bioactivities, along with their mechanisms of action responsible for the pharmacological activities, is needed. 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the list of phytochemicals identified in 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species. There is a need to investigate whether the crude extracts or isolated pure compounds are more effective. Synergistic effects of multiple active compounds in the extract may lead to a stronger pharmacological effect than that achievable by a single compound. At this stage, limited clinical studies on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> have been conducted. Human clinical trials with clearly defined symptomology to evaluate the therapeutic value of genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> are necessary because animal experiments cannot be a substitute for clinical trials in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one non-systematic randomized controlled trial that has been carried out. 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Rerknimitr et al. (2016)</xref> investigated the efficacy of 
 <italic>G. pseudochina</italic> DC. var. 
 <italic>hispida</italic> Thv. ointment in treating chronic plaque psoriasis in a randomized controlled trial.
