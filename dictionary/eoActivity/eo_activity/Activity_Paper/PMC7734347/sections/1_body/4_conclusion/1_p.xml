<p>The extracts and phytochemicals of several 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species, particularly 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic>, 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic>, 
 <italic>G segetum</italic>, 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic>, 
 <italic>G. formosana</italic>, 
 <italic>G. nepalensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>G. pseudochina</italic>, have been reported to exhibit strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. However, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies and clinical studies that have been carried out on the species are by no means free of methodological flaws. All 27 studies selected in this systematic review depicted risk of bias at different extent. The lack of randomization, lack of blinding, and unclear methodology explanation are some prevalent limitations. Further preclinical studies, including toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies on 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> extracts and their bioactive compounds, are necessary before they can be subjected to clinical studies. Genus 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> has high potential to be developed into medicinal agents for prophylactic supplements of diseases related to oxidative stress or inflammation.
