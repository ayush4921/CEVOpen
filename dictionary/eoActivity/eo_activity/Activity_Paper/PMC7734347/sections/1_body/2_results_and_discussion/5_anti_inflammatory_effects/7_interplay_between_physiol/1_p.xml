<p>The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species are corroborated to each other. As aforementioned, inflammation and oxidative stress are highly interdependent pathophysiological events. Hence the antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species has supported anti-inflammatory effects by these plants. In general, 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species depict anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting inflammatory signaling pathways, cellular pathogenicity, inflammatory biomolecules secretion, and clinical manifestation of inflammatory diseases. Granulomatous inflammation is the end result of a prolonged complex interplay among causal agents, mononuclear phagocytes activity, circulating immune complexes, and a vast array of biological mediators (

Inflammatory cell infiltration is the critical process in granuloma formation while tissue swelling is one of the possible associated clinical manifestation. The pathogenesis of granulomatous inflammation is manipulated by the vital player of macrophages along with secretion of cytokines and chemokines by immune cells through stimulation of inflammatory signaling pathways (

 <italic>Gynura</italic> are having high potential to be explored for pharmacological evidence of different ailments.
