<p>Nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule that physiologically exerts an anti-inflammatory effect and acts as a pro-inflammatory mediator in the overproduction of the enzyme iNOS (

 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> extract had shown an inhibitory effect on NO production in macrophages (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Liu M. et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ning et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Chandradevan et al., 2020</xref>). This significant NO inhibitory effect by 250 μg/ml 
 <italic>G procumbens</italic> was comparable to the positive control of the non-selective NOS inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME) (

 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> fractions (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, 
 <italic>n-</italic>butanol, and water) at concentrations of 0.3–0.8 mg/ml also exerted 2–64% inhibition of NO production in macrophages. Among the fractions, the ethyl acetate fraction possessed the highest NO inhibitory effect (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Liu M. et al., 2019</xref>). The protein expression of iNOS in macrophages was shown to be inhibited by the 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> extract at a concentration of 250 μg/ml (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Ning et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> showed concentration dependent suppression on iNOS protein expressions and NO production (30% decrease with 120 μg/ml extract) in macrophages (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> extract also inhibited NO production in macrophages, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.16 ± 0.03 μg/ml. Meanwhile, one of the compounds isolated from 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> extract, 8,8′-(ethene-1,2-diyl)-dinaphtalene-1,4,5-triol, depicted the strongest NO inhibitory activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.15 μM (
