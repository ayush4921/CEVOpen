<p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) act as crucial regulatory enzymes in both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways through the actions of cytokine or chemokine activation and antagonism (

 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> dose-dependently inhibited MMP-1 and MMP-9 expression in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs), where the inhibition of the MMP-1 expression by the 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> extract was even more effective than that of the positive control drug retinoic acid (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), the energy provider to generate ATP, is produced when free energy is used to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix via oxidative phosphorylation. Under a stress condition, Δψm can be reduced and can possibly lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in inflammatory responses (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Yue and Yao, 2016</xref>). In a concentration dependent manner, Δψm was increased, and LDH activity was inhibited by 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> extract (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>) and the isolated compound from the 
 <italic>G. nepalensis</italic>, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid ethyl ester (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). The induction of Δψm by the isolated compound of 
 <italic>G. nepalensis</italic> was more effective than that of carbonyl cyanide 
 <italic>m</italic>-chlorophenyl hydrazone, a chemical inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). 
 <italic>G. formosana</italic> also suppressed plasma inflammatory biomarker (LDH, GPT, and CRP) activities in the treated group, where these inhibitory effects were comparable to indomethacin (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). The essential oil of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> and its active ingredient, limonene, showed an inhibitory effect on inflammatory cell infiltration (
