<p>All selected articles were assessed for their quality and risk of bias. 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the quality assessment of studies on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species. The reporting completeness of the material in all selected studies was assessed using information of the 
 <italic>Gynura</italic> species material, voucher specimens, quality control, and chemical analysis. Naming inconsistency between studies was detected as full botanical taxonomic names were not stated in 13 selected studies (

All plant species need to be validated taxonomically, and the full names have to be clearly stated as the incomplete name of plant species can lead to confusion of readers and any recorded uses or properties attributed may, in fact, correlate to different species. Such erroneous publications on the use of plant names are a permanent source of confusion for future research, search engines, and databases (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Rivera et al., 2014</xref>). An incomplete plant name in some contexts may be ambiguous or may even mislead readers. This error is possible to occur within genus
