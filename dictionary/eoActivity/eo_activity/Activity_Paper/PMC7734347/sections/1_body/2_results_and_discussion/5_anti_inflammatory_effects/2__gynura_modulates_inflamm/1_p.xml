<p>Cytokines are released by cells for signaling, where critical pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, are involved in the upregulation of inflammatory reactions (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Turner et al., 2014</xref>) and IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and An, 2007</xref>). 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> inhibited the IL-6 and IL-8 production in UV-induced HaCaT keratinocytes (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> extract also dose-dependently suppressed the IL-6 production in macrophages and inhibited the TNF-α level. At the same time, the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> showed the best inhibitory effect on IL-6 and TNF-α (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Liu M. et al., 2019</xref>). In a parasite-infected mice model, 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> reduced the levels of the liver and serum TNF-α and IFN-γ as well as increased IL-10 level (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> possessed an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the production of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Pai et al., 2019</xref>). 
 <italic>G. pseudochina var. hispida</italic> methanol extract also caused inhibition of IL-1β production (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.46 μg/ml). Meanwhile, ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>G. pseudochina var. hispida</italic> showed strong inhibition of the release of IL-6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.14 μg/ml) and TNF-α (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.49 μg/ml) in monocytes (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Siriwatanametanon et al., 2010</xref>). The extract of 
 <italic>G. pseudochina</italic> and its marker compounds of chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and 
 <italic>p-</italic>coumaric acid also showed significant inhibition of IL-8 production in keratinocytes (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Sukadeetad et al., 2018</xref>). 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> extract inhibited the release of TNF-α (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.20 ± 3.94 μg/ml) and IL-1β (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.72 ± 1.84 μg/ml) in macrophages. Among the isolated compounds of 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic>, 4,5,4′-trihydroxychalcone was the most potent sample in inhibiting IL-1β (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.69 μM), and another isolated compound, rutin, demonstrated the strongest inhibition against TNF-α release in macrophages (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 16.96 μM) (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Yuandani et al., 2017</xref>). The anti-inflammatory effects of 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> and 
 <italic>G. formosana</italic> have been demonstrated by the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> inhibition of TNF-α and IL-1, where the inhibitory effects of 500 mg/kg of 
 <italic>G. segetum</italic> and 
 <italic>G. formosana</italic> extracts were comparable to that of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Seow et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> also suppressed TNF-α production in a diabetic mice model (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2019</xref>).
