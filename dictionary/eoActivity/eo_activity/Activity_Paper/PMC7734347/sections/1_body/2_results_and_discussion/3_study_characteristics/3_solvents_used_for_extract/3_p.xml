<p>Five studies used the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> and 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> to determine their antioxidant or anti-inflammatory activities in human endothelial cells (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Chao et al., 2015</xref>), murine adrenal gland pheochromocytoma (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), murine hepatocytes (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Liu Y. et al., 2019</xref>), diabetic mice (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Pai et al., 2019</xref>), and liver-injured mice (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Liu Y. et al., 2019</xref>). The ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>G. formosana</italic> was studied for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities in granuloma model rats (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). Meanwhile, the ether extract of 
 <italic>G. bicolor</italic> was studied for its anti-inflammatory activity in murine macrophages (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). 
 <italic>G. divaricata</italic> was lyophilized into powder and tested in diabetic mice (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2019</xref>). The study by 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2019)</xref> determined the anti-inflammatory effect of 
 <italic>G. procumbens</italic> essential oil and its active ingredients in murine macrophage and ear-inflamed mice. One randomized controlled study on patients with moderate plaque psoriasis was conducted to study the anti-inflammatory effect of 
 <italic>G. pseudochina</italic> ointment from an ethanol extract with a ratio of one extract to 10 vehicles (
