<p>Different solvent extracts used may possess different antidiabetic properties in the same species of seaweed [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Extracts in water may contain nonphenolic components and may have influenced glucosidase activity [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Besides, the contents and concentrations of bioactive compounds in the extracts of the seaweed studied may have been affected by the different polarities of the extracting solvents used [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The polyphenol content of crude extract of brown seaweed 
 <italic>Sargassum</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Ascophyllum nodosum</italic> had been attributed to, for their high and mild 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activities [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Polyphenols have the ability to chelate enzymes, causing them to precipitate and later experience alteration in structure coupled with a loss of their biological functions. Polyphenols from edible seaweed have also been suggested to influence responses relevant to diabetes through modulation of glucose-induced oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Therefore, phenolic groups which were reported in high concentrations in all the extracts in the present study could be correlated with the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition found in the present study.
