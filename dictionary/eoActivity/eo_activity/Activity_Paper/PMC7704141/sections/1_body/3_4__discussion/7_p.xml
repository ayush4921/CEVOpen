<p>The formation of cancer cells in the human body can be directly induced by free radicals. The use of natural anticancer drugs as effective chemopreventive agents has become an important approach in cancer prevention. Hence, radical scavenging compounds from marine algae can be used indirectly to reduce cancer formation in the human body [

 <italic>Ulva</italic> sp. as anticancer candidate. They reported the cytotoxicity activity of different 
 <italic>Ulva</italic> sp. extracts towards different cell lines including human colon cancer (HCT 116) cells [

 <italic>Halimeda tuna,</italic> in chloroform and methanol extracts have also been reported to show cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells [
