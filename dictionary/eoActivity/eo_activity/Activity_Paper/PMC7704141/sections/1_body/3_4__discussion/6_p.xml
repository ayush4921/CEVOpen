<p>Fucoidan isolated from 
 <italic>Sargassum</italic> sp. brown seaweed showed high 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Fucoidan delays the absorption of dietary carbohydrates in the intestine and leads to the suppression of blood glucose level after a meal. This may provide a way to regulate postprandial hyperglycaemia of diabetic patients. Although fucoidan was not measured in the present study, it is likely that in seaweed extracts which comprise complex matrixes of the compound, antidiabetic properties would not be closely connected with a specific compound, but with a mixture of polar and nonpolar compounds as this mixture of compounds acts synergistically. Nevertheless, our data revealed the potential of the extracts of 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>H. macroloba</italic> sp. to be used as efficient candidates for inhibiting the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase enzyme after slight purification. According to Nguyen et al. 2011 [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the search for 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitors from marine organisms is vital due to their ability to suppress the postprandial hyperglycaemia of diabetic patients.
