<p>Active components responsible for various biological activities could be evaluated by investigating the chemical composition of each extract using GC-MS analysis. The highest number of compounds (27) was noted in the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>U. intestinalis,</italic> followed by 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>macroloba</italic> methanolic extract (22) and 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic> methanolic extract (24). Most of these compounds are known to exhibit various pharmacological activities. In the present study, the highest 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity and cytotoxicity of the methanolic extract were related to the occurrence of a higher number of bioactive compounds including 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexadecanoic acid, 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2-hexadecen-1-ol, stigmast-5-en-3-ol, (3
 <italic>β</italic>,24S)-, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester, benzenepropanoic acid, 3,5-
 <italic>bis</italic>(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-hydroxy-, methyl ester, and phenol, 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-.
