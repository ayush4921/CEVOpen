<p>It has been suggested, therefore, that further work needs to be performed to identify the metabolites components of seaweed that are useful for industrial and pharmaceutical applications. A holistic approach is proposed to further authenticate the health benefits of seaweed, in order to unravel the new potentials of edible species through biochemical profiling. Consequently, the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the chemical compositions and investigate the 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory and cytotoxic activities of extracts of 3 selected species of seaweed available in Peninsular Malaysia against five cancer cell lines including MCF-7 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells, HT-29 cells, Hep G2 cells, and 3T3 cells using a colorimetric (MTT) assay. The three selected species of seaweed investigated include 
 <italic>U. intestinalis, H. macroloba</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. ilicifolium</italic>. The overall aim of this study was to explore the potentials of these abundant species of seaweed for utilization as a functional food for human consumption, in order to promote the commercial cultivation of the species.
