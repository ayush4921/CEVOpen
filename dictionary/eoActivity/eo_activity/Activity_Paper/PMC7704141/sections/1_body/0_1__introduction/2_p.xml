<p>In research and development, most researchers working on marine seaweed are those within the medical or pharmacology disciplines, where their attention is particularly focused on the medical significance and application of extracts from seaweed based on pharmaceutical potentials [

At the moment, cancer and diabetes mellitus, especially Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are among the group of diseases that are considered to be of public health concern around the world. Moreover, the prevalence of these diseases has increased steadily in recent years [

In Malaysia, for instance, data from the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) showed the prevalence of T2DM as significant, measured at approximately 14.9% in 2006. This alarming public health concern continues to increase, as in 2011 and 2015, 15.2% and 17.7% cases were recorded, respectively. The prevalence of T2DM in Malaysia is projected to reach about 21.6% in 2020. As the use of natural anticancer and antidiabetic medication in effective chemopreventive therapy is fast becoming one of the important approaches of cancer prevention and for management of T2DM, the evaluation for the active components responsible for the biological activities against these ailments needs to be properly investigated.
