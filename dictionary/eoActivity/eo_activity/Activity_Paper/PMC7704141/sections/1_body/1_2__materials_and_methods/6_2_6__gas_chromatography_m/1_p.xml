<p>Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was employed to characterize and quantify bioactive substances in the seaweed extracts. Methanolic extracts were characterized quantitatively via GC-MS, according to slight modifications to the method adopted by Han et al. 2009 [

The column temperature was maintained at 50°C for 3 min, then programmed at 250°C for 10 min, and maintained at 250°C for 30 min. The inlet and the detector temperatures were set at 250°C, and the solvent cut time was set at 4.50 min. The identification of peaks was based on a computer-based program matching the mass spectra with those in the library for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NlST3208 and NIST 08s). This was done by comparing retention time data with that obtained for authentic laboratory standards. Individually detected peak areas were quantified and expressed as a percentage of total components detected.
