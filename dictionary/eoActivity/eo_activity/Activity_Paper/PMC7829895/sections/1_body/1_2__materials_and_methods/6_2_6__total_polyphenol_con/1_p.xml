<p>In this assay [
 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], 120 μL of samples (from the two plants, for each month) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL were treated with 500 μL of Folin–Ciocalteu (10%) reagent and gallic acid was used as standard. Time reaction was 8 min, and at this moment, the reaction was maintained at rest. Later, 400 μL of sodium carbonate (7.5%) was added to neutralize the mixture. Then, triplicate samples were kept at room temperature, in the dark for 120 min. Meanwhile, they were transferred to 96 well plates for later reading on a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-2550, Shimadzu) at 765 nm.
