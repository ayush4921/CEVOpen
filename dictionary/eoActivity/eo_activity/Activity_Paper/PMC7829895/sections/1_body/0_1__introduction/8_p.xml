<p>Thus, based on the extensive literature demonstrating 
 <italic>M. x villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> therapeutic aspects, these two species deserve attention, mainly in areas where they are not well explored, such as in photoprotection and seasonality of nonvolatile extracts, since plants employ many mechanisms to adapt themselves to its environmental conditions in order to regulate its metabolism [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and it can directly impact in secondary metabolites production. Therefore, understanding the annual variations of secondary metabolites of these two species can help us to better use them in terms of pharmaceutical product development. A previous study by Terto et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as well as unpublished data [
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], showed that these two species have promising photoprotective activity in vitro since they presented a sun protection factor (SPF) of around 13. Thus, we evaluated the seasonal variations that occurred in 
 <italic>M. x villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>, by monitoring the quantitative production of polyphenols, flavonoids, and rosmarinic acid month by month, the role of solar radiation, and precipitation in the production of these metabolites and their implications for the SPF and antioxidant activity of these extracts.
