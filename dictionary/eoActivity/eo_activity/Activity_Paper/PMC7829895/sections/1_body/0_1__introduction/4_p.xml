<p>Many of the biological activities presented by 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> are due to the presence of essential oils that are widely studied and have monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in their composition [

 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, its nonvolatile extracts also have a large amount of biologically interesting compounds, such as phenolic compounds. In 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic>, several phenolic acids have been identified, such as rosmarinic acid, quinic acid, and chlorogenic acid, as well as several flavonoids, such as luteolin and apigenin derivatives, hesperidin, kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide, eriocitrin and chrysoeriol-7-O-rutinoside [

 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>, many polyphenols have also been identified, such as caffeic acid, gallic acid, rosmarinic acid, crisimaritin, luteolin, and apigenin derivatives, p-cumaric acid, taxolifin, among others [
