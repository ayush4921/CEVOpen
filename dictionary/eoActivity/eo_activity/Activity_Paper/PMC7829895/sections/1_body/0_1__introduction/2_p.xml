<p>It is known that an increase of UVB radiation incidence and a decrease of precipitation can cause an increase in the production of free radicals, causing cellular damage that forces the plant to respond to this stimulus, altering morphological characteristics until the content of metabolites produced change, i.e., the increase of polyphenols [
