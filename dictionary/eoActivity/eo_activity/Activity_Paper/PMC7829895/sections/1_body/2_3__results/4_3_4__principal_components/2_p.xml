<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00110-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the correlation between PC4 Ã— PC1 of the PCA explained 80% of the existing groups. For a better understanding of the results, SPF values were categorized through colors to differentiate the value of this parameter in each species. In this figure, it is possible to observe that samples that showed the highest SPF values were grouped more to the left in green, for both 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>, in addition, it is possible to observe that something beyond the SPF influence in these groups and it is the phenolic content.
