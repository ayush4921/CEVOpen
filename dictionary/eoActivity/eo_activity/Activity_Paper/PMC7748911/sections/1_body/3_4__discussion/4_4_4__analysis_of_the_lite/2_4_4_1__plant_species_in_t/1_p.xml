<p>The antihypertensive activity of 
 <italic>Opuntia ficus</italic>–indica Mill. was reported among Zulu medicinal plants where the aqueous leaf extract inhibited the activity of ACE 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Other investigations on 
 <italic>O. ficus</italic>–indica have indicated antihypercholesterolemic, antihyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities perhaps due to the presence of phenolics and flavonoid compounds [

 <italic>R. caffra</italic>, also known as quinine tree, is a fast-growing tree predominantly found in Africa. It is traditionally used for the treatment of hypertension, cough, stomach ailments, wounds, and diarrhoea [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Antihypertensive activity associated with this plant was shown by a reduction in the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats [
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The high blood pressure lowering effect has been linked to the presence of reserpine [
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. The cultivation for food of 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. also known as hemp has been limited due to the presence of the psychoactive compound (tetrahydrocannabinol). However, a peptide isolated from the hemp seed has been reported to show antioxidant and antihypertensive activities through the inhibition of ACE [
