The exact causes of high blood pressure are unknown, but several risk factors such as family history, smoking, extensive use of alcohol, being overweight or obese, high sodium intake, high sugar intake, or lack of physical activity have been linked to the development of hypertension [

There are different treatment regimens for hypertension, but these are associated with side effects, and hence, there is still a need for alternative treatment modalities. In this regard, different societies have their own systems in place to maintain and restore well-being, including traditional medicine that are of great importance as research has shown that their therapeutic properties are associated with secondary plant metabolites which treat the disease effectively with fewer or no side effects compared to the use of synthetic drugs [
