About forty percent (39.6%) of the participants had primary education, 47.2% secondary education, 1.9% tertiary education, and 11.3% had no formal education. None of the participants in this study was employed, and with the exception of one healer who used eight plant species and another who used 12 plant species, all of the participants used up to six plant species to treat hypertension. All the traditional healers that participated in this survey got their trainings through family knowledge particularly from ancestors.
