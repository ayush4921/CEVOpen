<p>Most bacteria grow in a neutral and mildly alkaline environment, whereas yeasts and moulds could grow in an acidic environment (pH = 4.0–4.5). Conversely, the pH values of honey are neither those needed for bacteria nor yeast growth [

 <xref rid="B18-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The pH value of Tualang, Gelam, and Kelulut honeys were reported to be in the range of 3.14–3.83. Moreover, the sugar content of these three honeys has complied with the requirement of the European Honey Legislation and Codex Alimentarius Standards. In terms of honey colour characteristics, Tualang honey is described as light amber honey and Gelam honey belongs to dark amber honey, whilst standard Kelulut honey is amber brown [
