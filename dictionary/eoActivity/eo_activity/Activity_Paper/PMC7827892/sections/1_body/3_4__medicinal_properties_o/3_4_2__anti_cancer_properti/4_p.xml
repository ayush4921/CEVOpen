<p>In an animal model of oral squamous cell carcinoma, Tualang honey showed chemopreventive capabilities by suppressing cancer cell proliferation and activity, as demonstrated by the decrease in the expression of CCND1, EGFR, and COX-2, which are genes related to cancer development and cellular proliferation. In addition, Tualang honey inhibited the aggressiveness of oral squamous carcinoma by down-regulating TWIST1 and RAC1, which are the genes representing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and overexpressing Î²-catenin and E-cadherin [
