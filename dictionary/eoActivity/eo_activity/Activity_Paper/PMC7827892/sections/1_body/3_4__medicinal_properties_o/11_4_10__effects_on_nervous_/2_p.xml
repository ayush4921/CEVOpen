<p>Several clinical studies have found that oestrogen treatment has a protective effect on aging women’s cognitive decline [

In a study on stressed ovariectomised rats, Tualang honey or 17β-estradiol treatment has been shown to demonstrate antidepressive-like effects, possibly via restoration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and enhancement of the BDNF concentration [

In the same set of studies, rats administered with Tualang honey or 17β estradiol showed improved short-term and long-term memory and enhanced neuronal proliferation of hippocampal CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions compared with untreated stressed ovariectomised rats [

A randomised controlled trial comparing Tualang honey supplementation and oestrogen plus progestin therapy demonstrated that postmenopausal women who received Tualang honey showed improvements in their immediate memory but not in immediate memory after the interference and delayed recall as oestrogen plus progestin therapy. However, this finding is comparable with the improvement seen in women receiving oestrogen plus progestin treatment [
