<p>Wound healing is associated with keloid scar formation. Keloid scar formation is due to the excessive induction of EMT by TGFβ in keratinocytes. In a study, treatment of 0.0015% Kelulut honey has been demonstrated to reduce the TGFβ-induced EMT in human primary keratinocytes, indicating Kelulut honey’s therapeutic potential in preventing keloid scar formation [
