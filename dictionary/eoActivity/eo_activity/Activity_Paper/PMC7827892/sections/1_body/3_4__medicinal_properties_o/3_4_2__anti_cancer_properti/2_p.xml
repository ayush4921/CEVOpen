<p>Three in-vivo studies demonstrated the anti-cancer properties of Tualang honey in a breast cancer model [

 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The anti-cancer effect of Tualang honey was demonstrated through modulation in five aspects: tumor growth, tumor grading and haematologic, oestrogenic and apoptotic activities. Lower growth rate, tumor size, weight and multiplicity of tumor in the Tualang honey-treated group than those in the untreated control were reported in a rat breast cancer model [

 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Histologically, breast cancer rats treated with Tualang honey were primarily graded I and II compared with the untreated control, in which the majority was grade III [

 <xref rid="B61-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Tualang honey treatment was also found to modulate haematological parameters, such as haemoglobin (Hb), red blood cells (RBCs), packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration MCHC, polymorphs and lymphocytes values [
