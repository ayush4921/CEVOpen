 <xref rid="B84-nutrients-13-00197" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Some types of honey, such as Manuka honey, possess high non-peroxide antibacterial activity that could retain the antibacterial activity even after treatment with catalase [

The antibacterial potencies of Tualang, Gelam, and Kelulut honeys were generally comparable to those of Manuka honey, with Tualang honey being the closest. Gelam, Kelulut, and Tualang honeys have a high antibacterial activity of total and non-peroxide activities, indicating that peroxide and non-peroxide components are mutually important antibacterial mechanism of these honeys [

Yap et al. (2012) found that anti-microbial activity was strongly positively correlated with the phenolic content, whilst the total flavonoid content was moderately positively correlated with antibacterial activity [
