<p>The viral product of another human coronavirus strain HCoV-NL63 has been decreased (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.17 ± 0.75 μg/mL) by treatment of the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>Sambucus formosana</italic> stems (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). Caffeic acid was the most potent antiviral agent (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.54 ± 0.77 μM; or ~640 ± 140 ng/mL) identified among the extracts' phenolic compounds. It has been cited that caffeic acid inhibits the attachment of HCoV and other viruses such as hepatitis B to host cells by the ability to bind to S proteins. Still, the specific binding sites were not identified (

 <italic>S. formosana</italic> are likewise non-toxic and suitable for human use as the extracts of 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic>, another species that belongs to the same genus of 
 <italic>S. formosana</italic>, have been commercialized to treat symptoms of colds and flu. However, clinical studies would be necessary to ensure this. The bioavailability and delivery mechanisms of these extracts must also be taken into consideration to attain therapeutic plasma levels for viral inhibition (
