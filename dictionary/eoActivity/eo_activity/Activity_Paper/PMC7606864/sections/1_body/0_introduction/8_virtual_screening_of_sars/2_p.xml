<p>Moreover, Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) selected 13 compounds for further investigations as potential inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 of 115 compounds tested in TCHM that have been virtually tested. Many of these polyphenol candidates, such as quercetin and kaempferol, are naturally present and can be considered as treatments for other diseases (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Nevertheless, there are many doubts about the potential lack of efficacy of some polyphenols and traditional herbal medicines that are promoted to treat the symptoms of COVID-19. For example, however, the TCHM called Lianhuaqingwen demonstrated antiviral potential against SARS-CoV-2, with quite higher EC
 <sub>50</sub> when compared to the commercial drug remdesivir (~411 vs. 0.39 Î¼g/mL, respectively) using the same method (
