<p>Several plant-derived compounds have been tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for their antiviral potential against human coronavirus strains. Saikosaponins (A, B2, C, and D) characterize a group of oleanane derivatives, usually existing as glycosides, which naturally occur in medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Scrophularia scorodonia, Heteromorpha</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Bupleurum</italic> spp. The antiviral potential of saikosaponins has previously been evaluated against several viruses such as measles virus and hepatitis B virus (

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>), hepatitis C (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>), and HCoV-229E coronavirus strain (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). Saikosaponins (A, B2, C, and D) showed good to moderate antiviral potential against HCoV-229E, particularly saikosaponin B2, which showed the highest efficacy (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.7 ± 0.1 μM). The same compound showed inhibitory activity on viral attachment and penetration. It seems that saikosaponin B2 has the potential to display a wide range of bioactivity, including inhibition of cellular entry of hepatitis C as well as inhibition of drug transporters that are associated with resistance of multidrug and present on the cellular surface (
