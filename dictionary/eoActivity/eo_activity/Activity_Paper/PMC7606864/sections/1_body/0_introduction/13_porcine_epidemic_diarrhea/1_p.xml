<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a severe enteric coronavirus from the α-CoV subclass that infects the cells lining pigs' gastrointestinal tract causing severe dehydration and diarrhea, leading to economic losses in porcine herds worldwide. Many natural phytochemicals have demonstrated antiviral activities against PEDV, particularly quercetin and griffithsin and their derivatives that have also been considered as antiviral agents against human CoVs (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) reported some chemical derivatives that can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases, and quercetin was shortlisted. Furthermore, quercetin-7-rhamnoside at a low concentration of 0.03 μM provided 50% inhibition of viral activity, lower than that of quercetin about 187 times (

The authentic mode of actions of quercetin-7-rhamnoside or quercetin against PEDV was not yet determined; however, a previous computer modeling study conducted by Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) has indicated that silico testing (a computer model to complement and accelerate
