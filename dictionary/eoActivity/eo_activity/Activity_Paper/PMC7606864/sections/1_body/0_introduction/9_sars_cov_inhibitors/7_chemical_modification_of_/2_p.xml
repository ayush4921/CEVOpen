<p>Moreover, quercetin has demonstrated antiviral activity against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) less 100 times than quercetin-7-rhamnoside (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). The antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin was also raised by 10-fold by adding 2-acetamido-Î²-
 <italic>D</italic>-glucopyranosylamine to its glycoside chain. The enhancement in the antiviral activity can be ascribed to increasing its attraction to the S proteins. Again,

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Although the examples of amendments displayed here differ, it is necessary to not assume that substitutions were randomly supplemented but rather performed to target a particular biochemical pathway and/or receptor. For example, the supplementation of residues of amino acids and glycosides to glycyrrhizin was conducted in request to raise its attraction to the highly glycosylated S proteins of SARS-CoV. Consequently, future investigations seeking to find effective natural inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 must also take into account investigating the potential designing or modifications of synthetic derivatives that might enhance required activity.
