<p id="Par27">This paper considers ethnomedicinal data of wild plant species encountered during the 2017 and 2018 fieldwork for the current data analysis. Ethnobotanical interviews and data analysis focused on “wild” (non-cultivated) plants native to the study area. For instance, species such as 
 <italic>Malus domestica</italic>, 
 <italic>Prunus x domestica</italic>, 
 <italic>Morus alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Robinia pseudoacacia</italic>, etc. were excluded from the study since they are either widely cultured or exotic. Although they are also cultivated, 
 <italic>Corylus avellena</italic>, 
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic>, 
 <italic>Ribes rubrum</italic>, etc. were included as they are native to the area or have run wild and become naturalized. There was no focus on or promotion of exotic plant species or unconventional (introduced) knowledge related to them. This choice was made not only for logistical reasons but also because even though exotic plants may somewhat enrich local ethnobotanical knowledge [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Furthermore, participant knowledge and perceptions of plant collecting places were used to decide which species qualified as “wild.” Based upon these criteria, a total of 152 wild plant species were included in the analysis.
