This corresponds to part of the highlands between the Hopa-Artvin-Ardahan-Çıldır main road (41° 23′ 38′′ N, 41° 25′ 08′′′ E–41° 01′33′′ N, 43° 28′14′′ E) in Turkey and Batumi-Khulo-Akhaltsikhe-Ninotsminda main road (41° 36′03′′ N, 41° 34′30′′ E–41° 08′ 30′′ N, 43° 47′ 24′′ E) in Georgia. It falls within the borders of Adjara and Samtskhe-Javakheti regions in Georgia; Artvin and Ardahan provinces in Turkey. The area includes the characteristics of three of the world’s ecological regions: The Caucasus Mixed Forest Ecoregion, Euxine Colchic Deciduous Forest Ecoregion, and to a lesser extent Eastern Anatolian Montane Steppe Ecoregion [
