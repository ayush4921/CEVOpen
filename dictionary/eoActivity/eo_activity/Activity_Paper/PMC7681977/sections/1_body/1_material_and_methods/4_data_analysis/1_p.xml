<p id="Par25">Firstly, all reported plant species and their relevant ethnobotanical data were entered into a Microsoft® Excel spreadsheet in a use-report (UR) based order, following the categories in the Economic Botany Data Collection Standard [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Under each use-category, each different use was counted as one UR. For example, if a participant mentioned a species used for headache and coughing, it counted as 2 UR. Secondly, the data of wild plants and their related medicinal use reports were extracted. After a final classification of the categories, pivot tables were constructed for further analysis. The final classification of reported ailments and diseases considered The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2-R) developed by World Organization of Family Doctors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO), on suggestions by several authors of comparative ethnomedicinal studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Thirteen medicinal use-categories for several emic subcategories were determined (Table
