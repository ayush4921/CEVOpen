 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the number of use-reports, number of species, cultural importance, and informant consensus for each medicinal use-categories. Comparison of the results in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> reveals that ailments related to digestive and skin problems have the highest number of use-reports in both countries (in total, 43% of URs in Georgia, 49% of URs in Turkey). In order of importance, these categories are followed respectively by respiratory, cardiovascular, and muscle-skeletal disorders in both countries. Conversely, complaints related to ear, eye, blood, psychological, and neurological conditions have the least (or not any) use-reports in both countries. On the other hand, the informant consensus factor (FIC) in medicinal use categories are, in order of importance, digestive, skin, muscle-skeletal in Georgia and skin, digestive, muscle-skeletal in Turkey. There is no statistical consensus in the ear category in both countries; neither is there any consensus in the psychological and blood category in Turkey. However, it is noted that low (e.g., eye and neuro) or exceptionally high (e.g., in psych) FIC values in this table can be misleading since they were represented by very low use reports; it should not be interpreted as a high degree of intracultural variation but it might be a sign of insufficient documentation of participants’ knowledge [
