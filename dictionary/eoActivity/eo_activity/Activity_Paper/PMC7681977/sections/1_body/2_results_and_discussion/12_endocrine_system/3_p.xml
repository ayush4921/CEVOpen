<p id="Par73">The 15 genera/species with highest CI and their relative importance in each medicinal use-category are shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. It seems that the culturally most important species are also the most versatile species in terms of number of different uses. Based on CI index value, two-thirds of the top 15 genera in both countries have use reports for at least seven medicinal use categories. Therefore, the diversity of usage makes these species and genera of top priority for our participants’ health, well beings and cultures.
