<p id="Par41">One thousand five hundred six use-reports for 152 native wild plant species are documented for medical purposes in the study area. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the overlaps between the recorded numbers of wild plant species among studied communities. The regions on either side of the border share 83 of the reported plant species. Considering the fact that almost the same flora is found in the two regions, the level of similarity is low. In addition, the number of unique species (43 species) mentioned only by participants in Georgia is significantly higher than the number of unique species (26 species) mentioned only in Turkey (Fig.
