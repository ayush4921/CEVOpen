<p id="Par57">Sap of 
 <italic>Chelidonum majus</italic> is the only shared species commonly used externally to cure warts in both countries. Magic rituals are also reported for this skin disorder. 
 <italic>Alnus glutinosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Salix</italic> spp. are the ones to cure warts in Turkey. With the former, as many 
 <italic>Alnus glutinosa</italic> leaves as the number of warts are hung on the wall. It is thus believed that the warts will disappear when the leaves dry and fall to the ground. In the latter practice, people carve as many notches as the number of warts in a branch of 
 <italic>Salix</italic> spp. and keep it over the roof of the house. The wart is predicted to disappear when the branch falls from the roof.
