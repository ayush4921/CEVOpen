<p id="Par47">Asteraceae is seen to have the highest number of genus (16 in Georgia; 15 in Turkey) in both countries. The CI index of this family in Georgia is more than threefold that of Turkey. Significant differences in CI are also noted at the species level. While 
 <italic>Anthemis</italic> spp. (CI 0.96) are the most important species following 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> (CI 0.62) on the Georgian side, in Turkey 
 <italic>Helichrysum rubicundum</italic> (CI 0.28) is the most important, following 
 <italic>Anthemis</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> with same CI value of 0.23. These results might be a sign of differences in the level of knowledge regarding medicinal use of this plants among studied communities. The Rosaceae is the second culturally most important family in Georgia and third in Turkey, mostly respresented by 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> genus comprising approximately half of the CI value of Rosaceae in both countries. Although several 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> species have been recorded for medicinal use, a particular selection between two different species between two countries is noted. While 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> with a CI of 0.31 is the most important 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> species in Georgia; 
 <italic>Rosa spinosissima</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>R. pimpinellifolia</italic>) with a CI of 0.32 is the most important 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> species in Turkey, being more than threefold that the CI index of 
 <italic>R. spinosissima</italic> in Georgia (0.09). The small CI index value of 
 <italic>Rosa spinosissima</italic> in Georgia may be due to the fact that it has a narrow distribution and low abundance in Georgia. However, as far as observed, this species has a relatively wider distribution and high abundance in Turkey. Another possible and more plausible explanation is that the particular medicinal use of this species in Turkey, especially in Ardahan, could be related to similar cultural background and unique ethnomedicinal knowledge of the people living there. The frequent use of 
 <italic>Rosa spinosissima</italic> roots as medicinal tea in this province is an uncommon medicinal use, which has so far rarely been cited in the literature in Turkey. One previous report was from Çıldır, Ardahan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] within the area of this study, while a further two more reports were from the nearby region, in Erzurum [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Consensus in this traditional knowledge in Ardahan is likely to reflect the therapeutic efficacy of this plant, a point of interest to be noted for further ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies.
