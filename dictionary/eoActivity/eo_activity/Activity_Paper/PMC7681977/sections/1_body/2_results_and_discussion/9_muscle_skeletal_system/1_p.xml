<p id="Par68">Muscle-skeletal complaints are among the top five medicinal use categories in both Georgia (CI 1.62) and Turkey (CI 0.78) with relatively high FIC values (0.67 in Georgia; 0.63 in Turkey) in both countries. Bone and joint pain, and rheumatism problems are widely reported by the participants in both countries (34% of the muscle-skeletal URs in Tukey; 74% of them in Georgia). A bathing in water decoction of Urtica dioica aerial parts or Equisetum arvense aerial parts is the most commonly used remedy in both countries. Plastering of body with fresh leaves of U

Bathing in water decoction or plastering of Tussilago farfara leaves, and bathing in water decoction of Equisetum arvense aerial parts are suggested as its remedies in Adjara.
