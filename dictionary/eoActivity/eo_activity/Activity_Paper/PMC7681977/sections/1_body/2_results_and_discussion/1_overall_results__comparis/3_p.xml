<p id="Par43">When comparisons were based on medicinal use categories (e.g., digestive, respiratory, cardiovascular system etc.), out of 490 species-use combinations, only 120 (24% of the reports) of these were found to be in common in both countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). The results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> a and b indicate significantly low consensus of medicinal knowledge about shared native wild flora across the border. Participants in both countries use a significant number of shared species for different purposes. This lack of shared ethnomedicinal knowledge might be a sign of different epidemiology of certain ailments in communities studied as well as various medicinal knowledge systems in ethnolinguistically diverse communities on both sites of the border.
