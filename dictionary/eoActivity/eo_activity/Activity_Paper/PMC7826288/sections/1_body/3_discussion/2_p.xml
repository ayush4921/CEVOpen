<p>Methods of TL measurement based on gel imaging analysis of PCR products suffer from a strong background and low contrast for the short telomeres. By directly measuring TL one molecule at a time, the single-molecule method can circumvent the background issue of gel imaging analysis and reveal the length distribution of telomeres, especially the short ones at any defined length ranges. Extension measurements using single-molecule force spectroscopy reveals the shortest TLs at a low occurring frequency. The short telomeres &lt;1 kb occurs 10Ã— less than the long ones peaked at 2.5 kb. Because the short telomeres can activate DNA damage responses and cellular senescence, the capability of measuring the shortest telomeres without background noise like that in gel imaging of PCR products demonstrates that single-molecule force spectroscopy can serve as a unique tool in the research of telomere biology, epidemiology, and cancer therapy, among others.</p>
