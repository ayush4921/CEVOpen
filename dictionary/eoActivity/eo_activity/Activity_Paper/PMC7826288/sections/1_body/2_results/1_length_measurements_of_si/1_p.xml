<p>To investigate the single-molecule behavior of TRF1 organizing human telomeres, we first prepared single human telomeres for mechanical manipulations. We extracted genomic DNA from K562 leukemia cells (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), a standard cell line for telomere length (TL) assessment (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). We assessed the integrity of DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis, which revealed intact genomes without degradation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). The K562 genomic DNA then underwent digestion by four restriction enzymes (BfaI/CviAII/MseI/NdeI), which have been used in terminal restriction fragment (TRF) analysis to measure TL (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). The resulting terminal restriction fragments contain full telomeres from all chromosomes with minimized subtelomeric regions. The four restriction enzymes generate either ‘TA’ or ‘AT’ 5′ overhangs at the proximal end of telomeres. To achieve affinity interactions in single-molecule mechanical manipulations, we used the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to incorporate digoxigenin-dUTP in the 5′ overhangs of ‘TA’ or ‘AT’ to form blunt ends. Because the Klenow fragment had neither 5′ to 3′ nor 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, the 3′ overhangs of telomeres with TTAGGG repeats remained intact. Therefore, we designed the biotinylated DNA oligos of Biotin- (5′-TAACCC-3′)
 <sub>3</sub> to capture the 3′ overhangs of telomeres. With biotin and digoxigenin modifications on K562 telomeres, we were able to manipulate single human telomeres using magnetic tweezers mechanically.
