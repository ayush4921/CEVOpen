<p>Distribution of changes in extension discloses that TRF1 condenses a single telomere with heterogenous loops. We measured the changes in extension (Δ
 <italic>L</italic>) at 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> = 2–20 pN and TL = 2.5–3.5 kb (Equation 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="M1">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). The Δ
 <italic>L</italic> distributions reveal two major components upon the disruption of TRF1–TRF1 interactions or TRF1-DNA interactions at [TRF1] = 10, 20 and 40 nM. The short Δ
 <italic>L</italic> of ∼250 bp is independent of the TRF1 concentrations. On the other side, the size of long Δ
 <italic>L</italic> decreases from 640 ± 212 bp at [TRF1] = 10 nM to 470 ± 120 bp at [TRF1] = 20 nM or 545 ± 124 bp at [TRF1] = 40 nM (Gaussian center ± sigma). Furthermore, Δ
 <italic>L</italic> of &gt;2000 bp occurs with low frequencies at [TRF1] = 10 nM but is not detectable at [TRF1] = 20 and 40 nM. Together, these data suggest that TRF1–telomere complexes form heterogenous loops, in which the long loop sizes respond to changes of TRF1 concentrations.
