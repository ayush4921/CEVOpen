<p>To further understand the role of TRF1 at telomeres upon fork movement, e.g. induced by replication or transcription, we designed a DNA hairpin construct for mechanical strand-separation assays. The hairpin stem has 23 repeats of TTAGGG motifs in 169 bp, close to dsDNA’s persistence length (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). The hairpin loop contains four nucleotides of thymine. At the fork end of the hairpin stem, there is a random sequence of 18 bp. We embedded two non-telomeric sequences, TGG and CGTC, in the stretch of the telomeric sequence after the 10th and 20th of TTAGGG motif, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). The two non-telomeric sequences in the hairpin stem facilitate the correct base pairing in the strand-separation assays. Two strands of the telomeric dsDNA unzip when forces are above the critical melting force of 15.1 ± 0.6 pN (mean ± SD,

Because of the interactions between TRF1 and telomeric dsDNA, TRF1 can block the dsDNA strand separation from the upstream to the downstream. By probing interruptions of strand separation, we can site-specifically measure the dynamics of TRF1 dissociation from a telomeric DNA in real-time.
