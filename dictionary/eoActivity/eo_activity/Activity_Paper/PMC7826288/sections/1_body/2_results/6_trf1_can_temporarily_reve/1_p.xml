<p>While the forward movement of a fork drives the dissociation of TRF1 upon strand separation, we occasionally observed backward steps of fork movements at 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> = 17 pN. Reverse steps suggest that the fork of the telomeric hairpin stem moves backward due to the blockage by a TRF1 binding event (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). To further examine the backward steps, we next modulated the 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> from 17 pN down to 15.8 pN, which is still &gt;1 standard deviation higher than the critical force of 15.1 ± 0.6 pN (mean ± SD, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 98). Also, we decreased the TRF1 concentration from 25 to 10 nM, crossing the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> of 17.5 nM and reducing the binding events in a single strand separation assay. At 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> = 15.8 pN and [TRF1] = 10 nM, the occasionally happened backward steps become hopping events with high frequency, indicating that TRF1 blockage on the strand separation of a telomeric dsDNA is sensitive to forces and protein concentrations (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, inset). Without TRF1, strand-separation assays show no pauses when forces jumped from 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>low</sub> = 6 pN to 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> = 15.8 pN, or vice versa. On the other side, many pauses happen upon a force jump from 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>test</sub> = 15.8 pN to 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>low</sub> = 6 pN at the presence of TRF1, which contrasts to the single drop of extensions with a force jump from 17 to 6 pN (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> versus B, green). Both hopping events and pauses mentioned above manifest that TRF1 binding events can interrupt the unzipping and zipping processes of telomeric dsDNA.
