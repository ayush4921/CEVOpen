<p>To characterize the role of TRF1 in modulating the dynamics of a telomeric fork, we designed a short hairpin construct that contains 13 repeats of TTAGGG in the stem. The short telomeric hairpin had a similar configuration as that of the long hairpin construct with 23 repeats of the TTAGGG motif (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S7</xref>). However, the short DNA allows us to observe hopping events upon the fork movement, which are rare in the long one. Under the same buffer conditions as that for the long hairpin construct, we performed strand-separation assays at constant forces using the short hairpin construct.
