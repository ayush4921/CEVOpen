<p>We commercially synthesized biotinylated DNA oligo of biotin-(5′-TAACCC-3′)
 <sub>3</sub>. The probe can bind telomeres via base-pairing. We then added streptavidin-coated beads (Cat#: 65305, M270, Invitrogen, USA) to capture K562 telomeres via biotin–streptavidin interactions. We isolated the M270 beads with K562 telomeres using magnets and washed other genomic DNA fragments away. The human telomeres immobilized on M270 beads underwent measurements using single-molecule force spectroscopy.
