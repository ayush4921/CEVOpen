<p>We expressed TRF1 in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3). The LB medium contains 100 μg/ml of Ampicillin sodium for culturing. After induction for 18 hours with 0.5 mM of isopropyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 25°C, we collected cell pellets by centrifugation which was followed by resuspension in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol) supplemented with 20 U RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Cat#: M6101, Omega Bio-tek, Inc., USA) and 5 μg/ml RNase A (Cat#: R4875, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Cell lysis was facilitated by sonication with a 50-min program of repeating 1-s-on and 3-s-off using ultrasonic cell crusher (Scientz-IID, SCIENTZ, China). We then collected supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 12 000 rpm. We continued to incubate the supernatant with Ni-NTA agarose beads (Cat#: 17526801, GE Healthcare, USA) for 1 h at 4°C. The following washing step used the lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mM imidazole. To remove the trx tag in TRF1, we used 3C protease (Cat#: 88946, ThermoFisher, USA).
