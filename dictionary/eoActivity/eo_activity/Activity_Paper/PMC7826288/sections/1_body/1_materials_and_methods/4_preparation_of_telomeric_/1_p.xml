<p>Our hairpin constructs consist of general parts for mechanical manipulation and unique telomeric sequences. The stem contains either 23 (long) or 13 (short) repeats of TTAGGG. The general parts are two handles, a junction, and a loop. To prepare handles for mechanical manipulation, we ran PCR to prepare DNA fragments of ∼676 bp using a template of pBluescript II SK(+) (Cat#: 212205, Agilent, USA) and a dNTP mixture supplemented with biotin-16-dUTP or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Cat#: 11093070910 or 11093088910, Roche, Switzerland) (Forward and reverse primers for handles in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). We mixed dTTP with either biotin or digoxigenin modified dUTP at a molar ratio of 10:1. We used restriction sites of BbvCI or PpuMI for ligation between two handles and a hairpin junction. The assembly of the hairpin junction used four DNA oligos (Junction oligos in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>), which were annealed at equimolar ratios in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0) with a temperature program of heating to 95°C for 3 min, then reducing 0.1°C per step (700 steps in total) and finally cooling down to the room temperature of 25°C. We ligated the handles and the hairpin junction with a molar ratio of 5:1:5 (biotin:junction:digoxigenin) at 16°C for 12 h.
