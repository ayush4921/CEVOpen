<p>The core subunits of shelterin have two distinct Myb-related telomeric DNA binding proteins, TRF1 and TRF2 (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Telomeric organization by TRF1 and TRF2 is modulated by nucleosomes (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The N-terminal domains of TRF1/2 can regulate their capability of condensing telomeric DNA (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). TRF1 bends telomeric DNA as a dimer (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Self-dimerization of TRF1/2 mediated by a TRFH domain is also essential for compacting telomeres (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Although lacking structural information of full-length protein at atom resolution, evidence from electron microscopy showed that TRF1 adapts a molecular conformation, assisting the DNA binding activity with its TRFH domain accessible to other TRF1 partners (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). More interestingly, TRF1 plays an architectural role at telomeres by recognizing binding sites spaced far apart on DNA independently from orientation or binding sites on two different DNA molecules with extreme spatial flexibility (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).
