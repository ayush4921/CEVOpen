<p>Telomeres protect the termini of human chromosomes (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Telomere attrition causes maladaptive cellular changes, limiting tissue renewal capacity and leading to aging or human diseases (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The short telomeres, but not the ones in averaged length, determine cell viability and chromosome stability (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Telomeres are under tight regulation by telomerase, as well as protected by shelterin proteins (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Shelterin subunits organize telomeres into globular structures through complex interactions with telomeric DNA (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Removal of shelterin triggers chromosome end-protection issues, DNA damages, and fusion of telomeres (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8â€“12</xref>).
