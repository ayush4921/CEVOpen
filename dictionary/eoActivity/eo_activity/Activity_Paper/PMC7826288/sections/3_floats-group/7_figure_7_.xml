  <p>Reversed steps in strand-separation assays at the presence of TRF1. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Reversed steps upon strand separation. Reverse steps occasionally happen at 
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>test</sub> = 17 pN with [TRF1] = 25 nM (magenta). The dotted frame is zoomed in to show reverse steps in detail (inset). (

   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>test</sub> = 15.8 pN with [TRF1] = 10 nM (blue). The dotted frame is zoomed in to show hopping steps in detail (inset). When finishing a strand-separation assay, changes in extension pauses at the transition from

   <sub>test</sub> to 
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>low</sub> (green), which is not observed in (A). (

   <sub>test</sub>. At the concentration of [TRF1] = 10 nM, small changes in 
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>test</sub> (15.7, 15.8 and 16 pN) modulate the equilibrium of hopping events to distinct distributions of backward and forward states. Buffer and temperature conditions are the same as those in Figure 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>. Sampling rate = 100 Hz in (A), 200 Hz in (B) and (C).
