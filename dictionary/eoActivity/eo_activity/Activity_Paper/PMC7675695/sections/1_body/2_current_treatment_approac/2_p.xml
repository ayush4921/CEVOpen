<p>The era of antiviral drug development was begun after the approval of idoxuridine in June 1963, which was the first anti‐herpes antiviral drug that inhibits viral DNA synthesis (De Clercq,

 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). On the other hand, increasing antiviral drug resistance (ADR) like in herpesviruses and HBV is a pressing concern, and ADR could be managed by understanding the mechanism of resistance pattern, formulation of new drugs, optimization of compound delivery, and host components (Manuscript &amp; Implications, ). High costs and adverse side effects of synthetic drugs, along with the emergence of ADR has demanded the safe and novel antiviral drugs. Herbal extracts have become an exceptional alternative for the formulation of antiviral drugs that can inhibit multiple steps of the virus replication cycle. Furthermore, plant‐based antiviral compounds have shown remarkable results even in multiple clinical trials; for instance, anthocyanins (Pour, Fakhri, Asgary, Farzaei, &amp; Echeverría,
