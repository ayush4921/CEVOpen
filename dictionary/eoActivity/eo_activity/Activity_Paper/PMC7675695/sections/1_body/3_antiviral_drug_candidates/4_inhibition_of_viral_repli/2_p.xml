<p>Coronavirus genome encodes a protein called RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which allows the viral genome to be transcribed into new RNA copies using the host cell's machinery. Thus, inhibition of RdRP could be a potential target for the control of viral infection. Epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate (

 <xref rid="ptr6893-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) inhibit virus replication (Kitazato, Wang, &amp; Kobayashi, 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Many other nucleoside analogs, including DNA synthesis inhibitors such as tenofovir, disoproxil, lamivudine, and similar other antiviral agents, have the potential to inhibit the SARS‐CoV‐2 multiplication. They are being evaluated through molecular docking studies and testing in laboratory culture infected cells (Khaerunnisa et al.,
