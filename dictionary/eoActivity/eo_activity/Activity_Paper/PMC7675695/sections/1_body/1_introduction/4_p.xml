<p>Till now, there are no absolute therapies for COVID‐19, but preventive and supportive therapies are employed to control further complications and organ damage (Rodríguez‐Morales, MacGregor, Kanagarajah, Patel, &amp; Schlagenhauf, 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Based on the information available key regions of new drug targets are RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of the virus, cell membrane receptors of SARS‐CoV‐2 (ACE‐2), and spike proteins (S protein), the antiviral mechanism of plant extracts varies as per the structure and replication process of the viruses. Some plants help to increase the inherent antiviral immunity of our body (Webster, Taschereau, Lee, &amp; Jurgens, 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Some of the studies have already proven that plant extracts can be used for the preparation of peptides/proteins with the medicinal value, which can be a good source of vaccines and protein/peptides‐based treatment. However, screening of new therapeutic products will take an extended period, and medicinal plants could be an alternative, which is already tested by various ethnic groups since the ancient period. It is believed that medicinal plants are the primary source of healthcare for nearly 85% of the global population (Pešić, 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), and more than 40% of synthetic drugs available in pharmaceutical markets are derived from plants and microbial‐based natural products (Bauer &amp; Brönstrup, 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). In order to find the potent antiviral drug of the COVID‐19, research should be directed to emulsion‐based uHTS as well for the screening of hundreds of natural products. Thus, this review is focused on summarizing medicinal plants and/or herbs showing antiviral properties, which could be useful in drug discovery programs.
