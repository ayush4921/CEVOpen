In the context of the global burden of COVID‐19, where an absolute medicine is waiting for patients, promptly available plant‐based medicines with studied safety and efficacy can be on the frontline to tackle the ongoing calamity caused by COVID‐19. The problems encountered while using bioactive secondary metabolites like their solubility, stability, and bioavailability need to be addressed to use these metabolites as medicine (Coimbra et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6893-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Moreover, the application of artificial intelligence tools like molecular docking studies, toxicity analysis, and pharmacological studies would further add significant information regarding potency of the aforementioned secondary metabolites. However, the mutation occurring in targets should be taken into account. Extensive studies and investments are demanding for new drug development strategies using herbal extracts to save sapiens lives on our planet from pandemics like COVID‐19, today, and tomorrow.
