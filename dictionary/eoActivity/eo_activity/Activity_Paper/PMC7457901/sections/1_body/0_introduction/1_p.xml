<p id="Par2">Dengue is a very notorious mosquito-borne viral infection, belongs to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, which contains at least seventy-two viruses including; Zika, Yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. Dengue is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. There are four serotypes of dengue virus circulating in various parts of the World. Dengue is very dangerous since its origin but its prevalence has increased significantly within the last two decades. Although there is no specific surveillance, World Health Organization (WHO) suggested that more than 100 countries from Asia, Africa and some parts of Europe, South and North America are affected by dengue virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The number of dengue cases reported to WHO increased by ~ 6 times from &lt; 0.5 million in 2010 to over 3.34 million in 2016, following a sharp increase in 2019 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At present, there is no effective treatment for dengue. Medicinal plants area source for the treatment of common to life-threatening diseases since civilization. Herbal medicine can be alone used for treatment or increase the therapeutics potential when used along with conventional antiviral medicines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Many herbs are being routinely used against DENV infection as an alternative approach to reduce disease symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The discovery of natural drugs will be more universal, modified, and involves sensible use of modern and ancient skills of therapeutics in a corresponding way so that the patient and community get the maximum benefits [

 <italic>Cyamopsis tetragonoloba</italic> (L.) Taub (guar), which is commonly known as cluster bean belongs to the family 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic>. It is a small (2-4 feet), drought-resistant legume plant cultivated in semi-arid regions of India and Pakistan. The plant seeds are rich sources of their nutritive values viz vitamins, amino acids, flavonoids and phenolic compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> used as an herbal medicine for dyspepsia, anorexia, digestive aid, cure inflammation, sprains, arthritis, anti-secretory, and anti-oxidant and antibacterial [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Guar gum is an herbal medicine that is used for treating cancer and diabetes which is also used as a dietary supplement. It has properties as anti-microbial, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory. The leaves of gaur used in asthma, and to treat night blindness, constipation, cough, and Vata [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Several secondary compounds were present in gaur seeds and works have been carried out [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The present study aims to analyse the in vitro and in silico anti-dengue potential of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> supercritical extract (SFE) in animal cell culture model and to analyse the secondary compound in the extract by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS).
