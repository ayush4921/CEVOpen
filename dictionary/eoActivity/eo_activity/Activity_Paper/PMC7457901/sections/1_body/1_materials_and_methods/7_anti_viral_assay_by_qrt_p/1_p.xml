<p id="Par9">TaqMan probe chemistry-based Real-time RT-PCR was performed to determine the potential of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> on DENV-2. The commercially available Geno-Sen’s Dengue S1-S4 PCR kit was used to perform the antiviral assay on ABI 7500 real-time PCR instruments. The commercially kit contains a specific master mix for specific amplification and quantification of dengue viruses. All the PCR reagents were thawed. The master mix was prepared following the kit manufacturer’s instructions. After that, PCR tubes were prepared by adding 10 µl master mix and 15 µl of extracted RNA from each lysate from cell/negative control, virus/positive control, experimental/dengue-2 virus treated by MNTD of 
 <italic>C. tetragonoloba</italic> extracts, and standards (Dengue S 1-5). Then, all the reagents were mixed properly by pipetting up and down in the PCR tubes. Then the amplification tubes were closed and transferred into the ABI 7500 real-time thermocycler. The reaction conditions of PCR were as follows: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 15 min, denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, as followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and a final extension step at 72 °C for 15 s. The fluorescence emission data were collected during the annealing step.
