<p id="Par3">An in vitro study was done in C6/36 cell with the help of minimum essential medium (MEM, Batch No. 0000319279), streptomycin sulphate (100 μg/ml, Hi-Media, Batch No. 0000187551), Penicillin (100 U/ml, Sigma-Aldrich Batch No. BCBN 3112V), Trypsin (Hi-Media Batch No. 0000285329) and Fetal Calf Serum (FCS, Gibco NV, USA, Batch No. 1584260). Cell viability/cytotoxicity was performed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Hi-Media, Batch No. 0000263610). Analysis of anti-dengue assay was done using the commercially Geno-Sen’s Dengue S1-S4 PCR kit that contains a buffer, virus standard, enzymes, dNTPs, dengue specific primer, and probes.</p>
