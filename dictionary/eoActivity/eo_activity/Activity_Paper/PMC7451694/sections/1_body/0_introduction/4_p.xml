<p id="p0015">The variations in the antimicrobial potencies among the different honeys reported to be more than 100-folds, which is attributed to their botanical and geographical origins (
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">Molan and Cooper, 2000</xref>). Such variations in the properties of honeys could be responsible for the broadly varying capabilities of honeys to serve as antioxidants (

 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Mullai &amp; Menon 2007</xref>). The antimicrobial property of honey is mainly attributed to osmolality (sugar), pH, hydrogen peroxide levels and the methylglyoxal (

 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Suarez et al., 2010a</xref>). Moreover, the honey’s non-peroxide aspects such as: lysozyme, some phytochemicals, phenolic acids and flavonoids are reported to play important role in its antimicrobial properties (
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Al et al., 2009</xref>). Particularly, the presence of phenolic compounds in honey, their anti-oxidant properties and their positive health role have been well documented (

 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Nicholls and Miraglio, 2003</xref>). Moreover, the presence of differences in the amount of phenolic compounds based on its botanical and geographical origins have been also reported (
