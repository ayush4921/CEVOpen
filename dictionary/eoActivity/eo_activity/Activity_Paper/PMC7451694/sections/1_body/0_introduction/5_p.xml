<p id="p0020">Honeys composition is variable as they vary not only in their physico-chemical properties but also in their biological activities (

Moreover, the quality of honey is also utmost importance in determining the antimicrobial potential of honey because honey that has been mishandled (overheated or adulterated) may loss its medicinal properties. In addition, some of the physical properties (acidity, phenolic content and antioxidant level) of honey have direct relationships with its antimicrobial properties which are important to assess and correlate the physical properties and medicinal values of honeys.
