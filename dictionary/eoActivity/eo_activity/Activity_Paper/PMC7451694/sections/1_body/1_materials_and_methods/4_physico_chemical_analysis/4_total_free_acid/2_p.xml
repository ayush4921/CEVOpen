<p id="p0055">The total free acid in the honeys was determined based on the following protocols: 10 g of honey sample was dissolved in 75 ml of carbon dioxide-free water in a 250 ml beaker. The solution was stirred with the magnetic stirrer. The honey solution was titrated with 0.1 M NaOH to pH 8.30, using Hanna® pH measuring device. The result was expressed as free acidity, (Milliequivalents of acid/kg honey = ml of 0.1 M NaOH × 10).</p>
