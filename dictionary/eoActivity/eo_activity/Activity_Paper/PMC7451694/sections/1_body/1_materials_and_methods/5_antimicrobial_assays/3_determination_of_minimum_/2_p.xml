 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Suarez et al. (2010b)</xref> protocols with some modifications. A dilution series with honey concentrations that ranges from 5 to 50% v/v with an increment of 5% were added aseptically into sterile test tubes. The required honey concentration with nutrient broth solutions were mixed by stirring with small vortexing. Specimen of each microorganism was taken from pure culture grown in 10 ml nutrient broth. These specimens were cultured in broth containing different concentrations of individual honey by using a standard loop (10 μl). Control plates of nutrient without honey were included in each susceptibility assay to check the viability and density of the bacterial cells.
