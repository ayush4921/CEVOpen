 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Alvarez-Suarez et al., 2010b</xref> protocols. For each sample 5 g of liquid honey was dissolved in 50 ml of distilled water and the solution was filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper (0.5 ml). Then the honey solution was added to 2.5 ml of 0.2 N Folin-Ciocalteau reagent and mixed for 5 min then 2 ml 0.7 M Sodium carbonate (Na
 <sup>2</sup>CO
 <sup>3</sup>) was added. The solution was incubated in dark at 25 °C for 2 h. The absorbance of the reaction mixture was determined at 760 nm using Agilent Cary 60 UV–Vis (© Agilent Technologies, Inc). The calibration curve was determined using standard Gallic acid following
