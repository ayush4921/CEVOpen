<p id="p0120">The average total antioxidant capacities of the honey samples as Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) were varying 225.4 ± 12.8–465.7 ± 21.8 FRAP (μM Fe(II)/100 g with a mean of 320.3 ± 15.1 μM Fe(II)/100 g (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Relatively lower FRAP values of 225.4 ± 12.8 &amp; 237.1 ± 11.7 μM Fe(II)/100 g recorded for 
 <italic>Guizotia scabra</italic> and multi-floral honeys while relatively higher FRAP values of 421.5 ± 23.4 and 465.7 ± 21.8 μM Fe(II)/100 g recorded for 
 <italic>C. macrostachyus</italic> and 
 <italic>V. amygalina</italic> honeys respectively. Generally, all the honey samples have possessed strong antioxidant properties and the values were closer or within the values reported by

 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Bundit et al., 2016</xref> for Cuban and Thai honeys respectively. The antioxidant capacities of the 
 <italic>V. amygalina</italic> and 
 <italic>C. macrostachyus</italic> honeys were within the ranges of the antioxidant values reported for Manuka honey (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Bundit et al., 2016</xref>). The differences in antioxidant properties of the honey samples could be due to the variations in phytochemicals of the respective plants and their geographical origins. The presence of variations in antioxidant properties of different honeys as a result of their floral sources, seasonal and environmental factors are well reported (
