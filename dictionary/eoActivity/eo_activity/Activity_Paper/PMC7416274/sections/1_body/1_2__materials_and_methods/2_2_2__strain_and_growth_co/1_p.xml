 <sup>2</sup>6020 was grown in 7H9 and 7H11 Middlebrook media to which was added 10% ADC (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% glucose, and 0.85% NaCl), L-lysine (40

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). The 7H9 medium additionally contained Tween-80 (0.5% v/v) and glycerol (0.2% v/v) [

 <sub>600mn</sub>) of 0.6 (approximately 3 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml) and then diluted in a 1 : 2,000 ratio for studies of growth inhibition. Cultures of
