<p>Although antibacterial activity has previously been described in 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Pro. heptaphyllum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Xylopia aromatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], we found that only some of the plant part extracts inhibited both 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth and the kinase activity. The flower extract of 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 30.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and an MIC of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, while the inner bark extract showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 144 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml but an MIC higher than 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Similarly, an extract of the inner bark of 
 <italic>Pro. heptaphyllum</italic> had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 37.4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and an MIC of 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, but the leaf extract had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 95.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and an MIC over 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The young leaf extract of 
 <italic>Xylopia aromatica</italic> inhibited both growth and kinase activity (MIC = 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 93.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), while the other extracts of this plant showed neither activity. Terpenoid compounds have been shown to possess high antituberculosis activity [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Phytochemical studies of the essential oils of 
 <italic>X. aromatica</italic> and 
 <italic>Prot. heptaphyllum</italic> leaves demonstrated the presence of various terpenes, including spathulenol [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This sesquiterpene has been shown to have antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
