<p>Previous research established the potential of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. sanvicentense</italic> against breast cancer MDA-MB-231, prostate cancer PC-3, and human colon cancer HT29 cell lines [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but this is the first report of its antibacterial activity. Of the 118 extracts we tested, the 
 <italic>P. sanvicentense</italic> extract had lowest MIC for inhibiting 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Although it did not show any ability to inhibit kinase activity, 
 <italic>P. sanvicentense</italic> could be a promising candidate for chemical analysis. This is also the first report of antibacterial activity in the species 
 <italic>Brom. goeldiana</italic>, 
 <italic>M. guianensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pol. aureum</italic>, whose fruit, leaf, and stem extracts, respectively, showed activity only against bacterial growth at an MIC of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml.
