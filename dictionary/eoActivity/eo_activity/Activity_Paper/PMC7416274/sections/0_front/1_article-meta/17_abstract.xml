 <p>Global control and elimination of tuberculosis are hindered by the high prevalence of drug-resistant strains, making the development of new drugs to fight tuberculosis a public health priority. In this study, we evaluated 118 extracts from 58 Venezuelan plant species for their ability to inhibit the growth of 
  <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> mc
  <sup>2</sup>6020, using the agar dilution method. Additionally, we determined the ability of these extracts to inhibit the activity of PknB protein, an essential 
  <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> serine/threonine kinase, using a high-throughput luminescent assay. Of the 118 extracts tested, 14 inhibited bacterial growth with a minimum inhibitory concentration ≤500 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 36 inhibited the kinase activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration &lt;200 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Five extracts inhibited 
  <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth and inhibited the activity of the kinase protein, suggesting that this could be the basis of their growth inhibition.
