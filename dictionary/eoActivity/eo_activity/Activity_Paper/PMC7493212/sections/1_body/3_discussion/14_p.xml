<p>In conclusion, the present results show that the crude extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> demonstrated antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities. The hepatoprotective activities of the plant extracts could be due to their free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities, resulting from the presence of some phytochemicals including polyphenols, flavonoids, saponins and alkaloids. Furthermore, the exact phytoconstituents and their mechanism of hepatoprotection should be studied. Additionally, these findings could justify the traditional use of the root bark of 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> in liver disorders; and suggest the possible utilization of the root bark of the plant as a source of new compounds for hepatoprotective activity.
