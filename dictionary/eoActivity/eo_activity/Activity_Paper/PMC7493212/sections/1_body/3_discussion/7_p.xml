<p>Suppression of the elevated serum levels of ALT and AST by the crude extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> is an indication of stabilization of plasma membrane as well as repair of hepatic tissue damages caused by paracetamol. This is consistent with what has been found in previous studies done by Gutiérrez and Solís (2009).

The negative effect of paracetamol on total protein was reversed with the administration of the crude extract and aqueous fraction which indicates an improvement of the functional status of the liver cells to synthesize proteins. These findings corroborate the ideas of Okokon et al (2017); Shrivastava et al (2017).
