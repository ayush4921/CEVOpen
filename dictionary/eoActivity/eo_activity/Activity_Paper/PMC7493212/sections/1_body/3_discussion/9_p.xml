<p>Other liver protective activities of the plant extracts could be; (1) inhibition of metabolism of paracetamol; because, metabolism of paracetamol with cytochrome P450 enzymes specifically, CYP2E1, is implicated in the hepatotoxicity of paracetamol by producing toxic metabolite, NAPQI. As a result, inhibition of this enzyme by the plant extracts could possibly reduce the toxic effects of paracetamol;

Excess NAPQI alkylates and oxidizes intracellular glutathione resulting in liver glutathione depletion subsequently leads to increased lipid peroxidation and liver damage.
