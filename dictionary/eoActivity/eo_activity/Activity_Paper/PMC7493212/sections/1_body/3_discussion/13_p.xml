<p>Histopathologic findings revealed protective activities of the crude extract and solvent fractions against paracetamol-induced liver damage which is in good agreement with the results of the biochemical activities of the plant extracts and Silymarin. The section of the paracetamol intoxicated liver tissue demonstrates hepatic necrosis, condensed blood vessels and aggregation of inflammatory cells. This may be a result of the formation of free radicals and oxidative stress induced by paracetamol. These pathological changes were lesser in the mice administered with the different doses of the plant extracts and Silymarin followed by simultaneous administration of paracetamol. This indicates that treatment of the mice with the plant extracts and Silymarin may prevent paracetamol-induced liver damage.</p>
