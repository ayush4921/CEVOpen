<p>Acute oral toxicity of the crude extract was carried out according to the organization of economic co-operation development (OECD)-425 guideline at a limit test dose of 2000 mg/kg.
 <xref rid="cit0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The test was conducted in adult nulliparous and non-pregnant female mice. The mice were randomly selected and acclimatized for 5 days prior to dose administration. The mice were fasted for food, but not water 3 hours prior to dosing and 1 hour after the administration of the extract. The dose was calculated using body weight of the mice just after fasting. A single dose of the extract was administered orally by oral gavage. Mice were observed individually for gross behavioral changes (locomotion, activity, hair texture, pupil size, and feeding) at least once during the first 30 minutes of dosing, periodically with special attention given during the first 4 hours of the 24 hours, and thereafter daily, for a total of 14 days.
