<p>The free radical scavenging activity of the crude extract and solvent fractions of root bark extracts of 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> was determined in vitro by 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay according to the standard method described by Braca et al, (2001).
 <xref rid="cit0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Initially, 3 mL of 0.004% DPPH in methanol was mixed with 1 mL of various concentrations (200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5 Âµg/mL) of the crude extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic> separately. Mixtures were incubated for 30 minutes incubation at room temperature in a dark place. The absorbances of the mixtures in the samples were measured using a spectrophotometer at 517 nm against methanol as blank. The percentage of radical scavenging activities of the samples were evaluated compared with a control (3 mL DPPH solution and 1 mL methanol). Each sample was measured in triplicate and the average was calculated. The percentage of radical scavenging activity (RSA) was calculated using the following formula:
