<p>In a rat model with diabetes induced by streptozotocin, 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> treatment decreased glucose levels, restored insulin levels to nearly normal, and pancreatic tissue damage was ameliorated [

 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] is not surprising. Although the in vivo study by Lee et al. focused on the impact of 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> extracts on diabetes, the benefits could be extrapolated to the treatment of cancers. This hyperglycaemic effect, in the context of cancers, should be investigated further.
