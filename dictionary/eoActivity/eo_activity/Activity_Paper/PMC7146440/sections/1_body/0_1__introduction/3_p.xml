 <italic>Fomitopsis pinicola</italic>, like many other fungi, are predominantly identified phenotypically, but require molecular biology techniques to confirm the identification. Internal spacer region (ITS)2 sequencing is a suitable method that is routinely used for the correct identification of numerous species, including 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic>. Unfortunately, it can appear phenotypically similar to 
 <italic>Ganoderma lingzhi</italic> and other species of the genus 
 <italic>Fomitopsis</italic>, and therefore it is important to confirm the speciation of the specimen one is working with prior to publication.
