<p>The fruiting body is fan shaped, has a hard, woody texture, can grow up to 40 cm in diameter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-12-00609-f001">Figure 1</xref>), and is often referred to as the red belt conk. The fruiting body has a glossy appearance and can be red-brown or a lighter colour depending on the age of the specimen. It grows by adding an additional layer or tube annually. The fungus is saprobic and can also be parasitic, causing heart rot in living trees, and brown cuboidal rot in dead trees [
 <xref rid="B2-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Decay fungi such as 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> are often thought to be symbiotic and this could be due to the presence of fungi and nitrogen fixing bacteria at the same sites on fir trees [
 <xref rid="B5-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, they help circulate forest nutrients through the decay of dead tree trunks, although the brown rot residues can remain in the soil for extended periods before breaking down [
 <xref rid="B6-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> and other brown rot species can also contribute significantly to forestry loses, particularly at sites where the bark has been damaged as might occur when branches are removed.
