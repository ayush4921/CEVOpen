<p>In conclusion, further research is required to characterise the anti-cancer activities of 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> as there is a paucity of data, particularly from in vivo and clinical studies. It would be useful to identify the bioactive components of 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> and build on the research performed by Wang et al. and Gao et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In particular, care must be taken to correctly identify each specimen using molecular techniques, prior to experimentation. Like many food components, 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> has the potential to reduce the risk of disease. The advantage of investigating the anti-cancer benefits of 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> is that the mushroom is not toxic as shown by anecdotal evidence over centuries, as well as in vivo studies. In addition, it is widely available and is affordable.
