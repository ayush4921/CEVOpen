<p>Fresh tender leaves of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> were collected from the Xishuangbanna Tropical Flowers and Plants Garden (100.70421 E, 22.015894 N) and the genomic DNA was isolated using the Dneasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). The purified DNA was stored in the ultra-low temperature specimen library at YITC (specimen accession number: YITC-2020-FZ-A-003). The sequencing library was constructed and DNA sequencing was carried out by the Illumina Hiseq 2500 Platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Chloroplast genome assembly and annotation was carried out by CLC Genomics Workbench v3.6 (

 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The assembly and annotation results of the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> were uploaded to the GenBank (
