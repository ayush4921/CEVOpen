<p id="p0060">For the excision model, 8 groups of mice; six animals per group were used. Animals in group 1 &amp; 2 were treated with Nitrofurazone (0.2 %) and simple ointment to serve as a positive &amp; a negative control respectively. Animals from group 3 to 8 were treated with different doses (5% and 10% w/w) of the hydroalcoholic ointments prepared from experimental plant extracts. For the incision model, 9 groups of mice; having six mice per group were used. Here the 9
 <sup>th</sup> group was added as compared to the excision model because, in the incision model, one more group which was left untreated was required to compare the tensile strength due to simple ointment. The animals under group 1 to 8 were treated similar to excision model, and the 9
 <sup>th</sup> group was left untreated and served as untreated controls.
