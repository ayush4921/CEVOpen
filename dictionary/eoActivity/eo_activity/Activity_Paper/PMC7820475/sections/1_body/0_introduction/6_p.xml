<p id="p0030">Wound is formed due to physical, chemical, thermal, microbial, or immunological factors [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and its healing process might be complex, dynamic, and normal biological process [

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] which entails efficient management skills [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Wound healing process occurs in a persistent &amp; integrated manner [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and this process involves four temporarily and spatially overlapping phases named as hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These phases should be well controlled in order for proper wound healing process [

 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] where the trends in the use of these resources is on the increase in many countries [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to meet their primary health care needs [
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In Ethiopia, the use of traditional medicinal preparation is common [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] due to cultural acceptability, low cost, and inadequate access to modern health facilities [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, different types of medicinal plants [

 <italic>Dodonaea angustifolia</italic> are highly claimed even though their in vivo wound healing activity is not reported: a driving force to conduct this study using both incision and excision wound models.
