<p>In an animal study using Swiss albino mice with streptozotocin induced dementia, 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> tubers were reported as having the potential to preserve memory while serving as a preserving, curing and restorative agent [

The authors further highlighted the possible delay of onset of neurodegenerative diseases as well as mitigation with the ingestion of dietary polyphenols that confer protection to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration. Also, the neuroprotective effect of 
 <italic>D. pseudojaponica Yamamoto</italic> using senescent mice induced by D-galactose indicated the useful potential of yam for treatment of cognitive impairment, a process partly mediated via enhancing endogenous antioxidant enzymatic activities [

The steroidal saponin—diosgenin—one of the major bioactive compounds in yam, was found to aid the restoration of axonal atrophy and synaptic degeneration, thus improving memory dysfunction in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease [

Diosgenin administration prior to surgery in rat test models reduced significantly the death rate while improving impaired neurological functions, thus establishing the potential cerebral protection of diosgenin against transient focal cerebral ischemia- reperfusion (I/R) injury [

In an in vivo study using mice, the same group of authors reported that diosgenin enhanced neuronal excitation and memory function in normal mice, which is mediated by 1,25D3-MARRS (membrane associated, rapid response steroid-binding) triggered axonal growth [
 <xref rid="B308-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">308</xref>]. This seems to support a school of thought that sees diosgenin as a new category of cognitive enhancers with potential of reinforcing neuronal networks and thus, formed the basis for the use of humans as test models. Tohda et al. [
 <xref rid="B309-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>] conducted a Japanese version of the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) test on 28 healthy volunteers (between the ages 20 and 81 years) under diosgenin-rich yam extract administration with findings confirming a significant improvement in cognitive function. However, the limitation of this study remains the sample size, non-randomized selection of volunteers (sampled adults were only well-educated Asians) and daily dietary intake and physical activity levels of the individuals were not accessed.
