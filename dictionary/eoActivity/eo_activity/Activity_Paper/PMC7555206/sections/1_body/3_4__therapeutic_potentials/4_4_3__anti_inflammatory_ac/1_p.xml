<p>Several animal studies have reported the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species. Olayemi and Ajaiyeoba [
 <xref rid="B271-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>] investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of defatted methanol extract of 
 <italic>D. esculenta</italic> tuber on Wistar rats. Their finding showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of the carrageenan at doses of 100 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg which was comparable to that of 150 mg/kg acetylsalicylic acid (reference standard). Chiu et al. [
 <xref rid="B130-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>] confirmed that 
 <italic>D. japonica</italic> ethanol extract elicited an in vivo anti-inflammatory effect on mouse paw oedema induced by λ-carrageenan. Pre-treatment using dried yam (
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> spp.) powder on Sprague-Dawley rats before inducement of duodenal ulcer by intragastric administration of cysteamine-HCl (500 mg/kg) revealed that dried yam powder exerted a significant protective effect by reducing the incidence of perforation caused by cysteamine and preventing duodenal ulcer, which was comparable to the pantoprazole effect [
 <xref rid="B272-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>]. The observed effect of yam powder was attributed to its potential to lower inflammatory cytokines as well as scavenging free radicals and up-regulating activity of carbonic anhydrase. The hydro-methanol extract of 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> tubers which contain different bioactive phytocompound has also shown to significantly down-regulate the pro-inflammatory signals in a gradual manner compared to a reference control (µg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B203-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. Mollica et al. [
 <xref rid="B273-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>] reported the anti-inflammatory activity of extract from 
 <italic>D. trifida</italic> on food allergy induced by ovalbumin in mice. In addition extracts from leaf, rhizome and bulbil have exhibited anti-inflammatory activity.
