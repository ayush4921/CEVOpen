<p>Synthetic medications and chemotherapy for cancer management comes with a multitude of side effects that are often intolerable for most cancer patients; thus, naturally occurring bioactive compounds in plants are increasingly becoming better alternatives.In vitrocytotoxicity screening provides insights and preliminary data that help select plant extracts with potential anticancer properties for future work andin vivoreplication. A study by Itharat et al. [
 <xref rid="B240-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>] showed that aqueous and ethanol extracts of rhizome of 
 <italic>D. membranacea</italic> and 
 <italic>D. birmanica</italic> were cytotoxic against three human cancer cell lines while remaining non cytotoxic to normal cells. The use of active compounds naphthofuranoxepins (dioscorealide A and B) and dihydrophenanthrene from 
 <italic>D. membranacea</italic> (locally known as Hua-Khao-yen) rhizome in Thai medicine is highly potent and has exhibited cytotoxic activity against five types of human cancer cells [

 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic> (air potato) in dose-dependent manner, with no significant toxicity in vivo at dosage between 2 and 16 mg/kg [
