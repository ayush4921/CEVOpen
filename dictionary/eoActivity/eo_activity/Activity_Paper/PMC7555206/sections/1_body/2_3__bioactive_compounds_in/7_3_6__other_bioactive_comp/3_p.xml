<p>Furthermore, hydrogen cyanide which is formed as a result of hydrolysis of glycosides by enzymes in plants and is a neurotoxin found in cassava (
 <italic>Manihot esculenta</italic>), has been reported in yam though at lower concentrations. Shajeela et al. [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported hydrogen cyanide ranging from 0.16 to 0.34 mg per 100 g in nine 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species with the highest level recorded in 
 <italic>D. tomentosa</italic> and 
 <italic>D. oppositifolia</italic> var 
 <italic>oppositifolia.</italic> Using spectrophotometry methods, cyanide was also reported in

 <italic>D. hispida</italic> Dennst sampled from Sleman, Yogyakarta [
