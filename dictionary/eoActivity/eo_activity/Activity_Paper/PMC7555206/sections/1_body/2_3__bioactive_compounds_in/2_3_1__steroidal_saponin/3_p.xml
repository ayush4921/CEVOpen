<p>The underlying mechanism of action of diosgenin may vary depending on the disease and has been reviewed by Cai et al. [
 <xref rid="B139-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B143-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>] and Raju and Rao [
 <xref rid="B138-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Although diosgenin has been reported in several yam species, its content varies considerably within the 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> genus with 
 <italic>D. barbasco</italic> (Mexican wild yam) and 
 <italic>D. zingiberensis</italic> (Chinese yam) being very important sources for diosgenin [
 <xref rid="B146-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Perhaps this explains the reason why China and Mexico account for more than half (about 67%) of world diosgenin production [
 <xref rid="B148-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>] and the utilization of this compound takes preeminence in these countries. The presence of diosgenin has also been recorded in 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B144-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Contreras-Pacheco et al. [
 <xref rid="B149-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>] use gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to quantify and characterize diosgenin in sixty accessions of two 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species (
 <italic>D. sparsiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>D. remotiflora</italic>) collected from the city of Jalisco, Mexico. Their findings showed diosgenin at a range between 0.02 and 0.16 mg/kg in dry basis. In the same vein, Yi et al. [
 <xref rid="B146-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] recorded a range of 0.78 mg/g to 19.52 mg/g in three 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species including 
 <italic>D. zingiberensis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. septemloba</italic> and 
 <italic>D. colletti</italic>; however, diosgenin was not detected in 
 <italic>D. polystachya</italic>. Huai et al. [
 <xref rid="B150-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>] revealed that the intra-species diversity with respect to significant differences in the amount of disogenin in different yam varieties may be attributed to climatic factors and environmental conditions such as growing and storage conditions.
