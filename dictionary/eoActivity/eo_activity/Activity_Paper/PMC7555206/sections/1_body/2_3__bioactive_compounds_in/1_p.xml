<p>In addition to the nutritional constituents of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species, few studies have explored the pharmaceutical potentials of different species of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic>. They contain substantial amounts of secondary metabolites referred to as bioactive compounds. Bioactive compounds are produced within the plants besides the primary biosynthetic and metabolic routes associated with plant growth and development. These compounds are not needed for their daily functioning but may provide various functions such as protection, attraction or signaling to the plant [
 <xref rid="B119-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Bioactive compounds can be described as phytochemicals found in plants/food that have the capacity to influence the cellular or physiological activities in humans as well as in animals. They modulate metabolic processes by exhibiting numerous beneficial health effects such as anti-oxidative, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities, inhibition of receptor activities, inhibition or induction of enzymes and induction and inhibition of gene expression, thus resulting in the promotion of better health [

However, it is worth noting that bioactive compounds can also have antinutritional properties, thus eliciting toxicological effects in humans and animals. A wide list of bioactive compounds such as phenolics, flavonoids, allantoin, dioscin, dioscorin, diosgenin, polyphenols, tannins, hydrogen cyanide, oxalate, saponin and alkaloids have been reported in yam by several studies as listed in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01304-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Their content in yam varies within and between species as reported by Wu et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These authors reported a varied range of 0.032%–0.092% dry weight and 0.62%–1.49% dry weight of dioscin and allantoin detected in 25 yam landraces from four species (
 <italic>D. alata</italic>, 
 <italic>D. polystachya</italic>, 
 <italic>D. persimilis</italic> and 
 <italic>D. fordii</italic>), respectively. Inter- and intra-species diversity as it relates to bioactive compounds content has also been highlighted by Price et al. [
 <xref rid="B121-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), dioscin ranging between 0.086 and 0.945 µg/mLwas reported in yams of African origin including 
 <italic>D. cayenensis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. mangenotiana</italic> and 
 <italic>D. rotundata</italic>. In addition, dioscin has been reported in other parts of yam plant such as rhizomes and roots as reviewed by Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B122-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Hence, this section will elucidate the bioactive constituents of yams.
