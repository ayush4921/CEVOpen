<p>Yam is classified as an energy food source to consumers especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) because of its high starch content which amounts up to 80% in dry weight basis (

 <xref rid="B84-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Among the 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> spp., 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> has been reported to contain a relatively high starch content when compared to others, up to 84.3% [
 <xref rid="B54-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A study by Afoakwa et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>] evaluated the starch composition of seven of the cultivated yam species (
 <italic>D. cayenensis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. rotundata</italic>, 
 <italic>D. alata</italic>, 
 <italic>D. bulbifera</italic>, 
 <italic>D. esculenta</italic>, 
 <italic>D. praehensalis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. dumentorum</italic>) in SSA and reported a range between 63.2% and 65.7%. The variation in the starch content of 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> recorded by these authors may be dependent on several environmental factors and agronomic practices, as well as the degree of maturity. The degree of maturity of yam tuber has a great influence on the physicochemical quality of food [
 <xref rid="B86-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. In addition, van Eck [
 <xref rid="B87-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] highlighted the importance of maturity as it influences starch and tuber yield of potatoes when compared to other genetic variations. Similar values of starch have been recorded in other root and tuber crops including potatoes, cassava and cocoyam, as well as cereal grains. While studies have shown high starch content in yams, low (below 1%) starch content were reported in 
 <italic>D. delicata</italic> and 
 <italic>D. olfersiana</italic> (

 <xref rid="B37-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B88-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] reported a starch content ranging from 20% to 30% for Chinese yam. Yam starch granules consist of a mixture of branched (amylopectin) and un-branched (amylose) chain polymers of D-glucose usually occurring at a percentage ratio of 78:22 [
 <xref rid="B89-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]; nevertheless the values may vary depending on species as well as genotype. Using the iodo-colorimetric method, Otegbayo et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] reported a wide variability of amylose content between 15.1% and 27.0% of 43 genotypes in 5 species (
 <italic>D. alata</italic>, 
 <italic>D. rotundata</italic>, 
 <italic>D. cayenensis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. dumetorum</italic> and 
 <italic>D.bulbifera</italic>). Amylose content as high as 39.3 g amylase/100 g starch was reported in Thai yam (
 <italic>D. hispida</italic>) using a simplified amylose assay [
 <xref rid="B91-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], comparable to the value reported in Taiwanese 
 <italic>D. alata</italic> (39 g amylose/100 g starch) [
 <xref rid="B92-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. A much lower amylose content ranging from 1.4% to 8.7% of starch was recorded for six 
 <italic>D. trifida</italic> of the Venezuelan Amazon [
 <xref rid="B81-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. It is important to point out that the discrepancies observed by the latter authors, who reported a wide variability in amylose content of 1.4% to 8.7%, 1.4% to 3.6% and 2.2% to 5.9% was as a result of analytical methods including colorimetric (iodine binding with amylose), differential scanning calorimetry and amperometric, respectively. The ratio of amylose to amylopectin content of yam starches is very crucial as it affects the starch properties and functional characteristics such as crystallinity and digestibility. While high amylopectin content of starch granules results to low levels of retrogradation susceptibility and high peak viscosity, starch granules with high amylose content demonstrates high retrogradation and absorbs limited water content during cooking [
