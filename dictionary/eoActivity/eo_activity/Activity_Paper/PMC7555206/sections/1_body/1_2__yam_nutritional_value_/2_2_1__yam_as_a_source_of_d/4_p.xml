<p>Other minor components such as lipids have also been reported in yam. Although these components are present at a very small fraction [
 <xref rid="B103-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], they have a great impact on the functionality of starch [
 <xref rid="B84-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. A wide range of concentrations of lipid between 0.03% and 10.2% have been reported. The highest lipid level (10.2%) was recorded in

 <xref rid="B38-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is important to note that lipid content is highly influenced by the extraction solvent used, as this determines the lipid fraction (bound or unbound) extracted [

 <xref rid="B106-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Mondy and Mueller [
 <xref rid="B107-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] highlighted the possibility of tuber lipid being of limited nutritional importance; however, it enhances the cellular integrity of the cell membrane, proffers resistance to bruising and reduces enzymatic browning of the tuber.In addition, the ash content of yams is reported to range from 0.1% to 8.8% (

However, recent studies have shown that ash content measurement of yam starch can be influenced by inefficient starch purification methods, thus leading to higher values.
