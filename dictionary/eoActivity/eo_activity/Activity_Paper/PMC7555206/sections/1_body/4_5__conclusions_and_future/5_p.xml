<p>Scientific investigations into the clinical use of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> species with focus on reducing the risk of ovarian cancer, treatment of menopause complications and female ageing diseases needs to focus on characterizing the bioactive compounds and proteins isolated from diverse species. This includes amino acid sequencing, in vivo pharmacokinetic study as well as modulating mechanisms. This will help in the establishment of multi-target based anti-menopausal drug screening, towards developing more effective drug candidates for future use [

 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> as a therapeutic agent against asthma, urinary tract infections and bladder related complications, rheumatism, arthritis, pelvic cramps and so forth, need to be promoted. Most of the studies have been limited to in vitro and animal models. It is very important to have further insights into the effects of yam on degenerative diseases while putting into consideration the feasibility and long term effects on humans. Limited or no data on safety, toxicity and efficacy as use as contraceptives on human health, during pregnancy, lactation and childhood suggest an issue of concern. The paucity of data on the safety of diosgenin and other bioactive compounds suggests that further investigation should focus on development, toxicity, neurotoxicity and allergenicity. While preclinical and mechanistic findings tend to support the use of diosgenin as a novel, multitarget-based chemopreventive and therapeutic agent against different forms of cancer [
 <xref rid="B288-foods-09-01304" ref-type="bibr">288</xref>], research should also focus on developing and evaluating standards of evidence. On a commercial scale, the introduction of 
 <italic>Dioscorea</italic> extracts into the growing international market of natural herbs is highly encouraged. The Mexican experience [
