<p>Blood was collected from the tail of each mouse in heparinized micro-hematocrit capillary tubes. The capillary tubes were filled to 3/4th of their height with blood and sealed at one end with sealing clay. The tubes were then placed in a micro-hematocrit centrifuge, with the sealed end outwards and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 11,000 rpm. The tubes were taken out of the centrifuge and PCV was determined using a standard Micro-Hematocrit Reader. It was measured before inoculating the parasite (day 0) and day 4 in Peter’s 4-day suppressive test and D0 and D7 in the prophylactic activity test. In the case of Rane’s test, PCV was measured on the third day after the infection was established, and on the last day of treatment on the seventh day. PCV is a measure of the proportion of RBCs to plasma in the whole blood and determined using the relation shown below.
