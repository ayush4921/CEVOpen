<p>The leaves of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> were washed with distilled water to remove dirt and dried at room temperature (25–27°C). The plant material was coarsely grounded into powder by the electrical mill. Then, the coarse powder of the plant material was macerated with methanol for about 72 hours (three times) and filtered via Whatman filter paper. The filtrate of the plant material obtained from the successive maceration was concentrated via a rotary evaporator followed by a hot air oven (40°C). Finally, the dried extract of 
 <italic>Acanthus polystachyus</italic> was kept separately in a desiccator until used for the experiment. The extraction yield was calculated using the following formula:
