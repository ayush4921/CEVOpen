Similarly, chloroquine 25 mg/kg significantly (p&lt;0.0001) prevented weight loss as compared to the negative control. The higher (400mg/kg) dose of the crude extract showed a significant (p&lt;0.01) effect on preventing a drop in body temperature as compared to the negative control. However, a drop in body temperature was not significantly prevented at 100mg/kg and 200mg/kg doses of the crude extract as compared to the negative control (

The standard drug still had a significant effect on preventing a drop in body temperature compared to the negative control All doses of the crude extract (100 mg/kg, 200mg/kg, and 400mg/kg) showed a significant (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.0001 and p&lt;0.0001), respectively, effect on preventing the loss of packed cell volume when compared with the negative control group. Likewise, the standard drug showed a significant (p&lt;0.0001) prevention of packed cell volume reduction when compared to the negative control group (
