<p id="Par37">UHPLC–MS analysis of the methanol extract of leaves revealed the presence of flavonoids, phenolics, and terpenoid derivatives, with the most abundant compounds being a diosgenin derivative and polygalacin D, whereas kaempferol and robinin were abundantly present in the chloroform extract of leaves. The UHPLC–MS analysis of the stem extract revealed the presence of diverse components including alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and benzopyran derivatives as the major components. The presence of diverse phytochemicals is in agreement with a previous study that reported a number of secondary metabolites from this plant [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to establish a possible link between their phytocomponents and beneficial bioactivities. It is well known that the polyphenolics and flavonoids, as well as their glycosides, are responsible for antioxidant, anticancer, and cardioprotective activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The HPLC–PDA analysis results showed that the leaf and stem extracts contained diverse phenolic compounds, with epicatechin, rutin, and catechin as the most abundant. Plants contain different classes of phenols, including polyphenols, flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignins, which are involved in the protection against and cure of diseases such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and others [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For example, epicatechin and catechin have diverse biological properties, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and cardioprotective activity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Rutin was also observed in a significant amount in the leaves and stems of 
 <italic>M. buxifolia</italic>. Rutin has antioxidant properties, which enable protection from cellular damage caused by free radicals. It also helps to eliminate cholesterol from the body and maintain healthy collagen, and it has anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, amongst others [
