<p id="Par28">Previously reported standard in vitro methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] were followed to estimate the antioxidant properties of all the extracts, including their free-radical-scavenging property (DPPH and ABTS), reducing power potential (FRAP and CUPRAC), phosphomolybdenum-based total antioxidant capacity, and metal-chelating ability. The outcomes are presented as Trolox equivalents in all assays except for the metal-chelating assay where ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as a standard.
