 <italic>Monotheca buxifolia</italic> was collected in June 2016 from the Mohmand Agency Mountain, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The plant was identified by Dr. Rizwana Aleem Qureshi (Taxonomist Department of Plant Sciences, Quaid-e-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan), and a herbarium sample was deposited (voucher ID BIT-4220, Herbarium Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, Pakistan). The plant material was washed, dried under shade, and powdered using an electric grinder. The powdered material (leaves and stems) was separately macerated with analytical-grade methanol (1:3) and subjected to sonication for 30 min in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature [

The residue was again dipped in methanol, and this procedure was repeated thrice. The filtrates were combined and concentrated using a rotary evaporator (Rotovapor R 200 Buchi, Flawil Switzerland) at 40 °C. The residue was macerated in chloroform (1:3), and the same procedure was followed as stated above to obtain the chloroform extract. The extracts were stored at 4 °C until further use.
