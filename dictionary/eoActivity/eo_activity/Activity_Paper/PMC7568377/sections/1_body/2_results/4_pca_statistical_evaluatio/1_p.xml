<p id="Par35">To assess the similarity of the biological activities expressed by the extracts and to analyze the correlations between variables, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. The Pearson correlation, as depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a, suggests a firm positive correlation between total phenolic content (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.99–0.71) and antioxidant potential (except for metal chelation). However, the negative relationship between total phenolic content (
 <italic>r</italic> = − 0.94) and metal chelation may be due to the antagonistic or synergetic effect of phytochemicals or the presence of some nonphenolic chelators. Similarly, a strong positive relationship (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.95–0.8) was recorded between phenolic content and enzyme-inhibitory activity. In contrast, in the case of flavonoid content, a strong negative correlation was noted with both antioxidant potential (
 <italic>r</italic> = − 0.8 to − 0.79) and enzyme-inhibitory activity (
 <italic>r</italic> = − 0.99 to − 0.54), except for metal-chelation activity, with which flavonoid content was positively correlated (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.66). Overall, it was observed that the tyrosinase-inhibitory, FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS activities were the most contributory biological activities to the formation of the first principal component with 
 <italic>p-</italic>values of 0.007, 0.018, 0.019, and 0.025, respectively. The bioactive compounds and the biological activity showed an 82.5% eigenvalue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b), in accordance with the strong correlation between the various activities and the extract components determined through HPLC–PDA.
