<p id="Par34">The enzyme-inhibitory capabilities of 
 <italic>M. buxifolia</italic> extracts were assessed for five clinically important enzymes, which showed their significant potential (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). The methanol extracts of both parts of the plant and the chloroform extract of stems were most active against AChE (4.70, 4.66, and 4.62 mg GALAE/g, respectively), while, for BChE, the chloroform extract of stems was most potent (4.27 mg GALAE/g). The stem extracts showed significant tyrosinase- (140.16 and 137.93 mg KAE/g inhibition by methanol and chloroform extracts, respectively) and amylase-inhibitory activities; however, all four extracts presented equal inhibition of glucosidase activity.
