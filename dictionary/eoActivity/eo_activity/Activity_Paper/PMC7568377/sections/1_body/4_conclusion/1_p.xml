<p id="Par41">This study concludes that 
 <italic>Monotheca buxifolia</italic> contains a diverse range of phytochemicals with significant biological activities. The stem extract contained a high amount of phenolics, while flavonoids were most prominent in the leaf extract. The free-radical-scavenging activity, reducing power, and antioxidative potential show that the plant can be used as a nutraceutical to heal stress in the body. Furthermore, the significant enzyme-inhibitory activity, especially against AChE, BChE, and tyrosinase, shows that the plant is clinically important as a potential cure for diseases. The prominent amylase- and glycosidase-inhibitory activity of the extracts is in accordance with folk knowledge linking this plant with digestive and laxative properties. The UHPLC–MS analysis and HPLC–PDA quantification identified a number of bioactive secondary metabolites, including phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoid derivatives, which may be responsible for the plant’s significant antioxidant and enzyme-inhibitory potential. The observed activities of this plant could act as a starting point in the identification and isolation of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and enzyme-inhibitory potential.
