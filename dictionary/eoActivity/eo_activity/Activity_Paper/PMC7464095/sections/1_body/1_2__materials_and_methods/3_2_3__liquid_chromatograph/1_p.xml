<p>To determine chemical compositions in the extracts, we used an Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity liquid chromatography system (Santa Clara, CA, USA) hyphenated to a 6420 Triple Quad mass spectrometer on which a chromatographic separation on a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (100 mm × 4.6 mm I.D., 2.7 μm) column [
