<p>Analysis of phenolic components, and biological potential using antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory assays of 
 <italic>A. macrocephalus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>finitimus</italic> extracts were conducted for the first time. Twenty-four compounds were identified and quantified in the tested extracts. The levels of these compounds were dependent on the plant parts used. Hyperoside, apigenin, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids were dominant compounds in the extracts. In the connect with chemical profiles, different results were observed for each part in the biological activity assays. Except for metal chelating ability, the extract from leaves exhibited the best biological activities in the performed assays. To sum up, our observations suggest that 
 <italic>A. macrocephalus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>finitimus</italic> could serve as a prominent source of bioactive agents to combat global health problems caused by oxidative stress. However, further studies are needed to understand the toxic profile, the type of enzyme inhibition and bioavailability of the tested extracts.
