<p>The amounts of total phenolics and flavonoids in the tested extracts were affected by plant parts used. As shown in 
 <xref rid="biology-09-00231-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the highest levels of phenolics and flavonoids were determined in the leaves extract (37.68 mg GAE/g and 39.23 mg QE/g). Flowers (6.96 mg GAE/g) and roots (6.03 mg QE/g) had the lowest level of total phenolics and flavonoids, respectively. Several studies reported different levels of these compounds in the members of the genus 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,

 <xref rid="B39-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Observed differences may be linked with geographical, environmental, and climatic conditions as well as plant parts [

 <xref rid="B42-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, recent studies indicated that the colorimetric methods had several drawbacks and these methods could not reflect accurate levels of these compounds in plant extracts [
 <xref rid="B43-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Hence, chromatographic methods such as HPLC or LC-MS are required to provide certain data. In this context, the extracts were analyzed by LC-MS and the results are given in 
 <xref rid="biology-09-00231-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Hyperoside, p-coumaric and ferulic acids and apigenin were identified as main compounds in the tested extracts. The level of hyperoside varied from 2.90 (in roots) to 1828.94 (in leaves) µg/g extract. The highest level of p-coumaric acid was detected in flowers extract with 146.78 µg/g extract. The main compounds in the extracts exhibited significant biological activities in earlier studies. For example, hyperoside is a main compound in the genus 
 <italic>Hypericum</italic> and this compound exhibits promising biological abilities [

 <xref rid="B47-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Additionally, similar properties were also reported for p-coumaric acid [
 <xref rid="B48-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], apigenin [
 <xref rid="B49-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and ferulic acid [
 <xref rid="B50-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-biology-09-00231" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. From this point, observed biological activities of 
 <italic>A. macrocephalus</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>finitimus</italic> extracts might be linked to the presence of these compounds.
