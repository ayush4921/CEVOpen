<p>Unsupervised principal component analysis and hierarchical clustered analysis were applied to assess the connections between plant parts used on their biological activities. The outcomes are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biology-09-00231-f003">Figure 3</xref>. With the percentage of variance of 79.1 and 9% respectively; the first two dimensions that represented a cumulative percentage of 88.1% of variance, seemed sufficient to cover the most information in the dataset. The main dominant biological activities of PC1 were FRAP, DPPH, CUPRAC, Ferrous ion chelating and phosphomolydbdenum while PC2 was dominated by alpha amylase inhibition

Besides, the cytoprotective antioxidants can be increased by antioxidant molecules thanks to the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, which is a main transcription factor for the oxidative stress regulation in human skin tissues such as melanocyte, keratinocytes, and dermal fibroblasts [
