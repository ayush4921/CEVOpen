<p>The study of the anti-inflammatory effects of SA on xylene-induced ear edema followed the experimental method of Sadeghi et al. and Anyasor and Ijituyi [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Twenty-five male ICR mice were randomly divided into five groups. Group 1 (control group) mice were fed distilled water. Group 2 (positive control group) mice were fed 10 mg/kg diclofenac sodium. The mice in groups 3–5 were fed 125 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, or 500 mg/kg SA extract, respectively. All mice were fed once daily for 7 days. On day 8, inflammation was induced in the animals as ear edema by topical xylene, and the mice were fed distilled water, diclofenac sodium, or SA extract 15 min later, after which the mice were induced by xylene. The right ear thickness of the mice was measured with a digital thickness gauge meter after 15, 30, 45, and 60 min.
