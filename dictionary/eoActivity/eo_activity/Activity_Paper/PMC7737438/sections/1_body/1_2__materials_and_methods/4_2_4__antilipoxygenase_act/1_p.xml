<p>An in vitro anti-inflammatory study was performed using a lipoxygenase assay adapted from Leelaprakash et al. and Chung et al. [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In brief, the oxidation of linoleic acid into 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid (HPODE) was detected by UV spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 234 nm. Diclofenac sodium as a standard was prepared at concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and the SA extract was prepared at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The % inhibition was calculated and expressed as the mean ± SEM of three replicates.
