<p>In this work we have demonstrated biological properties of cationic 1,4-dihydropyridine as self-assembling synthetic lipids and dihydropyridones as well as open-chain analogues: their cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines HT-1080 and MH-22A in comparison with cytotoxicity against normal NIH3T3 cells. The obtained data showed that 1,4-DHP derivatives containing cationic moieties in positions 2 and 6 and possessing dodecyl alkyl chains in the ester groups in positions 3 and 5 demonstrated high cytotoxicity on cancer cells HT-1080 and MH-22A, but low cytotoxicity on noncancerous NIH3T3 cells. According to our previous studies, these compounds also demonstrated significant antiradical activity and also gene delivery activity [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Together with antiradical activity, cell growth regulation, multidrug resistance inhibition, nucleic acid delivery, and the polyfunctional (pleiotropic) type of properties of the mentioned compounds open new avenues for their studies and use. According to literature data, liposomes could be used not only to transport biologically active compounds but also to have their own specific biological activity, e.g., to protect cells and encapsulated components against oxidative damage. Liposomes are proposed for the delivery of antioxidants for protection against pathological conditions related to oxidative stress [
