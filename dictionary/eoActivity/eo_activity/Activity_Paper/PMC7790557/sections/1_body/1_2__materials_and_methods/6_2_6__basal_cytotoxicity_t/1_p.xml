<p>The Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) assay was performed according to the standard protocol of Stokes et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] modified by a NICEATM-ECVAM validation study [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The NRU cytotoxicity assay procedure is based on the ability of viable cells to incorporate and bind neutral red, a supravital dye.
