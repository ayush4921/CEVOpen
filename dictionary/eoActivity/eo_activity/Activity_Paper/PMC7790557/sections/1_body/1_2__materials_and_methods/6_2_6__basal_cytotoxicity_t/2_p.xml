<p>Balb/c NIH 3T3 (mouse Swiss albino embryo fibroblast, ATCC® CRL-1658™) cells (9000 cells/well) were placed into 96-well plates for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Then, the cells were exposed to the test compound over a range of seven concentrations (1000, 316, 100, 31, 10, 3, and 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) for 24 h. Untreated cells were used as a control. After 24 h, the medium was removed from all plates. Then, 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of neutral red solution was added (0.05 mg/ml NR in DMEM 24 h preincubated at 37°C and then filtered before use through a 0.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>m syringe filter). Plates were incubated for 3 h, and then, the cells were washed three times with PBS. The dye within viable cells was released by extraction with a mixture of acetic acid, ethanol, and water (1 : 50 : 49). The absorbance of neutral red was measured using a spectrophotometer multiplate reader (Tecan Infinite M1000) at 540 nm. The optical density (OD) was calculated using the following formula: OD (treated cells) × 100/OD (control cells). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism® 3.0 program.
