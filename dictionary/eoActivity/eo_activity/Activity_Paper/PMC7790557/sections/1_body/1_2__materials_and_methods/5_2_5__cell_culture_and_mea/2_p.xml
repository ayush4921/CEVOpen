<p>HT-1080 and MH-22A cells were seeded in 96-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DMEM) medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 4 mM L-glutamine, without antibiotics, and cultivated for 72 h by exposure to different concentrations of compounds. Cell viability was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolinium bromide (MTT). In brief, after incubating with compounds, the culture medium was removed and fresh medium with 0.2 mg/ml MTT was added in each well of the plate. After incubation (3 h, 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>), the medium with MTT was removed, and 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l DMSO was added at once to each sample. The samples were tested at 540 nm on a Tecan Infinite M1000 multiplate reader. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated using the program GraphPad Prism® 3.0.
