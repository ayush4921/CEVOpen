<p>Compounds from the 1st group (comp.

 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) could be considered as analogues of 1,4-dihydronicotinamide and model compounds of redox coenzyme NAD(P)H. Many 4-aryl-1,4-DHPs possess antioxidant properties, including several Ca

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The antiradical activity (ARA) of two 1,4-DHPs containing cationic moieties was determined by a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical assay; the results were expressed as a percentage (%) of the DPPH free radical scavenging, and the untreated level of the DPPH radical was designated as 100% [

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It was demonstrated that 3,5-didodecyloxycarbonyl-4-phenyl-1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives containing pyridinium moieties showed 25–60% radical scavenging activity which are comparable with the ARA of Diludin [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] (40%)—a widely known antioxidant. Other 1,4-DHP amphiphiles containing saturated heterocyclic moieties—N-methylmorpholinium or N-methylpyrrolidinium derivatives—demonstrated more pronounced ARA, 95% and 54%, respectively. For 1,4-DHP amphiphiles possessing pyridinium moieties, the positive charge is delocalized in the heteroaromatic cycle, causing ARA reduction; for example, the electron donor dimethylamino group as a substituent of pyridinium moiety leads to a lower ARA (27%, comp.
