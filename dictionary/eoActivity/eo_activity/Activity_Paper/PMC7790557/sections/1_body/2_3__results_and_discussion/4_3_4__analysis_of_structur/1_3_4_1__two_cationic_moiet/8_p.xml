 <italic>(6) The Duplication of Moieties</italic>. Synthetic lipid-like compound 
 <bold>26</bold> was obtained as a “dimeric” form of compound 
 <bold>10</bold>, which was proposed as a promising DNA delivery agent. Cytotoxicity data of amphiphiles (comp. 
 <bold>26</bold> versus comp. 
 <bold>10</bold>) demonstrated that this structural modification slightly decreased cytotoxicity of the target compound 
 <bold>26</bold> in both tested cancer HT-1080 and MH-22A cells (12–27 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml versus 3–6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively) and also considerably decreased the LD
 <sub>50</sub> value—5164 mg/kg versus 1482 mg/kg.
