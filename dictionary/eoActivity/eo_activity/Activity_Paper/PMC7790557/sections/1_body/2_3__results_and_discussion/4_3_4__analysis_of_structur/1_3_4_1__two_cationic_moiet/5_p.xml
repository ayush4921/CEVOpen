 <italic>(3) Modification of the Cationic Moieties</italic>. Modification of the cationic moieties in positions 2 and 6 of the 1,4-DHP ring (in the case of 3,5-dodecyloxycarbonyl substituents) may result in substantially different toxicological properties. The insertion of substituents in the pyridinium ring leads to some quantitative modifications of cytotoxicity—mainly to slightly diminished cytotoxicity in the case of 4-methyl and 4-dimethylamino substituents (comp. 
 <bold>12</bold> and comp. 
 <bold>13</bold>)—while introducing a 3-acyl substituent (comp. 
 <bold>14</bold> versus comp. 
 <bold>10</bold>) in the pyridinium moiety did not give any influence on the cytotoxicity in HT-1080 cells (in both cases around 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), but decreased cytotoxicity in MH-22A cells (50–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and 3–6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively) and also decreased cytotoxicity in noncancerous cell line NIH3T3 (4040 mg/kg versus 1482 mg/kg). Comparison of the cytotoxicity of the compounds with 4-methylpyridinium and 4-trifluoromethyl pyridinium moieties (comp. 
 <bold>12</bold> versus comp. 
 <bold>21</bold>) showed that there are no significant changes of cytotoxicity in cancer HT-1080 and MH-22A cells (5–10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml versus 2–4 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 29–40 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml versus 19–49 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively) but a twofold increase of cytotoxicity in noncancerous NIH3T3 cells (1431 mg/kg versus 619 mg/kg). Introduction of a pyrazinium moiety instead of a pyridinium moiety (comp. 
 <bold>16</bold> versus comp. 
 <bold>10</bold>) gave a compound which was practically inert to the studied cancer cell lines HT-1080 and MH-22A and was also nontoxic to normal NIH3T3 cells. Exchange of the heteroaromatic pyridinium moieties to saturated heterocyclic moieties—N-methylmorpholinium fragments (comp. 
 <bold>15</bold>)—led to slightly lower anticancer activity of the compound towards the abovementioned cancer cell lines and comparatively higher cytotoxicity to NIH3T3 cells (979 mg/kg). Also, in this case, the influence of the anion was not taken into account, but it may give an effect (ClO
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> instead of Br
 <sup>−</sup>). Introducing N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammonium moieties as the cationic part of the amphiphile gave compound 
 <bold>17</bold> with less cytotoxicity (23–54 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) on both tested cancer cell lines and an LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1274 mg/kg, while the LD
 <sub>50</sub> value of compound 
 <bold>18</bold> with the introduced aliphatic N,N-dimethyl-N-dodecylammonium moieties was 836 mg/kg. It was shown that compound 
 <bold>18</bold> with aliphatic ammonium fragments was more cytotoxic. The obtained data is in agreement with conclusions by Lv et al. that among the synthetic cationic delivery systems, quaternary ammonium surfactants are more toxic than their analogues with the cationic charge delocalized in a heterocyclic system [
