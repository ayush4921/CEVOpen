<p>On the contrary, analogues comprising dodecyl chains in the ester groups at positions 3 and 5 and pyridinium moieties in positions 2 and 6 of the dihydropyridine ring (see comp.

 <bold>12</bold>, and 
 <bold>13</bold> were 1482, 1431, and 1706 mg/kg, respectively, while cytotoxicity towards HT-1080 cells was 3–10

In principle, the obtained data coincide with observations on the impact of dihydropyridine on cell growth, where it was concluded that a long alkyl chain containing 1,4-DHP amphiphiles show promising dual activity—proliferation inhibition on cancer cell lines and proliferation stimulating effect on normal cell lines [

 <bold>14</bold> with an electron-withdrawing acetyl group in the pyridinium moieties in positions 2 and 6 of the 1,4-DHP ring was practically nontoxic on noncancerous NIH3T3 cells and demonstrated selective cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and pronounced cytotoxicity of around 3
