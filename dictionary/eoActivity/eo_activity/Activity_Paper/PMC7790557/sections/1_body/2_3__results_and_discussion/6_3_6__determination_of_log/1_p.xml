<p>The lipophilicity of molecules represents their affinity for a lipophilic environment, and the lipophilicity may be expressed as log
 <italic>P</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The molecular polar surface area (PSA) is a very useful parameter for the prediction of drug transport properties, and PSA is defined as a sum of the surfaces of polar atoms [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In practice, medicinal chemists use the PSA to quantify the polarity of drug molecules [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Data of the calculated topological polar surface area represent the compound's blood-brain barrier permeability [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It allows one to plan further activities for the pleiotropic compounds.
