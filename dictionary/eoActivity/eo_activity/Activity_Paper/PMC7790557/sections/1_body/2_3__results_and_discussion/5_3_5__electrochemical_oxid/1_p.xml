<p>The electrochemical oxidation of various 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives has been extensively studied [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] including 1,4-DHP derivatives containing cationic moieties [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The electrochemical oxidation of the selected compounds studied in this work was performed by cyclic voltammetry on a stationary glassy carbon electrode in dry acetonitrile; the data is presented in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The perchlorates of the tested amphiphiles were obtained from the corresponding bromides by treating their abs. MeOH solutions with excess of conc. HClO
 <sub>4</sub> according to the procedure elaborated by Turovska et al. [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
