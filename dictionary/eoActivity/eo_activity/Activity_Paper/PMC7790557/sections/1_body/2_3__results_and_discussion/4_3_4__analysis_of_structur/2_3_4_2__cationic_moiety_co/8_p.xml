<p>The obtained data allows one to choose compounds for putative use depending on their structure. Thus, due to the polyfluorinated alkyl ester groups in the DHP molecule, low toxicity (practically inert) amphiphilic compounds can be obtained (comp. 
 <bold>25</bold>). Inert amphiphilic self-assembling compounds could be used as materials to form gene transfection or drug delivery nanoparticles for transmembrane transport according to the paradigm: pharmacologically inert transport vehicles should be used.
