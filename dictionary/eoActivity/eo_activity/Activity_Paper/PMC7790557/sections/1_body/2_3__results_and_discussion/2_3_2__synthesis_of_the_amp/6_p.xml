<p>Typically, enaminones have been studied and used as precursors and synthons for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic systems: pyridines, pyrroles, pyrimidines, dihydropyridines, etc. [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Therefore, up to now, most of the research in the field of enamines have been devoted to the elaboration of new strategies and synthetic methods, but lack biological studies [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. 2-Amino-3-alkoxycarbonylalkylammonium halides with long alkyl chains have appeared as a new class of enaminoesters and were elaborated as a transfection agent for RNS transfection [

 <bold>48</bold> is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch4">Scheme 4</xref>. Briefly, the first step included the transesterification of commercially available ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate with the corresponding carbinol without solvent by azeotropic removal of ethanol. Further reaction of the corresponding 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoates with ammonium acetate led to the formation of enaminoesters, which were used for quaternization with tertiary amines or heterocycles by extended heating in a dry solvent. Potassium iodide or sodium bromide additives were used for obtaining the corresponding iodides or bromides.
