 <italic>(2) Modification of Substituents at Position 4 of 3,4-Dihydro-2(1H)-pyridone Ring</italic>. The series of 3,4-dihydro-2(1
 <italic>H</italic>)-pyridones with a phenyl substituent at position 4 of the pyridone ring and also the 4-unsubstituted ones were compared. In the case of 4-phenyl pyridone 
 <bold>34</bold> and 4-unsubstituted pyridone 
 <bold>37</bold>, both compounds containing the same N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammonium moiety and hydrogen atoms in the alkyl chain had no significant change of cytotoxicity on the tested cell lines. While in the case of 4-phenyl pyridone 
 <bold>35</bold> and 4-unsubstituted pyridone 
 <bold>38</bold>, both compounds containing the same N,N-dimethylcyclohexylammonium moiety and fluorine atoms in the alkyl chain, the 4-unsubstituted 
 <bold>38</bold> possessed a slightly higher cytotoxicity—LD
 <sub>50</sub> values were 553 mg/kg for comp. 
 <bold>38</bold> and 898 mg/kg for comp. 
 <bold>35</bold>.
