<p>An acidic polysaccharide from 
 <italic>Schisandra chinensis</italic> (SCAP) was recently evaluated as a potential therapeutic agent in the streptozotocin-induced mouse model of diabetes. SCAP led to increased levels of fasting blood insulin and superoxide dismutase and to decreased levels of fasting blood glucose and malondialdehyde. This polysaccharide also prevented apoptosis of pancreatic Î²-cells through the up-regulation of factors such as BAX and Bcl-2, suggesting a possible mechanism for its antidiabetic activity. [
