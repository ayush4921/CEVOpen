<p>In another recent study, fourteen known compounds were isolated from 
 <italic>S. grandiflora</italic> crude extract and tested against α-amylase and α-glucosidase in vitro. Two flavonoids (quercetin and kaempferol) and two terpenoids (vomifoliol and loliolide) showed inhibitory activity toward these enzymes, which was justified through docking studies. Finally, all bioactive molecules acted as antioxidants in the ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical scavenging assay. Quantitative analysis highlighted high concentrations of the most active compounds in the plant extract, suggesting a potential use of the edible 
 <italic>S. grandiflora</italic> for the control of postprandial blood glucose in diabetic patients [
