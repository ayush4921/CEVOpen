<p>Lichens have also been used as a source of natural compounds for the treatment of AD. During a recent study conducted on murine neuroblastoma Neuro2A cells, lichen-derived secondary metabolites (atranorin, perlatolic acid, physodic acid and usnic acid) displayed an important increase in neurite outgrowth, with perlatolic acid achieving better results than reference compound resveratrol. MTT assays revealed that only usnic acid showed cytotoxicity at neurotrophic doses. The molecular mediators of these effects are NGF, which is upregulated by atranorin, perlatolic acid and physodic acid, and BDNF, which is upregulated by atranorin and physodic acid. Only perlatolic acid had a potential inhibitory activity on AChE, at a concentration that was comparable with galantamine and lower than biroquinone, another lichen metabolite reported as AChE inhibitor [
