<p>Other interesting bioactive secondary metabolites are butenolides, from the fungus 
 <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic>. The chemical structures of these compounds were recently elucidated and their effects against the expression of TNFα in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV2 microglia cells were tested. The most promising compound was asperteretal F, which inhibited the expression of TNFα in a dose-dependent mode, making it an anti-neuroinflammatory candidate for the treatment of NDs [
