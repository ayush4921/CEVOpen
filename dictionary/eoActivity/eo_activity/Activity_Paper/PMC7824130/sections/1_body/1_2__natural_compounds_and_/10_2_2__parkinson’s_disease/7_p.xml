<p>A natural compound extracted from 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> leaves, ginkgolic acid (GA), and its related molecule anacardic acid (AA) were screened for their influence on αSN aggregates. The treatment of KCl-depolarized SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with GA and AA led to a progressive and relevant decrease in αSN-positive aggregates, probably also due to increased activation of macro-autophagy, that resulted in increased survival of the neural cells [

 <italic>Ampelopsis grossedentata</italic>, a herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. Previous studies demonstrated that this compound played a neuroprotective role, and DHM, as proved by MTT assays on PC12 cells, blocked αSN fibrillo-genesis and its cytotoxicity. Moreover, DHM also disassembled preformed αSN fibrils, making it a potential molecule for the therapy of PD [
