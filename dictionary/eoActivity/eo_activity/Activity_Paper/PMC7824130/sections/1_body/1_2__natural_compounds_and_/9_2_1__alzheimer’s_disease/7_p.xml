<p>Detailed knowledge of the structure of plant and fungal secondary metabolites has also proven useful directing screening activities. Due to their similarity to existing nuclei used in AChE inhibitors and metal chelators, fungal secondary metabolites tenuazonic acid (TA), 
 <italic>epi</italic>-radicinol (ROH), mycophenolic acid (MA), radicinin (RAD), visoltricin/fungerin (FU) and plant metabolite 6-methoxymellein (6-MM) were screened for various activities such as inhibition of AChE, BChE and Aβ-aggregation, antioxidant effect and Cu and Zn interaction. A preliminary UV spectrophotometry test for metal chelation of Cu (II) and Zn (II) at physiological pH revealed that TA, MA and 6-MM probably interacted with Cu (II). TA and ROH exhibited a significant selective AChE inhibitory activity, while FU was the only compound that inhibited BChE. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity assay suggested that TA and MA behaved as antioxidants. Moreover, all molecules were inhibitors of Aβ
 <sub>1–40</sub> aggregation, as demonstrated by spectrofluorimetric assays, with ROH being the most active compound [
