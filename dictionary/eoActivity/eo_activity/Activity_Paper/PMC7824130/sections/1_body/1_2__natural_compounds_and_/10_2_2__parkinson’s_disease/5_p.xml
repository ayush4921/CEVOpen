<p>A dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>Renealmia Alpinia</italic>, was recently shown to possess a potent inhibitory activity towards both MAO-A and MAO-B. From this extract, desmethoxyangonin, a kavalactone, was isolated. It exhibited a potent, selective and competitive inhibition of MAO-B rather than MAO-A, confirmed by molecular modeling studies, leading to its selection as a candidate for further drug development. Other isolated molecules from the extract displayed moderate inhibition of both isoforms [
