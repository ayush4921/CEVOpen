<p>Looking at innovative targets, a recent paper describes Macamides, a group of secondary metabolites isolated from the plant 
 <italic>Lepidium meyenii</italic> (Maca). These compounds are benzylamides of fatty acids, active as analogues of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) and studies have demonstrated that they inhibit fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), blocking AEA hydrolysis. Gugnani et al. demonstrated a neuroprotective role of macamides in vitro and in vivo. Macamides reduced Mn-induced mitochondrial toxicity in glioblastoma U-87 MG cells, probably by binding the CB
 <sub>1</sub> receptor, and it could thus be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s Disease. Like AEA, macamides can interact with PPARγ, regulating inflammation, energetic metabolism and glucose homeostasis, all important factors for the prevention of AD [
