<p>Sarcophytolide, instead, is a lacton cembrane diterpene derived from soft coral 
 <italic>Sarcophyton glaucum</italic> that was recently shown to possess antimicrobic activity towards 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Moreover, pretreatment of primary cortical cells with sarcophytolide had a strong cytoprotective effect against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and increased the expression of Bcl-2. This mechanism confirmed by evidence that sarcophytolide showed a cytoprotective activity only if added before and not after the exposure of neuronal cells to glutamate [
