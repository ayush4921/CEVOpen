<p id="Par25">CFE in a serum-free medium is a functional assay used to investigate the survival of cells with stem-like properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Reducing the number of colony forming units is an important feature of potential chemotherapeutic compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Treatment with the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> at the IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration (80 μg/mL) resulted in 100% prevention of colony formation of JIMT-1 cells. Treatment with solvent fractions of 
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic> (SO:2 and SO:3), 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> (CS:1 and CS:2) and 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> VL:1 and VL:2) significantly reduced CFE in a dose-dependent manner compared to the controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In addition to reducing the number of colonies, treatment with the fractions in general resulted in smaller colonies than in control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c).
