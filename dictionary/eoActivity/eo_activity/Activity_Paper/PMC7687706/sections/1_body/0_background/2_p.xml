<p id="Par14">Breast cancer tissue contains a small population of highly tumorigenic multi-potential cells with self-renewal properties known as cancer stem cells (CSCs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the presence of CSCs was first reported in myeloid leukemia, they are now found in most solid tumors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. CSCs are very rare but are thought to be the main drivers of tumor growth and metastases. Much evidence points to CSCs being refractory to available cancer treatment regimens and thus contributing to cancer relapse and metastases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There are several phenotypic markers for breast CSCs. These include the expression of cluster of differentiation (CD)44 and absence of CD24 expression on the cell surface and the presence of enhanced aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Cell migration, one of the characteristic features of CSCs, is a prerequisite for cancer metastases, which results in tumor initiation at different sites of the body [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. One of the important signaling pathways maintaining CSCs is the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway. Aberrant NF-κB activation has been shown to be involved in breast CSC phenotypic features by cross-talking to several other signaling pathways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In most breast cancers, the NF-κB pathway is activated constitutively and plays a critical role in cell survival, proliferation, and inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. NF-κB is found in the cytoplasm in an inactive form associated with the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. When it is released from the inhibitor, p65/NF-κB is translocated to the nucleus and activates gene transcription by binding to sequence-specific targets in DNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, it is an important target for screening potential anticancer agents.
