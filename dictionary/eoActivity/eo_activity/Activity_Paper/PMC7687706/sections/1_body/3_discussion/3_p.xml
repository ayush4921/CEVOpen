<p id="Par30">Another feature of CSCs is their ability to form colonies in serum-free medium [

 <italic>C. simensis</italic> shows the inhibition of the unlimited self-renewal property and the capacity to initiate and maintain malignancy of the CSCs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The dose dependent reduction in the number of colonies and reduced sizes of the colonies in comparison to the controls may indicate that the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum,</italic> the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic>, or the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic> have inhibitory effect against the features involved in maintaining the stemness of the CSCs. The finding is corroborated by a recent report that treatment of MCF7 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells with solvent extracts of 
 <italic>Viola odorata</italic> reduced the colony formation and colony size in a soft agar assay [
