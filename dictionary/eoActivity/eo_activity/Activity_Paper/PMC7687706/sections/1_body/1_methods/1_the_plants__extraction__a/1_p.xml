<p id="Par16">In a previous study, we determined the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of seven Ethiopian medicinal plants selected based on the recommendations of traditional medicine practitioners and on the frequency of use reports across the country [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Here, investigations were done on three solvent fractions with low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values based on results obtained by treating various breast cancer-derived cell lines and one normal-like cell line [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus, here we investigate the effects of the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi,</italic> the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic>, and the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> on CSC properties of the JIMT-1 breast cancer cell line. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>V. leopoldi</italic>, the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>S. oxyacanthum</italic>, and the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> are 0.87 ± 0.2 μg/mL, 69 ± 2 μg/mL, and 80 ± 19 μg/mL, respectively, in the JIMT-1 cancer cell line [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The selectivity index of V. leopoldi, S. oxyacanthum and 
 <italic>C. simensis</italic> are 1.98, 1.16, and 1.2, respectively, compared to the normal-like breast epithelial cell line MCF-10A [
