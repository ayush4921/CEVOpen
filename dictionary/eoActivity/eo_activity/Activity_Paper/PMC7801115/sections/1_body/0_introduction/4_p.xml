<p>Additionally, the literature review revealed that amidines are structural parts of numerous biologically active compounds like many important medical and biochemical agents

 </xref>. We have proven that within designing suchlike derivatives, the biological activity could be significantly improved while many of derivatives showed interaction with an electronegatively charged biological molecule such as DNA. The synthesised derivatives displayed antiproliferative, antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidative activity with several active compounds which were chosen as lead compounds for further optimisation and modification to get more active, selective and less cyctotoxic derivatives with improved physico-chemical properties

 </xref>. Recently, we have published several papers describing the antiproliferative activity of various benzothiazole and benzimidazole derivatives substituted with either carboxamido, amino, halogeno, cyano, amidino, amino or nitro groups placed at different positions on the mentioned scaffold

 </xref>. The most significant biological importance was observed with amidino substituted benzazoles bearing different types of amidine substituents suchlike unsubstituted, isopropyl, morpholinyl or imidazolinyl. Obtained results revealed that among all synthesised benzazole derivatives, cyclic amidino substituent, namely 2-imidazolinyl group showed the most significant influence and the enhancement of the antiproliferative activity
