<p>Tested compounds (final concentration of 5 µM, 0.5% DMSO) were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in human and mouse plasma, respectively. Aliquots were taken at different time points (0, 30, 120 and 240 min) and reaction was terminated by addition of a MeCN/MeOH (2:1) mixture, containing internal standard (diclofenac). Samples were then centrifuged (at 4500 rpm, at 4 °C, for 30 min) and resulting supernatants were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The same procedure was followed for controls used in the assay: propranolol (both species), benfluorex (mouse) and eucatropine (human), respectively.</p>
