<p>Calculation of IC
 <sub>50</sub> data, curves and QC analysis is made by using Excel tools and GraphPadPrism software (La Jolla, CA), v. 5.03. In brief, individual concentration–effect curves are generated by plotting the logarithm of the tested concentration of tested compounds (X) versus corresponding percent inhibition values (Y) using least squares (ordinary) fit. Best fit IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are calculated using Log(inhibitor) versus normalised response – Variable slope equation, where Y = 100/(1 + 10((LogIC
 <sub>50</sub> – X) * HillSlope)). QC criteria parameters (Z', S:B, R2, HillSlope) were checked for every IC
 <sub>50</sub> curve.
