<p>The reaction mixture was refluxed for 4 h, cooled under nitrogen to 5 °C, and the obtained solid was filtered off and washed with dry ether. The solid mixture was suspended and heated to boiling in 70 ml of deoxygenated water, cooled under nitrogen at 5 °C for 2 h, and the resulting precipitate was filtered off and dried under reduced pressure over KOH. Yield of pure compound 
 <bold>2</bold> as pale yellow solid was 4.26 g (83.2%) mp = 284–288 °C.
