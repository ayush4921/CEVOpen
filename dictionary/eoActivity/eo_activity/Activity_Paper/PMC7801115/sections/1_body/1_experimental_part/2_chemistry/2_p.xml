<p>Melting points were determined by means of Original Kofler Mikroheitztisch apparatus (Reichert, Wien). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and the 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR spectra were recorded with the Bruker Avance DPX-300 or Bruker AV-600 using TMS as internal standard. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to TMS. Elemental analyses for carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen were performed on Perkin-Elmer 2400 elemental analyser. Analyses are indicated as symbols of elements, analytical results obtained are within 0.4% of the theoretical value. All compounds were routinely checked by TLC using Merck silica gel 60 F-254 glass plates.
