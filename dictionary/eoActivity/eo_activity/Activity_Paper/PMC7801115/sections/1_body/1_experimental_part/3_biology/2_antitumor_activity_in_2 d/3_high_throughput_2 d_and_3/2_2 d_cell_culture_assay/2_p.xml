<p>Cells were grown in 96 well cell star polystyrene plates. 10,000 cells/well were seeded in wells 4 h prior the treatment with different compounds concentrations and incubated for 72 h. A cell viability assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction, using CellTiter 96 aqueous solution, MTS kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). After 0.5–2 h of cell incubation with MTS in 2 D cell culture, the plates were read using PE EnVision absorbance at 490 nm. The results for each of tested compounds are reported as growth percentages from two independent concentrations curves compared with the untreated control cells after drug exposure. Since we prefer homogeneous assays (mix and read procedures) and therefore MTS is more practical (one step less than MTT). MTS is more sensitive and accurate in comparison with MTT assay.</p>
