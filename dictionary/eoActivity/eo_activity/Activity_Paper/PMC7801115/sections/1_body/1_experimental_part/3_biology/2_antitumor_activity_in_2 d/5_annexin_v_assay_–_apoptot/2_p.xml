<p>Under physiological conditions, choline phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin) are exposed on the external leaflet while aminophospholipids (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine) are exclusively located on the cytoplasmic surface of the lipid bilayer. This asymmetry is scrambled during apoptosis when phosphatidylserine becomes exposed on the extracellular side of the membrane
