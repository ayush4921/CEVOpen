<p>Phosphatidylserine is detected by anticoagulant protein Annexin V (tagged with fluorochrome) that reversibly binds to phosphatidylserine residues on the extracellular side of the membrane. Annexin V apoptotic assay was performed using Annexin V Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to manufacturer instruction. Briefly, 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were seeded on 24 well plate and treated with IC
 <sub>50</sub> concentration of chosen compounds from amidine series for 36 h. Cells suspensions were collected after incubation into 5 ml Falcon tubes, washed and centrifuged 2 times (once with PBS, followed by Annexin V Binding Buffer (AVBB)) for 5 min, 400 g at room temperature (RT). 100 µL of AVBB was added to each tube followed by addition of 2 µL of Annexin V Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate and incubated for 15 min at RT. Cells were washed in AVBB for 5 min, 400 g at RT. SYTOX™ AADvanced™ Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for detection of late apoptotic and necrotic cells. 1 µL of SYTOX AADvanced was added to each tube and incubated at RT for 5 min in dark. 500 µL of AVBB was added and samples were kept on ice until analysed. The results for each of tested compounds are reported as percentage of positive cells (live cells (Annexin V−/SytoxAAD−), apoptotic cells (Annexin V+/SytoxAAD−), late apoptotic/necrotic cells (Annexin V+/SytoxAAD+) and necrotic cells (Annexin V−/SytoxAAD+)).
