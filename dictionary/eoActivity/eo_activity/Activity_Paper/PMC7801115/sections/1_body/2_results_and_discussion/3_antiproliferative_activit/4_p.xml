<p>We have tested the antiproliferative activity on 2 D and 3 D cell culture assays 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> of newly synthesised amidino substituted benzimidazole/benzothiazole derivatives 
 <bold>5a–5i</bold> and 
 <bold>6a–6g</bold> on three human lung cancer cell lines A549, HCC827 and NCI-H358. As standard drugs, 
 <italic>doxorubicin</italic>, 
 <italic>staurosporine</italic> and 
 <italic>vandetanib</italic> were used. Doxorubicin interact with DNA by intercalation and inhibits synthesis of biomoleculas, staurosporin is protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor and vandetanib multikinase inhibitor (VGFRs, EGFR and RET kinase) is antitumor drug with potential use in a broad range of tumours types, especially thyroid and lung. For 2 D cell assay we used a classic two-dimensional 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cancer cell line proliferation assay and as 3 D assay we used a hanging drop proliferation cell assay. Antiproliferative activity for each compound is presented as an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value that was calculated using the program GraphPadPrism software (La Jolla, CA), v. 5.03., and average values from three independent experiments. The results for each of tested compounds are reported as growth percentages from two independent concentrations curves compared with the untreated control cells after drug exposure. In both assay formats, inhibition of proliferation was measured by MTS viability assay. Obtained IC
 <sub>50</sub> inhibitory concentrations in 2 D and 3 D cell culture system for three human lung cancer cell lines are depicted in
