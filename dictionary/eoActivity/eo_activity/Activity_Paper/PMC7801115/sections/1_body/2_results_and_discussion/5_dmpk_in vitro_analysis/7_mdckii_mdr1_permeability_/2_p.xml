<p>Both active and non-active compounds display low permeability, with P
 <sub>app</sub>(A2B) values below 2 × 10
 <sup>−6 </sup>cm/sec in A2B direction without P-gp inhibitor (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In the presence of elacridar (tested only for active compounds), A2B peremability, i.e. passive permeability, becomes moderate for compounds 
 <bold>5c</bold>–
 <bold>e</bold> and 
 <bold>5 g</bold>. For two remaining compounds, 
 <bold>5 h</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold>, permeability remains low (&lt;2 × 10
 <sup>−6 </sup>cm/sec) even in the presence of P-gp inhibitor. In addition, all active compounds could be classified as P-gp substrates with efflux ratio &gt;2 in the absence of P-gp inhibitor and its significant decrease (at least 50%) in the presence of elacridar. Non-active compounds could also be classified as P-gp substrates based on efflux ratio (&gt;2) in the absence of inhibitor. The only exception is 
 <bold>6 b</bold>, low permeable compound whose transport through membrane seems not to be influenced by P-gp (efflux ratio &lt;2).
