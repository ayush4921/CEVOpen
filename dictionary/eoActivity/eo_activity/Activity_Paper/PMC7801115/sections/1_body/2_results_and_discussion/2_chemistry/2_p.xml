<p>The targeted amidino substituted benzothiazoles 
 <bold>5a–5i</bold> and benzimidazoles 
 <bold>6a–6g</bold> were synthesised according to the procedure shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="s0001">Scheme 1</xref> by using conventional methods for cyclocondenastion to fused benzazole derivatives. Within the cyclocondensation in refluxing acetic acid between commercially aryl aldehydes 
 <bold>4a–4i</bold> and amidino substituted benzenethiolate 
 <bold>2</bold>, followed by quenching with hydrochloric acid, benzothiazoles 
 <bold>5a–5i</bold> as hydrochloride salts obtained in moderate to good reaction yields. This method has been optimised in order to perform direct condensation of aldehydes with amidino substituted 2-aminothiophenoles without using any catalyst or oxidant. The precursor 2-amino-5–(3,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidin-1-ium-2-yl)benzenethiolate 
 <bold>2</bold> in the form of zwitterion was prepared from 6-cyanobenzothiazole by Pinner reaction according to our previously described and well developed method
