<p>Several steps were implemented in order to validate the HPTLC method. The range of compound concentrations was measured for linearity, with results expressed as a correlation coefficient from linear regression. A sample was prepared by adding a known concentration of compounds to a previously quantified sample. This sample was analyzed at three different times on the same day in order to assess intra-day precision and daily for 5 consecutive days in order to quantify inter-day precision. Systemic error was calculated in order to estimate the accuracy of the analytical method. The relative standard deviation of the linearity data and a calibration curve slope were used to calculate the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) for KA. </p>
