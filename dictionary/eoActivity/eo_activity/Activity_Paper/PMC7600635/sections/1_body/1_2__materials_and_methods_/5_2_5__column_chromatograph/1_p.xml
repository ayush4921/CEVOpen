<p>Sequential purification through column chromatography was employed for partial purification for 14 different experiments with ultrasonicated 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> extracts. For the stationary phase, activated silica gel (pore size 60â€“120 mesh) was used, and for the mobile phase, a sequence of n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and petroleum ether was used. Additional column chromatography was completed after the crude methanol residue was partially dissolved in n-hexane and triturated with silica. Fractions were collected starting with n-hexane followed by ethyl acetate and petroleum ether. The collected fractions were then condensed. Due to their high fatty acid content, n-hexane and petroleum ether were discarded. A rotary evaporator was used to dry the collected ethyl acetate fractions before weighing. The result was yellow crystals of ethyl acetate fractions in test tubes. Each fraction was tested in order to confirm the presence of a single compound for ethyl acetate fractions using HPTLC.
