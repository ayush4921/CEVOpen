<p>Methanol extracts and KA were evaluated for antioxidant activities using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging method described by Mensor et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], with slight modifications. Dimethyl Sulfoxide DMSO (SIGMA) was used to dissolve test samples and mixed with 20 mg/mL of a DPPH methanol solution in order to yield concentrations of 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 μg/mL. After all samples were allowed to sit at room temperature for 30 min, absorbance values were measured at 517 nm and converted into the percentage of antioxidant activity as follows:
 <disp-formula>% Inhibition = (Absorbance of control − Absorbance of test sample) × 100/Absorbance of control</disp-formula>
