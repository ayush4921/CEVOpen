 <xref rid="B24-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In recent years, the high performance TLC (HPTLC) densitometry method has grown in popularity because it is economic, sensitive, accurate, and reduces the time needed to process large samples. The increased sensitivity of this method and the ability to process many samples in short periods of time have led researchers to use TLC-densitometry over the popular HPLC [

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> by applying a Boxâ€“Behnken design (BBD) and to quantify such a flavonol with a simple, efficient, and validated HPTLC-VIS technique.
