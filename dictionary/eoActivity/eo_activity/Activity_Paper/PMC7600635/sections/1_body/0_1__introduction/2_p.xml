<p>Basil (
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L.) is an herbaceous annual plant that generally produces white-purple flowers and is one of the most important cultivated aromatic herbs in the world. The 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> genus belongs to the mint family (
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic>), which contains dozens of medicinal plants that are grown for their high economic value. This genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and South America, and it consists of annual and perennial herbs and shrubs [

Basil can be cultivated in fields as well as under greenhouse conditions, which can result in different concentrations of chlorophylls and secondary metabolites. This herb is utilized for its medicinal values to treat headaches, coughs, diarrhea, constipation, warts, worms, and kidney malfunction [

 <xref rid="B8-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and is known as rihan in Arabic [
 <xref rid="B9-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Basil has many health benefits, and it is composed of essential nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, phosphorus, and beta carotene [
 <xref rid="B10-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It also contains flavonoids and phenolic compounds that act as reducing agents that contribute to its antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Basil extract is commonly used as an herbal drug due to the many pharmacological effects such as anti-hyperglycemic [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], hypolipidemic, antiatherosclerotic [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and anticancer activities [
 <xref rid="B14-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Basil leaves contain several polyphenols, bioactive compounds [
 <xref rid="B15-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and phenolic acids (caffeic acid, caftaric acid, and rosmarinic acid) [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and they are also rich in flavonoids such as anthocyanins, quercetin, kaempferol (KA), and luteolin. A very recent study conducted on the natural populations of basil indicated that it may have different chemical composition and biological activities [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Among flavonoids, KA is a natural flavonol antioxidant found in many fruits and vegetables. Several studies have focused on dietary KA due to its health benefits. In particular, it has been shown that KA may lower the risk of some chronic diseases, especially cancer [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, KA has been reported to increase the bodyâ€™s antioxidant defense against free radicals, the common cause of cancer, resulting in an inverse relationship between the use of dietary KA and cancer [
