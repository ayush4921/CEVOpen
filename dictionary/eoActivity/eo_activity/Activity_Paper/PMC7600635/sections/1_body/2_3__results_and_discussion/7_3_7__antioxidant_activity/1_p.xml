<p>Data on the antioxidant activities of the methanol extract of ultrasonicated basil leaves (
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>) under the optimized conditions, as well as their isolated compound (KA), are presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01379-t009" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>. The antioxidant activity of the methanol extract of ultrasonicated 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> was IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50.10 μg/mL. In contrast, the antioxidant activity of KA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.68 μg/mL) was higher with respect to the reference ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.79 μg/mL) and BHT (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.88 μg/mL). The present study was in accordance with the work of Shafique et al. [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-09-01379" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], who reported that 
 <italic>O. basilicum</italic> extracts exhibited and offered higher antioxidant activity compared to synthetic antioxidant BHT.
