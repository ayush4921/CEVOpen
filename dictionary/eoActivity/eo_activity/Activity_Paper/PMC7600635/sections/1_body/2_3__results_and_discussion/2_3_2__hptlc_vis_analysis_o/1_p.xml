<p>From the screening study, it was shown that the methanol–water solvent exhibited the highest yield of flavonoids from basil leaves when compared to the other four solvents. As a consequence, this type of extraction solvent was selected for the KA extraction. The ultrasonication extraction technique was performed on the extraction of the KA-containing methanol extract. To separate the bioactive compounds, the ultrasonicated 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> extracts from 15 experiments were partially purified with sequential purification through column chromatography. The results obtained from the column chromatography showed that among the hexane, ethyl acetate, and petroleum ether extractions, only ethyl acetate impacted the presence of KA in the extract. The ethyl acetate extraction was subsequently selected for TLC analysis. The test tubes were collected and the mobile phase was evaporated in order to obtain the pure, yellow crystals from the ethyl acetate fractions. The KA band in the ultrasonicated 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> extracts was verified by being compared with a standard of the KA sample using TLC (

The clear resolution exhibited on the chromatography demonstrates that this solvent system is capable of efficiently separating KA from the methanol extract of the ultrasonicated
