<p>HPTLC-VIS was used to quantify the KA yield from each experimental BBD run (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01379-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). A regression analysis was performed, and four proposed models were analyzed. The quadratic model appeared to be the best fit (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9138), followed by the cubic model (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9033), 2 Factor Interaction (FI) model (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.5462), and linear model (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.1986) (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01379-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). The adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> of the quadratic model was close to 1, implying a certain degree of correlation between the observed and predicted values. The adequate precision was calculated in order to determine the signal-to-noise ratio, and in this study, the adequate precision reading was 17.58, which was larger than the desired value (&gt;4.0). Such a large value would be indicative of an adequate signal and could be used to navigate through the design space. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the fitted quadratic polynomial model for the KA yield is presented in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01379-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. The lack of a fit F-value test for the model described the deviation in the data around the fitted model. The obtained value was not significant (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.265), indicating that the result might have been due to pure error, which therefore validated the RSM results. In other words, if the model did not adequately fit the data, the resultant lack-of-fit value would be significant. The optimization of a fitted response surface is likely to provide false results [
