<p>The concentration of total phenolics in the extract was analyzed by the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric assay [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-26-00768" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Firstly, crude extract (0.2 mL), deionized water (0.8 mL) and Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (0.1 mL) was incubated at room temperature for 3 min and then 0.3 mL of Na
