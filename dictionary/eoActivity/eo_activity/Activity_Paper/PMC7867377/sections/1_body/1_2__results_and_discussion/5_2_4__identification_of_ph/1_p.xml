<p>Different classes of phytochemicals are omnipresent in plants and have been linked with diverse biological activities. This study revealed the presence of diverse groups of chemical compounds, which are known to possess a broad range of bioactivities. After the evaluation of antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activities, a comprehensive phytochemical analysis from crude extract of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> was carried out via UHPLC-PDA-ESIâ€“MS/MS. Chromatogram was obtained with both positive and negative run and different types of phytochemicals were identified (
