<p>P-gp is a key to estimate active efflux through biological membranes and known as the most important member among ATP-binding cassette transporters or ABC-transporters used to protect the central nervous system (CNS) from xenobiotics. None of the selected phytocompounds were P-gp inhibitor/substrate. Intestinal absorption was also assessed and most of the identified compounds were highly absorbed by the intestine. The skin permeation as given by LogKP was predicted and results demonstrated that identified compounds might be moderately or highly promoted to penetrate through the skin, which confirmed their drug-like properties. Many of them such as Sedanolide, and (-)-Caryophyllene oxide with log BB (logarithm value of brain to plasma concentration ratio) greater than 0.3 were subjected to have more potential to cross brain blood barrier (BBB). Only fewer compounds like arachidonic acid, hexadecanamide and hordenine have the ability to penetrate to CNS. (-)-Caryophyllene oxide and hordenine are amongst the phytoconstituents that will be more distributed with distribution volume logVDss of 0.564 L/kg and 0.887 L/kg in the tissues, respectively.</p>
