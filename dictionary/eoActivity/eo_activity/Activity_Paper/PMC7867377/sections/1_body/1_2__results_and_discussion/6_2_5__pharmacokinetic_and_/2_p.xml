<p>To be a transdermal drug delivery, the skin permeability, which defines the rate of a chemical penetrating across the stratum corneum, will be checked to improve its efficacy. A molecule will perfectly penetrate the skin if log Kp was higher than âˆ’2.5 cm/h. All phytocompounds seem to possess moderate to good skin penetrability among them, those of scopoletin, sedanolide, (-)-Caryophyllene oxide and hordenine. The Caco-2 cell line is composed of human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Caco-2 permeability can predict the intake of oral drugs as Caco-2. All compounds displayed moderate to potent (log Papp values &gt;0.90 cm/s) Caco-2 permeability values. Among them, scopoletin, sedanolide, (-)-Caryophyllene oxide and hordenine were predicted to have the strongest Caco-2 permeability.</p>
