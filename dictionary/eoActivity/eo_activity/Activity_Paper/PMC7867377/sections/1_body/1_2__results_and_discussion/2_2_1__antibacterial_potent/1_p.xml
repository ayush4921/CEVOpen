<p>In recent times, almost all developing and developed countries are going through with a global problem of antibiotic resistance, which is continuously challenging the global healthcare sector. Multidrug-resistant pathogens are emerging and spreading in such a way that it continues to diminish the current antimicrobial therapies. This demands a search for novel antimicrobial substances, preferably from natural sources. Plants are one such example consisting of a variety of bioactive compounds with known therapeutic properties [
