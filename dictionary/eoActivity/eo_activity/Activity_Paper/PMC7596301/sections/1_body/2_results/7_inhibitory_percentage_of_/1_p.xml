<p>The inhibitory percentage of quercetin on different stages of SGIV infection was evaluated by RT-qPCR results. The results based on MCP gene expression revealed that the inhibitory percentages of quercetin on SGIV particles (test 1), SGIV binding to the membrane of host cells (test 2), SGIV invading into host cells (test 3), and SGIV replication (test 4) were 65.73, 76.14, 56.03, and 52.73%, respectively (
