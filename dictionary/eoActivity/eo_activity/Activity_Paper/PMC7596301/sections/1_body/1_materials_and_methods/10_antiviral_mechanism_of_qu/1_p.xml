<p>The effects of quercetin on SGIV invading into host cells were first analyzed by RT-qPCR. GS cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at 28°C for 24 h. Cells were incubated with SGIV (MOI = 0.1) at 4°C for 30 min, which made SGIV bind to the cell surface. After having been washed twice with L15, quercetin (50 μg/ml) was added to the cells and incubated at 28°C for 2 h. The culture supernatants were removed, and cells were washed twice with L15. GS cells were cultured at 28°C. The cells and the culture medium in each well at 12 hpi were collected for total RNA extraction and SGIV infection detection by RT-qPCR. Cells without quercetin treatment served as the control group.</p>
