<p>The antiviral mechanism of quercetin against SGIV infection was further analyzed, as previously described with modification (
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019b</xref>). Then, 100 μl SGIV (10

 <sub>50</sub>/ml) was mixed with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 4°C for 2 h. After having been centrifuged at 42,000 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 1 h, virion pellets were collected and suspended in 100 μl TN buffer. Furthermore, 10 μl SGIV was added into GS cells in a 12-well plate at 28°C. At 48 hpi, the cells and the culture medium in each well were collected for total RNA extraction and analyzed by RT-qPCR. SGIV without incubation with quercetin (50 μg/ml) served as the control group, and SGIV in the control group was processed as per the same procedures.
