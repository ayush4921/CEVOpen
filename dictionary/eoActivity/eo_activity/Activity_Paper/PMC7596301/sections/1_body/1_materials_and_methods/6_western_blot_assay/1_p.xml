<p>GS cells were treated with quercetin (50 or 25 μg/ml) and SGIV at 28°C for 48 h. At 48 h post-infection (hpi), the cells and the culture supernatants were collected for protein extraction. Proteins were separated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The blots were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with anti-MCP antibodies (1:500). The blots were washed with TBS and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:1,000). The blots were reprobed with α-tubulin (1:1,000) for total protein.</p>
