<p>The cells and the culture medium were collected and transferred to a 96-well plate to determine virus titer by 50% tissue culture infection dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) assay, as previously described (
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, GS cells were cultured in a 12-well plate (Corning) for 24 h at 28°C, after which quercetin (50 or 25 μg/ml) and SGIV, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1, were simultaneously added to the cells. GS cells added with only SGIV (MOI = 0.1) served as the control group. The cells were maintained at 28°C for 48 h. At 48 hpi, the cells and the culture supernatants were collected for virus titer analysis. The data from three independent experiments were used to quantify the effects of quercetin on SGIV infection.
