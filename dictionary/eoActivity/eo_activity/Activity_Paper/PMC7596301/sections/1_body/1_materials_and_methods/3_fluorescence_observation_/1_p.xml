<p>The effects of quercetin, at a safe working concentration, on the cell were identified by fluorescence observation (

 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2019</xref>). GS cells (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) were cultured in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (Cellvis, catalog number D35-14-1-N) at 28°C for 24 h and then incubated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) for 24 h at 28°C. After incubation, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) three times and subsequently dyed with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-vimentin antibody, FITC-labeled anti-cytokeratin antibody, and FITC-labeled anti-fibronectin antibody (Abcam, UK), respectively. Fluorescence was observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM, Nikon, C2, Japan). Normal GS cells without quercetin treatment served as the control group.
