<p>GS cells were seeded in a 12-well plate at 28°C for 24 h. Cells were incubated with SGIV (MOI = 0.1) at 4°C for 30 min and then maintained at 28°C for 2 h to make SGIV enter the host cells. The culture supernatants were removed, and the cells were washed twice with L15. Quercetin (50 μg/ml) was added and incubated with GS cells at 28°C for 10 h. SGIV-infected cells without quercetin treatment served as the control group. The cells and the culture medium in each well at 12 hpi were collected for SGIV replication analysis by RT-qPCR and virus titer detection. The cells and the culture medium in each well at 24 hpi were collected for SGIV replication analysis by virus titer detection.</p>
