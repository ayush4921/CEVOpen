<p>The inhibitory percentage of quercetin on a different stage of SGIV infection was evaluated as described previously (
 <xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2019b</xref>). Percentage inhibition = 1 − (X − B)/(A − B) × 100%. X represents each RT-qPCR results of cells treated with SGIV and quercetin on a different stage of SGIV infection, A represents the RT-qPCR result for cells treated with SGIV alone, and B represents the RT-qPCR result of normal cells.
