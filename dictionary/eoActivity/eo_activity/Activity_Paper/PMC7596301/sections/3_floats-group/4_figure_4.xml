  <p>Inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells. 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> The inhibitory effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were analyzed by RT-qPCR. Test group: GS cells pretreated with quercetin at 4°C for 30 min and then infected with SGIV at 28°C for 12 h; control group: cells infected with SGIV alone for 12 h. The cells and the culture medium in each well at 12 hpi were collected for total RNA extraction and SGIV infection detection by RT-qPCR. The levels of viral MCP 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and viral envelope protein 
   <bold>(B)</bold> gene expression in the test group were lower than those in the control group. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were analyzed by flow cytometry analysis. After having been pretreated with quercetin (50 μg/ml) at 4°C for 30 min, cells were incubated with Cy5-SGIV [multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1] at 4°C for 30 min and then collected for flow cytometry analysis. Cells infected with Cy5-SGIV (MOI = 1) alone for 30 min served as the control group. Compared to the control group, the fluorescence signals of Cy5 on the cells of the test group decreased obviously. It proved that quercetin did interfere with SGIV binding to targets on host cells (

   <bold>(D)</bold> The effects of quercetin on SGIV binding to host cells were further analyzed by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The LSCM observation results were consistent with the flow cytometry results. Compared to the control group, the fluorescence signals of Cy5 on the surface of cells in the test group decreased obviously. Scale bar: 50 μm.
