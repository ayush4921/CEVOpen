<p>The expressional level of genes encoded for 
 <italic>pal</italic>, 
 <italic>chs</italic>, 
 <italic>chi</italic>, and 
 <italic>fls</italic> proteins were examined to further evaluate the effects of LED lights on the flavonoid accumulation in 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic>. The obtained results in this study indicated that although the expression of 
 <italic>pal</italic> and 
 <italic>chs</italic> genes in all experimental conditions of LED lights were declined as compared to the control, the total flavonoid content in plants under BR LED was still higher than that in other lighting treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01344-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). The results showed that the transcription of 
 <italic>chs</italic> of plants developed under all of the LED lights was extremely lower than that in the FL at the collected time (which is under the daylight period) (
