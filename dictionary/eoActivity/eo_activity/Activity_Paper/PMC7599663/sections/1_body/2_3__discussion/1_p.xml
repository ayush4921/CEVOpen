<p>Light is one of the most indispensable factors for plant growth and development, which is directly involved in the regulations of plant morphogenesis, metabolism, gene expression, photosynthesis, and other physiological responses. In the last decade, numerous studies have investigated the effects of light quality and light intensity on plant growth and functional chemical yields [

 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> plant was selected to investigate whether the different LED lights treatments and combined light conditions can accumulate or suppress on some main growth and morphological characteristics of 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> including plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves and roots, root length, leaf area, cell width, cell length, and dry matter. The fluorescent lamp (FL) was used as the control because FL often shows a wide frequency wavelength ranged from 405 to 579 nm and was reported to both promptly and greatly enhance the growth of many plant species [

Our LEDs and combined lights were accurately designed following conditions: mono-wavelength (1) red (630 nm); (2) blue (465 nm), and mixed-wavelength; (3) BR (20% B light and 80% R light); (4) BRW 151 (13.8% B light, 72.4% R light, and 13.8% white light); and (5) BRW142 (13.8% B light, 58.6% R light, and 27.6% W light).
