<p>In this present study, firstly, we have observed the differences in growth and morphological characteristics of 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> explants cultured in vitro among the different light and combined light conditions. Except for the increase in plant height, the mono-wavelength of blue and red light was significantly inhibited the growth biomass of 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> plant from comparing with the control (FL) (

 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that the stem of 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> was shorter under the blue light treatment. The highest cell width was found under the blue treatment, while red light inhibited the cell width (

Our results were consistent with some previous results revealed that red light (620–630nm) greatly affected plant elongation. Numerous plant species showed skotomorphology, when cultured under red light (630 nm), which could be seen with weak and elongated stem [

 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> leaves. These results disclosed that the mono-wavelength (630 nm) of red light caused an extremely adverse influence on the stem’s morphology. With the combination of blue, red, and white light, the balance was recovered; abnormal morphologies were reduced. Interestingly, our findings found that the BR showed significant enhancement in both growth and biomass accumulation (
