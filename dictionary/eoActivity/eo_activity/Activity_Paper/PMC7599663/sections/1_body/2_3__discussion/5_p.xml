<p>Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (
 <italic>pal</italic>) encoded by the 
 <italic>pal</italic> gene is the first enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway. It involves the synthesis of both polyphenols and lignin in plants. Numerous studies showed that the 
 <italic>pal</italic> gene might be induced by light [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01344" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the transcription is also controlled by many transcription factors (TFs) involved in the lignin synthesis in plants, for instance: MYB TFs (AtMYB46, AtMYB 83, and MYP156) [

Previous works have also shown that there might be a regulatory mechanism existed in order to ensure the balance between lignin and flavonoid synthesis in plants. RNAi mutation of lignin synthesis in Arabidopsis resulted in not only reduced plant growth but also caused the improvement of flavonoid synthesis. This phenomenon could be reversed by decreasing the synthesis of flavonoids mediated via silencing chalcone synthase encoding gene (

 <italic>pal</italic> level may not significantly affect on the flavonoid accumulation, which might be controlled by other key enzymes at different branches in the pathway. The results obtained in this research showed that, although the expression of 
 <italic>pal</italic> gene in all experiment LED lights were declined as compared to the control, the total flavonoid content in plants under BR LED was still higher than that in other lighting conditions (
