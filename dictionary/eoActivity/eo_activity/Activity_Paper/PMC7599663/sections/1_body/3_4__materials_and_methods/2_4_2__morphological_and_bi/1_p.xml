<p>For measurements of the morphological characteristics, 30 random plants were selected from each treatment. Plant height, stem diameter (3rd node), leaf numbers, leaf area, root length, root numbers, fresh weight, and dry weight were measured. Briefly, the fresh weight was determined by using the electronic balance (Vibra, Japan) and dried to a constant weight under 70 Â°C before dry weight measurement. The stem diameter was recorded using the digital vernier caliper. The root length was measured from the top of the root tip to the main stem. Leaf area was measured by using image analysis method with ImageJ software [
