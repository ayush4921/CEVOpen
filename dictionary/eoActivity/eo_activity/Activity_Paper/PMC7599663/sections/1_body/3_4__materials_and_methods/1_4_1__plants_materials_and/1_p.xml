<p>Two-month-old 
 <italic>A. roxburghii</italic> rooted in vitro plants (with 2 roots, 3 leaves, and about 3 cm in height) were used as the initial materials. Plants were cultivated in hydroponic pots (17 cm long, 12 cm wide, and 7 cm deep) supplemented with 1/10 strength macro and minor salt of Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium. The LED light source was placed at the top of the steel frame structure of the cultivation rack. The distance between the plant canopy and LED lights fluctuated from 40 to 60 cm. The silver shading materials were used to insulate in the different treatments. The relative humidity in the growth room (2m in length × 0.6 m in width) was 80%, and the temperature was in the range of 22–24 °C with 12 h of lighting. The plants were subjected to different LED light for 2 months under following conditions: mono-wavelength (1) red (630 nm), (2) blue (465 nm), and mixed-wavelength, (3) BR (20% B light and 80% R light), (4) BRW 151 (13.8% B light, 72.4% R light, and 13.8% W light), and (5) BRW142 (13.8% B light, 58.6% R light, and 27.6% W light). Fluorescent lamp was a multiple wavelength and was used as the control

All the LED lights, mixed LED lights were ordered as accurate above conditions and designed by Dien Quang Lamp Join Stock Company, Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. The average of light intensity of the distance from the LEDs to the plant canopy was about 30 ± 2.13 µmol.m
