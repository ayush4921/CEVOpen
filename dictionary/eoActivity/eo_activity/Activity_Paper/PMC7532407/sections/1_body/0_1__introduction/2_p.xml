<p>Plants have been a potential source for the discoveries of pharmacological active compounds including enzyme inhibitors that can be used as lead compounds for drug development. Plants can also be used as dietary adjunct to the existing therapy. Studies have evidenced that plant-based bioactive compounds demonstrated efficient inhibition to relevant enzymes associated with metabolic diseases [
