<p>Metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperuricemia have become major public health problems with increasing prevalence worldwide [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These diseases have been known to be related to the development of cardiovascular diseases. In each case, abnormally high enzyme activity is observed, such as 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-glucosidase and xanthine oxidase activities for diabetes mellitus and gouty arthritis, respectively. Enzyme inhibition and the treatment for inflammation, as in the case in gouty arthritis, have become effective clinical approaches for the treatment of these diseases [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Synthetic inhibitors are the first-line drugs prescribed for the management of these disorders, such as acarbose for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), allopurinol for gouty arthritis, and sodium diclofenac for the treatment of inflammation. However, they reportedly cause unfavorable side effects. Acarbose has been associated with abdominal discomfort and hepatotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Allopurinol also presents some adverse effects such as allergy, liver function abnormalities, and nephropathy [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause gastrointestinal and renal toxicities [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great priority to find new enzyme inhibitors that are more affordable and less toxic and have fewer side effects.
