<p>The effect of EEPS and WEPS on DPPH radicals was determined based on a method described previously [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Different concentrations of leaf extracts (3 mL) were prepared, and into each of these solutions was added DPPH solution in ethanol (1 mL). The mixture was vigorously vortexed, thereafter incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 mins. The absorbance was read at 517 nm using a spectrophotometer. BHT and ascorbic acid were used as references, and ethanol was used as a negative control. The percentage of scavenging activity was calculated by the following formula:
