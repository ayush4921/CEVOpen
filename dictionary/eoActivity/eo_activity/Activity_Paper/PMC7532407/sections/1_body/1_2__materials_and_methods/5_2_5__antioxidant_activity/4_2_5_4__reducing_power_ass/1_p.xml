<p>The total antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined by the ferric thiocyanate method as described previously [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Sample solution in water (1 mL) was mixed with phosphate buffer pH 6.6 (0.2 M, 2.5 mL) and potassium ferric cyanide K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub> (1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, 2.5 mL). The mixture was incubated for 20 mins at 50°C. After cooling at room temperature, tricholoracetic acid (10% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, 2.5 mL) was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 mins. The upper layer (2.5 mL) was taken out and mixed with water (2.5 mL) and FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (1% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, 0.5 mL). The absorbance was read at 700 nm. Ascorbic acid (1.56–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was used to generate a standard curve. Results was presented as mg ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE)/gram dried material.
