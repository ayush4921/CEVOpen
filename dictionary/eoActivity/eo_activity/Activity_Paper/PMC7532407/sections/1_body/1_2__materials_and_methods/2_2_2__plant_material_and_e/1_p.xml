<p>The leaves of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> were collected from Tentena, Poso, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, in September 2018. A voucher specimen (KWL017) was deposited. The ethanol extract of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> (EEPS) was prepared by macerating 50 g of powdered dried leaves in 500 mL ethanol at room temperature for 3 days in the dark. Following filtration, the solvent was dried under reduced pressure by a rotary evaporator (BUCHI Labortechnik AG, Switzerland). The obtained extract was kept at 4°C in darkness for further analysis. The water extract of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> (WEPS) was prepared using 2 g of powdered dried leaves which was decocted in 200 mL of boiled deionized water. The mixture was continuously stirred, and the temperature was kept at 90°C to a final volume of 100 mL. After filtration, the clear filtrate was freeze-dried and kept at 4°C until used. The residue was used to prepare stock sample solution in ethanol for various analysis.
