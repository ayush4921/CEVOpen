<p>DNA protection effect was performed to evaluate the ability of EEPS to protect DNA from free radical-induced damage. The approach used in the present study was based on plasmid DNA breakage due to exposure to •OH radicals induced by Fenton reagent. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1</xref> shows the electrophoretic pattern of DNA derived from pBR322 plasmid in the absence and presence of EEPS. Band on lane 7 shows pBR322 plasmid DNA in the absence of Fenton reagent, which was mostly in the supercoiled form with high electrophoretic mobility, as similarly observed in other studies [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Exposure of plasmid DNA to •OH radicals was shown to cause DNA strand breakage as indicated by open circular form with low mobility in electrophoreses (band on lane 1). Bands on lanes 2 to 6 were plasmid DNA treated with EEPS in increasing concentrations (0.11–27.33 mg/mL). Upon increasing addition of EEPS, DNA regained its native forms, as indicated by an increase in supercoiled form, thus suggesting the protective effect of the EEPS. Densitometric analysis further confirmed the recovery of the plasmid DNA due to EEPS addition. Positive linear correlation was observed between EEPS additions and DNA percentage of recovery (

 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Polyphenolics are known to be able to chelate metal ions such as Fe(II) and Cu(II) ions which participate in the formation of •OH radicals [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In particular, several phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs) identified in this study contain polyphenolic structures that may be able to chelate these metal ions, such as isoactoside, forsythoside A and B, scroside E, and campneoside I. In fact, lavandulifolioside, which was identified in our extract, has been evidenced to exert protection effect on DNA
