<p>EEPS and WEPS exhibited potent scavenging activities on DPPH radicals, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> comparable to that of the standard ascorbic acid. Stronger activity was observed for EEPS than WEPS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Scavenging activities found in these extracts are in agreement with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Previously, extract of other part of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> has been reported to have good activity on DPPH radicals. Ethanol wood extract showed to have IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 155 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which was weaker than ethanol leaf extract observed in the present study.
