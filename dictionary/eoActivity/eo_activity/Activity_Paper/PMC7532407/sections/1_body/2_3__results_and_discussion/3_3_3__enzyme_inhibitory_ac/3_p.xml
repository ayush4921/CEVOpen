<p>EEPS was observed to have a potent inhibitory activity on 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase compared to WEPS. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>, the inhibitory activity increased with increasing EEPS concentrations, although a lower activity was obtained than acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 201.31 ± 2.43 and 152.46 ± 8.43 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively). However, it was observed that WEPS had no inhibitory activity on 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase.
