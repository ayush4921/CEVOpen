    "<i>Syzygium nervosum</i>, which belongs to the Myrtaceae plant family, is widely distributed and cultivated in South East Asian countries. The decoction of <i>S. nervosum</i> leaves and flower buds has been consumed regularly as a beverage among the Vietnamese and Chinese communities. In addition, it has also been used in traditional medicine for a variety of purposes, notably for influenza, skin diseases, and digestive conditions. To date, there has been a considerable number of publications on chemical profiling and pharmacological activities of <i>S. nervosum</i> crude extract and pure isolated compounds. Our analysis indicated the characteristic chemical scaffolds and potential bioactivities on cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases of this plant. The review aims to summarize up-to-date past study results and suggest future research direction on this species, in order to promote clinical applications of <i>S. nervosum</i>."
