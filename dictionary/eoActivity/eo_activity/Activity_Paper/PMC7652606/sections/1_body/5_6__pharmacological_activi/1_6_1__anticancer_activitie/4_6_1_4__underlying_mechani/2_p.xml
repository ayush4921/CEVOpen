<p>The past study results indicated that the DMC exhibited anticancer activities via multiple mechanisms of action, including genetic expression of apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bax), enhancing caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities, or ROS scavenging. Further works should be done to understand the biological mechanism of DMC in both cellular and animal setups.</p>
