<p>Choi et al. [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] investigated the antidiabetic effects of DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>) in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. DMC was shown to increase glucose uptake and promote fatty acid oxidation (FAO) via AMPK activation in myotubes; however, the compound was found to inhibit the differentiation of adipocytes in the 3T3-L1 cellular model. In high-fat-diet obese mice, treatment of DMC could improve glucose tolerance, reduce average weight, and increase the oxidation of fatty acids in muscle tissues. The mechanism of action was determined via FAO stimulation, which was mediated by AMPK activation in muscle [
