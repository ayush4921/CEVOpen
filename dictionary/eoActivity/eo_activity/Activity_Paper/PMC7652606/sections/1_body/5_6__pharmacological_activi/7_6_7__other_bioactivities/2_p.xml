<p>The antimicrobial activities of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> were also investigated. The methanol leave extract was tested against six strains of Gram-positive bacteria, two strains of Gram-negative bacteria, and one fungal species. Consequently, the extract (0.1â€‰mg/mL) exhibited inhibitory activities against seven out of nine experimental bacterial species. Furthermore, the extract also showed anticaries activity against 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (dental plaque organism) by inhibiting acid production and biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner [
