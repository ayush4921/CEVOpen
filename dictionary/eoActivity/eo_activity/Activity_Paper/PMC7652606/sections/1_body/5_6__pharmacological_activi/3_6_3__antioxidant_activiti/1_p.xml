<p>Since the major components of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> are flavonoids, the extract and its constituents were also examined for antioxidant activities via different bioassays. The fruit extract of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> was shown to protect the kidney from cadmium-induced oxidative injury in rats. The oral administration of the extract (0.5–2.0 g/kg) clearly reduced the levels of blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine, which resulted in the restoration of creatinine clearance, in comparison with the cadmium alone-treated group. Histopathological examination also evidenced the protective effects of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> fruit extract (1-2 g/kg) against cadmium intoxication, specifically the diminishment of severe tubular necrosis, vacuolar degeneration, and glomerular structural changes. Further molecular investigation indicated that the fruit extract of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> reduced the levels of nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and restored the levels of antioxidative enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and nonenzymatic antioxidants (total, free, and protein thiols) [
