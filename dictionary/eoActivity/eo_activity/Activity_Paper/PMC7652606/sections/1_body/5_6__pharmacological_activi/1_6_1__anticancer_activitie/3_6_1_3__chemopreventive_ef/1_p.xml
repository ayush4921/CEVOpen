<p>Treatment of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> fruit (1000â€‰mg/kg) significantly reduced the number and size of glutathione-S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci induced by diethylnitrosamine (a rodent genotoxic compound) and phenobarbital (hepatocarcinogenic promoter), which is an important indicator for early stages of rat liver carcinogenesis. Moreover, the extract also increased remarkably the enzymatic activities of hepatic glutathione peroxidase and catalase, in comparison with the carcinogen-treated group; however, the extract did not affect the activities of glutathione reductase and heme oxygenase in rat liver. The study also suggested that the chemopreventive effects of 
 <italic>S. nervosum</italic> might be due to anthocyanin constituents, which are antioxidant enhancers [
