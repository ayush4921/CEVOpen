<p>The molecular mechanisms of antitumor effects of DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>) on different models were also investigated. In an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study on a solid human tumor xenograft (SMMC-7721) mouse model, DMC with a dose of 150 mg/kg was shown to significantly reduce the average tumor weight in 50 days (DMC group: 0.59 ± 0.12 g; control: 1.42 ± 0.11 g). The study also identified that the lethal dose of DMC was 3800 mg/kg, which can be considered only slightly toxic [

The cytotoxic potential of DMC on human hepatoma cells (SMMC-7721) was determined via inhibiting intracellular ROS level and inducing the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities, and downregulating the expression of Bcl-2 protein. Interestingly, DMC shows almost no toxicity against human normal liver (L-02) and human normal fetal lung fibroblast (HFL-1) cells [

Other studies of anticancer effects of DMC on different cancer cell lines (K562 (leukemia cells) or PANC-1 (pancreatic cancer cells)) also indicated that the chalcone could lower Bcl-2/Bax ratio by decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 gene and activating caspase-3 and caspase-9 [
