<p>To develop new anticancer agents from the DMC backbone, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] synthesized a series of water-soluble DMC analogues with ionizable tertiary amine groups. These synthetic compounds were then tested alone or in a combination with Taxol. Consequently, all DMC synthetic analogues showed strong antiproliferative activities on different cancer cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 1.3 ± 0.16 to 24.7 ± 3.94 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and they also displayed synergistic effects with Taxol against a multidrug-resistant cancer cell line (Hela/Tax). The most promising synergistic effects were quantified by the combination index (CI &lt; 0.15) and dose-reduction index (DRI &gt; 15) [
