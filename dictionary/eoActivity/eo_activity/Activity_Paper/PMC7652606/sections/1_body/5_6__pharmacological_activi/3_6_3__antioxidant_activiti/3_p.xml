<p>As for other constituents, a study conducted by Min et al. [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] indicated that compounds 
 <bold>36</bold> and 
 <bold>52</bold> exhibited potent DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 22.8 and 27.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively, which were comparable to that of positive control, 
 <italic>α</italic>-tocopherol (20.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other flavonoids (
 <bold>35</bold> and 
 <bold>54</bold>) also showed moderate antioxidant effects in different bioassays, including DPPH radical scavenging assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 50.2 ± 2.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 75.8 ± 2.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively), superoxide radical scavenging assay (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 56.3 ± 2.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 317.5 ± 2.9 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively), and lipid peroxidation (64.3 ± 2.5% and 60.3 ± 2.3% inhibition at 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively) [
