<p>Noticeably, Zhang and Lu [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] compared the total polyphenol and DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>) content obtained from different extraction solvents (0, 30, 60, 95% ethanol, petroleum ether, and ethyl acetate extracts). As a result, the total polyphenol content ranked in the order of “aqueous extract &gt; 30% ethanol extract &gt; 60% ethanol extract &gt; 95% ethanol extract &gt; petroleum ether extract &gt; ethyl acetate extract.” The petroleum ether extract contained the highest content of DMC (1.85%), followed by ethyl acetate extract (1.14%), 95% ethanol extract (0.75%), 60% ethanol extract (0.59%), 30% ethanol extract (0.23%), and aqueous extract (not detected). The authors also pointed out the close relation between pancreatic 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory effects and total polyphenol content; however, the content of DMC (
 <bold>38</bold>) was determined to be a decisive factor for inhibitory activity on pancreatic lipase [
