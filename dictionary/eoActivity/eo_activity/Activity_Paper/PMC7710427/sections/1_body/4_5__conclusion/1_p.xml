<p>In conclusion, the new dosage forms preparation and the chemical structure modification of OA can improve the bioavailability and expand the scope of application, which are two effective ways to design and develop new drugs. Although the methods have made great progress, there are still some problems that need further research and exploration. For example, there are few innovative studies, the modified dosage form has not been biologically tested, and the activity of the obtained derivative has been decreased or no significant improvement. In the future research, we should make clear the purpose of the experiment, learn from the predecessors' experience, and study the necessary functional groups, pharmacophore, and unnecessary substituents, so as to carry out accurate and reasonable modification. Moreover, with the increasing drug resistance of some bacteria and viruses, the development of new drugs from natural products has become a research craze, and pentacyclic triterpenes have attracted much attention because of their various pharmacological activities. It is noteworthy that oleanolic acid exists widely in nature has strong biological activity and great research potential. It needs more researchers to explore in order to develop products for the benefit of mankind as soon as possible.</p>
