<p>In recent years, it has become a hot spot to modify the A ring of OA and esterify the C-28 position to connect various pharmacophore to study its antitumor activity [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] designed and synthesized a series of OA-cinnamate derivatives using molecular hybridization approach. And the MTT method was used to determine the cytotoxicity of cervical cancer HeLa, breast cancer MCF-7, and normal liver cells L-O2 in vitro. The results showed that 4e (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) on MCF-7 had the strongest selective killing effect, IC

 <italic>μ</italic>M. In addition, compound 6e (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) also showed strong selective inhibitory activity on HeLa cells, IC

 <italic>μ</italic>M. From the above results, we know that the introduction of a benzyl group with a substituent at the C-28 position can enhance its anticancer activity. The 4-methylcinnamic acid linked to the A ring can significantly increase the inhibitory effect of OA on MCF-7 cells.
