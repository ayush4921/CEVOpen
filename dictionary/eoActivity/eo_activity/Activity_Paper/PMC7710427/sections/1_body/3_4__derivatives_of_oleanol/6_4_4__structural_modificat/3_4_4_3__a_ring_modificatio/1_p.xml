<p>In order to improve the oleanolic acid antitumor activity, some researchers have conducted some beneficial explorations. Friedrich [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>] acetylated the C-3 position, and the nitrogen-containing heterocycle at the C-28 position was attached to the scaffold with a cationic functional group to obtain compound 1f (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). And 1f had good cytotoxicity to human breast cancer cell MCF-7, EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Its cytotoxicity is 17 times that of the standard substance betulinic acid and 50 times that of OA, which seems to prove that the type of triterpene acid, the type of amide bond, the type of cationic residue, and its substitution pattern have important meaning for tumor cytotoxicity. Gao [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] discussed the potential antitumor activity of oleanolic acid derivative 2f (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Using cell viability analysis to calculate IC
 <sub>50</sub> for six tumor types, it was found that 2f has a broad antitumor effect and its IC
 <sub>50</sub> on osteosarcoma cells significantly lower than other tumor cells, indicating that it tends to inhibit the growth of osteosarcoma cells. In vivo antitumor experiments in nude mice suggested that 2f can reduce tumor volume and weight and has low toxicity. Given the above results, its molecular mechanism is related to the downregulation of the expression of glycolysis-related enzymes in nude mice.
