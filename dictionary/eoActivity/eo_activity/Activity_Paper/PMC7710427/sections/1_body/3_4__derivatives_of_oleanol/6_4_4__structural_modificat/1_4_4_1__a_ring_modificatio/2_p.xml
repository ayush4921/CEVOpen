<p>Song et al. [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>] designed and synthesized a series of oleanolic acid derivatives and evaluated them as avian influenza virus H5N1 entry inhibitors. Structure-activity relationship (SARs) studies have shown that fine modification with OA as an aglycon has an important effect on antiviral activity. Whether introducing a disubstituted amide structure at C-28 of OA or changing the C-3 configuration of OA from 3
 <italic>β</italic> to 3
 <italic>α</italic>, the OA selectivity index can be significantly improved while maintaining its antiviral activity in vitro. Among these derivatives, compound 2d (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) showed excellent anti-H5N1 activity in the inhibitory activity experiment, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.36 
 <italic>μ</italic>M lower than the positive control CL-385319 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), which can be used as a lead for further development of H5N1 entry inhibitors compound or scaffold. What is more, the inhibitory activity of compounds 3d, 4d, and 5d (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) on H5N1 is similar, indicating that the diversity of pentacyclic triterpene structural framework has no significant effect on its anti-H5N1 activity.
