<p>Hu et al. [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] used oleanolic acid as the leader, introduced oxime ether structure at C-3 position, introduced methyl group and benzyl group, and substituted aromatic hydrocarbon at C-28 carboxyl position to obtain compound 1-3e (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Compounds 1-3e all showed a certain inhibitory activity on glucosamine-6-phosphate synthase (GlmS), but the effect was comparable to OA. Moreover, compounds 1e and 2e showed better bactericidal activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Botrytis cinerea of tomato, and rice blast, which was significantly better than OA, but lower than that of positive control drugs. From this report, it can be seen that OA introduces an oxime ether structure, and esterification at the C-28 position does not significantly improve anti-Glms activity.
