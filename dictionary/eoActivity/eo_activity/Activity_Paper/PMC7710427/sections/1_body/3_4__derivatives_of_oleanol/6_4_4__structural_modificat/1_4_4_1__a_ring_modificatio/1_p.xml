<p>Sommerwerk et al. [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>] synthesized maslinic acid with oleanolic acid, modified with A ring as well as amidated with C-28 to synthesize a series of OA derivatives to study their toxicity and selectivity to human tumor cells. The results showed that the EC

 <italic>μΜ</italic>, the effect was the best. This indicates that the introduction of acetyl groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions, and the presence of (2
