<p>The hepatoprotective effect of oleanolic acid makes it useful as an over-the-counter oral drug in China to treat humans for liver disorders. Not only has an oleanolic acid protective effect on acute chemical liver injury but also it has a protective effect on liver fibrosis and cirrhosis caused by chronic liver diseases [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Its mechanism may be related to an array of gene expression changes, including the Nrf2-, MT-related genes, and transcription factor farne-soid x receptor (FXR) [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Oleanolic acid can cause Nrf2-dependent gene induction by promoting Nrf2 nuclear accumulation, which helps protect the liver from hepatotoxicity induced by acetaminophen [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In later studies, it has been shown that the increased nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 by oleanolic acid is due to the activation of Akt and ERK pathways [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, Yim et al. [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] believed that the hepatoprotective effects are achieved by enhancing the ability of hepatic glutathione regeneration. In addition, Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] designed and synthesized two kinds of OA prodrugs that have obvious protective effect on CCl4-induced liver injury in mice, and the prodrugs improved the safety and efficacy of the parent drug. What is more, some derivatives of OA enhanced the hepatoprotective effects, such as nanosuspensions [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and oleanolic acid-amino acids derivatives [
