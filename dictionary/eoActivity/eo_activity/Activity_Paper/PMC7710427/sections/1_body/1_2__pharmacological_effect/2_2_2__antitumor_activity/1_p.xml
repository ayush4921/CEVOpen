<p>OA is one of the most abundant triterpenoids in plants and possesses antitumor activity in many cancer lines, such as liver cancer [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], thyroid cancer [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], lung cancer [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], cervical cancer [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and gastric cancer [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. At present, there are many reports on the treatment of liver cancer with OA. Studies have shown that the inhibition of cancer cell growth by OA is mediated via suppression of cancer cell migration and invasion, mitochondrial apoptosis, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and deactivation of JNK/p38 signaling pathway [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Yao et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] have proved that OA significantly induced the expression of UGT1As in HepG2, and the induction on UGT1A1 is mediated by PXR activation, not CAR. In addition, studies have found that the OA and autophagy inhibitors combination or the p-glycoprotein inhibition can play a better role in antiliver cancer effect [

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. OA has a large molecular weight and low solubility, which results in low anticancer efficiency. Therefore, researchers have designed a variety of OA derivatives, such as OA/hederagenin-nitric oxide donor hybrid [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], 2-cyano-3, 12-dioxooleana-1, 9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO), and its C-28 modified derivative: methyl-ester (CDDO-Me) [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and a gold (I) complex containing an OA derivative [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Fan et al. [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] demonstrated that OA covered with nanoliposomes led to enhanced anticancer effects by suppressing proliferation, migration, and invasion. In recent antitumor studies, combination therapy has become a hot spot. Some researchers have prepared calcium carbonate (CC) hybrid nanoparticles (HN) decorated with cancer cell membranes (CM) for the delivery of cisplatin (CDDP) and OA. The results showed that compared to free drugs alone or mono systems, it could enhance cell apoptosis and can reverse the cancer cells multidrug resistance [
