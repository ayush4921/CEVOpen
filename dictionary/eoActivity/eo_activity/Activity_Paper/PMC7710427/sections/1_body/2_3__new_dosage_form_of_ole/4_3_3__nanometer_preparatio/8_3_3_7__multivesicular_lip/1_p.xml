<p>Some researchers [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] prepared OA-encapsulated multivesicular liposomes (OA-MVLs) by a double-emulsion method and characterized them. The results showed that the average particle size of OA-MVLs was 11.57 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, the encapsulation efficiency of 82.3% ± 0.61%, zeta absolute potential was -13.35 mv, and polydispersity index was 0.21. In vitro studies showed that OA-MVLs can be better absorbed by HepG2 and enhance the growth inhibitory effect on HepG2 cells. Further in vivo experiments on H22 tumor-bearing mice showed that OA-MVLs have better antitumor effects than OA solution. Especially, OAMVLs had a significant inhibitory effect on the liver cancer cells survival at 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/L but had no significant effect on the normal liver cells viability, which proved that the drug is safe for clinical application.
