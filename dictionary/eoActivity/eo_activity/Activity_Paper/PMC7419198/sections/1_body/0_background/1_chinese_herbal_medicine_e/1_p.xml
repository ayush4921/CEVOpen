<p id="Par7">Professional health care training in Hong Kong, as in China generally, requires university students in medical discipline to be equipped with some basic knowledge and skills in conventional and integrative medicine, particularly Chinese medicine (CM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This training in CM focuses not only on the basic theory and clinical practice of CM, but also on recognizing Chinese medicinal herbs by their appearance in the wild and in CM dispensary, because herbal medicine is the major treatment method in CM. A fundamental course called “Chinese Materia Medica” is currently offered to higher education students in medicine-related disciplines to provide a solid foundation of knowledge on herbal medicine. In our school, “Chinese Materia Medica” is held in Semester 1 (September to December) of the second academic year. It is conducted mainly in a lecture-based form as in traditional instructional design of most universities. While factual knowledge of origins and parts of medicinal plants used are covered, the emphasis of teaching and assessment remains the properties, indications, route of administration and dosage, adverse effects as well as the identification of prepared herbs. Lecturing and demonstration of specimens have limits in cultivating essential skills in macroscopic identification, as well as thorough understanding of properties of herbs.
