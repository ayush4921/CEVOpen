<p id="Par27">All 49 students (27 women and 22 men) participated in the baseline test and briefing session, as well as the subsequent 6-day field trip. These students were then asked to complete a 6-day period of self-study on Moodle after returning to Hong Kong. Forty-nine questionnaires were distributed to the students along with the administration of post-teaching assessment after that. All students completed the post-teaching assessment. While two students finished the post-test without submitting the questionnaires, 47 questionnaires were returned, and 42 of these were complete and valid for analysis. The response rate was 85.7%.</p>
