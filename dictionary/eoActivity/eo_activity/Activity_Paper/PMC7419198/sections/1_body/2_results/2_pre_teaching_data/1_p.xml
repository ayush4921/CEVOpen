<p id="Par28">All the students enrolled in the field trip had completed the “Chinese Materia Medica” course, where they received lectures about the features and recognition of medicinal plants. This background was assumed to provide the necessary knowledge base for the field trip programme. To eliminate confounding factors, we analysed demographic data on students in each group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The gender ratio (male/female) was 10/16 in the 5-year cohort and 12/11 in the 6-year cohort. The “Chinese Materia Medica” course examination scores of the 5-year cohort students did not differ substantially from those of the 6-year cohort students. Because the examination was conducted in the previous semester and the scores might not reflect the current knowledge base of the students, a quiz on the content in the form of a recognition test was also completed by the students prior to the field trip. Fill-in-the-blank questions regarding 15 images of medicinal plants randomly selected from the pool of 64 images for the post-field trip assessment were used in this quiz. There was no significant difference in the baseline test scores of the two groups of students, indicating that students in both groups had minimal knowledge on recognizing medicinal plants in the wild. These data indicate that the students’ characteristics were not confounding variables in this study.
