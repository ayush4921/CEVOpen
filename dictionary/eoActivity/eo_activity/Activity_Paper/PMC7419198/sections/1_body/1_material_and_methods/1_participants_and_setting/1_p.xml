<p id="Par11">In the School of Chinese Medicine at the University of Hong Kong, field trip study programmes have been used for more than 10 years. The field trip is a compulsory summer course for second-year students in the BChinMed programme. The field trip is usually conducted in June, when students have finished the “Chinese Materia Medica” course. The location of the field trip is Kunming in Yunnan Province, which is well known as the “Kingdom of Plants”. A briefing session is held 1 week before the field trip to introduce the activities and requirements of the course. During the field trip, students study herbal plants in the wild under the guidance of teachers who are specialists in herbal plant identification. To complete the requirements of the field trip, students must participate in all the activities arranged by the School and complete the assignments requested by the teachers.</p>
