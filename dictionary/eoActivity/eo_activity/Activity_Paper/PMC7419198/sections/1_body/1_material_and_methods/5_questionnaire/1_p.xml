<p id="Par25">A questionnaire was developed with face validity to evaluate the Moodle course site as a secondary outcome. This 12-item questionnaire evaluated five aspects: overall evaluation, Moodle user experience, activities in Moodle, learning efficacy, and future development. A five-point Likert scale evaluation system was used (5 = strongly agree, 4 = agree, 3 = neutral, 2 = disagree, 1 = strongly disagree). Questions are presented in Table
