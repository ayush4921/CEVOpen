  <p>Computational processes for the generation of latent knowledge, molecular interaction and chemical property features. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Latent knowledge features were obtained by applying the text mining method to the PubMed abstracts. The n-gram features (x1, â€¦, xN) are embedded and averaged to fore the hidden variable. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Molecular interaction features were generated by applying RWR algorithm to the PPI network. The RWR algorithm propagated compound effects from seed nodes (binding information, red circles) to their neighbors, recursively. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Chemical features, including physicochemical properties, lipophilicity, water solubility, pharmacokinetics, druglikeness and medicinal chemistry information, were calculated.
