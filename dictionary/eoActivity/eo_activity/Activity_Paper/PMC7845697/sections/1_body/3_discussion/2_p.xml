<p>Our previous studies have shown that natural compounds have relatively limited chemical and molecular information compared with drugs (

In addition, the combination of various types of information is difficult to consider. Thus, we applied the partially connected deep neural network to solve these problems. Our underlying hypothesis consisted of two parts. First, even if a certain type of information is incomplete, its effect can be mitigated by utilizing many other types of information in the learning process. In general, we believe that the more kinds of information we use, the better we can make the model. But it becomes difficult to consider the heterogeneous characteristics of the information. In addition, as the number of features increases, the number of samples required for learning increases. In other words, using a large number of features does not always improve the performance of the model. The prerequisite for this is that there must be a sufficient amount of samples compared to the number of features. As shown in the results of this study, when a fully connected neural network was trained using complex and heterogeneous features, the performance was rather poor than when fewer features were used. Therefore, this study applied partially connected structure to alleviate the incompleteness of natural compound information by applying heterogeneous and complex characteristics. This approach is meaningful in that it provides directions on how to utilize heterogeneous and complex information on natural compounds in the future study. Second, if a natural compound has similar properties to certain approved drugs, this compound is more likely to have medicinal effects similar to that of the drugs. According to the validation results, the model incorporating various types of information outperformed the models incorporating a single type of information. This indicated that the simultaneous processing of various types of information led to synergy in the deep learning model. If our approach did not mitigate the incompleteness of the information, the performance would have converged to the average of the models using a single type of information. Moreover, it was confirmed that the model trained with drug information can successfully predict the medicinal effects of natural compounds. These results supported our underlying hypothesis.
