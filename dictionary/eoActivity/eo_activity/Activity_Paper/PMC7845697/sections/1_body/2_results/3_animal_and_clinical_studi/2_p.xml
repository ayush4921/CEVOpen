<p>Next, we checked clinical studies. Melatonin may enhance the therapeutic effects of various anticancer drugs (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors may have curative activities in murine models of acute and chronic Chagas disease (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Urbina, 2009</xref>). In patients with chronic stable congestive heart failure, 
 <sc>l</sc>-arginine prolongs the exercise duration (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bednarz et al., 2004</xref>). Reserpine may reduce systolic blood pressure as a first-line antihypertensive drug, as shown in a Cochrane review (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Shamon and Perez, 2016</xref>). Plasma norepinephrine is directly related to muscle sympathetic nerve activity values in hypertensive group (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Grassi et al., 2018</xref>). In a blind placebo-controlled trial, a pyridoxine-doxylamine combination appears to be safe for pregnant women suffering from nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Koren et al., 2015</xref>). RCTs showed that 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> Roscoe, which contains camphene, can be used to alleviate nausea and vomiting in pregnant women with no common side effects (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Stanisiere et al., 2018</xref>). In a randomized double-blind crossover study, the use of oral morphine for pain control led to a reduction in pain intensity relative to placebo use (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Moulin et al., 1996</xref>). Eugenol and carvacrol were shown to induce oral irritation, causing various types of pain (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). A single patch containing methyl salicylate and l-menthol significantly relieved the pain associated with mild to moderate muscle strain (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Higashi et al., 2010</xref>). Laudanosine prevented NADH-linked mitochondrial respiration and complex I activity as a neurotoxin that promotes Parkinsonâ€™s disease (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Morikawa et al., 1996</xref>). Melatonin decreases sleep onset latency, increases total sleep time, and improves overall sleep quality, as shown in a meta-analysis (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Ferracioli-Oda et al., 2013</xref>). One case study revealed that long-term colchicine therapy leads to symptomatic respiratory muscle weakness (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Tanios et al., 2004</xref>). Clopidogrel monotherapy leads to lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events compared with aspirin treatment (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Paciaroni et al., 2019</xref>). Demethylation of 5-Methylcytosine may help in the management of interstitial cystitis (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">Shahid et al., 2018</xref>). Flucytosine may serve as an effective and safe treatment for urinary tract infection (
