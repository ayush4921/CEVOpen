 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>) databases. In this study, we used 4,507 natural compounds and 2,882 approved and investigational drugs that have at least five molecular target information. For extracting latent knowledge from scientific literature, we collected 13,200,786 PubMed abstracts that were published from 1950 to 2019, containing 236,645,741 sentences and 3,689,111,651 words. For the molecular interaction analysis, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) dataset was obtained from BioGrid version 3.5.182, containing 18,008 nodes and 504,848 edges (
