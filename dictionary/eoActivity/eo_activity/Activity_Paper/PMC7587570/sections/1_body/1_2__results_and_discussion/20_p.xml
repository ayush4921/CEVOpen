<p>The obtained identified and unidentified bands on HPTLC plates create a unique pattern of the 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> tincture. As we observed in our unpublished research, three species of the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family (
 <italic>Satureja montana, Salvia officinalis,</italic> and 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>) collected in the same location and analyzed in the same plate create their own unique fingerprints. However, one of the major drawbacks of this study is the evaluation of only one the 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> tincture in the HPTLC method. However, there is an advantage as the analytical procedure is developed and interpreted. This procedure can be supplemented by other species of the 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> family, reference standards, and modified by their concentrations.
