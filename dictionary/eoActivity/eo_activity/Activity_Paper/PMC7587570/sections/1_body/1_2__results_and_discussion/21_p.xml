 <italic>S. montana</italic> L. essential oil was subjected to a detailed analysis to determine its chemical composition. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, 34 compounds were identified. According to the obtained analytical data, 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> had an unusual chemical profile. 
 <italic>p</italic>-Thymol as an isomer of thymol and carvacrol was dominated (about 81.79%) (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04763-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04763-f007">Figure 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04763-f008">Figure 8</xref>). This compound has not been stated earlier in the available scientific publications as the dominant component of the 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> essential oil. Thus, the existence of a special chemotype of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> grown on the experimental plots in the Kherson region was revealed. Among the other components revealed in concentrations more than 1% were linalool (2.09%), 1-octen-3-ol (1.91%), γ-terpinene (1.65%), 
 <italic>o</italic>-cymene (1.26%), 
 <italic>cis-β</italic>-terpineol (1.21%), and terpinen-4-ol (1.07%).
