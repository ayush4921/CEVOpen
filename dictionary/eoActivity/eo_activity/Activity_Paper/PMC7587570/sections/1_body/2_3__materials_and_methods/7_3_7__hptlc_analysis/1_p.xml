<p>HPTLC analysis of phenolic compounds was carried out using the CAMAG analytical system (Muttenz, Switzerland) as described by N. Stanek and I. Jasicka-Misiak [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The reference standards of phenolic compounds were dissolved in methanol in a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with the exception of rutin, quercetin, and (–)-catechin. For these three reference standards, the concentration was 0.1 mg/mL. The tincture and standard solutions in a volume of 10 μL were applied to chromatographic plates (20 cm × 10 cm) using an automatic application device. The mobile phase consisting of chloroform: ethyl acetate: formic acid (5:4:1,
