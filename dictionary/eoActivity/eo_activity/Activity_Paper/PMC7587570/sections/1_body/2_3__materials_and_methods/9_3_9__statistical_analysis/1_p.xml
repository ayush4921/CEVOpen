<p>All analyses for each tincture were carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean value ± standard deviation (SD) or mean value ± relative standard deviation (RSD). Correlation coefficients (r) to determine relationships between values were calculated using MS Excel Software. Achim Buyul and Peter Tsefel’s classification was used to evaluate correlation coefficients (r) between two magnitudes: up to 0.2 is very weak, up to 0.5 is weak, up to 0.7 is medium, up to 0.9 is high and over 0.9 is a very high correlation [
