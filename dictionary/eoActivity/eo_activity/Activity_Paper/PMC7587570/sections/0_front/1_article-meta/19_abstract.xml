 <p>Winter Savory (
  <italic>Satureja montana</italic> L.) has been used in traditional medicine and as a spice or natural food preservative in the Mediterranean region for centuries. In this paper, some technological and analytical aspects of the 
  <italic>S. montana</italic> tinctures development and an evaluation of the essential oil composition are provided. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and phenolic compounds profile analyzed spectrophotometrically and by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), respectively, were evaluated in the developed tinctures. The results showed that the tinctures prepared from the 
  <italic>S. montana</italic> herb by maceration or remaceration are rich in polyphenols, and there is an influence of the technological factors (particle size and extraction mode) on the total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Caffeic, rosmarinic, and chlorogenic acids, (â€“)-catechin and rutin were identified in the tinctures using the HPTLC method. 
  <italic>p</italic>-Thymol (81.79%) revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was the predominant compound of the essential oil of this plant. Thus, the high contents of polyphenols and flavonoids in the developed tinctures and 
  <italic>p</italic>-thymol among the volatile components of the 
  <italic>S. montana</italic> essential oil could indicate the promising antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of these herbal preparations. The obtained results are a ground for the organization of the manufacture of the 
  <italic>S. montana</italic> tincture and essential oil with the purpose of performing preclinical studies.
