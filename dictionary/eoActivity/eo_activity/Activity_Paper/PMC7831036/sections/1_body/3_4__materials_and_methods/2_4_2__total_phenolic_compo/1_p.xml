<p>The total phenolic compounds were quantified using the Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. A standard curve from 1 to 8 μg/mL of gallic acid was used. An aliquot of 10 μL (of the sample or standard) was mixed with 25 μL of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and 125 μL of 2M Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (20 ± 5 °C). The absorbance of samples and standards was recorded at 760 nm. The results were expressed in gallic acid equivalents (GAE mg/g). The ethanolic extract was fractioned with 16 fractions by column chromatography using a silica gel pore size of 60 Å, a 230–400 mesh particle size as the stationary phase and hexane/ethanol as the mobile phase with a concentration gradient from 100 to 0% hexane (Hexane RA, CTR Scientific, Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico). After this, the fraction was evaporated, and the dry extract was stored at −20 °C [
