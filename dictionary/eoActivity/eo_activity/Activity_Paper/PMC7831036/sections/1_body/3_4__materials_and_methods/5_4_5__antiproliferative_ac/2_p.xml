<p>After 48 h, the media were replaced with 100 µL of fresh media supplemented with 10 µL WST-1 [2-(4 iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrofenil)-5-(2,4-disulfofenil)-2
 <italic>H</italic>-tetrazolio] (Merck, Darmstadt; Germany) and incubated for 2 h. The optical density was measured at 450 nm using a Universal Microplate Reader ELx800 (Biotek Instrument, Winooski, Vermont; USA). The WST-1 test determined the viability of the cells, thus allowing a linear regression analysis on the dose response curve in order to determine the IC
