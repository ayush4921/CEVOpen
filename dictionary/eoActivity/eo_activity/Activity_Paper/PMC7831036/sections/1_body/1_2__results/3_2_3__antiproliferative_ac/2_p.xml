<p>To know the potential mechanism of action of the metabolites kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin, found in fraction 14, a bibliographic search and an analysis in SwissTarget Prediction was performed (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/</uri>) [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The results suggested β-tubulin as a potential pharmacological target and, therefore, a molecular docking analysis was carried out. 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00443-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the binding energy values of kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin on the reported active sites of β-tubulin, as well as the values of the reference drugs colchicine, paclitaxel, and vinblastine.
