<p>Based on the above, the ethanol extract was selected for its fractionation and the subsequent determination of its antioxidant capacity. The results showed high equivalent levels of Trolox in fractions 14 and 16 with values greater than 400, and 11 more fractions presented values greater than 300, but less than 400, and the rest of the fractions presented values less than 300. The level of activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrilhidrazil (DPPH) has typically been considered high for crude extracts from
