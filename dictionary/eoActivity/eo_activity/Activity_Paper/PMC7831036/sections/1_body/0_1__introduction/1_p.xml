<p>The genus 
 <italic>Equisetum</italic> (Equisetaceae) includes 15 species of perennial herbs with a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, which mostly inhabit aquatic environments or swamps [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The species 
 <italic>E. hyemale</italic> (L.) and 
 <italic>E. myriochaetum</italic> (Schltdl. &amp; Cham.) (known commonly as horsetails) are widely distributed in Mexico, where their medicinal properties are associated with their consumption [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The medicinal effects associated with this plant include antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiproliferative, and diuretic properties [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The antiproliferative capacity of these species has been limited to 
 <italic>E. arvense</italic> (L.), whose ethanolic extracts showed a cytotoxic effect in the lung carcinoma cell line A549 [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-26-00443" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phytochemical analyses of 
 <italic>E. arvense</italic> showed the presence of saponins, alkaloids, triterpenoids, and flavonoids, which could support its wide spectra of bioactive effects, including its antiproliferative potential [
