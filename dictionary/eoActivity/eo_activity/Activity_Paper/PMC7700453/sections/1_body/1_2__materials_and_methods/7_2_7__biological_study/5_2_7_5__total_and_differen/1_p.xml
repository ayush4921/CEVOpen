<p>Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.1 mL sterile saline and then centrifuged onto slides and stained with Wright-Giemsa for 8 min. Total cell counts were determined using a hemocytometer. Differential cell counts were quantified by counting a total of 200 cells per slide at 40 Ã— magnification. Number of each cell type was calculated as the percentage of cell type multiplied by the total number of cells in the BALF.</p>
