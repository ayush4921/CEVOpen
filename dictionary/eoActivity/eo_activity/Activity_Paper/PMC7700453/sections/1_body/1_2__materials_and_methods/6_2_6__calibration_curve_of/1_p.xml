<p>A weight of 10 mg of each isolated phenolic compound was transferred to a volumetric flask and dissolved in 10 mL methanol. Serial dilutions were prepared in methanol to achieve concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 ng/μL. Each calibration level was analyzed in triplicate. Each compound was injected separately by applying scan mode DAD from 190–500 nm. The UV-VIS scan of each compound was saved and matched with the detected compounds in each sample.</p>
