<p>The HPLC system consists of an Agilent 1260 system, solvent delivery module, quaternary pump, autosampler, column compartment, and diode array detector (Agilent Technologies, Germany). The control of the HPLC system and data processing were performed using ChemStation (Rev. B.01.03 SR2 (204)). The separation was performed on Kromasil 100 C18, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm column (Teknokroma, S. Coop. C. Ltd., Barcelona, Spain), maintained at 25 ± 2 °C. The LC system was programmed to deliver the mobile system as follows: Diode array detector (DAD): 284, 330, and 360 nm; 
 <bold>mobile A</bold>: 0.2% formic acid in water; 
 <bold>mobile B</bold>: acetonitrile; gradient elution program: 0–10 min, 5% B; 10–60 min, 5%–38% B; 60–61 min, 38%–100% B; 61–65 min, 100% B; 65–66 min, 5% B; run time, 72 min; flow rate, 0.9 mL/min.
