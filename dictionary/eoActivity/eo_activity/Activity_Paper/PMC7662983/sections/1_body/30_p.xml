<p>Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05131" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] determined the processes and mechanisms of intestinal absorption of capilliposide B and C from 
 <italic>Lysimachia capillipes</italic> Hemsl. Mechanisms involve processes such as facilitated passive diffusion, efflux transporters, and enzyme-mediated metabolism. Both capilliposides were suggested to be substrates of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2. Capilliposide B may interact with the CYP3A4 system.
