 <italic>Canarium tramdenum</italic> bark. Five different extracts were chemically characterized, revealing that 
 <italic>C. tramdenum</italic> fruit possesses phenols and terpenoids, which might contribute to reducing risks from diabetes. A high quantity of α- and β-amyrins highlighted the potentials of anti-inflammatory, anti-ulcer, anti-hyperlipidemic, anti-tumor, and hepatoprotective properties of
