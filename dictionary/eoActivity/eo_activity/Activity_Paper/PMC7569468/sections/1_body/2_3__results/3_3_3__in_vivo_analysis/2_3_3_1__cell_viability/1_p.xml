<p>For the cell lines, the effect of the six extracts on three concentrations (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were evaluated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These extracts did not have any effect on cell viability at any of the three concentrations analysed. However, for the ME and WEE, a reduction in cell viability for nontumour cells of approximately 25%-35% was observed (ME at 250 or 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and for WEE at 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, for tumour cell lines, in general, there was no significant change in cell viability. A reduction in cell viability ranging 10-25% for HE, CE, and WE was observed for HeLa and SiHa cell lines (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, in general for nontumour and tumour cell lines, 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts were not cytotoxic to the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> cell line model.
