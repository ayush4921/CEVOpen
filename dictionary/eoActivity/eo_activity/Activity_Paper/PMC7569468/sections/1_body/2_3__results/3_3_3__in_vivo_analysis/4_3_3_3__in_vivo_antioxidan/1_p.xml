<p>Because the EE and WE extracts did not have toxic effects on egg hatching and embryo development, these extracts were investigated for their 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antioxidant effects in 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. For these assays, wild animals (N2) were used and were treated with EE and WE at 1 and 10 mg/mL. Subsequently, these worms were analysed for survival under oxidative stress conditions (treatment with 
 <italic>tert-butyl hydroperoxide</italic> (t-BOOH)). An increased tolerance against oxidative stress conditions promoted by t-BOOH treatment was observed with EE and WE treatments (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(b)</xref>). For the control animals in the EE treatments, the average survival time was 7.5 h, compared with an average survival time of 10.5 h with EE (1 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL), indicating an increase of 28.6% (
