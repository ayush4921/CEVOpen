<p>The HPLC-DAD showed several peaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which were evaluated at different UV spectra (228–352 nm). When compared to standards, peak #2 corresponded to gallic acid (tr = 2.000—280 nm), peak #16 corresponded to 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid (tr = 10.257—280 nm), and peak #19 to vitexin (tr = 13.576—280-352 nm). The presence of vitexin was in agreement with the TLC data.
