<p>Pearson coefficient analyses showed a positive correlation between the phenolic compound content of the 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts and the antioxidant assays. There was a strong correlation between TAC and reducing power assay (Sup. Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">1</xref>), and a moderate correlation with superoxide radical scavenging. Furthermore, the sugar content presented a very strong correlation for reducing power assay and TAC and a moderate correlation with superoxide radical scavenging (Sup. Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">1</xref>).
