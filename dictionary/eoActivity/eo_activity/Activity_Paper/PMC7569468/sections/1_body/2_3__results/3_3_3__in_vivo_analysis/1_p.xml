<p>The data from the antioxidant assays described above prompted us to perform antioxidant assays 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, before carrying out these assays, it was necessary to assess the toxic potential of these extracts to rule out a possible harmful effect on the animals used in the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. Then, their effects on the nontumour cells 3T3 and five tumour cell lines, HeLa, SiHa, PC-3, B16-F10, and PANC-1, were analyzed. After that, 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> was used as the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> model.
