<p>To prevent light degradation, the flask was covered with aluminum foil. Then, it was placed on a shaker table at 150 rpm for 24 h at 24°C (Tecnal Shacker). The extract was filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper. Leaves were transferred back to the flask with the next solvent following the seriated extraction under the same conditions. The extracts were dried in a rotaevaporator (Tecnal–TE 210) at 40°C. The extracts were recovered into 1% DMSO (Merck), then lyophilized (Labconco FreeZone 4.5). All extracts were resuspended into water at a final concentration of 100 mg/mL (stock extract) and kept at -18°C until use.</p>
