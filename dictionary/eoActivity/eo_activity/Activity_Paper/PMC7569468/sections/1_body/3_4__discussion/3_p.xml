<p>The results obtained here showed excellent antioxidant potential for EE, ME, WEE, and WE, especially for reducing power and DPPH free radical scavenging. TAC showed higher antioxidant activity for EE and ME. DPPH evaluated the ability of a sample to scavenge DPHH free radicals, and both reducing power and TAC assays analysed the ability of the sample to donate electrons. Gusman et al. [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] observed antioxidant activity using the DPPH assay for 
 <italic>C. cereifera,</italic> and antioxidant activity using DPPH has also been observed for other species from Polygonaceae such as 
 <italic>Rumex japonicus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and 
 <italic>Polygonum maritimum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These species have been used in traditional medicine in Asia, Europe, and Africa, reinforcing the data obtained here for 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic>. The antioxidant potential may be associated with phenolic compounds as well as sugars present in the extract, as shown by Pearson's correlations. The sugars identified may be associated with phenolic compounds that are linked to sugar molecules, such as flavonoid glycosides, condensed tannins, and glycoside triterpenes, which may explain the presence of sugars in 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The antioxidant potential observed for these extracts may be associated with different bioactive molecules that might act to scavenge free radicals and reduce the ROS effects on cells, consequently maintaining the balance between production and degradation [
