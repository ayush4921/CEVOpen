<p>For 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic>, in the present study, phenolic compounds such as gallic acid, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, vitexin, and isovitexin were observed, and HPLC-DAD showed that there are many other compounds to be identified. These extracts may have other bioactive molecules, which may act synergistically with phenolic compounds, resulting in oxidative protection, which reduces ROS effects and helps to maintain the redox balance (ROS production versus ROS degradation) in cells and tissues [
