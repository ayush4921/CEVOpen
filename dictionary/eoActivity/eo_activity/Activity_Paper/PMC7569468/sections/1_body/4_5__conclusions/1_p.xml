<p>Five 
 <italic>Coccoloba alnifolia</italic> leaf extracts were obtained by serial extraction (using apolar solvents to polar solvents), and the sixth extract was made with only water (based on traditional folk use). The data obtained here show that these extracts contain phenolic compounds, terpenes, saponins, and flavonoids (vitexin and isovitexin). In 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, four polar extracts, EE, ME, WEE, and WE, were shown to be sources of antioxidant molecules. In general, these extracts did not affect the viability of six different mammalian cell lines. Moreover, EE and WE did not affect the fecundity of 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nematodes used as a test model and protected them against the t-BOOH stressor, increasing their life span. Therefore, 
 <italic>Coccoloba alnifolia</italic> leaves have excellent potential for the development of herbal medicines and as antioxidant products. Other biological activities may also be explored to determine how the potential antioxidants act in cells.
