 <italic>Coccoloba alnifolia</italic>, popularly known as “pau-de estalo” or “cabuçu,” is one of the endemic Brazilian species of this genus. Despite all these uses in traditional folk medicine, there is no scientific information about the secondary metabolite composition of 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> nor about their possible biological activities. The goal of this study was to characterise the chemical composition and the antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Five leaf extracts were obtained through a serial extraction (using apolar solvents to polar solvents), and the sixth extract was made with only water (based on folk use). In general, these extracts did not affect the viability of six different mammalian cell lines. In addition, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays showed four polar extracts, EE, ME, WEE, and WE, which were sources of antioxidant molecules. Moreover, EE and WE extracts did not affect the fecundity of 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nematodes used as a test model. Therefore, 
 <italic>Coccoloba alnifolia</italic> leaves have excellent potential for the development of herbal medicines and as antioxidant products.
