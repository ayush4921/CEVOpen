 <p>The genus 
  <italic>Coccoloba</italic> is widely used in traditional folk medicine, but few scientific data exist for this genus. The goal of this study was to characterise the chemical composition and antioxidant activities of 
  <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> leaf extracts using 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. Six extracts were obtained: hexane (HE), chloroform (CE), ethanol (EE), methanol (ME), water end extract (WEE), and water extract (WE). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis showed the presence of phenols, saponins, terpenes, and flavonoids. 
  <italic>In vitro</italic> assays demonstrated substantial antioxidant potential, especially for polar extracts (EE, ME, WEE, and WE). Moreover, no toxic effects were observed on mammalian cell lines for most of the extracts at the concentrations evaluated. The nematode 
  <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> was also used as an 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> model for testing antioxidant potential. The EE and WE were chosen, based on previously obtained results. It was observed that neither the EE nor the WE had any toxic effect on 
  <italic>C. elegans</italic> development. Additionally, the antioxidant potential was evaluated using 
  <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide as a stressor agent. The EE increased the life span of 
  <italic>C. elegans</italic> by 28% compared to that of the control, and the WE increased the range to 39.2-41.3%. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) showed the presence of gallic acid, 
  <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, and vitexin in the WE. Therefore, 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> data demonstrated the antioxidant potential of 
  <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts and their possible biotechnological applications.
