  <p>Percentage of the hatched eggs of 
   <italic>C. elegans</italic> treated with extracts of 
   <italic>C. alnifolia</italic>. The 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis corresponds to the treatments with ethanol (EE) and water extract (WE) at 0 mg/mL (control), 1 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL. The 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis corresponds to the percentage egg hatching. Data were obtained in quintuplicate, and they were analysed by an ANOVA and Tukey's test with significance set at 
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.05.
