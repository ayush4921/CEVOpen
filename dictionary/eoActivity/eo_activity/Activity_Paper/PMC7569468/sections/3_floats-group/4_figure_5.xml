 <caption>
  <p>Schematic representation from an interactome using String 10 version 11. This interactome showed the possible gene targets from vitexin and isovitexin, phenolic compounds presented at 
   <italic>C. alnifolia</italic> extracts. The data obtained from KEEG were used to build a network using String 10 version 11. Each circle corresponds to a gene; the lines indicate how these genes are connected. The blue lines indicate the curated database, pink lines indicate the determined experimentally, yellow lines indicate the data from text mining, black lines indicate the coexpression, and green line indicates a gene neighbourhood.
