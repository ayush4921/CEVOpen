<p>Total ﬂavonoid content of ethanol and aqueous extracts of PHAF was determined using the aluminium chloride method in 96-well microplates [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with some modifications. Absorbance was recorded at 415 nm and quercetin was used to construct the standard curve. TFCs of ethanol and aqueous extracts of PHAF were expressed as mg quercetin equivalents per gram of extract on a dry weight basis.
