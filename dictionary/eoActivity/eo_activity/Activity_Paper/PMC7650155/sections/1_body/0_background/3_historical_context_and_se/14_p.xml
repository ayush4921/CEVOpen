<p id="Par25">Although the Peruvian balsam trees produce sap the entire year, the sap is most abundant in the dry season, in summer.

He describes the process of recovering the sap as follows: the gatherers make rectangular holes in the bark of the tree, between 25 to 28 holes of 15 to 16 cm in depth. For 5 to 8 days, the sap flows slowly, but steadily. The natives use very clean cloth to collect it.
