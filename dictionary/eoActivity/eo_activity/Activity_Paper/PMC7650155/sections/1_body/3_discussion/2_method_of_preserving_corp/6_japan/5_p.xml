<p id="Par83">Yoshio Shunzō 吉雄俊藏 (1787–1843) translated a manual written for physicians on board of ships by the seventeenth-century Dutch official surgeon, Jan Kouwenburg, 
 <italic>Shinyaku Oranda neikai yōhō</italic> 新譯和蘭內外要方 (New Translation of the Essential Methods of Dutch Internal Medicine and Surgery; 1820) that also explicitly refers to balsam of Peru (拔爾撒謨百露比亞泥) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. In the nineteenth century, in contrast to China, interest continued unabated. In the 1820s, Udagawa Genshin 宇田川玄真 (1769–1834) and Udagawa Yōan 宇田川榕菴 (1798–1846) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>] translated and annotated 
 <italic>Ensei ihō meibutsukō</italic> 遠西醫方名物考 (A Study of Far-Western Medicinal Recipes and Notable Things) that provides even more information on the Peruvian balsam: “Bo’ersamo Poli, also called 
 <italic>barusamu peruviana</italic> in Latin, and 
 <italic>zuid indiaanse balsam</italic> in Dutch” (拔爾撒謨孛露 又「バルサム.ペルビアニ」羅「スワテ.インデアーンセ.バルセム」蘭). They describe the tree and also its medicinal uses and indications: it strengthens the nerves, prevents decomposition, can be used as a laxative, with cleaning functions, to sweat out excretions, can dissipate cold tuberculosis and is also effective against pneumoconiosis, asthma, gonorrhoea and other deficiency diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. This is definitely the most detailed and also the most up-to-date description about the balsam of Peru (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a–c</xref>). In the later nineteenth century, one continues to encounter relatively frequent references to the Peruvian balsam and its medicinal properties and uses in Japanese medical literature—quite in contrast to China, where the knowledge that had existed during the Ming, early and high Qing seems to have been almost lost, as the following example may show.
