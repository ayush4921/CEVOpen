<p>The tropical rain forests of Borneo are one of the global hotspots for plant biodiversity, many of which have traditional uses. Although there is no specific information on ethnobotanical uses for 
 <italic>Goniothalamus longistipetes</italic> which can be attributed to the rareness of this endemic species, other more widespread species of the genus 
 <italic>Goniothalamus</italic> from the Annonaceae family are known to possess ethnobotanical uses in Borneo including as folkmedicines [

 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00913" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have reviewed 
 <italic>Goniothalamus</italic> phytochemistry for antibacterial properties and both noted that the genus was poorly studied but with potential for antibacterial compounds whilst the main phytochemicals isolated were styryllactones [

 <italic>Goniothalamus longistipetes</italic> for these activities and report the structures and potential antibacterial action of the compounds.
