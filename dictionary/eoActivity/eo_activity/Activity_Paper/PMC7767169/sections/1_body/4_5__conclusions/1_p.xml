<p>This study highlighted the potential of bioactive compounds from 
 <italic>Goniothalamus longistipetes</italic> with reasonably good activities as drug ‘hits’. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> as well as 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> can be further optimized especially against the slow-growing mycobacterium and Gram-positive bacterial strains respectively whilst the broad-spectrum compound 
 <bold>4</bold> deserves further investigation and development for its inhibitory activities on the 3 key resistance determinants.
