<p>Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> exhibited more toxicity to the eukaryotic cell-line (RAW 264.7) compared to bacterial cells (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00913-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>: selectivity indices/S.I. &lt; 1) except for 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG, a slow-growing model of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. We can infer from this result that compound 
 <bold>1</bold> is selective (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00913-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>: selectivity indices/S.I. = 4) in inhibiting slow-growing mycobacterial growth. Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was found to be selective for inhibiting growth of all strains of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00913-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>: selectivity indices/S.I. = 3.91) used in this study. Whereas compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was found to be equally toxic to the eukaryotic cell when it was tested against the Gram-negative and mycobacterial species. Interestingly, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> was selectively potent (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00913-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>: selectivity indices/S.I. = 3.91) against the 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> strain. Compound 
 <bold>4</bold> displayed the best selective inhibitory growth against the Gram-positive and acid-fast strains (
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00913-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>: selectivity indices/S.I. = 16â€“32). In this whole-cell drug susceptibility assay, the mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) was used for the evaluation of toxicity against eukaryotic cells.
