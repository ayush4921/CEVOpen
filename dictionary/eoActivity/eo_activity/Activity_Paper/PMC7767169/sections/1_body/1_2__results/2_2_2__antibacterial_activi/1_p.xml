<p>Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> showed broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activities against Gram-positive, Gram-negative as well as acid-fast mycobacterial strains selected for this study, while 
 <bold>2</bold> demonstrated activities only against Gram-positives and a strain of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> sp. 
 <bold>3</bold> exhibited specific inhibitory activities against Gram-positive bacterial strains. The anti-bacterial activities of all the compounds and their respective selective indices are listed in 
 <xref rid="antibiotics-09-00913-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For the broth dilution assay for Gram-positive and negative-bacteria, inhibitors were serially (2-fold) diluted with a starting concentration of 512 µg/mL whilst for the acid-fast mycobacterial strains, a serial dilution ranging from 500 µg/mL to 0.0224 µg/mL was carried out.
