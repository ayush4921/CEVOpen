<p>Because there is a correlation between efflux pumps and inhibition of biofilm, inhibitors of efflux pumps could potentially act as inhibitor of biofilm formation. By understanding the roles that efflux pumps play in biofilm formation, it is possible that novel therapeutic strategies can be developed to inhibit and interfere with biofilms and therefore improve the treatment of bacterial infections [
