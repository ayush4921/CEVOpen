<p>In this study, two phenolic acids, syringic acid and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid, were identified by HPLC, which had not been identified from RTL in the past. Previously, vanillic acid was isolated from an RTL extraction utilizing EA [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, our present study did not identify vanillic acid from the fractions of RTL. It is speculated that when this compound cannot be identified, it is due to too little content or the extraction method that was used.
