<p>Previous studies have identified more than sixty compounds in RTL. The compounds obtained by separation and purification are mainly flavonoids, triterpenes, and steroids also containing long-chain fatty acids, alkaloids, and lignans [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, there remains a void in the literature regarding the role of these potent RTL compounds alleviating hepatic glucose uptake. Therefore, we aimed to screen the best glucose uptake activity of TNF-
