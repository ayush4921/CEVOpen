<p>The FL83B cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and then incubated at 37°C for 48 h to achieve 80% confluences. Serum-free medium containing 20 ng/ml recombinant mouse TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was added before incubating for 16 h to induce IR. The cells were then transferred to another F12K medium containing 5 mm glucose, without (basal) or with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>m insulin and 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l different RTL fractions and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. An assay of glucose uptake was then performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The fluorescence intensity of the cell suspension was evaluated using flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Bellport, NY, USA) at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 542 nm. Fluorescence intensity reflected the cellular uptake of 2-NBDG.
