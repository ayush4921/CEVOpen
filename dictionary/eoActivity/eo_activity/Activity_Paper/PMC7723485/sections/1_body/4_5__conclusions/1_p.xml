<p>Sephadex LH20 gel and MCI gel were used to separate the EA layer of RTL. An evaluation of the glucose uptake in IR-induced FL83B hepatocytes showed that EAF5-5 demonstrated the best activity for improving cell glucose uptake. These activities were eventually linked by HPLC to two phenolic compounds—syringic acid and 
 <italic>p-</italic>coumaric acid—and the flavonoid compound cirsimaritin. Among the three compounds that significantly improved the activity of cellular glucose uptake, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid was the active ingredient with the best effect of increasing glucose uptake although its effect was still not as good as the combined effect of all three compounds and the EAF5-5 fraction. Thus, we speculate that the antidiabetic effect of RTL may be the result of multiple active ingredients, but additional research is needed to confirm this.
