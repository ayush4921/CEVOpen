<p>An evaluation of the 2-NBDG uptake was performed to assess the improvement of glucose uptake in FL83B hepatocytes. Compared with the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>-treated group, the fluorescence content of the two fractions of EAF5 and EAF7 was significantly increased, and the fluorescence intensity was 93.3 ± 5.4% and 88.9 ± 2.8% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), respectively. The EAF5-treated group demonstrated the best improvement in glucose uptake in the IR-induced FL83B hepatocytes. Thus, EAF5 was used for the following examinations (
