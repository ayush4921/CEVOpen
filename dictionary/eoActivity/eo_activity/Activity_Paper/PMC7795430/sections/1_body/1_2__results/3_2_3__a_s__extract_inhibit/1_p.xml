<p>To further evaluate if A.S. extract could inhibit NF-κB signaling and IL-2 expression, its effects on PMA and PHA (PMA/PHA)-induced phosphorylation of p65, a mediator of NF-κB signaling, and IL-2 mRNA expression and secretion were measured. The level of mRNA expression and production of IL-2 was measured based on previous studies (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00035">Figures S1 and S2</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00035-f004">Figure 4</xref>A, A.S. extract inhibited PMA/PHA-induced nuclear expression of phosphorylated p65 and endogenous p65. In addition, PMA/PHA-induced IL-2 mRNA expression decreased even in the low-dose A.S. treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00035-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) and PMA/PHA-induced IL-2 secretions in the culture medium were dose-dependently suppressed by A.S. treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00035-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). These results showed that A.S. extract suppressed the expression and secretion of IL-2 mRNA via the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway in T-ALL Jurkat cells.
