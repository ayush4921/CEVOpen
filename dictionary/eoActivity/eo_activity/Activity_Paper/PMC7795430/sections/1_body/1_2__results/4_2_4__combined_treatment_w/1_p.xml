<p>Cell viability and IL-2 mRNA expression were additionally tested to assess if combined treatment with A.S. extract and tyrosine kinase inhibitors would have synergistic effects in Jurkat cells. To elucidate the synergism of combined treatment, we measured cell viability and calculated combination index (CI) values representing the effects of the combined agents on the cell viability of Jurkat cells, with CI values of one indicating an additive effect and less than one indicating a synergistic effect. As shown in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00035">Figure S3</xref>, co-treatment with A.S. extract and axitinib or dovitinib showed a synergistic effect on the viability of Jurkat cells. In addition, co-treatment with axitinib or dovitinib showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on the expression of IL-2 compared to the group of A.S. extract only (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00035-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that A.S. has an inhibitory effect on the expression of IL-2 mRNA through the inhibition of NF-ÎºB signaling. In addition, combination therapy with A.S. extract and conventional tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as axitinib and dovitinib can be used to inhibit T-ALL cell survival and IL-2-relevant immune responses.
