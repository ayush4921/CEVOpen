<p>Jurkat cells were pretreated for 3 h with A.S. extract alone or combined with axitinib or dovitinib, followed by a 1 h incubation with PMA (50 ng/mL) plus PHA (1 μg/mL) in culture media (5% FBS). Total RNA was isolated using the AccuPrep
 <sup>®</sup> RNA Extraction Kit (Bioneer Corp., Daejeon, Korea), and cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng total RNA using the iScript
 <sup>TM</sup> cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using iQ™ SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and the CFX96
 <sup>TM</sup> Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, Sacramento, CA, USA). Cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The following primers were used: IL-2 forward, 5′-ACTTTCACTTAAGACCCAGGGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-AGTGTTGAGATGATGCTTTGACA-3′; GAPDH forward, 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′ and reverse, 5′-GATCTCGCTCCTGGAAGATG-3′. All reactions were performed in triplicate, and the data were analyzed using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method [
