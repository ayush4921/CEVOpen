  <p>A.S. extract inhibits NF-κB signaling mediated IL-2 expression in T-ALL Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were treated with A.S. extract phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (50 ng/mL) plus phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) (1 μg/mL) together for 6 (
   <bold>A</bold>), 3 (
   <bold>B</bold>), or 24 h (
   <bold>C</bold>). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Expressions of p65 and its phosphorylated form were measured by Western blot, with actin as a loading control. The detected band intensities were quantified based on ImageJ software, and the relative ratio between nucleic proteins was normalized by lamin B1. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Jurkat cells were pretreated with A.S. extract for 3 h and then treated with PMA (50 ng/mL) plus PHA (1 μg/mL) together for 3 h. Relative IL-2 mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR analysis using the 2
   <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method. (
   <bold>C</bold>) IL-2 concentration in culture medium of Jurkat cells was treated for 24 h with PMA (50 ng/mL) plus PHA (1 μg/mL) together with A.S. extract. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Data are presented as mean ± SD. *
