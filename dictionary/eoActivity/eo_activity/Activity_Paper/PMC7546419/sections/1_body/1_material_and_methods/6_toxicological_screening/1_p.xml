<p>The acute toxic effect of chloroform fraction and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) was performed in mice of both sexes as per our standard method (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Rauf et al., 2016a</xref>). To find the toxicological profile of the extract and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>), mice were starved for 16 h earlier to the experiment. All animals were divided into various groups (
 <italic>n = 6</italic>). Group I (Control group) was fed with normal saline (10 ml/kg). The remaining animals were treated with chloroform fraction in various doses (50, 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg, (p.o.) and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) at (10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 mg/kg, (p.o.). Treated mice were then allowed free access to water and food and were noted for gross behavior change as well as mortality for 24 h.
