  <p>HBV life cycle and therapeutic targets. HBV life cycle: adsorption, penetration, biosynthesis, assembly, and secretion; therapeutic targets: entry inhibitors (NTCP and HSPG as the receptor-virus binding), cccDNA inhibitors (inhibiting the information of cccDNA), Epi-drugs (inhibiting the viral RNA synthesis), endoplasmic reticulum inhibitors (inhibiting the viral capsid assembly), and glucosidese inhibitors (inhibiting the secretion of HBV proteins).</p>
