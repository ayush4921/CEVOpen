<p>The analogue of isosteviol, NC-8 (
 <bold>155</bold>), had anti-HBV activity by inhibiting the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg, with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.89 g/mL, which was better than that of the positive control (lamivudine). The mechanism of NC-8 was interfering with HBV replication and gene expression and blocking the TLR2/NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>b signaling pathway of host cells. It is for the first report of isosteviol analogues against HBV [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>] got a series of new derivatives, including the IN-4 (
 <bold>156</bold>) with high anti-HBV activity. The mechanism might be that IN-4 suppressed the expression of HBV gene and the replication of HBV-DNA by interfering with the NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathways of host cell.
