<p>Scoparamide A (
 <bold>157</bold>) could inhibit not only the secretions of HBsAg and HBeAg with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.617 ± 0.25 mM (SI = 2.1) and 0.887 ± 0.25 mM (SI = 1.4), respectively, but also HBV-DNA replication with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.477 ± 0.14 mM (SI = 2.7) [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>] isolated cichoric acid (
 <bold>158</bold>) from the leaves of 
 <italic>Chicory intybus</italic> L and found that it had significant anti-HBV activity. Rosmarinic acid (
 <bold>159</bold>) inhibits HBV replication in HBV-infected cells by specifically targeting 
 <italic>ε</italic>-Pol binding. In addition, they analyzed an additional 25 rosmarinic acid derivatives and found that the “two phenolic hydroxyl groups at both ends” and the “caffeic acid-like structure” of rosmarinic acid are critical for the inhibition of 
 <italic>ε</italic>-Pol binding [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. It is well known that phenolic acids have better antiviral activity. The studies showed that 3-caffeoylquinicacid 
 <bold>(160)</bold> [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] could inhibit the secretion of HBsAg, HBeAg, and the replication of HBV-DNA on Hep G 2.2.15 cells at the concentration of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. In order to reveal the anti-HBV activity and structure-activity relationships of the analogues of chlorogenic acid, 9 chlorogenic acid analogues were evaluated on HepG 2.2.15 cell lines 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and found that chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid (
 <bold>161</bold>), neochlorogenic acid (
 <bold>162</bold>), 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (
 <bold>163</bold>), 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (
 <bold>164</bold>), and 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid (
 <bold>165</bold>) possessed potent activity against HBV-DNA replication with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 5.5 ± 0.9-13.7 ± 1.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Di-caffeoyl analogues (
 <bold>163-165</bold>) also exhibited activity against the secretions of HBsAg and HBeAg. The number of caffeoyl moiety may contribute to the inhibitory activity against HBsAg and HBeAg secretions, while the position of caffeoyl units play little role on anti-HBV-DNA activities. In addition, carboxyl group is closely associated to the antiviral activity [
