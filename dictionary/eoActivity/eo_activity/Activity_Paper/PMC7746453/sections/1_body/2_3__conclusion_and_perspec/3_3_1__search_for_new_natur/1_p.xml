<p>The research on natural products against hepatitis B mainly focuses on the field of traditional Chinese medicine on land. The research on traditional Chinese medicine against hepatitis b has been very matured. However, it is still difficult to develop active natural products against HBV. In addition, there are few researches on marine natural products, microbial fermentation products, plant polysaccharides, and other aspects. In recent years, studies have found that marine natural products have good biological activity due to their special growth environment. Huang et al. [

In recent years, many novel compounds are derived from microbial fermentation products. It is an interesting way to study the anti-HBV activity of microbial fermentation products. Plant polysaccharides have a wide range of biological activities, and studies [

 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] have shown that the chemical components of polysaccharides have a good anti-HBV activity. It is of great significance to search for anti-HBV active ingredients from novel natural products.
