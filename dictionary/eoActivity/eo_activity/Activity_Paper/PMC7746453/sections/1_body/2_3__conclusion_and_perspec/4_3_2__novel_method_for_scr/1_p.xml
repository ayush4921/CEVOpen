<p>The traditional screening of anti-HBV activity involves the separation and identification of chemical components in traditional Chinese medicinal materials and then the screening of their activity, which often takes time and effort and is difficult to obtain accurate screening results. In recent years, researchers used computer-aided drug design (molecular simulation docking) to screen out suitable compounds from the database and then carried out screening 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. This method has strong purpose and high accuracy. A series of derivatives with good anti-HBV activity were obtained by modifying the structure of known compounds with anti-HBV activity, and the derivatives with the best activity were screened out through activity test. This method also provides a new idea for discovering anti-HBV compounds with better activity [
