<p>To search for potent radiotherapy enhancers from medicinal herbs, we screened their constituents at a concentration of 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M to evaluate the inhibitory effects on IR-induced A549 cell migration [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2(a)</xref> shows the width of the scratch created, which mimics a wound, that was rapidly covered by cells following 10 Gy 
 <italic>γ</italic>-irradiation. However, treatment with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M of compounds 1–3 decreased the covering rate over the wound area. To quantify cell migration, the width of the scratch created in A549 cells was measured and calculated at 0 and 24 h after wound creation. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>, all tested compounds significantly suppressed the wound-healing ability of 
 <italic>γ</italic>-irradiated A549 cells in comparison with the untreated 
 <italic>γ</italic>-irradiated A549 cells. This finding indicated that compounds 1–3 inhibited IR-induced A549 cell migration.
