<p>To investigate whether the inhibitory effects on IR-induced A549 cell migration were actually due to cytotoxicity, the cell viability assay was performed. In this study, the effect of 10 Gy IR on the viability of A549 cells was not tested because it has been reported to have no effect on the viability in A539 cells [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The results of the CCK-8 assay demonstrated that compound 1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value at 48 and 72 
 <italic>h</italic> = 69.94 and 57.40 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively) exhibited cytotoxic effects at 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, whereas compounds 2–3 did not (IC

 <italic>γ</italic>-irradiated A549 cells can be partially attributed to its cytotoxicity, whereas compounds 2–3 appear to have inhibitory effects that are independent of cytotoxicity. Next, to determine the noncytotoxic concentration of 1–3, the cell viability assay was performed with a low concentration of each compound (2.5 or 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>, compounds 1–3 did not exhibit cytotoxic effects at these concentrations; thus, further analyses were performed at these concentrations.
