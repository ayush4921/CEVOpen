<p>In recent years, research into medicinal mushrooms has progressed exponentially, but much remains to be done. Many species remain unstudied or underestimated in terms of their pharmacological properties. The primary urgency is also to identify the molecules present in the extracts, the metabolites responsible for their effects, their chemical characterization, and their mechanism of action. There is also an urgent need to fully understand both their individual and synergistic actions, with particular attention paid to in vivo dynamics, as well as refining the design of in vivo and clinical studies. It is also necessary to standardize the production of mushroom supplements throughout the supply chain, from cultivation to the extraction and preparation of the commercial formulation, as well as precise monitoring and regulation to ensure high quality levels.</p>
