<p>Studies in vitro or in mice models have shown an increase in lymphocyte proliferation and immunoglobulin IgG levels, suggesting effects on humoral immunity by PSP. Other results suggest a role for PSP in the activation of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), fundamental, therefore, in the innate immune response upon an encounter with a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) [

One type of PRR whose specific level of action is a function of the infecting pathogen is toll-like receptors, which represent the body’s first line of defense and on which the PSP can act positively. Antiviral action of this kind was demonstrated in vitro by Rodríguez-Valentín et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], showing that PSP not only downregulated viral replication and promoted the upregulation of specific antiviral chemokines, such as RANTES, MIP-1α/β, and SDF-1α, with blocking action on HIV-1 coreceptors in THP1 cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), but upregulated TLR4 expression. A study lead by Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in mice carrying a defective or normal TLR4 gene recorded how PSP stimulates the expression of both cytokines and TLR4 and its downstream signaling molecule TRAF6 and increases the phosphorylation of the transcription factor NF-κB p65 and the activator protein AP-1 transcription factor component c-Jun in peritoneal macrophages from TLR4
 <sup>+/+</sup> mice, but not from TLR4
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. This shows that PSP-mediated immunomodulatory action occurs via the TLR4 signalling pathway. Besides, a reduction in tumors was also found compared to normal saline treatment.
