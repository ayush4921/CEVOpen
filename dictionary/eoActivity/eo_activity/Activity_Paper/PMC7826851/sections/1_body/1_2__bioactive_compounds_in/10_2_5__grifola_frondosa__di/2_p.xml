<p>Two polysaccharide fractions obtained from GFPs and named as F2 and F3 showed promising hypoglycemic effects in vitro, most likely due to enhanced insulin resistance stimulated by the reactivation of insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1); both fractions reduced levels of fasting serum glucose (FSG), fasting serum insulin (FSI), and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and also enhanced IR and IRS-1 activities and the protein level of IR, reducing, on the contrary, that of IRS-1, and consequently acted on the PI3K/Akt pathways, as seen from the increased mRNA levels of PI3K and Akt [
