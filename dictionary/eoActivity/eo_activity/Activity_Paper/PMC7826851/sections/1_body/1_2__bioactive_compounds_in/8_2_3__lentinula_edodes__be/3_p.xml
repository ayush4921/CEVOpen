<p>Underpinning the current use of lentinan as an adjuvant in oncological therapies are also several preclinical studies in which the polysaccharide was tested alongside substances used in chemotherapy treatment. For example, lentinan has been shown to alleviate the ROS-mediated nephrotoxicity of cisplatin (a key drug in lung cancer treatment) by activating the Nrf2-ARE signaling pathway. Similarly, a synergistic action with the tumor drug paclitaxel on A549 cells was exerted by activation of the ASK1/p38 MAPK signaling pathway and, consequently, of the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)-associated NLRP3 inflammasome (TXNIP-NLRP3) [
