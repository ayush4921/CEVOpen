<p>The AC ethanolic extract also showed marked antiproliferative activity in human T47D breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. AC caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, thus inhibiting proliferation, and induced autophagy. The reduced expression of cell cycle-related proteins and the increased expression of the transcription factor FOXO1, the autophagy marker LC3 II, and the protein p62 were recorded. The extract also mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress by upregulating the expression of inositol-requiring enzyme 1-Î± (IRE1), glucose-regulating protein 78 GRP78/Bip, and C/EBP homologous protein CHOP. Tumor growth was inhibited in vivo [
