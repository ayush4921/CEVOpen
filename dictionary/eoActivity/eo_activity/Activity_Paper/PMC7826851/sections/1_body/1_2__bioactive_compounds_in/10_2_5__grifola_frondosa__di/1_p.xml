 <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> or maitake is another major medical mushroom with numerous medicinal properties and whose main bioactive metabolite is the so-called D-fraction or GFP, a β-glucan proteoglycan compound. Several studies have demonstrated its antitumor effect, such as the one conducted by Alonso et al. [

Not only did it activate macrophages, T cells, and NK cells, but it also triggered the expression of BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (BAK-1) and several other genes (RASSF-2, FADD, IGFBP-7, ITGA2, ICAM3, SOD2, CAV-1, Cul-3, NRF2, Cycline E, ST7, and SPARC) involved in apoptotic stimulation, the inhibition of cell growth and proliferation and cell cycle arrest, the suppression of tumor cell migration and metastasis, and the downregulation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. In a subsequent study in rodent LM3 mammary adenocarcinoma cells, it was observed that D-fraction, in addition to inducing apoptosis and reducing cell motility and invasiveness, increased cell adhesion by upregulating E-cadherin protein levels and inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity [
