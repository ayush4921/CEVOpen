<p>In particular, concerning immunomodulatory action, it has been observed that this occurs through multiple mechanisms, such as the activation of cytotoxic T cells, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages, NK cells, the TLR-4 pathway, and other immune cells, as well as their by-products TNF-α, interleukins IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, and IL-6, and active nitrogen and oxygen intermediates [

 <italic>lucidum</italic> triterpenes butyl ganoderate A and B and butyl lucidenate A and N exert an inhibitory effect on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. The first and last of these compounds exerted this action by suppressing the mRNA expression levels of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) genes. The researchers concluded that the inhibitory action of these triterpenes on 3T3-L1 cells is at least partly due to the downregulation of the adipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1c) and its target Fanconi anemia (FA) group C gene (FAC) and ACC. Lucialdheydes A and C, ganodermanonol, and ganodermanondiol showed cytotoxic activity in vitro in Lewis lung carcinoma, sarcoma 180, T-47D, and Meth-A tumor cell lines [

An in vivo study on mice injected with inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and treated with the commercial extract ReishiMax GLpTM (carpophore and cracked spores) highlighted a selective action on gene and protein expression, with smaller tumor size and weight and reduced expression of E-cadherin, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4G (eIF4G), and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and the activity of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK 1/2) [

It has been observed in vitro that the antiproliferative and proapoptotic action of reishi terpenes, polysaccharides, and proteins occurs by stimulating the proliferation of undifferentiated spleen cells and the production of cytokines and antibodies. They also have an antimetastatic action, which they exert by activating the NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways, promoting cytokine release [

A great deal of research has been carried out on ganoderic acids; ganoderic acid T, for instance, has been shown to induce apoptosis in metastatic lung cancer cells by acting on the pathway linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and the expression of the tumor protein p53. Moreover, ganoderic acid D inhibited the proliferation of HeLa human carcinoma cells and induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [

Ganoderic acid DM has been shown in vitro to arrest osteoclastogenesis in bone marrow cells and RAW 264 cell D-clone (RAWD) by suppressing the expression of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1), with the consequent inhibition of dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) expression and reduced osteoclast fusion [
