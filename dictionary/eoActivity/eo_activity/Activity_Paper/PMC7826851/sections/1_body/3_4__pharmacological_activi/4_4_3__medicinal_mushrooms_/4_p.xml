<p>Because of the effect of 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>erinaceus</italic> (HE) on the autonomic nervous system and brain function, the effects of this mushroom on menopause, depression, sleep quality, and undefined disorders were investigated by Nagano et al. [
 <xref rid="B111-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Evaluations were carried out according to the Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and the Indefinite Complaints Index (ICI). Thirty females were randomly assigned to consume either four HE cookies (0.5 g powdered carpophore per cookie) or four placebo cookies daily for 1 month. In the treated group, the CES-D and ICI scores after the HE intake were significantly lower than before; compared to the placebo group, the “insensitive” and “palpitation” terms of the ICI were significantly lower, and the terms “concentration”, “irritating”, and “anxious” tended to be lower. Finding that 
 <italic>H</italic>. 
 <italic>erinaceus</italic> can alleviate anxiety and depression, the authors were led to suppose a different mechanism of action from the more familiar NGF-enhancing action of the mushroom.
