<p>In addition, 
 <italic>Pleurotus cornucopiae</italic> (Paulet) Rolland or tamogitake was associated with the upregulation of the immune system in a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial by Tanaka et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], suggesting its great potential for the prevention of various diseases, such as cancer and infectious diseases. This study showed that the administration of a fungal extract for eight weeks increased interferon IFN-γ and IL-12, and a smaller increase in NK cell activity, while serum levels of Th2-type cytokines IL-10 and IL-13 and other cytokines remained unchanged. The enhancement of the immune system by tamogitake appears to occur through Th1 phenotype potentiation and the macrophage–IL-12 and IFN-g pathway, thus resulting in activation of the cell-mediated immune system, but with almost no change in Th2-type cytokines (the causes of which have yet to be clarified).
