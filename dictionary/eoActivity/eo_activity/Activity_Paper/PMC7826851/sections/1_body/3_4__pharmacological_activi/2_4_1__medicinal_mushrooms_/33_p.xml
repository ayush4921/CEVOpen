<p>In addition, a more recent clinical study by Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B93-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] showed that lentinan-based chemoimmunotherapy seems to be a promising strategy for antitumor activity via enhancing the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells (CD3+ CD8+) and CD3+ CD56+ NKT cells, followed by the elevation of proinflammatory chemokines/cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α) and proinflammatory IL-12, which would then lead to a shift in the Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1. These were the results observed in subjects treated with 4 mg/d of lentinan for 12 weeks in relation to the total number of patients with NSCLC involved in the trial.
