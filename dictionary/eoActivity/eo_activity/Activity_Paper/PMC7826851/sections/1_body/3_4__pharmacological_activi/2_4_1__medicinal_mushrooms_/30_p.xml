 <italic>cinnamomea</italic> T.T. Chang and W.N. Chou, a popular medicinal mushroom in Taiwan, was tested in subjects suffering from different kinds of cancer (gastric, lung, breast, liver, or colorectal) alongside chemotherapy. A total of 37 patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or 20 mL of an

 <italic>cinnamomea</italic> (AC) oral formulation (mainly containing polysaccharides, triterpenoids, and Î³-aminobutyric acid) twice a day for 30 days. Although lower mortality rates and longer overall survival were found in the mushroom-treated group than in the placebo group, these differences were not statistically significant.
