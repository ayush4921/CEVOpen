 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> or reishi is one of the oldest medicinal mushrooms used in Asian regions, and is consequently one of the most studied up to the present day. About 400 bioactive compounds have been isolated from the mycelium, fruiting bodies, and spores of this mushroom, including polysaccharides, triterpenes, ganoderic acids, phenols, amino acids, lignin, vitamins, nucleosides, nucleotides, sterols, steroids, proteins, unsaturated fatty acids, and inorganic ions [

However, the most important bioactive molecules turn out to be polysaccharides, the most important of which are β 1–3 and β 1–6 D glucans, and triterpenes, especially the lanostane type. They have shown multiple important therapeutic properties both in vitro in numerous tumor cell lines and in vivo in animal models, thus explaining why Chinese medicine traditionally uses extracts of this mushroom for cancer prevention and treatment. They are also used to alleviate the side effects of radio- and chemotherapy.
