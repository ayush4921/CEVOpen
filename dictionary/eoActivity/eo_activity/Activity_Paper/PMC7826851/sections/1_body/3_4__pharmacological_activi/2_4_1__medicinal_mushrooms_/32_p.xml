<p>In 2011, Ina et al. [
 <xref rid="B91-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>] wanted to test whether the biological response modifier (BMR) lentinan, used in combination with oral fluoropyrimidines (S-1 chemotherapy), could be effective in patients with gastric cancer. For this purpose, 78 subjects with metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer undergoing S-1 chemotherapy were selected, a proportion of whom were given 2 mg/body weight of lentinan intravenously for 30 min every 2 to 3 weeks. Immunochemotherapy with lentinan has been shown to significantly increase the overall survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer, although without consistent differences in the incidence and degree of adverse effects. Another randomized clinical trial was reported by Ma [
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], comparing the effect of lentinan when combined with nanoparticle (NP) chemotherapy (cisplatin plus navelbine) on advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients. A significantly lower Parkinson disease (PD) rate and significantly higher efficiency rate and control rate were observed in treated subjects compared to the control group, as well as higher levels of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+/CD8+, showing that the immunochemotherapy with lentinan is able to improve the therapeutic efficacy, enhance immune functions, and reduce the adverse effects.
