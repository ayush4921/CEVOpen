 <xref rid="B99-ijms-22-00634" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. A sample of 1244 women planning for their first pregnancy was recruited and randomly assigned to consume at least 100 g of white button mushroom (cooked according to personal taste) daily or follow a normal diet, from the pre-pregnancy stage to the 20th week of gestation. In the end, 582 women in the WBM group and 580 in the placebo group completed the program. The primary outcome was gestational hypertension, measured by diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP); the secondary outcome included preeclampsia, gestational body weight gain, other pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes mellitus, and birth weight. The results showed a beneficial impact of the mushroom diet on all the parameters mentioned above, and a significantly lower risk of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, and macrosomia was observed.
