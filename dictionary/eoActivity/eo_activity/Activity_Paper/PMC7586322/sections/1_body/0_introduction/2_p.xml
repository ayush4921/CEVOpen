<p>The economic importance of these parasitic infections in ruminants imposes the need for rigorous measures of control. Thus, these measures relied on the repeated use of synthetic, chemical anthelmintic drugs in order to break the nematodesâ€™ life cycles by eliminating the worms in the hosts. However, this nearly exclusive reliance on synthetic molecules to control GI nematodes nowadays faces several limits. The first is the enhanced concern of consumers about the use of chemicals in farm animals, which might generate possible residues in food products or environmental consequences,
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the threat of anthelminthic resistance and high cost, especially to farmers of low income in developing countries, which have led to the notion that sustainable helminth control cannot be achieved with commercial anthelminthics alone. Therefore, other options, such as biological control, vaccines and traditional medicinal plants are being examined in different parts of the world.
