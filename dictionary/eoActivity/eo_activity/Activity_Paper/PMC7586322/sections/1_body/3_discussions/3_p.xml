<p>The effective doses (IC

 <xref rid="cit0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Consequently, the three condensed tannin extracts in this study revealed a range of efficacies to inhibit egg hatching and larval development. The observed differences in potencies among the extracts might be associated with the corresponding variation in their tannin contents. Related work with the in vitro inhibitory effect of condensed tannins on egg hatchability and larval development of 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> was reported previously.
