<p>It has been stated that controls of 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus</italic> could not be resolved by the use of conventional anthelminthic drugs
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> as there is worldwide problem regarding the development of anthelminthic-resistant worm populations. The three species of plants were chosen for our trial based on their relatively high tannin content and their wide availability in the study area. The promising result of the present study is that all three plants exhibited various dose-dependent in vitro efficacies on egg hatchability and larval development of 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> in sheep. This could provide baseline information on the possibility of considering condensed tannins as an alternative in the packages towards the control of haemonchosis in sheep.
