<p>To assay soluble CTs, 0.5 mg of tannin-enriched extract was mixed with 2 mL of butanol-containing reagent (51.5% acetone/43% butanol/5% 12 N concentrated HCl/0.5% H
 <sub>2</sub>O) and 67 μL of ferrous reagent (2% w/v FeNH
 <sub>4</sub>(SO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> in 2 N HCl). The final assay mixture, containing both sample and assay solutions in a 2.5 mL volume was thus comprised (v/v) of 50.1% acetone, 33.5% butanol, 3.9% 12 N concentrated HCl, 7% dH
 <sub>2</sub>O, 2.9% MeOH, and 2.6% ferrous reagent in a total volume of 2.5 mL. Aliquots (200 μL) of the final assay mixture of were removed to be read as non-heated controls. Assay samples were heated to 70°C for 2.5 h, allowed to cool to room temperature, and the absorbance read at 550 nm using a. To determine CT concentration, absorbances from unheated aliquots were subtracted from heated samples. When assaying water extracts for CTs, the proportion of assay reagent components, as well as volumes of extract and iron reagent, were adjusted to give the same water and solvent concentrations in the final assay mixture as for solvent-extracted CTs.
