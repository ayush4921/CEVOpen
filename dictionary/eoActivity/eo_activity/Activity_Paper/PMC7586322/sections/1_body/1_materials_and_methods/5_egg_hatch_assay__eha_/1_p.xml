<p>The EHA was conducted according to the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) guidelines.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Condensed tannin-enriched extracts of the plant leaves were used as the active treatment. Albendazole (pure standard reference) was used as positive control while untreated eggs in water were used as negative control. The test was conducted in 5-mL test tubes. In the assay, approximately 150–250 eggs in 1 mL of water were placed in each test tube. Various serial concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125, 0.015 and 0.0078 mg/mL each plant extract in total volume of 0.5 mL in distilled water was added. Albendazole originally dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and diluted at concentrations of 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125, 0.0156 and 0.0078 µg/mL distilled water at different concentrations was used. The test tubes were covered and kept in an incubator at 27°C for 48 h. A drop of logo’s iodine solution was added to each well to stop further hatching, and all the unhatched eggs and L1 larvae in each well were counted under dissecting microscope at 40x magnification. The experiment was replicated four times for each concentration and control.
