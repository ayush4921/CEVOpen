<p>Phytochemical analysis and total tannin quantification of the extracts from the three plant samples were performed and the result indicated that 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> showed the highest tannin content and 
 <italic>A. gumifera</italic> the least (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Meanwhile, the results of mean inhibition percentage (Â±SD) of condensed tannin-enriched extracts (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>) showed that all three condensed tannin extracts demonstrated various degrees of dose-dependent inhibition on both egg hatchability and larval development, with 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> being the highest followed by 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>guineensa</italic>, whereas 
 <italic>A. gumifera</italic> showed the lowest inhibition.
