 <caption>
  <p>Examples of the expected outcomes of AILDE method</p>
  <p>(A) The calculated binding free energy of the lead compounds with a protein receptor.</p>
  <p>(B) Heatmap showing the activities of the lead compounds obtained by fragment linking. The horizontal axis represents the fragment molecules, and the vertical axis represents the atomic number of the atoms connecting the fragments. The darker the red, the more active the compound is. The darker the blue, the less active the compound is.</p>
  <p>(C) The interaction modes of the lead compounds with protein receptor.</p>
