 <p>Hit-to-lead (H2L) optimization is crucial for drug design, which has become an increasing concern in medicinal chemistry. A virtual screening strategy of auto 
  <italic>in silico</italic> ligand directing evolution (AILDE) has been developed to yield promising lead compounds rapidly and efficiently. The protocol includes instructions for fragment compound library construction, conformational sampling by molecular dynamics simulation, ligand modification by fragment growing, as well as the binding free energy prediction.
