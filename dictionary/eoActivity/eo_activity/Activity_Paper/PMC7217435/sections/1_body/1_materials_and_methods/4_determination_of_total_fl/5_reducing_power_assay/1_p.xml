<p>1 mL extracts, 2.5 mL phosphate buffer, and 2.5 mL potassium ferricyanide were mixed and then placed in a water bath at 50Â°C for 20 min. 2.5 mL TCA was added to terminate the reaction. After centrifuging for 10 min, 2.5 mL supernatant was added to 2 mL distilled water and 0.5 mL 0.1% ferric chloride. 2.5 mL supernatant was added to 3 mL distilled water as part of the control group. The optical density was recorded at 700 nm and reflected the reducing power. The experiments were performed in triplicate with similar results (RSD &lt; 5.0%). Please refer to [
