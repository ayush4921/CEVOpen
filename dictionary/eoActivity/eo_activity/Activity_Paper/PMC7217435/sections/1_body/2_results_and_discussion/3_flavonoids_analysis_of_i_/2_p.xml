<p>Four flavones contain apigenin, apigenin-7-glucuronide, acacetin-7-O-glcopyranoside, and homoplantageninisoetin; four flavonols, namely, isoetin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-[6”-O-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl)-β-D-glucopyranoside], and limocitrin-Neo; one prodelphinidin (procyanidins); and one nothofagin (dihydrochalcone) were tentatively identified in the mass spectrometry-DAD (254nm) chromatograms of extracts from 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. Apigenin was an edible natural flavonoid found in several dietary plant foods such as vegetables and fruits and showed potential antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties [
