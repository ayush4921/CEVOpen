  <italic>Isoetes sinensis</italic> Palmer is a critically endangered, first-class protected plant in China. Until now, researchers have primarily focused on the ultrastructure, phylogeny, and transcriptomes of the plant. However, flavonoid profiles and bioactivity of 
  <italic>I</italic>. 
  <italic>sinensis</italic> have not been extensively investigated. To develop the endangered 
  <italic>I</italic>. 
  <italic>sinensis</italic> for edible and medicinal purposes, flavonoid content, chemical constitution, and antioxidant activities were investigated in this study. Results revealed the following. 1) The total flavonoid content was determined as 10.74 ± 0.25 mg/g., 2) Antioxidant activities were stronger than most ferns, especially ABTS free radical scavenging activities. 3) Four flavones, containing apigenin, apigenin-7-glucuronide, acacetin-7-O-glcopyranoside, and homoplantageninisoetin; four flavonols, namely, isoetin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-[6”-O-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl)-β-D-glucopyranoside], and limocitrin-Neo; one prodelphinidin (procyanidins;) and one nothofagin (dihydrochalcone) were tentatively identified in the mass spectrometry-DAD (254nm) chromatograms. This study was the first to report on flavonoid content and antioxidant activities of 
  <italic>I</italic>. 
  <italic>sinensis</italic>. Stronger antioxidant activity and flavonoid content suggests that the endangered 
  <italic>I</italic>. 
  <italic>sinensis</italic> is an important and potentially edible and medicinal plant.
