Natural alternatives are increasingly gaining attention because of greater accessibility to medicinal plants, and the possibility that they may have fewer and less adverse side-effects than synthetic drugs. This makes natural alternatives more desirable as novel drug therapies. Thousands of plant species still remain to be screened for their bioactivity. Only approximately 15% of some 250,000 species of higher plants have been studied for their pharmaceutical potential [
