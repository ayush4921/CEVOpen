<p>CBD can be used to regulate the immune system’s response to viruses (and other invading pathogens. The immune system uses oxidative stress (via reactive oxygen species) to combat invading pathogens. During many disease processes, the cells of the body accumulate high levels of reactive oxygen species (R.O.S.). This may be due to reasons including, but not limited to increased metabolic activity, increased oxidase activity, and/or increased mitochondrial activity. In excess, oxidative stress can cause tissue and organ damage. Numerous studies show CBD’s potential as an anti-oxidant. CBD inhibits neurotoxicity and oxidative stress by reducing inflammation, production of reactive oxygen species and other oxidative stress parameters [

When oxygen is metabolized in the body, ROS is produced. In moderation, ROS is involved in homeostasis and signaling and is associated with the maintenance of healthy cells [
