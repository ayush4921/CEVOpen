<p id="p0010">As I write this commentary in late April 2020, the world is scrambling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19, short for Coronavirus disease 2019, is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Globally, more than 3 million people have been infected by COVID-19 and over 200Â 000 people have died of this disease. Normal lives of billions of people around the world are disrupted. The global economic loss is incalculable. Where I am (Massachusetts, USA), universities have closed down since mid-March. Most researchers were sent to work from home, which means in-person lab research has to be abruptly halted. The COVID-19 pandemic ruthlessly deprives us of some of the very basic activities that we take for granted living in a modern society, such as going to work, eating out with friends, and attending social gatherings. As painful as it is, COVID-19 also serves as a wake-up call that reminds us how fragile our society still is when challenged by a pandemic, and much is to be learned about infectious diseases because we still lack effective ways to eradicate them.</p>
