<p id="Par30">2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid diammonium salt) was dissolved in water to make a concentration of 7 mM. ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> was produced by reacting to the ABTS stock solution with 2.45 mM potassium persulfate and allowing the mixture to stand in the dark at room temperature for 12–16 h before use. For the study of samples, the ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline 5 mM, pH 7.4 to obtain an absorbance of 0.70 at 734 nm. After the addition of 980 μl of diluted ABTS to 20 μl of samples, the absorbance reading was taken five minutes after the initial mixing [
