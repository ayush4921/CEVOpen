<p id="Par40">Mutans streptococci group colonize at the tooth enamel surface and initiate plaque formation by their ability to make extracelluar polysaccharides from sucrose using glucosyltransferase which is a major component in the development of dental caries [

 <italic>A. nilotica</italic> bark contained a considerable amount of condensed tannins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The HPLC chromatogram of F4 indicated the presence of condensed tannins. This type of tannin is available in barks, oolong tea, green tea and grape seed, which are potent GTF inhibitors owing to their polyphenolic moiety being able to form hydrogen bonds with GTF [

However, it has been reported that chlorhexidine is cytotoxic to human periodontal ligament cells, inhibits protein synthesis, and affects mitochondrial activity, thus having detrimental effects on vital tissues [
