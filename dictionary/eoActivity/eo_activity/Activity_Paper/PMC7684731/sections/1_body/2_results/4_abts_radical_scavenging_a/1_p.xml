 <sub>50</sub> value is the effective concentration at which antioxidant activity is 50%. The ABTS radical scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of crude extracts and fractions were ranged between 0.8–5.2 μg/ml (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The results also revealed that Fr1 had a significant antioxidant activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.8 μg/ml compared to the trolox as a positive control (2.1 μg/ml). As described previously, the gallic acid was the main compound in this Fraction. Fraction three (Fr3) also demonstrated an excellent antioxidant activity in which there were no significant differences between Fr3 (3.1 μg/ml) and positive control.
