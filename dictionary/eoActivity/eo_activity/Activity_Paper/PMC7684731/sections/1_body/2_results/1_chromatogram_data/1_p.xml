<p id="Par34">Typical chromatograms of crude methanolic extract and fractions are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The chromatographic peaks of Fr1 and Fr2 were identified according to a commercial standard of gallic acid (GA) and methyl gallate (MG) (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Therefore, the Fr1 contained a GA at the retention time 9.9 min as the main compound. Fr2 contained a mixture of GA and MG at the retention time 9.9 and 16.8 min, respectively, in addition to unknown compound at the retention time of 41.6 min. In contrast, compounds in the other fractions are still unidentified.
