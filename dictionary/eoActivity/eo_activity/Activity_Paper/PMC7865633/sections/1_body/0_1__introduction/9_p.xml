<p>After analyzing the compelling articles dealing with the antiviral activity of natural compounds against SARS-CoV-2, we dedicated our attention to natural compounds recognizing SARS-CoV-2 druggable targets. Particularly, natural compounds currently under clinical trials were extensively herein discussed. Due to the amount of data from scientific literature, in our opinion sometimes inaccurate and superficial, our main goal is to give a vision on the possible role of the natural compounds against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
