<p>Hence, the repurposing of clinically evaluated drugs is one of the most promising strategies to address the immense landscape of diseases, including infectious ones such as COVID-19. Remarkably, while most drug repurposing occurrences are based on synthetic compounds, naturally occurring molecules may offer significant opportunities. In fact, nature itself may be considered a magic bullet providing molecules with promising or still unexplored pharmacological properties [

Moreover, natural products are considered an essential source of successful drug leads and provide unique structural diversity with respect to standard combinatorial chemistry. Since more than 95% of the worldâ€™s biodiversity has not been evaluated for potential biological activity, the main challenge involves how to efficiently access and enhance this natural chemical diversity [

As a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, the repurposing of natural products could be an effective strategy to handle the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Currently, several studies have highlighted the antiviral properties of several natural compounds [
