 <bold>,</bold> and due to their comparable pharmacological activities, the possible binding mode of these compounds towards the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was analyzed. Thus, it was observed that 
 <bold>ursolic acid</bold> formed a hydrogen bond with Ser46 and several Van der Waals interactions with Thr24, Thr25, Thr26, Cys44, Thr45, Asn142, Gly143, Cys145, and Glu166 residues of the protease. Further, in silico results showed that 
 <bold>oleanolic acid</bold> was involved with the catalytic dyad of the SARS-CoV-2 protease establishing both a hydrogen bond and several hydrophobic contacts with Gln189, Cys145 and His163 residues, respectively [
