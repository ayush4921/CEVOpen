<p>A possible mechanism of action was attributed to the binding between the active form of vitamin D and S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Docking results showed that calcitriol recognised the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike glycoprotein with good binding affinity, thus engaging hydrogen bonds with Gln493 residue and hydrophobic interactions with Ser494, Tyr449, Asn450, Leu452, Tyr489, Leu492, and Glu484 residues [
