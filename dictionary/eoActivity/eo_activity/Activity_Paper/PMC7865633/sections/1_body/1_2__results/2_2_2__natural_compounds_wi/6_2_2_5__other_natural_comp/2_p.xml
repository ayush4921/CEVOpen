<p>Among phenolic compounds extracted from honey and propolis, it was observed that 
 <bold>ellagic acid</bold> made hydrogen bonds with Gly808, Pro809, His816, thr817 and Tyr831 residues of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Docking results also showed that hydrogen bonds between ellagic acid and His41, Gly143, Arg188 were formed. Furthermore, Shaldam et al. proposed 
 <bold>artepillin C</bold> as a potential inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro due to the interactions between the phenolic compound and Cys145, Arg188, Thr190 and Gln192 [
