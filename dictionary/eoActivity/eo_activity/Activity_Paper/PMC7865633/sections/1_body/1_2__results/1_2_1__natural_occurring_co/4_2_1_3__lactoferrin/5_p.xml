<p>Additional computational study sustained the idea of direct LF binding to the Spike S glycoprotein CDT1 domain, reducing the virusâ€™s likelihood of entering cells. Moreover, after evaluating the human LF-Spike complex, it was observed that only two residues (Thr500 and Tyr505) are involved in the interface recognition [
