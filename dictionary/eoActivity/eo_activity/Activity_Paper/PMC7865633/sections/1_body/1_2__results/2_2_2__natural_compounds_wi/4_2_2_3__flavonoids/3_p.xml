<p>Again, 
 <bold>quercetin-3-Î²-galactoside</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00632-f017">Figure 17</xref>p) a flavonoid-based compound, was found to bind SARS-CoV-2 Mpro through numerous interactions with the key residues of the catalytic pocket. Notably, the 
 <italic>N</italic> atom of the main chain of Glu166 made two hydrogen bonds with the compound, while the Gln189 side chain was able to form other four similar interactions. The hydrophobic contacts between the compound and Leu141, Asn142, Met165, and Glu166 residues were evident too. Concentrating on their chemical scaffold, it is possible to rationalize that: (1) four hydroxyl groups of quercetin are crucial determinants of the bioactivity of this type of compounds; (2) the shape of sugar moiety and 7-hydroxy site of quercetin can be characterized by large structural modifications in order to enhance the binding interactions [
