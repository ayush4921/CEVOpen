<p>Both aqueous extracts from the leaf and rootstock of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> are rich in phenolic compounds, particularly phenolic acids. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> biological investigations showed that 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> leaf and rootstock aqueous extracts exhibited important antioxidant and antihyperglycemic effects. Indeed, the rootstock extract (investigated for the first time) revealed important antihyperglycemic effects, which were mediated by the inhibition of enzymes implicated in sugar metabolism (
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase). On the contrary, the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> leaf and rootstock aqueous extracts can also be useful to improve the management of people with diabetes. These finding suggest that phenolic compounds of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> are responsible for these biological effects. However, further investigations regarding the isolation of these main compounds and evaluation of their antioxidant and antidiabetic activities are required.
