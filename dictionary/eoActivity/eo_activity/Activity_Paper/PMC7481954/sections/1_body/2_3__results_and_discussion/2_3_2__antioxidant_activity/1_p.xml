<p>Recently, the interest in natural antioxidants has considerably increased worldwide. Plants produce various antioxidants compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins which have a potent capacity to prevent oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species. These compounds have low or no side effects for use in preventive medicine in comparison to the synthetic antioxidant agents. Considering the complexity of the oxidation process, it is necessary to combine the responses of different and complementary tests to evaluate the antioxidant activity of samples. In this study, we evaluated antioxidant capacity of the aqueous extracts of the leaves and rootstocks of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> using the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging methods.
