<p>Diabetes mellitus is characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood that can lead to several serious complications [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In modern medicine, the treatment of this condition is based on the use of insulin and oral antidiabetic drugs, which have side effects [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Medicinal plants and their active components can be a promising source for new safer antidiabetic drugs [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Many species of plants are used for this purpose [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In the present work, two extracts of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> are evaluated for their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antidiabetic activity. The polysaccharides and disaccharides must undergo enzymatic hydrolysis to be converted into monosaccharide absorbable by the enterocytes. The enzymes 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase are responsible for the breakdown of carbohydrates in the digestive tract. When starch is ingested, it is hydrolysed in a proportion of 30 to 40% by 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase present in the saliva. The residual starch is then hydrolysed by pancreatic 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase into maltose which is converted into glucose by 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidases present at the brush border of the intestinal cells. The inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase activity is therefore an important strategy to limit the postprandial hyperglycemia [
