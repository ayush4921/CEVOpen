<p>The 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition assay was performed using the previously reported method [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In brief, 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of various concentrations of the samples and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase (240 U/mL, in 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9) were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. A portion (250 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) of soluble starch (1% (w/v)) (in 0.02 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.9) was added, and the mixture was further incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Finally, 1 mL of dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) color reagent was added and incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min to stop the reaction. The mixture was then diluted with 2 mL of distilled water, and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. Acarbose was used as positive control. The results were expressed as percentage inhibition and calculated using the following formula:
