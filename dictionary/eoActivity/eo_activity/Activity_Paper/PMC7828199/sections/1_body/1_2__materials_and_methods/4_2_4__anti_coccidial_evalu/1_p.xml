<p>To evaluate the anti-coccidial index (ACI) or efficacy of RN leaf powder, bloody diarrhea, fecal oocysts per gram, relative BWG, lesion scores, and survival rate were determined as anti-coccidial parameters based on the formula described by [
 <xref rid="B43-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and then the ACI value was determined as described by [
 <xref rid="B44-animals-11-00167" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In brief, the ACI value below 120 was evaluated to be an inactive anti-coccidial effect, 120 to 140 as mild or slight, 140 to 160 as moderate, 160 to 180 as marked, and above 180 as excellent.
