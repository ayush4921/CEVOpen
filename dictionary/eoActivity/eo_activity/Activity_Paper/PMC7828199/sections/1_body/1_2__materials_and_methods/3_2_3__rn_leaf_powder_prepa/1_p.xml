<p>RN Vahl was collected from the valleys and mountains around the village of Bait Al-Aqra, Ibb region, Yemen. RN exsiccatae registration No. 23033, registered by botanist (herbarium specialist): Dr. Jacob Thomas at the Department of Botany, Faculty of Science at King Saud University. The harvested RN leaves had been air-dried every five hours for 15 days under sunlight. Then, the dried leaves were ground to a fine powder (particle size; 0.25â€“0.30 mm) using a blender in our laboratory. After that, grinding leaves were mixed with the diets of broilers at concentrations of 1, 3, and 5 g of RN/kg diet. Proximate analysis was conducted to determine the nutritional value of RN as described by [

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was used for the identification, separation, and dosing of chemical compounds in the RN extract mixture. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) test was used for detecting the chemical composition as described by [
