<p>Bloody diarrhea in chickens was evaluated by daily observation under veterinary supervision and counting of bloody feces (count number of blood pieces present in feces after parasite oocyst penetrate the cecal part of chicken intestine via the fecal-oral route, and multiples in its epithelium) through the 4th to 7th d post-infection period. The chickens’ bloody diarrhea is one of the clinical signs of coccidiosis, and here considered one parameter to calculate the anti-coccidial index. In the morning, during the 4th to 7th day’s post-infection period, bloody chicken diarrhea was achieved by observing and counting the number of blood pieces present in the birds’ feces trays. After each observation, the feces were removed to see the new bloody pieces, and so on every day. The mean number of pieces of bloody feces in each treatment was assigned from 0 to 4 and rounded to the nearest integer. Briefly, 0 represented normal feces, 1 indicated one piece, 2 represented two pieces, 3 indicated three pieces, and so on, respectively. The fecal score percentage was then determined as (total highest fecal score for each division in PC minus total highest fecal score for each division in the medicated group)/total highest fecal score for each division in PC multiplied by 100.</p>
