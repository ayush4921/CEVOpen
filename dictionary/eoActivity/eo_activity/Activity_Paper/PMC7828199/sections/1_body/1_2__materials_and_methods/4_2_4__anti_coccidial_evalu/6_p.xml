<p>At the end of the trial (d 7 post-infection) at 28 d of age of the Ross 308 broiler chickens, a sample of 30 birds, with 1 bird/1 replicate, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 birds in each group were subjected to feed withdrawal for 10 h, but drinking water was provided ad libitum during the feed withdrawal period. The birds then slaughtered and cut according to the law of animal welfare. After slaughtering by cutting the jugular vein, birds were left for complete bleeding and were then de-feathered and eviscerated. The cecum of each bird was removed and examined. The lesion scores ranged macroscopic lesions observed at necropsy on a scale of from 0 to 4 depending on the severity of the lesion and atrophy of the cecum. Where 0 refers to normal status and no gross lesions, 1 to small scattered petechiae, 2 to numerous petechiae, 3 to extensive hemorrhage, and 4 to extensive hemorrhage that provides a dark color to the cecal of the birds including coccidiosis-related death. Moreover, the length of the ceca was measured and recorded as mean Â± SEM (in cm) to assess the degree of atrophy.
