<p>Although our data have the intermediate activity of RN against coccidia with higher dose, the performance parameters were higher numerical with lower dose at the same time. Thus, both sides take into account the anti-cocidal and improvement performance of RN for future prescript. As a result, our results suggested that the dose could be increased by 5 g RN or more with good expected result on coccidiosis oocysts shedding when added to the broiler diet or used as an extract for further improvement, if possible, in order to increase the efficacy of RN. However, further studies are needed for its application, perhaps alone or with other herbal products, which could improve the feed conversion rate, increase body weight gain, and reduce coccidia oocysts together.</p>
