<p>The GC-MS analysis of the six studied varieties of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> revealed a substantial variation either in the quantity or quality of their EOs’ chemical composition. This variation reflects the chemical polymorphism phenomenon, and these varieties are considered to be different chemotypes. Based on the main compounds and the PCA analysis, it is evident that some main compounds such as 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene and globulol were reported in all studied varieties, while 
 <italic>trans</italic>-nerolidol was reported as a major compound in all varieties except for the RM variety. Other major compounds characterize specific varieties; for example, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and limonene characterize the RM variety, and caryophyllene, α-copaene, and junipene distinguish the ESEG variety. Therefore, these compounds could be used as a chemical fingerprint to identify these varieties. In practical terms, these major compounds are biologically effective compounds with various activities. The large biomass of guava trees that results from the pruning process, which is considered a waste or byproduct, can be a potential source for these important compounds. The characterization of chemotypes in cultivated plants is crucial for agricultural applications, chemistry purposes, and pharmacological uses. Further study is recommended to characterize the studied varieties at the molecular level to confirm their chemotaxonomic differences.
