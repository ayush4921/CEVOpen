<p>The EOs were extracted via hydro-distillation from the leaves of six varieties of guava: Red Malaysian (RM), El-Qanater (EQ), White Indian (WI), Early (E), El-Sabahya El-Gedida (ESEG), and Red Indian (RI). The extracted EOs showed considerable variation in the yields, wherein they produced 0.48, 0.25, 0.21, 0.19, 0.18, 0.15, and 0.11% (
