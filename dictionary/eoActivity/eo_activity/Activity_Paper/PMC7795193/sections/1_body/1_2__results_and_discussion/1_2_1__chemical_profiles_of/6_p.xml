<p>The sesquiterpenes 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene and globulol were detected as major compounds of all studied guava varieties, while 
 <italic>trans</italic>-nerolidol was reported as a major compound in all except for the RM variety (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00119-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The preponderance of caryophyllene in these varieties was in accordance with those reported by de Souza et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], where they investigated 22 guava genotypes grown in two environments. However, globulol was not detected in the genotypes of de Souza et al.’s [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] study. Although Arain et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00119" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> leaves collected from Pakistan present an excellent source of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, our study revealed that the ESEG and E varieties of 
 <italic>P. guajava</italic> had approximately twice the amount of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene compared to that of the Pakistani variety.
