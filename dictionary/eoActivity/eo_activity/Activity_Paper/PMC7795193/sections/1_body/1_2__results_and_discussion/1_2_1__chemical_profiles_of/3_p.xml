<p>On the other side, the RM variety attained the highest content of monoterpenes (56.87%), composed mostly of monoterpene hydrocarbons (55.72%), while oxygenated monoterpenes were minor (1.15%). The RI, E, EQ, WI, and ESEG varieties attained 28.88, 13.41, 12.22, 3.55, and 0.68% of the monoterpene compounds (

In general, RI attained the highest content of oxygenated compounds (73.72%), followed by E (37.83%), EQ (31.49%), ESEG (26.38%), WI (26.24%), and RM (25.51%). In contrast, the RM, WI, and ESEG varieties exhibited 74.48, 73.72, and 72.90% as non-oxygenated compounds, which suggested that terpene hydrocarbon biosynthesis is more activated in these varieties (
