<p>Although differences in chromatographic patterns were observed among essential oil specimens, we attempted to categorize them in a holistic manner using chemometric tools. Principal component multivariate data analysis (PCA) was applied to model the EO compounds dataset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00119-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) and extracted using Metabolomics Ion-based Data Extraction Algorithm (MET-IDEA), and led to the detection of 867 Mass Spectral (MS) signals. The model accounted for 77% of the total variance described by principal components (PC1 and PC2). The PCA score plot (

On the other side, all other varieties were clustered together in the center of the PCA and had positive score values. Moreover, the examination of the loading plot revealed that 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene and limonene contributed the most to oil segregation and were more abundant in the RM variety. In contrast, the position of the ESEG variety was attributed to its abundance in sesquiterpenes, i.e., caryophyllene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-copaene, and junipene. Hierarchical clustering analysis further confirmed the EOs segregation pattern, where RM and ESEG varieties were placed separately away in the dendrogram (
