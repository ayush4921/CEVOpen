<p>The fresh, healthy, and well-developed (mature) leaves of the six guava (
 <italic>P. guajava</italic>) varieties were collected during the fruiting period (June 2019) from the same garden in Almansouria, Alharam, Egypt. These varieties were characterized as Red Malaysian (RM), El-Qanater (EQ), White Indian (WI), Early (E), El-Sabahya El-Gedida (ESEG), and Red Indian (RI). The garden is located in a semi-urban area, and the soil in the garden is loamy. The climate of the study area has an average temperature of 30–35 °C and average relative humidity of 60%. All of the collected varieties were authenticated by Mohamed El Gebaly, Professor of Taxonomy at the El-Orman Garden and National Research Center. The leaves were dried in the shade at room temperature (25 ± 3 °C) for two days before they were ground into a fine powder and packed in paper bags at −4 °C until further analysis [
