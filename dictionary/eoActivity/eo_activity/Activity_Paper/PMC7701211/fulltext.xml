Introduction</title><p>Inflammation is an important predisposing factor and one of the leading causes of disease occurrence. Indeed, the excessive inflammatory responses are closely associated with cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases, for example, hyperlipidemia, myocardial ischemia, ischemic stroke, and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In clinic, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., aspirin, paracetamol and indomethacin) and glucocorticoids (e.g., beclomethasone dipropionate and budesonide) are commonly used to control inflammatory processes by acting on protein targets in inflammatory signaling [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Due to the poor target selectivity, most of these anti-inflammation drugs have shortcomings of side effects, withdrawal rebound, and drug resistance [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been used in clinic for thousands of years, and many of them show good therapeutic effects in chronic inflammatory diseases. Thus, TCM is playing a comprehensive therapeutic effect in alleviating inflammation-induced clinical symptoms and improving quality of life: the pharmacological properties of TCM are mediated by multicomponents and multitargets [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Alkaloid is an important group of secondary metabolite with varieties of biological activities, especially in anti-inflammation and immune-regulation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Historically, there are many classical TCM prescriptions targeting anti-inflammation, for example, Mahuang Xixin Fuzi Tang (described in &#x0003c;&#x0003c;Shanghan Lun&#x0003e;&#x0003e;) in treating allergic rhinitis [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Huanglian Jiedu Tang (described in &#x0003c;&#x0003c;Waitai Miyao&#x0003e;&#x0003e;) in treating sepsis [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and Zuojin Wan (described in &#x0003c;&#x0003c;Danxi Xinfa&#x0003e;&#x0003e;) in treating ulcerative diseases [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Alkaloids, for example, pseudoephedrine, berberine, and palmatine, in these herbal prescriptions are proposed to alleviate inflammatory response, to reduce tissue damage, and to regulate immune balance [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, this is an efficient way to search anti-inflammatory components with highly effective and low toxicity from TCM.</p><p>
<italic>Corydalis</italic> Rhizoma (CR; the dried tuber of <italic>Corydalis yanhusuo</italic> (Y. H. Chou and Chun C. Hsu) W. T. Wang ex Z. Y. Su and C. Y. Wu) is a well-known herbal medicine in TCM. Due to the efficacy of activating blood, promoting Qi, and relieving pain, CR has been widely used in treating varieties of pain for years, for example, stomachache, cardialgia, and dysmenorrhea. In clinical application, CR is usually used by combining with other herbal medicines, for example, herbal mixtures of Yingshen San (described in &#x0003c;&#x0003c;Weishi Jiacang Fang&#x0003e;&#x0003e;), Ersheng San (described in &#x0003c;&#x0003c;Qixiao Liangfang&#x0003e;&#x0003e;), and Shixiao San (described in &#x0003c;&#x0003c;Taiping Huimin Hejiju Fang&#x0003e;&#x0003e;) in treating abdominal cold pain, colic pain, and blood stasis pain [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, CR extracts had good analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in mouse twisting and foot swelling experiments [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In parallel, dehydrocorydaline, an alkaloid in CR, was shown to have antiallergic effect in collagen type I-IV allergic models [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while rotundinum (tetrahydropalmatine), isocorypalmine, and corydalmine showed analgesic activity via dopamine, NMDA, and mGlu1/5 receptors [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. By spectrum-effect relationship analysis, the CR alkaloids, that is, coptisine, berberine, palmatine, and dehydrocorydaline, were proposed to be closely related to anti-inflammatory potency of CR extracts [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Due to different physiological mechanisms of pain and inflammation, the mechanistic studies of CR, as well as its active components, on anti-inflammation have not been fully revealed. In general, CR contains 0.5 to 1% of total alkaloids [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Indeed, the protoberberine quaternary amine alkaloids (e.g., columbamine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, and dehydrocorydaline), hydrogenated tertiary amine alkaloids (e.g., isocorypalmine, stylopine, rotundinum, canadine, and corydaline), proopioid protoberberine alkaloids (e.g., protopine and allocryptopine), and aphis alkaloids (e.g., glaucine) are the main parent structure of alkaloids being found in CR [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, the anti-inflammatory activities of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine were chosen for further study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

The HPLC chromatograms of CR extracts by using different solvents of having varied amount of ethanol are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>. The major alkaloids, that is, columbamine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, dehydrocorydaline, glaucine, rotundinum, corydaline, and stylopine, were identified in the fingerprints, and their content in different extracts was determined and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>. The structures of major CR alkaloids are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Besides, the closely related alkaloids previously found in CR, for example, allocryptopine, isocorypalmine, corydalmine, and canadine, were also presented; however, these alkaloids were not found in our current analysis. The amounts of alkaloids in CR crude drug were determined, and the linear relationships having <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of each component&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.999 are shown in <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The alkaloid content of CR extracts increased obviously with ethanol concentration in the extracting solvent. Maximal amount of alkaloid was revealed in solvent of 100% ethanol, that is, about 140&#x02009;mg per gram of extract. In parallel, the peaks showing amount of alkaloids in CR were increased with an increase of ethanol fraction in extracting solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). The yields of CR extractives however decreased when the ethanol fraction increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Dehydrocorydaline was the highest abundant alkaloid in CR extracts, nearly accounting for 50% of total alkaloid content. Corydaline, an analogue of dehydrocorydaline, also occurred in high amount in CR ethanol extract.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2. CR Extracts Inhibit Expression of Proinflammatory Cytokines</title><p>Before measurement for anti-inflammatory activity, the effect of CR extracts on cell viability in RAW 264.7 cells was firstly determined by MTT assay. By comparing to the control (only DMSO treatment), CR extracts of water and 25%, 50%, and 75% ethanol fraction showed no significant effect on RAW 264.7 cell viability at concentration not more than 30&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure S1</xref>). At concentration not more than 20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL, the CR extract of 100% ethanol showed no significant effect on RAW 264.7 cell viability. To compare anti-inflammatory activity of CR extracts, different concentrations of CR extracts with no cytotoxicity were chosen for further experiments. Similarly, different concentrations of CR alkaloids, for example, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine, were applied onto cultured RAW 264.7 cells for 24 hours, followed by MTT cell viability assay. Thus, the nontoxic doses of these extracts or alkaloids were used in the following culture experiments.</p><p>RAW 264.7 macrophage is often used as inflammatory cell model, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines, for example, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, could be stimulated markedly by applied LPS. Cultured macrophages were incubated with CR extracts in 24-well plates, followed by adding LPS (20&#x02009;ng/mL). The proinflammatory cytokines in culture medium were measured by ELISA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the inhibitory activities of CR extracts from 5 to 20&#x02009;mg/mL on the LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines increased with an increase of alkaloid content, while CR extracts of water and 25% ethanol showed no inhibition on cytokine expression; CR extracts of 50% and 75% ethanol showed weak inhibition on cytokine expression. The CR extract of 100% ethanol showed good inhibition on the LPS-induced expressions of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The cytokine suppression was increased in accordance with the amount of ethanol in extracting solvent, as well as dose of applied herbal extracts. Dexamethasone was used as a positive control.</p><p>The mRNA expressions of proinflammatory cytokines in RAW 264.7 cells, determined by quantitative real-time PCR, were markedly induced by LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In LPS-treated cultures, application of ethanolic CR extract suppressed the expressions of mRNAs encoding TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>, which were in dose-dependent manners. The ethanolic CR extract at 20&#x02009;mg/mL fully suppressed the inflammation, triggered by applied LPS: this robust suppression was similar to that of dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). As seen from the alkaloid composition of CR extract, the quaternary protoberberine alkaloids were the main components in CR. Besides, dehydrocorydaline was the highest abundant component among CR quaternary protoberberine alkaloids. Therefore, it was strongly indicated that dehydrocorydaline and other quaternary protoberberine alkaloids could be the major player in anti-inflammatory property of CR.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3"><title>3.3. Dehydrocorydaline and Its Analogues Inhibit Expression of Proinflammatory Cytokines</title><p>The CR alkaloids, for example, columbamine, palmatine, glaucine, and berberine, are known to have anti-inflammatory activity [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Dehydrocorydaline and corydaline are the most abundant alkaloid in CR. However, the anti-inflammatory activity or mechanism of dehydrocorydaline and corydaline, as well as its closely related analogues corydalmine, was less studied. Although corydalmine was not detected in our CR extracts, this alkaloid was reported in CR extracts. Thus, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine were selected and tested for inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine expression. The cell viability of CR alkaloid was determined by MTT assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure S1</xref>, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine showed no significant effect on macrophage at concentrations of 20, 90, and 120&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>M, respectively. Therefore, the maximal concentration of alkaloids in the following experiments should not be higher than their toxic concentration.</p><p>Cultured macrophages were incubated with the alkaloids in 24-well plates followed by using LPS to activate cell inflammation. The noncytotoxic dosages of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine were applied in LPS-treated macrophages. In LPS-treated cultures, the applied alkaloids suppressed the protein and mRNA expressions of TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in dose-dependent manners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Dehydrocorydaline, the highest abundant alkaloid in CR extracts, showed robust effect of anti-inflammation. The expression of IL-6 in LPS-treated cultures was downregulated by dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine: this suppression was revealed in both mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>). Moreover, the mRNA expression of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> in LPS-treated macrophages was suppressed by applied dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>). Therefore, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine suppressed the inflammation at different magnitudes, that is, reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines. Besides, the expression of mRNA was more sensitive to that of the protein in responding to alkaloid treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4"><title>3.4.

In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory pathway of alkaloids in cultured RAW 264.7 cells, the expressions of I<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> protein and pNF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B-Luc were determined by western blot and luciferase assay. In LPS-treated cultures, application of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine promoted the expression of I<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> in a dose-dependent manner: the maximal induction was robust, as good as that of dexamethasone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>). In this activation, corydaline showed the best result. In pNF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B-Luc transfected cultures, the applied LPS induced the luciferase activity by &#x0223c;20 folds. The induction was markedly suppressed by dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine in dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>). Here, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine showed better regulation in suppressing pNF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B-Luc activity in RAW 264.7 cells.</p><p>The translocation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B into nucleus contributes to inflammatory responses by upregulating transcription of key inflammatory genes. To further confirm anti-inflammatory mechanism of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine on NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B signaling, the nuclear translocation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B in drug-treated RAW 264.7 cells was determined by immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>CR is a common TCM being used in treating varieties of pain. Except the usage in relieving pain, the herbal extracts of CR, or its alkaloids, are commonly used in treatment of myocardial ischemia, rheumatism, and dysmenorrhea, and most of these medical problems are involving different types of inflammation [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Alkaloids are commonly found in herbal medicines that are used for anti-inflammation. For example, berberine, originated from <italic>Coptis chinensis</italic> Franch. and <italic>Phellodendron chinense</italic> Schneid., inhibited expression of proinflammatory cytokine by modulating Sirt1/NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B signaling [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Palmatine and columbamine, originated from <italic>Tinospora sagittata</italic> (Oliv.) Gagnep, inhibited production of nitric oxide and activation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Glaucine, isolated from <italic>Glaucium flavum</italic> Crantz. (Papaveraceae), reduced proinflammatory cytokine, and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) by Toll-like receptor-mediated signaling [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Stylopine, isolated from <italic>Corydalis impatiens</italic>, reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokine by inhibiting NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B and MAPK signaling [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In line with other alkaloid-containing herbs, CR has been shown to reduce the acetic acid-induced mice writhing and relieve ear swelling and neuropathic pain [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while rotundinum, the quality chemical marker of CR (described in &#x0003c;&#x0003c;Pharmacopoeia of P.R. China&#x0003e;&#x0003e;, 2020), is able to inhibit the secretion of proinflammatory cytokine by blocking MAPK phosphorylation [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, corydalmine, and isocorypalmine are the representing alkaloids in analgesic effect of CR usage [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; however, due to different mechanism of pain and inflammation, the signaling of anti-inflammatory property of these alkaloids has not been fully revealed.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory potency of CR extracts with high amount of alkaloids was stronger than that of CR extracts with low amount of alkaloids, that is, the CR extract of 100% ethanol fraction significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokine with a good dose-effect relationship. In line with this notion, our current results showed that the abundant alkaloid (dehydrocorydaline and corydaline) demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-induced macrophages. Besides, as seen from Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, the protoberberine alkaloids with quaternary nuclear structure were the main components of CR, in which dehydrocorydaline was the highest abundant component, accounting for about half of total alkaloid. Interestingly, the potency of dehydrocorydaline in suppressing expression of proinflammatory cytokines was stronger than corydaline and corydalmine. Therefore, similar to the structure-activity relationship of protoberberine alkaloids from <italic>Corydalis</italic> species on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it is speculated that the quaternary nuclear structure with positively charged nitrogen atom (N+) could enhance the anti-inflammatory activity of protoberberine alkaloids. Besides the protoberberine scaffold, the methylenedioxy substitutions at R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 positions of benzene ring are also strongly correlated with the anti-inflammatory activity of protoberberine alkaloids, which however need to be studied further.</p><p>AChE is an enzyme to hydrolyze acetylcholine in cholinergic synapses, and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>7nAChR is an important inflammation-related receptor in many kinds of immune cells [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These two cholinergic molecules have been known to play important role in &#x0201c;cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP)&#x0201d; by regulating cholinergic anti-inflammatory response [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which includes the release of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, IL-6, and IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) in macrophage by controlling the level of acetylcholine and activation of <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>7nAChR. In addition, recent studies have shown that the inflammation, induced by LPS, could upregulate expression of AChE in macrophage [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In parallel, AChE-targeting microRNA-132 could attenuate inflammation by reducing AChE level in immune cells [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, the regulation of AChE expression could be triggered by cyclic AMP responding element acting on the AChE gene promoter, and this regulation could be induced by phytochemicals [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Many alkaloids, for example, huperzine A from <italic>Huperzia serrata</italic>, fangchinoline from <italic>Stephania tetrandra,</italic> and coptisine from <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, showed good inhibitory activity on AChE [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Here, most of the CR alkaloids showed AChE inhibitory activity at different magnitudes [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between AChE and inflammation inhibition, that is, quaternary ammonium alkaloids (e.g., berberine, palmatine, dehydrocorydaline, and columbamine), having strong AChE inhibitory and anti-inflammatory effects compared to their hydrogenated tertiary amine alkaloids (e.g., canadine, rotundinum, corydaline, and isocorypalmine). Thus, the anti-inflammatory function of CR alkaloids could be, at least partly, contributed by its AChE inhibition, which needs to be studied further.</p><p>Alkaloids are a group of important naturally components in medicinal herbs. As the major active component, the amount of alkaloid in CR could account for 0.5&#x02013;1% of total weight [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As calculated from yields of CR extracts and alkaloid content in CR extracts, ethanol should be considered as the best solvent in total extractive yield and total alkaloid, which is much better than that of water [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Decoction, powder, pill, elixir, and ointment are common forms of TCM preparations during clinical application. From over 1,000 CR-contained herbal prescriptions described in &#x0201c;Dictionary of TCM Prescriptions,&#x0201d; the frequency of CR used in crude powder is 2.6 times higher than that of CR used in a form of water decoction. Besides, among 256 CR-contained Chinese patent medicine prescriptions in &#x0201c;Compilation of National Proprietary Chinese Medicine Standards,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Ministry of Health Drug Standards, Chinese Medicine Formulation,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Pharmacopoeia of P.R. China,&#x0201d; the frequency of CR being used in form of crude power or ethanol extract is about 2 times higher than that of CR being used in water extract. Therefore, the historical usage of CR, in powder or in ethanol extract, strongly supports the current results that alkaloids could be the active components of this herb.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Alkaloids are the major components in CR extracts, and the anti-inflammatory property of CR extracts increased in parallel to the amount of alkaloid in CR extracts. Besides, the highest abundant, quality chemical, and/or analgesic alkaloids, including dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine, demonstrated good anti-inflammatory activity in reducing the release of proinflammatory cytokine and suppressing the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokine. In addition, their application promoted I<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> expression, suppressed activation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B transcriptional element, and reduced the nuclear accumulation of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B. Therefore, the results supported that the alkaloids were the major anti-inflammatory active compounds in CR extracts, and the anti-inflammation pathway of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine was firstly revealed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was funded by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M653087), Shenzhen Science and Technology Innovation Committee (JCYJ20170413173747440, ZDSYS2017 07281432317, and JCYJ20180306174903174), Zhongshan Municipal Bureau of Science and Technology (ZSST20SC03); Guangzhou Science and Technology Committee Research Grant (GZSTI16SC02 and GZSTI17SC02), GBA Institute of Collaborate Innovation (GICI-022), Special Project of Foshan University of Science and Technology in 2019 (FSUST19-SRI10), Hong Kong RGC Theme-Based Research Scheme (T13-605/18-W), and Hong Kong Innovation Technology Fund (UIM/340, UIM/385, ITS/500/18FP, and TCPD/17-9 and TUYF19SC02, PD18SC01, and HMRF18SC06).</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplementary-material-1"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><label>Supplementary Materials</label><caption><p>Figure S1: the cell viability of CR extracts and alkaloids. The effects of CR extracts and alkaloids in cell viability. RAW 264.7 cells in 96-well plates were treated with the different doses of CR extracts by water and different fractions of ethanol (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) for 24&#x02009;hours, respectively. The cell viability of CR extract-treated macrophages was performed by MTT assay. The cell viability after treating CR alkaloids (dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine) was determined.
