<p>Alkaloids are a group of important naturally components in medicinal herbs. As the major active component, the amount of alkaloid in CR could account for 0.5–1% of total weight [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As calculated from yields of CR extracts and alkaloid content in CR extracts, ethanol should be considered as the best solvent in total extractive yield and total alkaloid, which is much better than that of water [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Decoction, powder, pill, elixir, and ointment are common forms of TCM preparations during clinical application. From over 1,000 CR-contained herbal prescriptions described in “Dictionary of TCM Prescriptions,” the frequency of CR used in crude powder is 2.6 times higher than that of CR used in a form of water decoction. Besides, among 256 CR-contained Chinese patent medicine prescriptions in “Compilation of National Proprietary Chinese Medicine Standards,” “Ministry of Health Drug Standards, Chinese Medicine Formulation,” and “Pharmacopoeia of P.R. China,” the frequency of CR being used in form of crude power or ethanol extract is about 2 times higher than that of CR being used in water extract. Therefore, the historical usage of CR, in powder or in ethanol extract, strongly supports the current results that alkaloids could be the active components of this herb.
