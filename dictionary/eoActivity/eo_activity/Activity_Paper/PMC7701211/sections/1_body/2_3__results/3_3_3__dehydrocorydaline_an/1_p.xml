<p>The CR alkaloids, for example, columbamine, palmatine, glaucine, and berberine, are known to have anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Dehydrocorydaline and corydaline are the most abundant alkaloid in CR. However, the anti-inflammatory activity or mechanism of dehydrocorydaline and corydaline, as well as its closely related analogues corydalmine, was less studied. Although corydalmine was not detected in our CR extracts, this alkaloid was reported in CR extracts. Thus, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine were selected and tested for inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine expression. The cell viability of CR alkaloid was determined by MTT assay. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure S1</xref>, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine showed no significant effect on macrophage at concentrations of 20, 90, and 120 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively. Therefore, the maximal concentration of alkaloids in the following experiments should not be higher than their toxic concentration.
