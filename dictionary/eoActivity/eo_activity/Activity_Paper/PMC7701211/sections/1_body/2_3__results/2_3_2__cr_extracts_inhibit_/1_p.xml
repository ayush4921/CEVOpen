<p>Before measurement for anti-inflammatory activity, the effect of CR extracts on cell viability in RAW 264.7 cells was firstly determined by MTT assay. By comparing to the control (only DMSO treatment), CR extracts of water and 25%, 50%, and 75% ethanol fraction showed no significant effect on RAW 264.7 cell viability at concentration not more than 30

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, the CR extract of 100% ethanol showed no significant effect on RAW 264.7 cell viability. To compare anti-inflammatory activity of CR extracts, different concentrations of CR extracts with no cytotoxicity were chosen for further experiments. Similarly, different concentrations of CR alkaloids, for example, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine, were applied onto cultured RAW 264.7 cells for 24 hours, followed by MTT cell viability assay. Thus, the nontoxic doses of these extracts or alkaloids were used in the following culture experiments.
