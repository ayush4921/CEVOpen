<p>Cultured macrophages were incubated with the alkaloids in 24-well plates followed by using LPS to activate cell inflammation. The noncytotoxic dosages of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine were applied in LPS-treated macrophages. In LPS-treated cultures, the applied alkaloids suppressed the protein and mRNA expressions of TNF-

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Dehydrocorydaline, the highest abundant alkaloid in CR extracts, showed robust effect of anti-inflammation. The expression of IL-6 in LPS-treated cultures was downregulated by dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine: this suppression was revealed in both mRNA and protein levels of IL-6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>). Moreover, the mRNA expression of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> in LPS-treated macrophages was suppressed by applied dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(c)</xref>). Therefore, dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine suppressed the inflammation at different magnitudes, that is, reducing production of proinflammatory cytokines. Besides, the expression of mRNA was more sensitive to that of the protein in responding to alkaloid treatment.
