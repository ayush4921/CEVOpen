<p>The cultured macrophage cells were placed on glass coverslips and treated with dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine at concentrations of 20, 60, and 90 
 <italic>µ</italic>M, respectively. In parallel, the positive control cells (treated with dexamethasone and LPS) and negative control cells (not treated with drug and LPS) were performed. After being washed with PBS, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. Then, the cells were blocked by 0.5% BSA with 0.2% Triton 
 <italic>X</italic>-100 for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were incubated with anti-NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B antibody (Abcam) at 1 : 500 for overnight at 4°C, followed by the Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) together with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining (5 mg/mL) for 2 hours at room temperature (Sigma). After being washed, the samples were then examined by a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.
