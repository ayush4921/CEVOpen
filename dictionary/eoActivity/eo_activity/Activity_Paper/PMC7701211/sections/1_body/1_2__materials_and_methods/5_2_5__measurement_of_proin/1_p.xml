<p>The proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6) secreted by RAW 264.7 cells were measured by Mouse/Rat Valukine ELISA Kit (Shanghai Univ Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The cells were seeded in 24-well plate with 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well for sticking cultivation. The cultured RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with different concentrations of CR extracts (5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/mL), dehydrocorydaline (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), corydaline (10, 15, 30, and 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and corydalmine (15, 30, 60, and 90 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) for 2 hours and then treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) at 20 ng/mL for 6 hours to induce cellular inflammation. The positive control cells were pretreated with dexamethasone (Dex; Solarbio Life Sciences) at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and treated with LPS; the negative control cells were not treated with drug and LPS. After that, the cultured medium was collected to measure the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6) by measuring the absorbance difference between 450 and 570 nm using Thermo Scientific Multiscan FC. Meanwhile, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the cell plate was frozen at −80°C refrigerator for quantitative real-time PCR or western blot analysis. Protein concentration was measured by Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent (Hercules, CA).
