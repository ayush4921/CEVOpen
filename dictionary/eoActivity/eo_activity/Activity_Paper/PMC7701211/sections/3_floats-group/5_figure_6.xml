  <p>CR alkaloids regulate I
   <italic>κ</italic>B
   <italic>α</italic> and NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B. (a) Cultured RAW 264.7 cells in 24-well plates were treated with different doses of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine, as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The cells were harvested for expression of I
   <italic>κ</italic>B
   <italic>α</italic> by western blot (upper panel). The expression of 
   <italic>α</italic>-tubulin served as a loading control. Quantitation of protein bands was shown (lower panel). (b) Cultured 264.7 cells in 24-well plates were transiently transfected with pNF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B-luc for 24 hours; after that, they were pretreated with alkaloids as in (a). Then, the cell lysates were collected for luciferase assay. Data are expressed as fold of change to basal (no drug), in mean ± SEM, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3, each with triplicate samples.
