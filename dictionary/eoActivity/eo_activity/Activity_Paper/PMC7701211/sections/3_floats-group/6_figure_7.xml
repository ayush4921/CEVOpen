  <p>CR alkaloids suppress LPS-induced translocation of NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B. Cultured RAW 264.7 cells were treated with dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine at concentrations of 20, 60, and 90 
   <italic>µ</italic>M, respectively, as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Immunofluorescence staining was applied to observe the localization of NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B p65 by antibody (red fluorescence) and in nuclei staining by DAPI (blue fluorescence) in RAW 264.7 cells. Asterisks indicated nuclei with NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B staining, and also the enlarged cell was in the bottom right corner.
