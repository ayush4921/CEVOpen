  <p>CR alkaloids inhibit transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. Cultured RAW 264.7 cells in 24-well plates were treated with different doses of dehydrocorydaline, corydaline, and corydalmine, as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The cultured medium was collected and tested for protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines by ELISA, and the cells were harvested for mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines by real-time PCR.
