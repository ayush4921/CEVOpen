<p id="p0050">For evaluation of cytotoxicity on murine macrophages, we determined the CC
 <sub>50</sub> (cytotoxicity concentration for 50% of cells) of extracts on macrophages. Murine cells were grown at 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells /mL in 96- well micro plates (Lab-Tek, Nunc, USA) and allowed to adhere for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The non-adherent cells were removed by washing with medium, and 190 μl RPMI-1640 complete medium was added to each well of cells and incubated at the same conditions as mentioned. After that, macrophages were exposed with 10 μl of different concentrations of extracts (1–1000 μg/mL) and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h. Finally, the cytotoxicity level was evaluated using the colorimetric assay with MTT test as earlier defined in the promastigote susceptibility assay.
