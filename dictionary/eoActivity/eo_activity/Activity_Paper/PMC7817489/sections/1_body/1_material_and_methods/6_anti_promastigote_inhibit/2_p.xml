<p id="p0055">To evaluate the effects of these plant extracts on L. 
 <italic>tropica</italic> promastigotes, colorimetric cell viability assay was used for estimation of viable cells in multi-well micro plates as described elsewhere (
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Shokri et al., 2012</xref>). The MTT solution (3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide, Sigma Aldrich, USA) consists of tetrazolium which is positively charged and is able to readily penetrates viable cells to reduce the soluble form of MTT into a colored insoluble formozan. Briefly, 100 μl of logarithmic phase promastigotes (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml) were added to a 96-well tissue culture plate. Then, 100 μl of various concentrations of three methanolic extracts (dissolved in RPMI-1640 medium) and MA reference drug (1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/mL) was added to each well and incubated at 25 ± 1 °C for 48 h. Afterward, 10 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well following incubation at 25 °C for 4 h. For producing a purple color and stop the reaction, cold isopropanol was added to formazan crystals, as a solvent. Finally, the optical density (OD) of each well was read at 495 nm by an ELISA reader (BioTek-ELX800, USA). Cultured promastigotes with no drug was used as untreated control and medium with no promastigotes and drugs used as blank. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values) were calculated for all the tested extracts by using Probit test in SPSS software version 24.
