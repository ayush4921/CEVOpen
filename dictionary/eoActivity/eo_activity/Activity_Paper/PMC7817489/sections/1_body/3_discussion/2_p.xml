<p id="p0095">To our knowledge, this is the first investigation on the leishmanicidal effects of these three plant extracts. In the present study the methanolic extracts demonstrated a good index of antileishmanial activity against both stages of L. 
 <italic>tropica</italic> as they proved to be effective in inhibiting the replication rate of promastigotes and intra-macrophage amastigotes. The MIC was 1000 μg/ml for the extracts and also Glucantime® which expressed a similar inhibitory action when the overall potential strength is being considered. Additionally, this leishmanicidal activity could be confirmed by the low OD or IC
 <sub>50</sub> values.
