<p id="p0085">The results showed that different concentrations of three methanolic extracts and Glucantime® decreased the growth rate of amastigotes (clinical stage). Our plant extracts demonstrated significant reduction in the mean number of amastigotes in cells compared to untreated control at all concentrations, except at 1 μg/mL (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01). Besides, 
 <italic>Q. velutina</italic> represented more reducing effect on the amastigotes in comparison to the other extracts and Glucantim®e, especially at 1000 μg/mL concentrations (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01) (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Also, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for 
 <italic>Q. velutina</italic> was 51.2 μg/mL, followed by 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> 95.2 μg/mL and 
 <italic>N. tabacum</italic> 118.3 μg/mL against amastigotes, whereas this value was 236.3 μg/mL for Glucantime® as control drug (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All extracts showed significant reduction in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of amastigotes compared to Glucantime® (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001), as 
 <italic>Q. velutina</italic> showed the lowest one.
