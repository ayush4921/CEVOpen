<p>Hashemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] evaluated the sun protection factor (SPF), antioxidant capacity, as well as flavonoid and phenol contents of methanolic extracts of petals of 
 <italic>E. amoenum.</italic> The extraction was achieved using three different methods (percolation, Soxhlet, and ultrasonically). The phenol and flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity of these extracts were evaluated using the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, aluminium chloride methods, and DPPH assays. The results showed that with the assistance of percolation, the petal extracts showed the highest antioxidant activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 162.3 ± 4.1 μg/mL) and highest flavonoid contents (42.64 ± 1.6 QE/g) but the lowest SPF value (0.124 ± 0.00 at 2 mg/mL). There was no correlation between SPF and the content of phenols, flavonoids, or antioxidant properties in 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic>. Interestingly, although this correlation is absent in 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic>, Hashemi et al. reports a significant correlation between SPF and phenolic and flavonoid content in other plant species.
