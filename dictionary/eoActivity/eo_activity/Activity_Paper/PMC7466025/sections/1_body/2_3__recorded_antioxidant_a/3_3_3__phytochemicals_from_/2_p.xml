<p>Numerous reports have looked at the determination of the presence of phenolics in specific species in the genus 
 <italic>Echium</italic>. Saponins and tannins were found within the aerial organs of 
 <italic>E. italicum</italic> by Fazly Bazzaz et al. [
 <xref rid="B74-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Similarly, Chaouche, T. [
 <xref rid="B75-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] revealed that phenols (flavonoids and tannins), as well as steroids (saponins, sterols, and triterpenes) exist in both the leaves and roots of 
 <italic>E. pycnanthum.</italic> Furthermore, the petals of 
 <italic>E. amoenum</italic> contained anthocyanidin (13% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>), flavonoid aglycons (0.15% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>), volatile oil (0.05% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) with Î´-cadinene (24.25% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which certainly could account for the vast ethnomedicinal uses of this particular species. Sousa et al. [
 <xref rid="B76-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] evaluated the antioxidant capacity of bee pollen extracts, in particular flavonols and anthocyanins extracted from 
 <italic>E. plantagineum.</italic> In this study, oxidative stress models were conducted in vitro (Caco-2 cells induced by 
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide (
 <italic>t</italic>-BHP)). Interestingly, the isolated anthocyanins moderately impeded antioxidant potential, while the isolated flavonols partly protected the Caco-2 cells under oxidative stress.
