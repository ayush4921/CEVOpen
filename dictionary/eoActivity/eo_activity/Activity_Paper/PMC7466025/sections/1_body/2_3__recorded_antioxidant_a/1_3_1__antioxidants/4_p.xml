<p>In Serbia, six antioxidant activity assays, including metal-chelating (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>), FRAP, phosphomolybdenum method, OH radical, DPPH, and ABTS radical scavenging activity were carried out on 
 <italic>E. vulgare</italic> and 
 <italic>E. rubrum.</italic> It was subsequently determined that 
 <italic>E. vulgare</italic> contains higher antioxidant activity, including higher TPC and TFC values [
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-09-00722" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Again, this outcome could explain the rich ethnomedicinal use of 
 <italic>E. vulgare</italic> in the Mediterranean area for centuries.
