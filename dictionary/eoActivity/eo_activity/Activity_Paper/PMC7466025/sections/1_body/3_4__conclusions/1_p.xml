<p>Plant-based extracts and phytochemicals have played a major role in treating human diseases. Despite currently being used as ornamental and garden plants, numerous 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species have been used for millennia as folk medicine in the Mediterranean area. Petals, leaves, roots, and aerial parts have been used for a wide range of diseases, such as respiratory problems, ulcers, mental health-related issues, and wound healing. Recent studies have shown that both crude extracts and isolated compounds of 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species exhibit promising pharmacological activities, with bioactive compounds, such as flavonoids, terpenoids, saponin, phenolic acids, and naphthoquinones, present. These bioactive compounds, either used by themselves or as mixtures, correlate well with the reported traditional ethnomedicinal uses.
