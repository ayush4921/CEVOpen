<p>This review has identified and discussed potential antioxidants that the various 
 <italic>Echium</italic> species possess. Moreover, the reported ethnomedicinal uses (available in English) have been outlined and correlated this with modern antioxidant research for the first time, which is convincingly connected by isolation of therapeutically relevant phytochemicals. Furthermore, for the first time, this review has listed all of the phytochemicals with antioxidant activity isolated from 
 <italic>Echium</italic> and discussed many of the more promising compounds concerning ethnomedicinal uses and future research. What is apparent from the literature is that further investigation into compound isolation and elucidation is required for more than half of the recognised species. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo biological antioxidative determination and evaluation is also missing from the literature for most species, as well as further categorisation of the mechanism of antioxidant action. The gaps that we have identified will allow exploitation of the antioxidant properties of this genus for formulation into the potential treatments of a wide range of common illnesses and disease states and subsequently, will lead to the significant therapeutic application of preparation based on 
 <italic>Echium</italic> in the future.
