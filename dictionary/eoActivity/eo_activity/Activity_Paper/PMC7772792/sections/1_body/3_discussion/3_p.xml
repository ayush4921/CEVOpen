<p id="par0145">Antioxidant evaluation of Tb fruit Eth and AQ extracts and EA showed significant radical scavenging activities during 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ABTS radical scavenging and FRAP assays. The radical ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> is a chemically stable chromophore over a wide pH range that shows maximum absorbance in the wavelength range of 600−750 nm. ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical is soluble in aqueous and organic media; hence it is useful for determining antioxidant activity of water-soluble and fat-soluble samples [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Test samples exhibited radical quenching ability in a concentration-dependent manner and blue colored chromophore was reduced to colorless ABTS. Therefore, the degree of discoloration made it possible to evaluate the percentage of inhibition of the ABTS cation radical by test compounds, which is determined as a function of the antioxidant concentration and the reaction time [
