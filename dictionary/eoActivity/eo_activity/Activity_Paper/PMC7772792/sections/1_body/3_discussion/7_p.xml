<p id="par0165">During the study period, daily administration of DCF for continuous 21 days led to 18.5 % decrease in body weight along with a significant rise (4.3 %) in relative liver weight signifying the adverse effect of DCF intoxication in rats (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). It has been reported that DCF causes gastric ulceration due to which the animals find it difficult to have food thereby resulting in malnutrition [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The rise in liver weight was however observed to be related to a concomitant increase in the level of serum markers such as SGOT, SGPT, GGT, ALP, LDH, creatinine, and uric acid (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2, 3</xref>) Other studies on NSAIDs-induced toxicity have also reported an elevated levels of hepatic markers [

 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, treatment with Tb fruit extracts and EA accounted for considerable recovery in body weight and liver weight indicating the hepatoprotective effect of Tb phytoconstituents against DCF induced hepatotoxicity (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A decline in total protein (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A) was an indicator of massive necrosis of the hepatocyte as well as altered hepatic functions [
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The level of total protein in serum also increased significantly coupled with a reduction in SGOT, SGPT, GGT, ALP, creatinine, uric acid, and LDH levels under influence of test compounds which substantiated the hepatoprotective action of EA and Tb fruit Eth and AQ extracts (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2, 3</xref>). SLM treatment produced best hepatoprotective effect against DCF mediated toxicity as indicated by recovery of the pathophysiological parameters towards normal level in group III rats. Hepatoprotective activities of EA was comparable to the activities shown by SLM. This fact further provided support to the little lower hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities of Tb AQ and Eth extracts as they possessed relatively lower amount of bioactive compounds as compared to EA [
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The concentration of total EA derivatives in fruit is reported to be four times higher than that of pure EA [
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, amount of total EA derivatives in test extracts (200 mg/kg) was computed to be 18.4 mg/kg which is about half of the amount of EA (40 mg/kg) fed to rats. Therefore, comparatively lower activity observed in the fruit extracts could be correlated with the lesser amount of EA content in the extracts. Moreover, solubility of EA is greater in ethyl acetate as compared to water. This fact further corroborates the higher biological activity observed in the Eth extract. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of EA might be associated with the direct scavenging action on DCF generated ROS and indirectly through the induction of antioxidant enzymes and thereby protecting hepatocytes against ROS mediated liver injury [
