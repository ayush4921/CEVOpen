<p id="par0110">Antiinflammatory activity of extracts and EA was investigated by inhibition of heat-induced albumin denaturation. Both the extracts and EA exhibited concentration-dependent anti-inflammatory activity. EA exhibited superior activity (IC50 7.64 μg/mL) as compared to AQ (IC50 36.22 μg/mL) and Eth (IC50 28.03 μg/mL) extracts by inhibiting the heat-induced denaturation of albumin more effectively as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Maximum inhibition of albumin denaturation by EA (86.62 ± 0.65 %) was observed at the concentration of 16.7 μg/mL while AQ and Eth extract produced 67.57 % and 77.67 % inhibition, respectively at the concentration of 50 μg/mL. DCF, a standard anti‐inflammatory drug, showed comparatively higher anti-inflammatory activity (95.56 ± 0.56 %) with lower IC50 value (5.66 μg/mL).
