<p id="par0130">Antioxidant status of liver tissue was monitored by evaluating the activities of CAT and SOD in rats administered with DCF and test compounds. Activities of both the antioxidant enzymes declined substantially after three weeks of DCF treatment in Group II rats indicating toxicity (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A-B). In quantitative term activities of catalase and SOD were found to be 6.66 U/mg and 28.11U/mg, respectively in control rats which reduced to 2.54 U/mg and 9.48 U/mg, respectively under the influence of DCF (Group II) showing 34–38 % of the original activity. SLM treatment augmented the activities of catalase and SOD up to 80 % of the normal values. Almost similar enhancement in enzyme activities was obtained with EA treatment (76 % of normal values). Appreciable recovery (66–72 %) in the activity of both the antioxidant enzymes was observed with the treatment of Eth extract (Group VI). AQ extract accounted for comparatively lower recovery (56–60 %) at the same dose (
