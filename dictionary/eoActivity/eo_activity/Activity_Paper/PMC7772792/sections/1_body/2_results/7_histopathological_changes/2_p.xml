<p id="par0135">Histological sections of the normal rat liver slices revealed a normal liver lobular architecture with central vein and radiating hepatic cords accompanied by intact hepatocytes with sinusoidal spaces and evenly distributed cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). DCF treated group exhibited noticeable morphological alterations and fibrosis, as shown by disruption of the tissue architecture, extension of fibers, large fibrous septa formation, pseudo-lobe separation, and fibers accumulation. This is evidenced by massive hepatocellular degeneration, necrosis, sinusoidal dilatation, infiltration of inflammatory cell and cytoplasmic vacuolation (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). However, concurrent administration of EA, Tb fruit AQ and Eth extracts with DCF accounted for the reasonable improvement in the hepatic architecture as observed by reduction in liver damage and associated hepatic injuries by suppressing hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis and thereby significantly improving liver structure and function (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D-F). Administration of SLM, the standard drug, showed comparatively better hepatoprotective potential (
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). The histopathological improvement observed in liver slices administered with EA, Tb extracts and SLM in DCF treated rats finds direct correlation with the liver weight, body weight and serum liver function markers along with tissue antioxidants.
