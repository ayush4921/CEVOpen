<p>The effects of the solvent fractions of B. 
 <italic>abyssinica</italic> on OGTT are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The BGL of all groups before solvent fraction, GLC, and distilled water administration didn`t show a significant difference as compared to each other. However, after 2000 mg/kg glucose administration all groups of mice showed a significant (p &lt; 0.001) elevation in blood glucose level at thirty minutes as compared to the baseline fasting blood glucose level irrespective of the treatments received, this indicates the induction of hyperglycemia by glucose administration. Administration of B.
 <italic>abyssinica</italic> at a dose of AQF 200 mg/kg (p&lt;0.05), AQF 400mg/kg (p&lt;0.001), EAF 200mg/kg (p&lt;0.01), and GLC 5mg/kg (p&lt;0.001) significantly reduced the BGL following 1-hour post-treatment with the solvent fractions and the standard drug as compared to the negative control. Likewise, the higher doses of the solvent fractions (400mg/kg) significantly (p&lt;0.001) dropped the BGL following 2- and 3-hours post-treatment as compared to negative control groups.
