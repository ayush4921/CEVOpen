<p>Between-group analysis showed that all tested doses of the aqueous fraction (AQF100 mg/kg, AQF200 mg/kg, and AQF400 mg/kg) revealed a statically significant improvement in serum lipid profiles: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p&lt;0.001); serum total cholesterol (p&lt;0.001); and serum triglyceride (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001, respectively for the three doses); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, respectively); and only AQF400 mg/kg displayed a significant (p&lt;0.05) improvement in serum lipid profile of very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when compared with the diabetic control group. Thus, treatment with leaf aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> and glibenclamide 5 mg/kg to diabetic mice significantly and dose-dependently improved TC, TG, and LDL-c, and VLDL-c levels as compared to the diabetic control group. Although considerably increase in serum HDL-cholesterol level was shown in the aqueous fraction of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> treated groups compared to the diabetic control group (
