<p>In the normoglycemic model, the mice were treated with a single dose ranging from 100–400mg/kg of aqueous solvent fraction, ethyl acetate solvent fraction, and GLC 5mg/kg for each group containing six mice showed a significant drop in BGL of normoglycemic mice. In a previous study, both the crude and its solvent fractions (chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous) showed a statically significant alpha-amylase inhibition activity at different tested doses.
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This hypoglycemic effect of the solvent fractions could be because of the inactivation of the α-amylase activity. In the previous experimental study, GLC can cause hypoglycemia effect through stimulation of insulin secretion from the pancreatic β cells.

 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> could possess an insulin-like effect/stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas. However, the lower doses of the ethyl acetate solvent fraction and the aqueous solvent fraction of 
 <italic>Bersama abyssinica</italic> leaves did not show any significant hypoglycemic effect after the solvent fractions were administered. The current findings are in agreement with previously reported similar studies.
