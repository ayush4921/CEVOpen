<p>In the repeated daily doses, the solvent fractions of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> and the standard drug have shown a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose levels as compared to the diabetic control group. All the tested doses of the solvent fractions (100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg) caused a maximum drop in fasting BGL at the 14th days, 33.29%, 38.59%, 52.71%, and 59.66%, respectively for AQF100, AQF200, AQF400, and GLC 5mg/kg (

Similarly, glibenclamide reduces the fasting BGL by blockage of ATP sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, leads to membrane depolarization, activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, a rise in cytosolic (Ca2+), and then release of insulin in the pancreas.
