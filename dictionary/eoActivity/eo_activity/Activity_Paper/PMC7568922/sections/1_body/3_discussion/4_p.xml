<p>After oral administration of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic> solvent fractions at all tested doses (100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg) to glucose challenged mice exhibited a significant (p &lt;0.001) drop in blood glucose level at 1- and 2-hours post-treatment as compared to the negative control. Likewise, GLC 5mg/kg showed a significant reduction in blood glucose levels early from the 30 minutes onwards (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This indicates that the solvent fractions can effectively control the elevated blood glucose level, showing its possible benefit to lower postprandial hyperglycemia and related complications of DM. Regulator control of postprandial hyperglycemia is the most common approach for the management of DM. OGTT measures the body’s ability to utilize glucose and it is seen as the “gold standard” in diagnosing diabetes mellitus.
 <xref rid="cit0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The observed activity may fairly be a due reduction of glucose absorption into the bloodstreams via inhibition of α-amylase as a previous study supports the α-amylase inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>B. abyssinica</italic>.
