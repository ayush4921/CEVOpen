<p>To induce the wound, the mice were primarily anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration route using 50 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine. Following the induction of anaesthesia, dorsal region of each mouse was shaven for surgical actions. A circular wound model was induced in a size of 7 mm using a surgical biopsy punch and per wound was inoculated by an aliquot of 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> suspension containing 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 26313) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853) in 50 μL phosphate-buffered saline (Farahpour et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Khezri et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Subsequently, animals were divided into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 18), as (group I) negative control group (NCG) that was administered commercial base ointment, (group II) positive control group that were treated with Mupirocin
 <sup>®</sup> (MG), and (groups III and IV) treated groups with therapeutic ointments containing 2 g and 4 g ZME mixed in NCG (2% and 4% ZMEO), respectively. Concerning the colonization of the bacteria, 24 h after the induction of the wounds, ointments were applied on wounds, once a day. In addition, according to the tissue sampling on days 3, 7, and 14 after the wounding, the animals in each group were divided into three subgroups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6).
