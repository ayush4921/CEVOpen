 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Al Doghaither et al., 2016</xref>). Analysis revealed that Zamzam water holds high concentrations of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and fluoride. It contains also arsenic and nitrate below the level of human consumption danger but above the standard limit of WHO (
