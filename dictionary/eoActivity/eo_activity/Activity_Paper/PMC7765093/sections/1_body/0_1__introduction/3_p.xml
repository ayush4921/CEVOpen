<p>Callus formation is one of the steps involved in in vitro plant propagation, and it has been used in both research and industrial applications. Several factors may influence the success of callus induction and multiplication of woody plants, which include the selection of suitable basal medium and plant growth regulators (PGRs). The correct concentration of PGRs is also crucial since different plant species require different conditions for callus growth [

A high ratio of auxin to cytokinin or cytokinin to auxin into the callus medium typically facilitates root and shoot regeneration, while a balanced ratio of auxin and cytokinin promotes callus induction [
