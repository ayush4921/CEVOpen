<p>All the experiments were conducted based on the Completely Randomized Design (CRD). The data were analyzed using Proc analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the significant differences between treatments using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS 9.4). The comparison of means was determined by Tukey’s multiple range tests at
