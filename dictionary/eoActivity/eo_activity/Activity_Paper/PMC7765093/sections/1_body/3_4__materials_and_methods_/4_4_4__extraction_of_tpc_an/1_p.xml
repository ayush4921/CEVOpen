<p>The callus grown on MS + 30 µM dicamba at week 3 was chosen for determination of TPC, TFC, and antioxidant activity since it showed the highest callus biomass. The extraction of callus was conducted based on the method described by Giri et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] with minor modification. The 200 mg fresh callus was weighed, ground using mortar and pestle, and extracted with 10 mL of 100% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) methanol. The mixture was kept at room temperature with continuous shaking (150 rpm) for 24 hours. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected and stored at 4 °C until further use. The samples were prepared in triplicate.
