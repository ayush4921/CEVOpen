<p>The TFC of the callus was determined by a method described by Adhikari et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] with minor modification. About 1 mL of the methanolic callus extract (as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4dot4-plants-09-01772">Section 4.4</xref>) was diluted to 5 mL with distilled water and mixed with 0.3 mL of 5% (w/v) sodium nitrite (NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>) solution. After 5 min, 0.3 mL of 10% (w/v) aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) solution was added. Then, 2 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was added prior to addition of distilled water up to a final volume of 10 mL. The absorbance of the mixture was determined at 510 nm. A standard curve of quercetin was plotted. The analysis was conducted in triplicate. The TFC was expressed as mg of quercetin equivalents per gram of fresh extract (mg QE/g FW).
