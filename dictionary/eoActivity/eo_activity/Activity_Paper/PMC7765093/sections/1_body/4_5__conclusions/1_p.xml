<p>In this report, the effectiveness of callus induction and multiplication of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> depends greatly on the types of culture media as well as types and concentrations of auxins used. For callus induction, the WPM medium supplemented with 16.56 µM picloram in dark condition showed the highest callus induction percentage. Meanwhile, the callus cultured on the MS basal medium supplemented with 30 µM dicamba exhibited the best callus proliferation with the highest fresh weight and dry weight recorded at week three. The TPC and TFC from the callus were found to have a correlation with the DPPH scavenging activity. Hence, the establishment of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus culture can be used as an approach to mass produce secondary metabolites, and therefore, may reduce overcollection of this plant in order to preserve its natural habitat as well as in other world areas.
