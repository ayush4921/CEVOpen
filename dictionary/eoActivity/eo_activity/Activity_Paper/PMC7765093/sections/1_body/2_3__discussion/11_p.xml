<p>The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>P. bullata</italic> callus was also expressed as ascorbic acid equivalent. This method was used to express the antioxidant activity for direct comparison with the well-known potent antioxidant that is widely distributed in plant materials [
 <xref rid="B62-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The higher the ascorbic acid equivalent value, the higher the antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The study by Tadhani et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01772" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] found that the callus of 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic> exhibited a higher ascorbic acid equivalent with 32.32 ± 0.56 mg AEAC/g. The ascorbic acid equivalents from 
 <italic>Salvia tebesana</italic> callus that were derived from different explants showed a variation of antioxidant activity ranging from 14.1 ± 0.32 to 36.2 ± 0.35 mg AEAC/100 g extract [
