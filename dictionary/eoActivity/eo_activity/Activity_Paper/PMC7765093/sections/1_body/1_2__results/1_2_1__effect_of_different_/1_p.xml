 <xref rid="plants-09-01772-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> displays responses of different explants when they were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) containing 2,4-D, NAA, and picloram, respectively at different concentrations under light and dark conditions. Among the treatments, midribs incubated in the dark on MS + 16.56 µM picloram induced the highest callus (31.11 ± 12.86%) after 66 days of culture. The leaf explants cultured at adaxial and abaxial positions on all MS combination media, however, failed to induce callus formation; therefore, the results are not presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01772-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A negative response was also observed on callus that was cultured on MS basal media without auxins (MSO) and MS supplemented with different concentrations of dicamba under light and dark conditions.
