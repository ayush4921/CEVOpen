<p id="par0020">In Chinese clinic, the combination of Chinese and Western medicines is still the mainstream for the treatment of COVID-19, so elucidating the exact role of these TCMs is in urgent demand and the database-based strategy will facilitate the mechanistic investigations of these clinically effective TCMs on COVID-19 to some extent. It is also worth noting that although ACE2 may be an ideal target for preventing COVID-19, we do not yet know whether it is safe to interfere with the normal operation of ACE2. Other receptors/targets of SARS-CoV-2 should also be explored to avoid research gridlock. Furthermore, the quality control and mechanistic investigations of TCM need to be strengthened so that TCM can be acceptable and beneficial for COVID-19 patients worldwide.</p>
