<p>Furthermore, the peel extract has been successfully used in improving
 <italic>Capsicum</italic> shelf life against 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> due to the polyphenol constituents such as punicalagin, catechin and rutin [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00153" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The possible mechanism of the antimicrobial effects is correlated to the chemical structure of the phenolic compounds. Their lipophilic nature enables them to penetrate easily into the pathogen cell membrane and also to interfere with enzymes responsible for energy and protein production in the microorganism’s cells, hence causing cell death [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00153" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]; instead the antimicrobial activity of the polysaccharides might be related to their chemical structure and ester sulfate groups [
