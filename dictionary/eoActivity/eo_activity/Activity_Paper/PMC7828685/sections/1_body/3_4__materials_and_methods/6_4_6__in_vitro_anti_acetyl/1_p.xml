<p>AChE inhibitory activity assay was performed according to a previously described spectrophotometric method [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00153" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-10-00153" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Briefly, in a total volume of 1 mL, 415 μL of Tris-HCl buffer 0.1 M (pH 8), 10 μL of different concentrations of extract dissolved in methanol and 25 μL of AChE solution (0.28 U/mL) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Seventy-five microliters of a solution of AChI (1.83 mM) and 475 μL of DTNB were added, and the final mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm by a spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO, Monza, Italy). Galanthamine was used as the C+ve. Bi-distillated water, instead of the extract or galanthamine, was used as C−ve. The inhibition rate (%) of AChE activity was calculated by comparison with the C−ve following Equation (3):
