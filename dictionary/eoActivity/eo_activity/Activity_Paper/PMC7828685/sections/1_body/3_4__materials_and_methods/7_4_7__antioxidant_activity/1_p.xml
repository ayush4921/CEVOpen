<p>Aliquots of the LEP extract were dissolved in methanol to have the final dose range from 12.5 to 100 µg/mL. The antiradical activity was determined using the sTable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) according to the Brand-Williams and coworkers method [

 <xref rid="B50-plants-10-00153" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In its radical form, DPPH has an absorption peak at 517 nm, which disappears by the reduction of DPPH with antiradical compounds. For preparation of the standard curve, different concentrations of DPPH methanol solutions (10–60 µg/mL) were used. One milligram of extract was dissolved in 1 mL of DPPH solution (60 µM) to prepare the stock solution. An aliquot of MeOH solution containing different amounts of the extract was added to a DPPH solution (7.6 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M), which was prepared daily and kept in the dark to have a final volume of 1 mL in a straight-sided cuvette. Methanol alone was used as the blank, whereas 1 mL of DPPH solution (60 µM) was used as the control. Absorbance at 515 nm was measured using a Thermo Scientific Multiskan GO spectrophotometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Vantaa, Finland) after 15, 30 and 45 min. The tested doses of the extracts were 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 µg/mL. The DPPH concentration (µg/mL) in the reaction mixture was calculated from the following calibration curve, analyzed by linear regression (r
