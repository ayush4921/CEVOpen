<p>To the best of our knowledge, to date, there is no report on the diversity and antimicrobial potential of endophytic actinobacteria associated with 
 <italic>Thymus</italic>. Thus, the objectives of our study were as follows: (1) to isolate and identify endophytic actinobacteria associated with Chinese traditional medicinal plant 
 <italic>Thymus roseus</italic> Schipcz by a culture-dependent method
 <italic>;</italic> (2) to analyze the species richness and distribution pattern among the different plant tissues and locations; (3) to compare the effectiveness of plant tissue pretreatment on the isolation of endophytic actinobacteria; and (4) to determine their antimicrobial capability and to screen the isolates with the antibiotic biosynthetic genes in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions.
