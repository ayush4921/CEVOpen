<p>The pretreatment of plant tissues is an advantageous method to promote and release rare endophytic actinobacteria from the inner parts of plant tissues. It is an essential and useful step for the isolation of endophytic actinobacteria that is depending on many factors, including host species, geographic and habitat distribution, pretreatment of plants, and selective media (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Golinska et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we isolated 126 endophytic actinobacteria from three types of pretreated plant tissues. Among different pretreatments, the number of endophytic actinobacteria with freezing treatment of plant tissues was more than the other two pretreatments. This result indicated that freezing treatment of plant tissues were more useful for the isolation of endophytic actinobacteria and helpful to release rare genera, such as strains T4LB045 and T3RB037, which belong to

 <italic>Dietzia</italic>. Freezing treatment of plant tissues could inhibit the majority of gram-negative species and the resistibility to low temperatures of spore-forming actinobacteria stronger than the non-spore-forming bacteria (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al. (2009)</xref>. This also could be due to some physiological characteristics of some actinobacteria in plant tissues being different (
