<p>Different pretreatment and media have been used for the isolation of endophytic actinobacteria. A total of 181 endophytic actinomycetes were isolated from three types of pretreatment of medicinal plant 
 <italic>T. roseus</italic> S tissues. The 128, 41, and 10 strains were isolated from the plant tissues treated with freezing (–80°C), and this was followed by average temperature (4°C) and high-temperature treatment (100°C). Freezing treatment showed the highest number of isolations with comparing to the other two treatments (

The effect of different media on the isolation of endophytic actinobacteria used in this study showed dramatic results; the majority of isolations were from humic acid-vitamin (HV) medium M7, followed by sodium propionate agar medium M5, raffinose-histidine agar medium M6, and oatmeal agar medium M8 (
