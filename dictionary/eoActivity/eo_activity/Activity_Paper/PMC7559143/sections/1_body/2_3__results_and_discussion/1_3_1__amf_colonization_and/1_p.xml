<p>It is known that AMF are largely dependent on their host plant for carbon, so they are sensitive to climatic changes that affect their host plant [
 <xref rid="B14-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this sense, eCO
 <sub>2</sub> could have an indirect effect on mycorrhizal colonization by promoting carbon assimilation and allocation to roots [
 <xref rid="B29-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Since AMF are attached to plant roots, they are lucky to receive higher amount of photosynthates under eCO
 <sub>2</sub> before other soil microbes [
 <xref rid="B30-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Herein, the mycorrhizal growth was significantly enhanced in 
 <italic>T. vulgare</italic> by AMF treatments (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00168-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Such mycorrhizal proliferation was much more stimulated under eCO
 <sub>2</sub> conditions. Several studies have demonstrated some positive effects for eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on AMF-plant association such as increased mycorrhizal root length [
 <xref rid="B14-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and increased extra-radical hyphae [
 <xref rid="B31-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, other studies did not show any beneficial effects for eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on AMF growth in host plants [
 <xref rid="B32-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the impact of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> levels on mycorrhizal growth seems to be dependent on plant species, AMF species and soil type [
 <xref rid="B34-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In fact, as being a member of 
 <italic>Glomeraceae</italic>, the ratio of 
 <italic>R. irregularis</italic> has been reported to be more positively influenced by eCO
 <sub>2</sub> than others, e.g., 
 <italic>Gigasporaceae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
