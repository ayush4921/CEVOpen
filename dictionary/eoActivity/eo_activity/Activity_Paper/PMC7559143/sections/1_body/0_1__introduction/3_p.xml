<p>One of the well-known plants for both culinary and medicinal purposes is 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> L., a member of the family Lamiaceae, being widely used in folk medicine for treatment of several diseases like bedwetting, diarrhea, stomach ache, arthritis, sore throat, cough, bronchitis and chest congestion [
 <xref rid="B15-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The biological activities of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> are mainly ascribed to its content of secondary metabolites, particularly essential oils that have been extensively studied for antioxidant, antimicrobial and antitumor activities [
 <xref rid="B16-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, improving the accumulation of these phytochemicals in 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> could support its nutritional, medicinal and pharmacological properties. In this regard, previous studies have reported the positive impacts of both AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on the growth and quality of herbal plant [

 <xref rid="B18-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], however, the complete picture on how AMF-eCO
 <sub>2</sub> combination affect primary and secondary metabolomes is not fully drawn [

 <xref rid="B20-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, metabolic profiling of the host plant is essential to understand the mechanisms behind the changes occurring in response to the individual and/or combined effect of AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub>. So far, the detailed metabolic implications induced by the synchronous application of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and AMF on plants are not investigated. Thus, the current study was conducted to explore, in details, the individual and combined impacts of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> and AMF on 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, as a model herbal plant. We have assessed the changes in mycorrhizal colonization, plant biomass production, photosynthesis, respiration and levels of individual primary (sugars, amino acids, fatty acids and organic acids), secondary (phenolic acids and flavonoids) metabolites and volatile oils. Further, the associated changes in nutritional and medicinal values of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> were investigated.
