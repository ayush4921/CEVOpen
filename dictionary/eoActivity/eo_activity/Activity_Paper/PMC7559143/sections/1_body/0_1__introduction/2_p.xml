<p>In another aspect, the exposure of plants to elevated CO
 <sub>2</sub> (eCO
 <sub>2</sub>) has been regarded as an effective approach to improve the nutritional and medicinal values of herbal plants [

 <sub>2</sub> can increase plant growth and productivity either directly by enhancing photosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or indirectly by stimulating plant water use efficiency [
 <xref rid="B11-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. On the other hand, the effect of eCO
 <sub>2</sub> on belowground communities, including AMF, are still not fully understood [
 <xref rid="B12-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. What is well known is that the higher the photosynthetic activity, under eCO
 <sub>2</sub>, the more the photosynthate transfer to plant roots and the higher release to the associated microbial communities [
 <xref rid="B13-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, as being dependent on their host plant for carbon, AMF may be sensitive to global climatic changes that influence their host [
 <xref rid="B14-jof-06-00168" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, such triple effect resulting from interactions among plant, AMF and eCO
 <sub>2</sub> is expected to have beneficial roles in increasing the productivity and quality of crops and medicinal plants.
