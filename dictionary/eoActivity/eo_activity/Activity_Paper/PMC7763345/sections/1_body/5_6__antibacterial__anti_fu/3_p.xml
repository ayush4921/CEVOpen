<p>Post-2019 and the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic that has spread around the world at an alarming rate, it has become clear that there is a need for new and effective antiviral drugs. 
 <italic>Rn</italic> and its constitutive compounds have been shown to be effective against various viruses, including Herpes [

 <italic>Rn</italic> compound would still need to be tested clinically, and there are already several neuraminidase inhibitors that have been tested for safety and would be ahead of any 
 <italic>Rn</italic> compound with regards to clinical testing against SARS-CoV-2.
