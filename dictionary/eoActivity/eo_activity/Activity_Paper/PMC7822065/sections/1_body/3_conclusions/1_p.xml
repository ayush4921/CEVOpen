<p>Structural modification was performed on the previous IBA based HDACI. Compounds with hydroxamic acid and hydrazide groups as ZBGs were synthesised and evaluated in the enzyme inhibitory assay and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative screening. Among the derived compounds, molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> exhibited high HDAC inhibitory activity against HDAC1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 13.9 nM), HDAC3 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 12.1 nM), and especially HDAC6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.71 nM). The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative results revealed that molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> can effectively inhibit the growth of both haematologic and solid tumour cell lines. Compared with SAHA, molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> showed high potency in the growth inhibition of U937, U266, HepG2, A2780, and PNAC-1 cells. In the further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assay, 50 mg/kg/d of 
 <bold>I13</bold> can inhibit growth of xenograft tumour in athymic mice compared with 100 mg/kg/d of SAHA. Induction of apoptosis was revealed to play a role in the anticancer activity of molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold>.The results suggested that HDACIs with high anticancer potency could be derived by further structural modification of the lead compound 
 <bold>I13</bold>.
