<p>To evaluate the antiproliferative activity of hydroxamic acid containing molecules, MTT assays were performed using U937, U266, and HepG2 cell lines. Several synthesised compounds revealed improved inhibitory potency than the positive control SAHA (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among them, molecule 
 <bold>I3</bold> and 
 <bold>I13</bold> which have good performance in the enzyme inhibitory assay, also showed high 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiproliferative activity in the cancer cell based test. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of compound 
 <bold>I3</bold> and 
 <bold>I13</bold> against U937, U266, and HepG2 cells were 0.94 and 0.93 μM, 0.24 and 0.16 μM, 1.92 and 1.85 μM, respectively, compared with SAHA (1.40, 0.88, and 8.68 μM). Molecule 
 <bold>I13</bold> exhibited 5.5-fold and 4.7-fold more active than SAHA in the inhibition of U266 and HepG2 cells. Compound 
 <bold>I12</bold> also showed good antiproliferative potency in the cell based screening, especially in the inhibition of U266 cells (with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.12 μM).
