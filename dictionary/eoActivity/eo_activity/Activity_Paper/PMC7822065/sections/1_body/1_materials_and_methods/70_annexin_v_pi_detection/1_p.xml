<p>HepG2 cells in logarithmic growth phase were seeded in six-well plates (4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and incubated with different doses of FNA and SAHA (0.2 and 0.8 µM) for 24 h. After the incubation, cells were washed with PBS, collected, resuspended with binding buffer from the Annexin V-FITC kit (Thermo Fisher Co., Waltham, MA), and then added with 5 µl annexin V-FITC and mixed gently. After 10 min of incubation, 1 µl PI was added to each sample and mixed gently. After incubation at room temperature for another 20 min in the dark, cells were subjected to flow cytometer (CytoFLEX, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA).
