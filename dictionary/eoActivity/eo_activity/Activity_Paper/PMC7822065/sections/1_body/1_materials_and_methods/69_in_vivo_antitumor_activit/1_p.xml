<p>For 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antitumor efficacy study, 1.8 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> HepG2 cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right shoulder of male athymic nude mice (5–6 weeks old, Slac Laboratory Animal, Shanghai, China). Then days after injection, tumours were palpable and mice were randomised into treatment and control groups (seven mice per group). The treatment groups were administrated with 100 mg/kg/d of SAHA and 50 mg/kg/d of 
 <bold>I13</bold> intragastrically, the control group was administrated with equal volume of PBS solution. During treatment, the body weight of mice was monitored regularly. After 16 days of administration, the mice were executed and the tumour weight was measured by an electronic balance.
