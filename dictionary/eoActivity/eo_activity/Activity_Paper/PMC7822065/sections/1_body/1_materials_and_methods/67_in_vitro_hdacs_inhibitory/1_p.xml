<p>All of the HDAC enzymes were purchased from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, CA). Briefly, 20 μl of HeLa nucleus extract or recombinant HDAC enzyme solution was mixed with various concentrations of tested compound (20 μl). The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h (for the time-dependent assay, the mixture was incubated for 15, 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively), then 10 μl of fluorogenic substrate (Boc-Lys (acetyl)-AMC (3 mM) for HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6, Boc-Lys (trifluoroacetyl)-AMC (3 mM) for HDAC 4, 7, 8, and 9) was added. After incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the catalytic reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of developer containing trypsin and trichostatin A (TSA). After 30 min, fluorescence intensity was measured using a microplate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The inhibition ratios were calculated from the fluorescence intensity readings of tested wells relative to those of control wells, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> curves and values were determined by GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (La Jolla, CA).
