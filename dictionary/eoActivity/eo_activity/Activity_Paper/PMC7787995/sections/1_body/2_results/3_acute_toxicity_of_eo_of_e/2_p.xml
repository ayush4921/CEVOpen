<p id="par0090">Single oral dose of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> M. EO up to 2000 mg/kg did not show treatment-related morbidity in mice. Treated mice did not show significant treatment related morbidity: yet short term disturbances including piloerection, muscle spasm and apathy were observed immediately after administration of 2000 mg/kg and ended in 12 hâ€™ time. The changes in body weights were not statistically significant (slope of linear regression, P = 0.5231). Better increase in body weight was observed in control group compared to 300 mg/kg and also 300 mg/kg compared to 2000 mg/kg treated (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Mean body weight showed non-significant variation between 300 mg/kg treated group versus 2000 mg/kg, p = 0.2950.
