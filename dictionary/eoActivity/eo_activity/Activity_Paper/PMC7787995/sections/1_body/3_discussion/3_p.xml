<p id="par0135">Single oral dose of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> EO up to 2000 mg/kg did not show significant treatment-related morbidity in female mice, though piloerection, muscle spasm and apathy were observed immediately after administration. Body weight increment was observed in those treated with 300 mg/kg EO compared to those which received 2000 mg/kg. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> EO could be considered greater than 2000 mg/kg as no death was noted up to this dose. This LD
 <sub>50</sub> is lower compared to 
 <italic>Ocimum gratissimum</italic> EO (1410 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] but higher to that of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus citriodora</italic> EO (2337.9â€“2967.5 mg/kg) [
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic> EO (used as ingredient of food, cosmetics, and cigarettes) showed oral LD
 <sub>50</sub> of approximately 4000 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. No histopathological changes, or biochemical alterations or skin irritation were not observed Cymbopogon citratus EO up to dose of 2000 mg/kg [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similarly, black caraway essential oil did not affect the immune, blood system, body enzymes and vital organs of the body [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. On the other hand, Citrus aurantifolia EO showed mild hematotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity among the 100 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg dose groups [
