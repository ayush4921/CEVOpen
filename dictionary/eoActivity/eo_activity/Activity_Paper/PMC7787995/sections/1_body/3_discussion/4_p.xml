<p id="par0140">Constant body weight and food consumption pattern was observed for combined groups with significant variations in gender groups which is in line to previous findings [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Constant weight pattern was observed in control and 100 mg/kg EO treated female groups. Significant weight loss was seen in 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg EO treated female groups indicating reduced tolerability to increased dose. Significant weight gain in all male groups, increased food consumption pattern in controls and those treated with 100 mg/kg, and constant consumption pattern in medium and high dose treated male groups could explain less sensitivity of males to toxicants compared to females [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The present finding is in agreement with international guidelines and results of most studies which revealed that males tolerate better compared to females [

Relative body weight in most of the tested organs did not show significant variations except mean relative organ weight of right kidney where highest dose treated groups varied significantly compared to controls in concentration dependent toxicity fashion.
