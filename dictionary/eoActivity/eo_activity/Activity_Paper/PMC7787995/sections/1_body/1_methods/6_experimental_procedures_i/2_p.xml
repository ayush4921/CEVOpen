<p id="par0070">Acute toxicity study was conducted and results were interpreted before the commencement of repeated-dose toxicity study. In acute toxicity study, nine mice grouped in three groups were employed as recommended in OECD guideline [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The first group received 4% Tween 80, the second group 300 mg/kg EO and the third group 2000 mg/kg EO after 24 h. The mice were fasted overnight and provided with water only, and then EO was administered via oral gavages. Observations were made closely for the first 4 h, 24 h and up to 14 days. The number of death within the study period was recorded. At the end of the experiment, the mice were sacrificed for gross anatomy investigation and organ weight measured. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of the EOs were determined based on the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS) [
