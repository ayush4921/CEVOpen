<p>Phytochemicals can provide an excellent pharmacophore template for novel drug discovery used for the cure of various diseases. The crude extract/fraction and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) exhibited excellently 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition activity. Similarly, the extract/fractions and isolated daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) showed potent and 
 <italic>β</italic>-secretase activity. In this study, the extracts and natural daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) inhibit 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>β</italic>-secretase significantly and can be used as an excellent template compound for the new drug used in diabetes and AD.
