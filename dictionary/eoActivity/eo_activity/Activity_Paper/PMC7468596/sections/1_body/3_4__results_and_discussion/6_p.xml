 <italic>β</italic>-Secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (
 <italic>β</italic>-APP) is the 1
 <sup>st</sup> step in a pathway leading to the formation of A
 <italic>β</italic> (amyloid); therefore, it is a major target for the development of a drug for the cure of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The 
 <italic>β</italic>-secretase enzyme (BACE1) is important for the production of ab. It has been documented that BACE1 level is high in Alzheimer's disease (AD); therefore, the study BACE1 inhibition is helpful in developing new Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapies [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Keeping the significance of BACE1 activity in mind, the crude methanolic extract and various fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) were screened 
 <italic>β</italic>-secretase inhibitory potency. Among tested fractions, the chloroform fractions showed excellent activity against 
 <italic>β</italic>-secretes (BACE1) enzyme with % inhibition 88.27% with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 304.21 ± 2.98 
 <italic>μ</italic>g followed by methanolic extract 78.42% with IC
 <sub>50</sub>246.51 ± 1.98 
 <italic>μ</italic>g, respectively. The ethyl acetate fractions also showed good inhibition with 67.98% activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 87.93 ± 2.87 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, while 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction was found the least active (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) was found significantly active against BACE1 enzyme with % inhibition 95.19 and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 260.70 ± 1.87 
 <italic>μ</italic>M as compared to standard having % activity 94.21 and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 289.24 ± 1.60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M.
