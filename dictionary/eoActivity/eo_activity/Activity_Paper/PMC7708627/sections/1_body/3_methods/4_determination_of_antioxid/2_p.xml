 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> ethanol extract was added to 100 µl of 125 µM DPPH in methanol at the 96-well microplate (Costar-USA). After incubation in darkroom temperature for 30 min, the absorbance was measured using the microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany) at 517 nm. Results expressed in µmol Trolox Equivalent (TE/g DW).
