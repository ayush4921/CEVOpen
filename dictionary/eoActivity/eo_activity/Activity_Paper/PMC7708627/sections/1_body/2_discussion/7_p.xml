<p id="Par34">Multivariate analysis, namely chemometric, is the statistical procedure to enhance the understanding of metabolite information and to associate quality traits to data of analytical instrument. It has been used to study in the correlation of the phytochemical component with pharmacological activities in the plant

 </sup>. In this study, we used two chemometric methods namely correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the phytochemical and pharmacological properties of the 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic>. Antioxidant activity (DPPH &amp; FRAP) found a significantly positive correlation with total phenolic and total flavonoid contents (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These indicate that they are significant selections parameters in cultivating the 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic>. Furthermore, these results indicated that the polyphenols are the main compounds for antioxidant capacities in 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic>. The results are in line with previous reports in 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> and other different crops

 </sup>. Besides, several reports shows association between polyphenol contents and antioxidant properties, but no one highlighted the mechanism of the association between polyphenol compounds and antioxidants in 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic>. This work showed a strong correlation between rosmarinic acid &amp; FRAP assay and sinensetin &amp; DPPH assay. Results indicated that the antioxidant mechanism of rosmarinic acid from 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> as reducing power while free radical scavenging mechanism found in the sinensetin compound. Interestingly, in PCA using phytochemical contents and pharmacological parameters, it was resulted three clusters. Two 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes viz. A11 and A15 had high TPC, TFC, SC, EY, DPPH, and FRAP, indicating a correlation of high polyphenol in these genotypes with antioxidant activities and extraction yields. Six 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes viz. A1, A3, A4, A5, A7, and A8 had high rosmarinic acid and cytotoxic activities (HeLa &amp; MCF-7), indicating the correlation of high rosmarinic acid content in these genotypes with cytotoxic properties. In the future, combining with anticancer activities such as A8 genotype with high phytochemical contents such as A15 genotype will be the main goal for new varieties development as anticancer sources with valuable phytochemical-rich in 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic>.
