<p id="Par31">Recently, an antioxidant is of particular concern, which played a critical role in preventing several human illnesses

 </sup>. Thus, getting plant genotypes as a source of high antioxidant activities is essential
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup>. In this study, DPPH and FRAP assays were used to evaluate the antioxidant activities in ethanol extract of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> studied genotypes. DPPH assay was used to analyses the scavenging capacities of extract, while the reducing power was determined by FRAP assay
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. In present work, the 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes studied showed variation for DPPH (1.68 to 15.55 μmol TE/g DW) and FRAP (0.07 to 1.60 µmol TEAC/g DW) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The highest antioxidant activities in DPPH and FRAP were found on genotype A15 and A7, respectively. In DPPH assay, our 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes had lower antioxidant capacity compared with reported by Chew et al.

 </sup> which about 21.81 µmol TEAC/g DW. Scavenging activity of genotype A15 recorded is not significantly different from A1, while genotype A7 and A1 were found not different in reducing power activities. This result indicated that the genotype A1 could be used to develop as 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> plant producing high antioxidant properties. Furthermore, antioxidant activities strong correlated with TPC and TFC indicates that the polyphenol (phenolic and flavonoid) in 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> genotypes are the major metabolites for antioxidant activity. Similarly, Saidan et al.

 </sup> while evaluating the different genotypes, reported that the correlation between TPC and DPPH activity was about 0.90 and FRAP 0.78, while between TFC and DPPH was 0.73 and FRAP 0.71. Our results show that the rosmarinic acid content on 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> leaves has a positive correlation with the DPPH activity and with FRAP activity of the extracts. The R
 <sup>2</sup> of the correlation between RAC and DPPH activity (0.30) is lower than with FRAP activity (0.54) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This result is agreed with the report of Ho et al.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>
 </sup> which concludes that radical scavenging of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic> is related to the high content of rosmarinic acid. Since the R
 <sup>2</sup> is not higher than 70%, it means other compounds also responsible for the antioxidant activity. It can be understood that besides phenolic and flavonoid responsible to the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>O. aristatus</italic>, diterpene, triterpene, and saponin groups are also responsible for antioxidant activity
