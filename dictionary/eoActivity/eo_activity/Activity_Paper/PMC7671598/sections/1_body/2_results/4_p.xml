<p>The MTT test was performed for all experimental variants which contained different concentrations of the tested thiamine antivitamins. The results showed that the most effective antivitamins were OT and OTPP. DATPP caused a decrease in the metabolic activity of HeLa cells as well, but to a lower extent (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). After the incubation of HeLa cells with OT and OTPP, over 50% (concentration 0.005%) and over 60% (concentration 0.02%) decrease in metabolic activity were observed in comparison to control. On the other hand, after incubation with DATPP, the reduction in the metabolic activity of cells did not exceed 50%.
