<p>Our results demonstrate that in the case of PDHC, DATPP as well as OTPP is a competitive inhibitors, which is expected from other results concerning the effect of OTPP on other thiamine-dependent enzymes

The lack of nitrogen atom in the thiazolium ring may prevent ylide formation more effectively than the lack of an amino group in the case of OTPP. The theoretical chemistry data show that both the mentioned compounds can bind to the active centre of TPP-dependent enzymes with similar docking energy, which is lower in comparison with the native coenzyme
