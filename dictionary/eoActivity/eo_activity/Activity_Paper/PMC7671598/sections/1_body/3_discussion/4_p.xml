<p>The data obtained for PDHC in the presence of OTPP (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) showed higher values of 
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> in comparison with DATPP. The effect of DATPP on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell cultures has not been tested till now. Therefore, in our studies, we compared the effects of DATPP and OTPP as well as OT on HeLa cells. Based on the above mentioned enzymological data, we hypothesised that DATPP may reduce the rate of cell growth 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and limit the viability of HeLa cells, by more effectively inhibiting the TPP-dependent enzymes than OT or OTPP.
