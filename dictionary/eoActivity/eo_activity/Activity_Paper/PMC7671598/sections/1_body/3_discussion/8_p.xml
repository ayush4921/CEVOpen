<p>OT and OTPP are soluble in water, and so their dephosphorylation, transport and phosphorylation inside the cells may have no impact on their action in contrast to DATPP. Based on our knowledge, DAT is insoluble in water. Therefore, dephosphorylation of DATPP leads to release-free DAT outside the cell and thus could be the other reason responsible for the slight impact of this compound on HeLa cells.</p>
