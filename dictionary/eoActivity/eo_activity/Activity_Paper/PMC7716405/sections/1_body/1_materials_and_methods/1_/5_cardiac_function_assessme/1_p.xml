<p>After 2 h of reperfusion, 3% sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection) was used to anesthetize the rats. Once anesthetized, the thoracic area was shaved and covered with ultrasonic transmission gel. A portable echocardiography machine (GE Vivid I; GE Healthcare) was used to evaluate the cardiac function of rats. The left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), LV fractional shortening (FS), LV internal dimensions at diastole (LVIDd) and LV internal diameter systole (LVIDs) were evaluated. An observer who was blinded to the experimental design measured these parameters in three consecutive cardiac cycles.</p>
