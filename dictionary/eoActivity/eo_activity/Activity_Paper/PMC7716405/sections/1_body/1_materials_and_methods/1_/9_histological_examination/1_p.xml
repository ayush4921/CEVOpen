<p>After 2 h of reperfusion, rat hearts were quickly harvested. and the blood was expelled. Hearts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 24 h at room temperature. After rinsing with water, heart tissues were dehydrated with gradient ethanol solution and embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, heart tissues were cut into 3–5 µm-thick slices and stained using a hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) kit for 3 min at room temperature. An optical microscope was used to observe morphological changes. The degree of cardiac damage was assessed by an independent researcher blind to the experimental design.</p>
