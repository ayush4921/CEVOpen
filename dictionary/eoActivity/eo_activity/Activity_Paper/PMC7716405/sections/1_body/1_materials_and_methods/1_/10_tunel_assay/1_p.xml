<p>Myocardial apoptosis was evaluated using a TUNEL assay kit (cat. no. 11684817910; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA). Heart tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 24 h at room temperature, embedded in paraffin, then sectioned on slides at 3–5 µm-thickness. TUNEL (1:9 mixed in equilibration buffer) staining of apoptotic cells (green fluorescence). DAPI (5 µg/ml) was used to dye the nuclei for 5 min (blue fluorescence). The slides were then sealed with 50% glycerin. Five randomly selected fields of view were observed and apoptotic cells of each section were counted under an ECLIPSE 80i fluorescence microscope (Nikon Corporation). The cardiomyocyte apoptotic index (AI) was counted as follows: Number of TUNEL-positive nuclei/the number of total nuclei ×100%.</p>
