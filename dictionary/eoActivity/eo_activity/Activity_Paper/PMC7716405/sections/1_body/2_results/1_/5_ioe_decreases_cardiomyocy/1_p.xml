<p>The present study aimed to detect the role of IOE in cell death by TUNEL staining. MI/R injury induced a certain degree of cardiomyocyte apoptosis by increasing the percentage of apoptotic cells in the MI/R group compared with the Sham group (P&lt;0.01; 
 <xref rid="f5-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). As expected, pretreatment with IOE (150, 300 and 600 mg/kg) significantly decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01). Therefore, the data suggested that IOE could alleviate cardiomyocyte apoptosis after MI/R injury.
