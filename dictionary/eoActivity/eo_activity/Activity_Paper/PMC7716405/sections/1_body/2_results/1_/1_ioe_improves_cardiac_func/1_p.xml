<p>The cardiac function of post-surgical hearts was evaluated by echocardiography. As shown in 
 <xref rid="f1-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-E</xref>, deterioration of cardiac function was induced in the MI/R group, LVIDd and LVIDs increased to 6.13±0.99 and 4.25±0.46 mm, respectively, whereas LVEF and LVFS decreased to 51.75±6.39 and 24.13±5.00%, respectively, compared with the Sham group (P&lt;0.01). IOE pretreatment increased the recovery of cardiac function in the impaired hearts, which was demonstrated by increased LVEF and LVFS, as well as decreased LVIDd and LVIDs, compared with the M/R group (P&lt;0.05 or P&lt;0.01).
