<p>SIRT1 is a highly conserved histone deacetylase, which can deacetylate various transcription factors (

 <xref rid="b12-mmr-0-0-11716" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The present study revealed that IOE notably increased SIRT1 expression in the ischemic myocardium. IOE also suppressed ER stress-induced apoptosis by mediating the PERK/eIF2α/CHOP signaling pathway. The present results demonstrated that IOE-induced SIRT1 activation may suppress ER stress-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis, thereby reducing the infarct size 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, there is a complex interaction between SIRT1 and ER stress. SIRT1 activation has been reported to inhibit ER stress and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes by promoting autophagic clearance and decreasing the expression of the protein disulfide isomerase and S-nitrosylation (
