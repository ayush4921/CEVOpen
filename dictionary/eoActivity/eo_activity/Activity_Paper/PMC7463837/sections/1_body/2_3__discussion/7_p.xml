<p>A study on superoxide anion radical scavenging activities showed that leaves from tissue-cultured plants produced a higher inhibition percentage in comparison with leaves from conventionally propagated plants. Similar findings were reported on shoot and root extracts of tissue-cultured

An excessive amount of superoxide anions produced in cells increases dismutation and leads to hydrogen peroxide production and thereby increases the oxidative stress levels in the human body [
