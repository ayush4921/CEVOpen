<p>In order to test the effects of sucrose on growth, sucrose at concentrations of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 g/L were fortified into the MS basal medium. The sucrose concentration of 30 g/L served as the control for this experiment. The data on the shoot regeneration percentage, number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves were recorded at the end of a six-week incubation period.</p>
