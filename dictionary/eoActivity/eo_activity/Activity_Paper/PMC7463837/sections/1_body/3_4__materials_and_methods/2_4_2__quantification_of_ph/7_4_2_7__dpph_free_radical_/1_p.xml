<p>DPPH free radical scavenging was conducted according to the method employed by Wong et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Prior to the experiment, DPPH was prepared in methanol with a concentration 0.1 mM and the initial absorbance of methanolic DPPH was measured immediately at an absorbance of 515 nm. A total of 20 ÂµL extract was added into 1.5 mL of 0.1 mM of the methanolic DPPH solution. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at 515 nm. The standard curve of absorbance against different concentrations of trolox was constructed and the DPPH value was expressed as mg trolox equivalent per gram dry weight (mg TE/g DW).
