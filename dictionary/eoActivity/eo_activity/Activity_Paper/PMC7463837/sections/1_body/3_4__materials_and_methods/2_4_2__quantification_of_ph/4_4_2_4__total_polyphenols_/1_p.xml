<p>The total polyphenols content was determined according to the method explained by Marinova et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In each vial, 50 ÂµL extract and 1.25 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, that was diluted 10 times, were added. The mixture was incubated for 5 min and 1.25 mL of sodium carbonate was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for an hour at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 725 nm using a spectrophotometer. The total polyphenols content in the extract was calculated by a constructed standard curve of absorbance against different concentrations of gallic acid. The total polyphenols content of the extract was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent per gram dry weight of the sample (mg GAE/g DW).
