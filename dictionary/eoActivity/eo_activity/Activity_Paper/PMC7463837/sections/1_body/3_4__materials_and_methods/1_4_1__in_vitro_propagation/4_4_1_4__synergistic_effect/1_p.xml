<p>The MS basal media was fortified with the best cytokinin from the previous experiment. In addition, the different types and concentrations of auxins were supplemented into the basal media. The auxins used were indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 1-napthaleneacetic acid (NAA) at the concentrations of 2, 4, 6 and 8 ÂµM. The MS basal media without auxin supplementation served as the control. The data on the shoot regeneration percentage, number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves, fresh weight of leaves and callus formation (if any) were recorded after six weeks of the incubation period.</p>
