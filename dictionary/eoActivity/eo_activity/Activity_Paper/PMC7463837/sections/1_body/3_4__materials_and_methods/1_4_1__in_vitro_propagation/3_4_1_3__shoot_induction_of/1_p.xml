<p>The shoot induction of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> was performed by supplementing the MS basal media with different types and concentrations of cytokinins including 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 6-furfurlaminopurine (kinetin) at 4, 8, 12 and 16 ÂµM concentrations. The MS basal media without cytokinin served as the control. The data on the shoot regeneration percentage, number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves were recorded after an incubation of four weeks.
