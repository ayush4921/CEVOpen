<p>The FRAP assay was conducted to measure the reduction in Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> under an acidic condition. The FRAP reagent was prepared prior to experiment by a mixed 0.3 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 20 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>,6H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 10 mM 2,4,6 tri(2-pyridyl)-s-triazine (TPTZ) in 40 mM HCL at a ratio of 10:1:1, respectively. Then, 100 µL of the extract was added into a vial that contained 1.5 mL of FRAP reagent. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min in the water bath at a temperature of 37 °C. The reaction mixture was cooled down and the absorbance was measured at 593 nm. The standard curve of absorbance against different concentrations of trolox was constructed and FRAP value was expressed as mg trolox equivalent per gram dry weight (mg TE/g DW) [
