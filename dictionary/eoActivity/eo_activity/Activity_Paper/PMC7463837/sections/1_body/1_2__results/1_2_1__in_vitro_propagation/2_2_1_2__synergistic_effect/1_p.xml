<p>In the present study, a treatment with 12 ÂµM BAP was established as the best cytokinin concentration for the shoot induction of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> nodal explants. The concentration was used with various concentrations of auxins. It is known that cytokinin is a plant hormone applied exogenously in basal media for the promotion of cell division and cell differentiation, while auxin is used to promote the cell elongation of explants.
