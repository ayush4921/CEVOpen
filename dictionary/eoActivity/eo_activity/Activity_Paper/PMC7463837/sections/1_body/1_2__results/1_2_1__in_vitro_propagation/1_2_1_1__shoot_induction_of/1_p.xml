<p>In plant tissue culture techniques, plant growth regulators such as cytokinins and auxins are vital elements directly affecting plant growth and the development of the plantlets. Cytokinin is commonly used in shoot induction and the multiplication stages of explants. In the present study, the shoot induction of nodal segments was conducted by supplementing Murashige and Skoog (MS) [

The results indicated that the MS basal medium without cytokinin (MS0), 4 µM BAP and 4 µM kinetin exhibited 88.89% shoot regeneration. Other treatments were successful in exhibiting 100% shoot regeneration. Shoot induction was observed from day four after explant inoculation. During shoot regeneration, the enlargement of the dormant axillary buds of nodal segments was observed, followed by bud breaks. Subsequently, shoot formation and proliferation occurred.
