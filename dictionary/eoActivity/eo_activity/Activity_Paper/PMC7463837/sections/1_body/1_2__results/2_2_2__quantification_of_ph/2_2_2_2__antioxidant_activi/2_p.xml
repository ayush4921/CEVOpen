<p>The measurement of the ABTS scavenging activity is based on the ability of an extract to scavenge the ABTS cation radical. The reaction between the ABTS cation radical and extract reduces the dark blue color of ABTS. The results obtained in the present study showed that the aqueously extracted tissue-cultured leaves at 100 째C significantly exhibited the highest ABTS scavenging activity with 1.50 mg TE/g DW (

There was no significant difference between the aqueously extracted tissue-cultured leaves at 25 째C, aqueously extracted conventionally propagated leaves at 25 째C and 100 째C with 1.48, 1.47 and 1.46 mg TE/g DW of ABTS scavenging activity, respectively.
