<p>The total polyphenols, total phenolic acids and total flavonoids contents in 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> leaves extracted aqueously at temperatures of 25 and 100 °C were evaluated and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The results show that at an aqueous temperature of 100 °C, cultured tissue and conventionally propagated leaves recorded higher total polyphenols, phenolic acids and flavonoids contents than at an aqueous temperature of 25 °C.
