 <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents the effect of the supplementation of auxins in the basal medium. The highest shoot regeneration percentage (100%) for the parameter was obtained from the MS basal medium supplemented with 12 µM BAP without the addition of auxin. The lowest shoot regeneration percentage (44.44%) was recorded from treatment supplemented with auxin at 8 µM indole-3-butyric acid (IBA). The results implied that the addition of auxin significantly reduced the number of shoots and leaves being formed. The maximum numbers and length of shoots were recorded from control treatment with 1.67 shoots and 3.23 cm, respectively (
