<p>NOâ€™s actions can be mediated by soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC), resulting in an increase in cGMP that can modify the properties of ion channels such as K
 <sub>ATP</sub>. NO-cGMP-K
 <sub>ATP</sub> axis has gastroprotective effects, and since the efflux of potassium promotes the blocking of voltage-sensitive calcium channels, it leads to the relaxation of smooth muscles, favoring blood flow and the arrival of growth factors and cell renewal that facilitate the ulcer healing process [

 <sub>ATP</sub> pathway, accelerating the healing of ulcers [
