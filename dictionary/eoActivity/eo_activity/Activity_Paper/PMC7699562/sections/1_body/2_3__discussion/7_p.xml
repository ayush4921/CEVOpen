<p>The pylorus ligation test is an experimental model of acute induction of gastric ulcers that provides important information about the effect of substances on gastric secretion [

This procedure activates the vagal reflex, thus, the mechanoreceptors located in the pyloric region start to stimulate the secretion of gastric acid through the neuronal, endocrine, and paracrine pathways. Thus, the different secretagogues activate the proton pump, increasing acid secretion [

The distention of the gastric mucosa caused by obstruction of the pylorus increases the release of acetylcholine (Ach) by the vagus nerve, which will act directly on G cells and parietal cells, stimulating the secretion of gastrin and histamine, respectively [
