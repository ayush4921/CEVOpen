<p>Baicalein (5,6,7-trihydroxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one or 5,6,7-trihydroxyfavone) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05431-f004">Figure 4</xref>) is a flavone found mainly in the root of 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> with antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], anti-cancer [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] and antimicrobial potential [
 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This flavone exhibited a gastroprotective effect against lesions induced by acidified ethanol and pylorus ligature in mice (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg, p.o.). The mechanism related to this effect involves the participation of SHs, adrenergic pathway, COX, NO, and K
 <sub>ATP</sub> channels. This effect was evidenced since the administration of blockers of these pathways (
 <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide, yohimbine, indomethacin, 
 <italic>N</italic>-w-nitro-
 <sc>l</sc>-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride, and glibenclamide, respectively) caused a reversal of the gastroprotective effect of baicalein. Besides, baicalein showed cytoprotective effects by increasing the secretion of gastric mucus, antioxidants with increased levels of GSH, and reduced activity of MPO and antisecretory with the inhibition of H
 <sup>+</sup>-K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity (0.30370 and 0.111 mMol/L) in vitro [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The gastroprotective effects of baicalein involve inhibition of 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> in vitro (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.331 mMol/L) and in vivo. The molecular events involved with this effect involve the suppression of the expression of the Vac A gene, the decrease in the capacity of adhesion and invasion of this microorganism and the reduction in the levels of the IL-8 cytokine in AGS cells. In the in vivo model, with infection of mice, treatment with baicalein inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> in the stomach of these animals and the serum levels of IL-1Î² and IgM and IgA specific for 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> were reduced [
