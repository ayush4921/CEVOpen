 <xref rid="B132-molecules-25-05431" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] in experimental models. Karanjin (10 and 20 mg/kg) and omeprazole (20 mg/kg) showed gastroprotective activity in the ethanol and stress model, inhibited oxidative stress, with reduced levels of lipid peroxidation and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, GPx, and SOD). In addition, karanjin negatively modulated the activity of H
