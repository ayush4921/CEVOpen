<p>In this scenario our null hypothesis (
 <italic>H</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) is the following: For a taxomic group (
 <italic>j</italic>), the proportion of medicinal taxa (
 <italic>θj</italic>) is equal to the overall proportion (
 <italic>θ</italic>), where 
 <italic>θj</italic> is a random variable uniformily distributed between 0 and 1 (prior probability). The posterior probability can be estimated, its distribution will be conditioned by the observed data (see [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] for more details). Probability distribution differences from the common proportion are assessed by all families.
