<p>In order to quantify the diversity of taxa within the families referred by the informants, we calculated two diversity indices (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00163">Supplementary Material S2</xref>). The first one, the Shannon diversity index [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] from the theory of communication and largely used in ecology, has also been calculated in some previous ethnobotanical studies [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. This index, calculated according to the formula H
 <sub>fam</sub> = −Σ
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>tax</sub>log
 <sub>2</sub>
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>tax</sub>, where 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>tax</sub>, represents the citation frequency of each taxon and assesses the ethnobotanical taxa diversity within each family, i.e., the family richness from the ethnobotanical point of view. The second index, k = log S/log N where S is the number of species and N the number of individuals, proposed by Margalef [
 <xref rid="B89-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] was adapted and used for the first time in an ethnobotanical study to calculate the diversity within the botanical families following the formula: k = log T/log UR, where T represents the number of taxa. Pearson’s coefficient correlation (r) was calculated between these two datasets.
