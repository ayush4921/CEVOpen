<p>The taxonomy of specific and infraspecific taxa in ethnobotanical works is usually given, as is logical, according to local floras but, as from the consolidation of the APG family updates, almost all papers use its system for families, which is not coincidental to those used in floras before APG rearrangements. This creates a difficulty in the comparison of data related to families in ethnobotanical research, either in one area or in different ones: the number of families and, more importantly, their rates of presence in each ethnoflora vary when applying the last classical [

An international effort should be carried out to implement the APG family system in the ethnobotanical databases in order to facilitate suitable meta-analytic work. Although new prospects will always be positive for a bigger and better knowledge of plant medicinal uses, at present a considerable amount of ethnobotanical information is already accumulated in many parts of the world, so that this is the appropriate moment to undertake comparative analyses between close and not so close ethnofloras, following the initiative, here seconded, pioneered by of Moerman [
