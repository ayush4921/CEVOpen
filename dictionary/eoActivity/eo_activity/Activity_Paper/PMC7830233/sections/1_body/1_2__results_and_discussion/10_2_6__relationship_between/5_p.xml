<p>Concerning Asteraceae, we want to underline two troubles in particular. First, the uses for the musculoskeletal system disorders and traumas, explained by 
 <italic>Arnica montana</italic> L. (335 UR, 52.59%) and other species of this family (
 <italic>Arctium minus</italic> (Hill) Bernh., 
 <italic>Doronicum grandiflorum</italic> Lam., all of the 
 <italic>Inula</italic> genus, 
 <italic>Jasonia saxatilis</italic> (Lam.) Guss., 
 <italic>Pallenis spinosa</italic> (L.) Cass. and 
 <italic>Pulicaria dysenterica</italic> (L.) Gaertn.) referred to with the popular name “
 <italic>àrnica</italic>” (189 UR, 29.67%). In total, the ethnotaxon constituted by 
 <italic>Arnica montana</italic> and the aforementioned related taxa accumulates 82.26% of the Asteraceae UR employed for musculoskeletal system disorders and traumas, specially bruises. This medicinal plant complex has been well studied in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands from a botanical and ethnopharmacological point of view [

 <italic>Centaurea</italic>, representing, with 180 UR, the 68.44% of this property, abundantly registered in this genus [
