<p>The analysis of the percentages of UR related to the different troubles/systems within each family (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00163-f002">Figure 2</xref>) denotes that the highest rates are rather widespread at the phylogenetic scale. In any case, it clearly appears that a large number of families have exhibit digestive and nutritional problems as the most treated ones (mean percentage: 24.56), which is in agreement with the above-mentioned idea that ethnobotany and phytotherapy importantly address mild, daily health constraints. Nevertheless, in the vast majority of families, there are also strong rates of uses focused on circulatory and blood, and respiratory ailments (mean percentages: 14.30 and 11.03, respectively), most of which are not so mild. Finally, some disorders are very scarcely addressed in the pharmaceutical ethnoflora under consideration, such as those linked to endocrine and metabolic, and immune systems, as well as to neoplasia (mean percentages: 0.35 and 0.16, respectively).
