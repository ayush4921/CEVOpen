<p>In this context, the aim of this work is to shed light on the role of botanical families in ethnobotany, depicting, in a molecular phylogenetic frame, the relationships between botanical families and medicinal uses of vascular plants in several Catalan-speaking territories (Formentera, Mallorca, and Catalonia, Northern Catalonia included). This will allow us to ascertain the most used families in pharmaceutical ethnobotany in this area and the possible phylogenetic reasons accounting for this, and to find out whether some families are more focused on some particular health conditions than others. </p>
