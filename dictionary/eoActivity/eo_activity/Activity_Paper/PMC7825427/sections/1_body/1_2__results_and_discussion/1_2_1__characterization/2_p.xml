<p>Further, the green synthesized Cr

 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were analyzed using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer, and the results are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b. UV–Visible spectrum results indicated the presence of two absorption peaks at 280 nm and 415 nm. The absorption band in the UV region is attributed to phytomolecules such as polyphenols and flavonoids, and these molecules absorb UV light because of the OH moieties [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f002">Figure 2</xref>b,c presented the FTIR spectrum of plant leaf extract and nanoparticles. The results demonstrated that the synthesized nanoparticles displayed different FTIR peaks corresponding to O-H (3430 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), C-H (2921 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), C=O (1702 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), N-H (1646 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), C=C (1517 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), and C-O-C (1061 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). These peaks are matched with the FTIR signals of the leaf extracts with slight shifting. These results suggest that many biologically active phytomolecules are left adsorbed on the surface of the Cr
