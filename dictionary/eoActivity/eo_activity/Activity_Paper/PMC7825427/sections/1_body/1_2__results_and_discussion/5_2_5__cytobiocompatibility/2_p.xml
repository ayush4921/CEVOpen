<p>We further analyzed the cytobiocompatibility of the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles with Vero cell lines compared to the plant extract and chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles using the live/dead staining technique. The results are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f009">Figure 9</xref>bâ€“e. The results demonstrated that the plant leaf extract and green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles exerted the lowest levels of cytotoxic effects on Vero cells as fewer cells died (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f009">Figure 9</xref>c,e). In contrast, chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles exerted more cytotoxicity, and many cells appeared dead (Red) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00502-f009">Figure 9</xref>d). The good cytobiocompatibility of the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles with the Vero cell lines might be attributed to the presence of phytomolecules of plant leaf extract.
