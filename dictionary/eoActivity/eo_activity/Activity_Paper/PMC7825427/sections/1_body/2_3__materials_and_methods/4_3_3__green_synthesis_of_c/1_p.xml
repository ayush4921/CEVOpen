<p>For the green synthesis of Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles, 10.20 g of Cr
 <sub>2</sub>(SO
 <sub>4</sub>)
 <sub>3</sub> was added to 100 mL of plant extract and stirred the resultant mixture for 60 minutes at 35 °C. After, a change in the color of the resulting mixture solution from red to black was observed, due to surface plasmon resonance indicating the formation of the required Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm twice and then filtered and washed with deionized water/ethanol three times. Then, the Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were dried in an oven at 40 °C and further calcinated at 500 °C in a muffle furnace for 3 hours (
