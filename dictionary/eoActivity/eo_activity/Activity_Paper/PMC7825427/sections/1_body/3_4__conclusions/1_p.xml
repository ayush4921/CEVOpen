<p>In this work, Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles have been successfully green synthesized using the leaf extract of 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet as a reducing and capping agent. The green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles were successfully characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, EDX, FTIR, XPS, and UV-VIS spectroscopy. The green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles displayed excellent antibacterial performance against all tested bacterial strains (
 <italic>E. coli, S. aureus, B. bronchiseptica</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and were comparable to the standard available drugs. However, they showed better bacterial inhibition than plant leaf extract and chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. The green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles also demonstrated significant anticancer and antioxidant activities against MCF-7 cancer cells and the linoleic acid system, respectively, comparable to the employed standard drug and external standard antioxidant, respectively. Moreover, green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles presented excellent biocompatibility with Vero cell lines compared to chemically synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles. It is interesting to note that 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet leaf extract was also found to be active towards antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. These results suggest that the green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticlesâ€™ enhanced biological activities might be attributed to the synergetic effect (physical properties and adsorbed phytomolecules on their surface). Thus, the antioxidant, antibacterial, biocompatibility, and anticancer activities results displayed the potential of green synthesized Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles for different future biomedical applications (antifungal, antilarvicidal, etc.). Hence, nanoparticles synthesis using leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet is an efficient, robust, economical, and green method that produces biocompatible and biological active nanoparticles. The use of leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Abutilon indicum</italic> (L.) Sweet can be further extended for synthesizing various other biocompatible nanomaterials for biological applications.
