<p>The flavor pattern was analyzed with an Electronic Nose system (Model 7100 Fast GC Analyzer, Electronic Sensor Technology, Newbury Park, CA, USA) equipped with a surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor based on the gas chromatograph (GC) system. Three different samples were prepared: control (non-treated coffee), Cordyceps coffee, and simple mixture of 30% Cordyceps powder in ground coffee. The ground coffees were directly analyzed, and the espresso were analyzed when freshly brewed in a semi-automatic coffee machine (EC 680M, De’ Longhi Appliances, Treviso, Italy). Each sample was placed in a 40 mL vial (Supelco Inc., Bellefonte, PA, USA) and sealed with Teflon-coated septa (PTFE/silicone septa, Supelco Inc.). When samples were at equilibrium, the volatile components were injected through the sample injection port for 20 s. High purity helium was used as the carrier gas, and the DB-624 capillary column (0.33 mm, 0.25 mm ×1 m, J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) was heated from 30°C to 120°C at a rate of 3°C/s. The run time was set to 30 s, and the temperatures of the sensor, column, valve, and inlet were set to 30°C, 40°C, 50°C, and 50°C, respectively.</p>
