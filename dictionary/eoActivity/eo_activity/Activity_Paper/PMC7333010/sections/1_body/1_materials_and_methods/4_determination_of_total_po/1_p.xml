<p>Total polyphenol contents were analyzed using Folin- Ciocalteu reagent, which develops a molybdenum blue color when it is reduced by a polyphenolic substance in food. Twenty microliters of the coffee extracts were diluted in 1.4 mL 
 <italic>d</italic>-water, then 0.1 mL Folin-Denis reagent was added, and the mixture was vortexed. After 5 min, a saturated solution of 0.3 mL sodium carbonate was added, and the mixture was filled to 2 mL and incubated at 40Â°C for 1 h. The absorbance was measured at 765 nm using an ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometer (DU 650, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Opa-locka, FL, USA). The standard curve was obtained using gallic acid and the total polyphenol content was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g (
