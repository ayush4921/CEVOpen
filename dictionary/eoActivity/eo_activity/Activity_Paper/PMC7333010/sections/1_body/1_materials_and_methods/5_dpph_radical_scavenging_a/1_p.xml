<p>Antioxidant activity, expressed in electron donating ability [EDA (%)], was analyzed using the DPPH free radical scavenging method. Coffee extract (0.2 mL) was mixed with 0.8 mL of 0.2 mM DPPH solution and vortexed for 10 s. The reaction was incubated in the dark for 30 min and the absorbance was measured at 525 nm. The EDA (%) was calculated as follows (
