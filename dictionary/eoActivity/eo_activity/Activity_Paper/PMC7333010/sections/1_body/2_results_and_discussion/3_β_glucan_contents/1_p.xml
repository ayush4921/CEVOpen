<p>The β-glucan contents are shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The β-glucan content of the medicinal mushrooms were 3.79% (Cordyceps), 7.06% (Phellinus), and 8.57% (Chaga). Chaga mushrooms also had the highest total glucan content of 9.70%. Cordyceps coffee contained β-glucan and total glucan contents of 2.03% and 3.11%, respectively, substantially lower than those for the raw mushrooms. However, the glucans from the mushrooms are thought to have been absorbed into the coffee beans. 
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">An et al. (2019b)</xref> reported the β-glucan content of result of ethanol extracts from various medicinal mushrooms in Korea and China. In this study, β-glucan contents of 45.11% and 24.7% were reported for Cordyceps mushrooms from Korea and China, respectively; these values significantly differ from our results.
