<p>Similarly, 
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al. (2015)</xref> reported that the DPPH radical scavenging capacity of coffee immersed in mulberry extract was higher (50.67∼55.25%) than the control (45.51∼47.02%). The antioxidant activity of food is closely related to the polyphenol compounds present in the constituent plants, because it is thought that the DPPH radicals are scavenged by the phenolic hydroxyl groups present in a number of polyphenol compounds. Kim et al. (2007) isolated four major polyphenol compounds (e.g. caffeic acid) that contribute to the antioxidant activity of Chaga mushrooms.
