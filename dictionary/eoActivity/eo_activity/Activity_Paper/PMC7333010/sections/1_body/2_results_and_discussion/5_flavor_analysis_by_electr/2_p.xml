<p>The flavor patterns of three samples (control, Cordyceps coffee, and the mixture of 30% Cordyceps mushroom powder with ground coffee) were analyzed by an electronic nose equipped with a GC-based SAW sensor; the derivative is shown in 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. Derivative chromatograms are obtained by differentiating changes in the frequencies detected from the sensor on the retention time (RT). The chromatograms for the control (A) and Cordyceps coffee (B) were almost identical. However, there were distinct differences in the chromatograms between the mixture (C) and A/B, despite a similar overall peak pattern (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In the ground state, some flavor components (e.g. the peaks of 12, 14, 16, 18, and 19) were only detected in C, which implies that these flavors are from the Cordyceps mushrooms. However, the compounds at peaks 10 and 20 were only detected in A and B. Furthermore, the peaks at 7, 13, and 21, which were considered to be major peaks in A and B, were significantly reduced in C.
