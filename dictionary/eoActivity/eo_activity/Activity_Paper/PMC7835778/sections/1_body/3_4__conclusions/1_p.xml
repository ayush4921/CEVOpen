<p>Medicinal plant decoctions traditionally used in Reunion Island could represent the basis of new therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing or limiting the progression of atherosclerosis [

 <xref rid="B27-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Among these compounds, flavonoids such as quercetin could be, at least in part, responsible for the bioactivity of these plant-based herbal teas. Different studies also highlighted other polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid, kaempferol or mangiferin, reported to limit the cytotoxicity induced by fatty acids and oxidative stress [

 <xref rid="B60-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This is consistent with the beneficial effects of decoctions from the eight selected plants from Reunion Island tested in this study, traditionally used for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and lipid-lowering properties. It cannot be excluded that these active ingredients act synergistically. The interest of the present study is to document the effects of complex mixtures of bioactive compounds (herbal teas rich in polyphenols) according to their traditional use in Reunion Island. Identification of the exact bioactive molecules in these plants is of interest and should be further investigated in complementary studies.
