<p>RAW-Blue™ cells (monocyte-macrophages) obtained from Invivogen cell culture collection (Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA), were seeded at a density of 100 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate. 20 µL of medium supplemented with decoctions (reaching 40 μg plant mash/mL of cell culture medium) was added to the cells. Cells were then immediately treated with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> lipopolysaccharides (LPS) Ultrapure (Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) at a final concentration of 0.5 µg/mL. After 24 h of incubation, 20 µL of medium was recovered and 80 μL of Quantiblue reagent (Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was added. RAW-Blue™ cells stably express secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) inducible by NF-κB. NF-κB activation was evaluated by the measure of the absorbance at 620 nm. Results were expressed as percentages of the control.
