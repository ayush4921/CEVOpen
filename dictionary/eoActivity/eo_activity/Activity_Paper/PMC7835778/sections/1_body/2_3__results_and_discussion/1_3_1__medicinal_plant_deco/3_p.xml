<p>As presented in

 <italic>H. ambavilla</italic>, 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic>, 
 <italic>H. lanceolatum</italic>, 
 <italic>P. x graveolens</italic> and 
 <italic>S cumini</italic> could suggest an effect on cell proliferation. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00280-f001">Figure 1</xref>b shows that incubation with 50 µg/mL ox-LDLs did not induce any cytotoxic effect; the cell viability was comparable to control non-stimulated cells. Using the same concentration of ox-LDLs (50 µg/mL), Ding et al. reported vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation as measured by the MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B43-nutrients-13-00280" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This effect was not found in our experimental conditions, using macrophages. A significant decrease in cell viability was observed after the incubation with 200 and 300 µg/mL of ox-LDL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-13-00280-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The concentration of 200 µg/mL of ox-LDL leading to 50% of cell death was selected to assess the potential protective effect of medicinal plant decoctions.
