<p>The RA harvest stretches from September to November. The fieldwork presented in this work was carried out during the cultivation and harvesting periods in 2018–2019, and involved a variety of locations in China: Guyang County, Wuchuan County, Helin County, Duolun County, Shangdu County, Naiman County, Siziwang County, etc. in the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia, and Min County and Longxi County in Gansu Province. Based on the characteristics of RA in the supply chain, we modified and designed three different structural questionnaires (

Semi-structured interviews and key informant interviews were conducted with experienced participants in the RA industry. In total, 34 farmers, 16 members of agricultural cooperatives or planting companies, three middlemen, 10 managers of processing companies, and 21 retailers provided information on the production, processing, and retail aspects of the RA industry.
