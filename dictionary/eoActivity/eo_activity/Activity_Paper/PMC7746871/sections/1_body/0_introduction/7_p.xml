<p>From the perspective of VCs, the study aims to achieve the quality control strategy of RA. The study was mainly carried out in Inner Mongolia, which is the main production and 
 <italic>daodi</italic> area for RA, in terms of economic, medicinal value and traded volume of plants. This work was based on information arising from an investigation conducted in the main areas of RA production, including Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Hebei, etc. Differences of the stakeholders, financial flows, and information about RA from production to consumer among its VCs were elucidated. The quality of RA was measured based on its main active ingredients (

We further described the effects of geographical indication on the quality and yield of the medicinal material and the competitive advantage of vertical coordination. Hopefully, the study will be helpful for the sustainable supplement of high-quality RA.
