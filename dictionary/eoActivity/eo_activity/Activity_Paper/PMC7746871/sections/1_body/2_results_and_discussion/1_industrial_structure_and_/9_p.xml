<p>VC 9 involves another form of integrated vertical coordination in which products are directly supplied to export markets. In VC 9, the botanical raw materials begin with medicinal material growers in China, which are then exported to consumers in foreign countries via the export markets. In this VC, some of the RA is used for medicine for treatment or health care under the guidance of traditional practitioners, and some is finely processed by the drug manufacturer. Furthermore, “added value” occurs due to the processing which is carried out by the farmers, processers, export and import middlemen, suppliers, and foreign herbal practitioners. The planting company becomes linked with the sourcing companies (i.e., joint ventures or big pharma) in order to enter the export market. In the process, the stakeholders need to pay careful attention to the quality of the products in order to improve the reliability of the RA production system and achieve reputational and marketing goals. RA agriculture also encourages producers to implement the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point System (HACCP). However, the RA produced in this VC is exported through a complicated series of quality inspection and intermediate sales procedures, without second processing, and is finally sold in the export market as prescription drugs or health food.</p>
