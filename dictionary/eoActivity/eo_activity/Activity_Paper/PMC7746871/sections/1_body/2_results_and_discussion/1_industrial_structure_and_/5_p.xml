<p>VCs 1 and 2 begin with independent farmers with relatively small RA fields (&lt;2 ha). These tend to be of traditional, small-scale, peasant economy form, and have been an important part of RA production for decades. Most of the time, the RA is delicately processed and graded in order to gain more profit, while the exception is when cash is scarce and they are sold as fresh roots. In these VCs, farmers often sell RA through large suppliers, such as middlemen, cooperatives, etc., and these procedures lead to high transaction costs and switching cost. Although the yields of RA products are sometimes higher than in other stages, procurement difficulties limit farmers’ incomes. Farmers near traditional herbal medicine markets or processing companies can sell their products directly to increase profits earned from cultivation of this medicinal plant. The model is especially prevalent in the parts of Gansu and eastern Inner Mongolia where RA is cultivated.</p>
