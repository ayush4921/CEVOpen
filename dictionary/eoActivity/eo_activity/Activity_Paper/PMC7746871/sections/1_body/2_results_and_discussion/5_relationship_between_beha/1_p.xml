<p>RA is a traditional herbal medicine and is included in a broad range of products including foods, beverages, cigarettes, toiletries, etc. As demand for RA has grown, the standards used to specify its purity and identification have not always kept pace with the expansion process.

Production processes driven by economic value can result in the products having poor quality and suffering from adulteration. In the current context, this means the RA products contain an insufficient amount of the active ingredients, an excessive amount of pesticide residues and/or heavy metals or be mixed with

They are also more likely to be used in adulteration schemes. The problem is more likely to occur in the traditional herbal medicine market, but the form of adulteration only works in the short term. In the longer term, it will seriously affect the credibility of such unscrupulous sellers and the prices they are able to charge.
