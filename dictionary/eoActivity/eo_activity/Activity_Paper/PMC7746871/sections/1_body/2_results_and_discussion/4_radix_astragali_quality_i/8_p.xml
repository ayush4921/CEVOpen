<p>As VCs 1–6 involve multiple sources and intermediary nodes, the information that needs to be collected is more widely dispersed which makes it much more difficult to check the integrity of the traceability chain. VCs 7–8 incorporate traceable management information platforms that record a certain amount of electronic data (covering breeding, cultivation, production processing, and circulation) for the whole supply chain according to specified requirements. Unfortunately, almost all the current traceability technologies in place only provide production or sales information. That is, it excludes information about habitat (precautions taken before planting and details of the natural and geographical environments) and input of agricultural materials (e.g., fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides). Only the products in VC 9 that link directly to export markets are developed under complete product-to-market control.</p>
