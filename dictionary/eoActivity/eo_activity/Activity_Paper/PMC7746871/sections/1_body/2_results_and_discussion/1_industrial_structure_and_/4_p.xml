 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> demonstrates the 10 primary VCs identified for RA and the stakeholders involved. Different stakeholders may have various roles, and the division of labor is also slightly different. Among the 10 VCs, middlemen or agricultural cooperatives play intermediary roles in VCs 1–4, while in VCs 5–10 production is made to order which weakens the role of middlemen.
