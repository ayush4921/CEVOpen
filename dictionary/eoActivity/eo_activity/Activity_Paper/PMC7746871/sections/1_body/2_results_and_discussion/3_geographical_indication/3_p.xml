 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> displays the results of the content analyses. Clustering analysis (using the 
 <italic>k</italic>-means algorithm and R v3.6.1 software package) was then adopted to compare the samples. The results are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> in the form of a dendrogram. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, the samples collected from Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Gansu Province are divided into different clusters (labeled Ⅰ and Ⅱ). Cluster Ⅱ is further divided into three subgroups (labeled a, b and c) based on geographic variation. The contents of active ingredients in the RA from Gansu Province are found to be lower than that in the products from Inner Mongolia; however, the yield of medicinal material is higher. The RA 
 <italic>daodi</italic> herbal medicines from specific areas of Guyang, Helin, Wuchuan, and Wulateqian counties are of better quality than that from other habitats due to their natural geographical environments and human factors, etc. The results of our geographical indication evaluation were universally accepted by the stakeholders involved in the production and supply chains. The RA also includes other saponins, flavonoids, polysaccharides, amino acids, etc. Researchers have tried to establish comprehensive quality evaluation protocols for RA by using fingerprinting methods (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Future research will we need to explore the comprehensive influence of multi-index components on quality control indices and evaluate resources for RA.
