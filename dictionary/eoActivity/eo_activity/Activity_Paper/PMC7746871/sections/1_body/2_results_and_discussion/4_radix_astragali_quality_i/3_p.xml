<p>The contents of total Pd, Cd, As, Hg, and Cu vary between 0 and 2.4061 mg/kg, 0 and 0.0369 mg/kg, 0.0112 and 0.2213 mg/kg, 0 and 0.1125 mg/kg, 4.7928 and 9.2858 mg/kg, with an average concentration of 0.6165, 0.0054, 0.0839, 0.0362, and 7.0418 mg/kg, respectively. The contents of heavy metals in RA comply with the limit standard of Chinese Pharmacopoeia, as well as the standards of the natural traditional Chinese Medicine materials, and standards of China Hong Kong, Japan, China Taiwan, United Kingdom and the United States (

From the measured pesticide residues, it was observed that the residues of BHC, DDT, and PCNB were found in samples at levels below 0.0488, 0.0023, and 0.0015 mg/kg, which were below permissible limits. The concentration of organochlorine pesticide residue was found to be within safe limits. Heavy metal and pesticide residues were found to be up to the standard as found in the study (
