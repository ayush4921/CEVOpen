<p>Recently, natural products have been reported to have the potential to be developed faster and cheaper than conventional single drug. For example, curcumin, lycopene, monascin, ankaflavin, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, berberine, amphene, tanshinone IIA, hesperetin, and naringenin inhibit cholesterol absorption in enterocytes [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, natural products, especially phenolic compounds of these products, may inhibit pancreatic lipase, cholesterol esterase, and solubility of cholesterol micelles. Vinegar is generally used as a food condiment and as an alternative medicine for obesity [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], hyperlipidemia [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], hyperglycemia [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and cancer [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and as a disinfectant [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The nipa palm (
 <italic>Nypa fruticans</italic> Wurmb) vinegar has been used by Southeast Asia, and it has showed biological activities, such as antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], antidiabetic activity [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and hepatoprotective effects [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, the NPV could be a natural alternative to treat common diseases from contemporary diet. Nevertheless, the antilipidemic activity of this vinegar has not been previously evaluated. This study aimed to investigate phenolic compounds and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory effects on pancreatic lipase, cholesterol esterase, and cholesterol micellization of nipa palm vinegar.
