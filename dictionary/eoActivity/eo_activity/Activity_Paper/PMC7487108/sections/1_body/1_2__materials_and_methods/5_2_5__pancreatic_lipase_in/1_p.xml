<p>Pancreatic lipase inhibition assay was undertaken as described by Adisakwattana et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In brief, 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of nipa palm vinegar diluted with distilled water, or positive control (orlistat), was mixed with 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of porcine pancreatic lipase solution and 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of oleate ester of 0.1 mM fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MUO) solution in phosphate buffer saline, subsequently. The mixture was incubated at 37
 <sup>o</sup>C for 20 min. Reaction was stopped by adding 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of 0.1 M sodium citrate at pH 4.2. The fluorescence of 4-methylumbelliferone released by the lipase was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 450 nm, respectively. Control without sample or orlistat represented 100% pancreatic lipase (PL) activity. The tests were performed in triplicate.
