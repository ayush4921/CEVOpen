<p>Cholesterol micelles served as a model system for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cholesterol micellization and were prepared according to a previous method [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In brief, the micelle solution (2 mM cholesterol, 1 mM oleic acid, and 2.4 mM phosphatidylcholine) was dissolved in methanol and then dried under nitrogen. After that, 15 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 6.6 mM taurocholate salt, pH 7.4, was added onto the dried micelles. The emulsion was sonicated twice for 30 min using a sonicator. The micelle solution was incubated overnight at 37°C. Various concentrations of nipa palm vinegar or equivalent PBS as a control were added into the micelle solutions, and samples were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. This mixture was then centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant of the mixture was collected for determination of cholesterol using total cholesterol test kits (Human Diagnostics Worldwide, Weisbaden, Germany). Gallic acid served as a positive control. All tests were taken in triplicate analysis.
