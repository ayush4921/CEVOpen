 <italic>Morus alba</italic> L. belongs to the Moraceae family. It is a deciduous shrub or tree that is grown naturally, and is widely cultivated for medicinal and edible purposes. Four 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> parts have been used medicinally, as registered in the Korean pharmacopeias, including the twigs (Sang-Ji, Mori Ramulus), leaves (Sang-Yeop, Mori Folium), fruits (Sang-Sim-Ja, Mori Fructus), and root barks (Sanb-Baek-Pi, Mori Radicis Cortex), each of which have different therapeutic efficacies [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Each medicinal 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> part has various pharmacological effects due to its specific phytochemicals. For example, twigs have hepatoprotective effects from stilbenes [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and leaves have anti-cancer effects from phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, each medicinal part presents different chemical compositions, and shows distinguishable pharmacological effects, such as the differences in the anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-tyrosinase effects of the leaves, fruits, twigs, stems, and root barks [
