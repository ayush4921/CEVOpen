<p>Previous studies compared the chemical compositions of different 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> parts using HPLC analysis [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] with orthogonal projection for latent structures discriminant analysis [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; however, the sample size for each medicinal part was insufficient, and the statistical comparison did not investigate quantitative differences in the marker compounds of the medicinal parts. In this study, a simultaneous analytical method was established and validated that determine 12 marker compounds in the four medicinal 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> parts. The quantitative differences in these marker compounds were compared statistically, and chemometric analysis (i.e., principal components analysis and heatmap analysis) was used to investigate the chemical characteristics of each medicinal part and their related compounds.
