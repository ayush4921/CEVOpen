<p>The relation between plant part and marker compound was investigated using chemometric analyses, including principal component analysis and heatmap analysis. The PC score plot demonstrated that the 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> samples showed confirmable distinguishment from other parts by their PC1 and PC2 scores (responsible for 58% of total variance), except for some overlapped samples of the root barks (SB) and leaves (SY). The PC scores of the loading plot explain the influential compounds in the clustering of the samples [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05592" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]: the root bark samples (SBs) were clustered mainly by mulberroside A, taxifolin, kuwanon G and morusin; the twig samples (SJs) were clustered mainly by 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and oxyresveratrol; and the leaf samples (SYs) were clustered mainly by skimmin, chlorogenic acid, rutin, isoquercitrin, astragalin and quercitrin. Likewise, the clustered heatmap, which visualizes the relationships between clusters and influential markers, shows that the 
 <italic>Morus</italic> samples were distinguished into four distinctive clusters, according to their medicinal parts and their highly associated marker compounds. This result is similar to the PC score and loading plot results, except for quercitrin.
