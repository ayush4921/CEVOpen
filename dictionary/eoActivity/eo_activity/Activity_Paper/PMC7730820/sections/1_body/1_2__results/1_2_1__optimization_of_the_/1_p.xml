<p>For better extraction efficiencies of the 12 marker compounds, ultrasonic extraction of the Morus samples was conducted at multiple solvent ratios (methanol:water = 10:0, 7:3, and 5:5). The 70% methanol mixture showed balanced extraction efficiencies of the 12 marker compounds (i.e., the middle values of the compoundsâ€™ absolute peak areas), compared with the methanol alone and the 50% solvent mixture; therefore, the Morus samples were extracted using the 70% methanol mixture for 30 min with the ultrasonic extractor.</p>
