<p>These relationships were marked as a dip red color and were observed more distinctively in the clustered heatmap. The Morus samples were obviously divided into four groups according to medicinal part, except for SB04, −05, −07, −11, and −15, which were clustered in the fruit samples. Rutin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, skimmin, and chlorogenic acid were mainly prominent in the leaf samples, while rutin and isoquercitrin were also apparent in some fruit samples. Mulberroside A, taxifolin, kuwanon G, and morusin were most obvious in the root bark samples, but lesser so in the twig samples. Moreover, 4-Hydroxycinnamic acid and oxyresveratrol were apparent in the twig samples. Quercitrin was found in some of the leaf samples, and its relation to other compounds was unlike the distribution of the PC loading plot (
