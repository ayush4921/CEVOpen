<p id="Par68">Ethnobotanical studies conducted in neighboring regions present a plethora of similarities in terms of plant uses, plant parts utilized, processing, and application methods. The edibility of 
 <italic>A. acutifolius</italic> young shoots is reported in regions of western Turkey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], while its medicinal effect against kidney-related diseases is mentioned by local people of the Marmaris district [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The skin wart and toothache therapeutic properties of 
 <italic>F. carica</italic> latex have been presented by locals of the Alaşehir region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], the Marmara island [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and Turgutlu district [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The effects of infused 
 <italic>Melissa officinalis</italic> L. flowering stems as sedative and treatment against memory disturbances, coughing, and abdominal pain, that have also been reported by Axiotis et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] (Greece), are cited by people living at the neighboring Edremit Gulf [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] and Kapıdağ Peninsula [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Same or very similar processing methods (olive oil lotion) and applications (healing of skin wounds, hemorrhoids, stomach ailments, and ulcer) of 
 <italic>H. perfoliatum</italic> and 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> are described in the works of Sargin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], Bulut [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], Uysal et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and Polat and Satıl [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. 
 <italic>J. regia</italic> leaves are applied externally for dental care purposes by inhabitants of the Marmara island [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], nearly coinciding with the teeth whitening properties of the fruit peel cited by our informants. 
 <italic>C. zacintha</italic> was presented in only one nearby study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], however attributing different preparations and medicinal uses (cut, boiled, and drunk to treat hemorrhoids versus eaten raw to treat skin warts in our study). Lastly, several plant species cited by our respondents as edibles or spices present the same usage in some of the aforementioned study areas. These include the pickled flower buds of 
 <italic>Capparis</italic> spinosa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], young stems of 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>],

 <italic>Erodium cicutarium</italic> (L.) L’Her [
