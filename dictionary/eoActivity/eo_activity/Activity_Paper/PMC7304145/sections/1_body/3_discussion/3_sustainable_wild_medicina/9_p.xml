<p id="Par80">In terms of plant parts extracted, wild plant harvesting in Lemnos tends to be ecologically sustainable as the removal of roots, wood, bark, bulbs, apical meristems, phloem saps, and whole plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] was avoided almost entirely. Among the seventeen most harvested medicinal plant taxa only in two cases, the plant part harvested combined with the plant’s life form suggests a medium susceptibility to overcollection (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). The first case refers to 
 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic>, whose flower collection may affect its ability to perpetuate, as it is an annual plant species with its flower being the only reproductive structure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. So, the argument of some harvesters that the “comb-hand” technique benefits the plant’s regeneration compared to non-harvesting cannot be evaluated as valid in these terms. Similarly, the removal of the whole aerial part of the annual/biennial 
 <italic>S. oleraceus</italic> raises the species’ vulnerability to overcollection and thus lowers the chances of an ecologically sustainable harvest.
