<p id="Par56">Uprooting and overharvesting were identified as the most common reasons for the downturn of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic> populations. While this plant subspecies was plentiful and easy to find in the past, nowadays it has become less abundant and more difficult to find. Its growing reputation as a spice and flavor enhancer on a local level during the last decade led to an increasing demand for it. Thus, more and more inhabitants started collecting it for home consumption or small-scale commercialization.
