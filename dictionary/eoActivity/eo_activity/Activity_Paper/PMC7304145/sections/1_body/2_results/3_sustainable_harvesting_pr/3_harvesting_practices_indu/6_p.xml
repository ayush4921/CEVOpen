<p id="Par50">A distinct method suggested for 
 <italic>M. chamomilla</italic> and 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> flower harvesting was the “comb-hand” technique. In this method, the harvester uses his/her palm with fingers slightly open—forming a comb-like form—so that the stem of a plant slides between them but flowers are trapped inside the harvester’s palm when pulling up. This way the needed flower heads are detached, and the remaining plant parts are left unaffected, allowing plant reproduction.
