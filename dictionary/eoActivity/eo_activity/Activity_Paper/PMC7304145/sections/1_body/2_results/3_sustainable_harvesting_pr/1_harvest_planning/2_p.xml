<p id="Par40">A harvester emphasized that his/her harvest planning relies principally on information regarding plant maturity that he/she acquires throughout frequent visits at the harvesting sites. Specifically, harvesting of mature or fading flowers was mentioned oftentimes for plant taxa like 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic>, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cistus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic>, 
 <italic>H. perfoliatum</italic>, 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic>, 
 <italic>H. triquetrifolium</italic> Turra, 
 <italic>H. olympicum</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic>. It was said that the harvesting of these plants needs to be scheduled in advance. Harvesters mentioned that at that stage, flowers have had enough time to attract pollinators but still hold their medicinal properties and can be removed.
