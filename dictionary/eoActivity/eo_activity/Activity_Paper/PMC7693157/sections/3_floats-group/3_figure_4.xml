  <p>A live/dead assay after treatment of HeLa cells with the four studied extracts over 24, 48, and 72 h. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Green fluorescence denotes viable cells stained with calcein-AM, while red fluorescence represents dead cells stained with propidium iodide. Then, data analysis was performed using ImageJ software and Prism 5 (
   <bold>B</bold>) 24 h, (
   <bold>C</bold>) 48 h and (
   <bold>D</bold>) 72 h. All results are expressed as a total percentage of viable and dead cells from four random fields with mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent determinations. Scale bar represents 50 μm.
