<p>In order to verify that the effect of the studied extracts on the growth inhibition of HeLa cells was related to apoptosis, analysis of the apoptotic and necrotic cells was performed using Annexin V. After 48 h of the treatment with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the four extracts, a double labelling was done with PI that staining the necrotic cells with red fluorescence and Annexin V-FITC which produce cytoplasmic green labelling for apoptotic cells. Images from fluorescent microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f006">Figure 6</xref>A), showed that viable cells were negative for both PI and Annexin V. While XA and IC were shown considerable green and red labelling for both apoptotic and necrotic cells, respectively. A significant detection of apoptotic cells was shown upon cell treatment with both EG and DP, indicating that cells mainly underwent apoptosis with those extracts.
