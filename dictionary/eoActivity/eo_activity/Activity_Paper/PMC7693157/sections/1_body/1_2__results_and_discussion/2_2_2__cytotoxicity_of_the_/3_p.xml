<p>According to the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) plant screening program, a crude plant extract is generally considered to have acceptable in vitro cytotoxic activity if the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value is less than 20 µg/mL after incubation 48 and 72 h treatment of cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Based on these results, the four plant extracts were shown potent cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells after 72 h, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 17.93, 27.61, 30.10 and 32.29 µg/mL for DP, XA, EG and IC, respectively. Thus, HeLa cells were selected for the assessment of inhibition mechanisms.
