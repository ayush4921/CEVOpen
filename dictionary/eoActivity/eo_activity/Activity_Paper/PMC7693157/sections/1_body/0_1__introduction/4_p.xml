<p>In this study, a well-established evaluation of the anticancer potential of these four plant extracts: (i) XA, (ii) IC, (iii) EG and (iv) DP was performed to assess their activities in the inhibition of cell proliferation in seven different human cancer cell lines: HeLa (cervical), MDA-MB-231 (breast), A549 (lung), HepG2 (liver), U-87 (glioblastoma, brain), SK-OV-3 (ovarian) and HL60 (leukemia). As well, an assessment of in vitro toxicity of these plant extracts was performed in non-cancerous HEK-293 cells. HeLa cells showed a higher sensitivity in cell proliferation assay upon treatment with these extracts, so further studies of the alteration and induction of cell death were investigated in HeLa cell line, by comparing the treated cells with these extracts to the untreated cells, using different assays involving cell cycle analysis, the caspase 3/7 activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The effect of the studied medicinal plants on the inhibition of cell progression and metastasis was assessed using the wound healing assay. Furthermore, a single cell gel electrophoresis assay was performed to exclude any probable genetic toxicity upon using of these extracts in cancer treatment.</p>
