 <italic>Imperata cylindrica</italic> (IC) (family Poaceae) also known as spear grass in West Africa, has diuretic, anti- inflammatory and antibacterial activities [

 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It also shows a potent anthelmintic activity [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the methanolic extract of its rhizomes was reported as a significant neuroprotective against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of rat cortical cells [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>Echinops giganteus</italic> (EG), (family Compositae) is traditionally used as a medicinal agent mainly in Africa and Asia. It is mainly used as heart and gastric troubles spice, reducing as well asthma attacks. In previous studies, the root methanolic extract showed significant antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], antibacterial [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and antifungal effects [
 <xref rid="B18-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The methanolic extract of EG roots also exhibited a significant activity against M. tuberculosis [
 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the methanolic extract from the underground part also reported for cytotoxic activity against prostate cancer (Mia PaCa
 <sub>2</sub>) and two leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000) [

 <italic>Dorstenia psilurus</italic> (DP), (family Moraceae) is widely used in traditional medicine and represents a great source of active constituents including flavonoids, alkaloids and phenolic compounds [

 <xref rid="B22-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has a therapeutic effect on cardiovascular disorders, snakebites, headache and stomach disorders, moreover it exhibits a potent antimicrobial activity and as its methanolic showed antibacterial activity against a panel of Gram-negative bacteria including multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotypes [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recent study reported the isolation of two isoprenylated flavones from the root extract of DP that activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), stimulate glucose uptake and lower glycemia [
