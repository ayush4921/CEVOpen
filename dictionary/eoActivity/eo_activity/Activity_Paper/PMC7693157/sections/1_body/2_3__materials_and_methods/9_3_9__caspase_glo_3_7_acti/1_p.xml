<p>The influence of extracts on caspase 3/7 activity in HeLa cells was observed using Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit (Promega). Following the manufacturer protocol, cells cultured in RPMI were seeded in 96-well plates overnight, then treated with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the crude plant extracts obtained from the MTT assay and untreated cells as a control. After 24 h treatment, 100 ÂµL of caspase reagent were added to each well, mixed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The luminescence was measured using a Fluostar Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany), then caspase activity was expressed as percentage of the untreated control within five replicates reading.
