<p>Cell viability was measured by a standard MTT assay method [
 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The plant extracts were dissolved in DMSO, then diluted with cell culture medium to different serial dilutions (200 to 1 µg/mL) while the concentration of vehicle control (DMSO) was kept at or below 0.1%., 1% Triton-x was used as a positive control and untreated cells receiving the same volume of medium served as control For all adherent cells, the cells were cultured in 96-well plates (4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well) and incubated at 37 °C for 24, 48 and 72 h. After that, a 20 μL MTT (5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) solution was added to each well and incubated for 4 h, then 150 μL of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance data was detected by a microplate reader at 490 nm. For Leukemia HL60, a suspension of 4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL were seeded in 96-well plates and immediately after, serial dilution of the extracts in the media was added. After adequate incubation 24, 48 and 72 h, the 96-well plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g, 4 °C for 5 min in a microplate-compatible centrifuge, then the media was carefully aspirated and treated with MTT solution as above mentioned. The viability was observed based on comparison with the absorbance of untreated and treated cells. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were obtained from the concentration of the plant extracts that induced 50% inhibition of cell growth using the GraphPad prism 5 software. Additionally, each test was replicated three times independently.
