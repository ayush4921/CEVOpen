<p>To initially assess the possible cytotoxic effect of the studied plant extracts, the colorimetric sulphorhodamine-B (SRB) assay was used for measurement of cell proliferation [
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Briefly, 4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> of HeLa (cervical cancer) and HEK293 (non-tumor) cells were added to each well of a 96-well plate and incubated overnight to allow for cell attachment. The cells were then treated with serial dilutions of the four plant extracts: XA, IC, EG and DP (200 to 1 µg/mL) and 1% Triton-x was used as a positive control. Untreated cells receiving the same volume of medium were served as a control while the concentration of vehicle control (DMSO) was kept at or below 0.1%. After 48 h exposure, the cells were fixed with ice-cold 10% TCA at 4 °C for 1 h, then washed four times under slow-running tap water, afterwards, stained with 0.057% (

The plates were read at 540 nm absorbance on a Fluostar microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany), the determination of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was based on dose-response curves between the extract concentration and percent growth inhibition using the GraphPad Prism 5 software. The values are expressed as mean ± SD with all the experiments independently performed in triplicate.
