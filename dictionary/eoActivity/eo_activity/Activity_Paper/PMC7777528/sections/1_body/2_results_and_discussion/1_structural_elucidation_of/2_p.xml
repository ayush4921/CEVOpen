<p id="Par33">Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was obtained as a light red amorphous solid. The positive high resolution-ESI mass spectrum gave a pseudomolecular ion at

 <sup>+</sup>, corresponding to a molecular formula C
 <sub>25</sub>H
 <sub>32</sub>O
 <sub>12</sub>. In the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum, four proton signals which resonated at δ 7.12 (
 <italic>s</italic>, H-4), 7.28 (1H, 
 <italic>dd</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 1.3, 7.3 Hz, H-7), 7.36 (1H, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.2 Hz, H-6) and 7.40 (1H, 
 <italic>dd</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 1.3, 8.2 Hz, H-5) indicated the presence of aromatic ring moiety. Three of these proton signals which are multiplets imply that they are found in close proximity (or are adjacent) and the fourth singlet aromatic proton peak at δ 7.12 (
 <italic>s</italic>, H-4) provides clues for the presence of a fused aromatic ring system. The presence of a disaccharide unit in compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was revealed by the typical anomeric proton signals at δ 3.31 (1H, 
 <italic>m</italic>, H-4′′) and 5.05 (1H, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 7.9 Hz, H-1′). The proton peaks from δ 5.05 to 2.91 further justify the presence of a disaccharide moiety. The 
 <sup>13</sup>C spectrum region from δ 76.82 to 66.59 also confirmed that the compound contains a disaccharide moiety. In addition, the two elevated 
 <sup>13</sup>C sugar signals at δ 102.84 and 100.86 indicate that the sugar units are linked through acetal bond. Furthermore, the absence of one CH signal in the sugar region (δ 76.82–δ 66.59) suggests one of the sugar units to be rhamnose. And this was found to be in good agreement with 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR reports of similar glycosides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, the disaccharide moiety was confirmed to be rhamnose-glucose 1,6 linkage. In addition, the presence of 10 
 <sup>13</sup>C signals from δ 154.71 to δ 110.5 implies that the fused aromatic ring system is naphthalene. Six of these carbon signals are absent from DEPT spectrum indicating they are quaternary aromatic carbons. Besides, two of them are elevated (δ 154.71 and δ 151.49) suggesting that they are oxygenated quaternary aromatic carbons. On the other hand, the two less elevated (δ 136.74 and δ 113.54) quaternary aromatic carbons are the bridgehead carbons of the fused aromatic system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The remaining two quaternary aromatic carbon signals resonated at δ 124.73 (C-2) and δ 133.30 (C-3). Lastly, the 
 <sup>13</sup>C signals at 207.7 and 41.3 are the carbonyl carbon and its acetyl methyl. Therefore, based on the above evidence and in comparison with 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data of the same and related compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], the structure of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was determined to be dianellin or 1-(1-hydroxy-3-methyl-8-(((2S,3R,4S,5S,6R)3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-((((2S,3S,4S,5S,6R)3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-methyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)methyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2yl)oxy)naphthalen-2-yl) ethanone (Fig.
