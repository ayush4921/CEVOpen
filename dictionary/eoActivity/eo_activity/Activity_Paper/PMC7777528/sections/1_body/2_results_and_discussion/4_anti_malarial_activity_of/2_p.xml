<p id="Par38">Among the isolated compounds, knipholone displayed the strongest anti-malarial activity against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> infected mice (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Although knipholone and dianellin showed significant suppression at all dose levels tested, the former displayed superior activity with percent suppression values of 55.14 and 60.16% at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, it significantly prolonged the mean survival days of the treatment groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The dose–response plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) disclosed that the ED
 <sub>50</sub> values of knipholone and dianellin were 81.25 and 92.31 mg/kg, respectively. However, neither of the compounds caused significant difference in percent change of weight among the treated groups.
