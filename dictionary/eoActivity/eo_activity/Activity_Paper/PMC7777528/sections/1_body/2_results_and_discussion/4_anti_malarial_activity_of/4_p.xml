<p id="Par40">In this study, the acute toxicity as well as the in vivo antiplasmodial activities of the various extracts of 
 <italic>K. folosia</italic> and its major constituents was evaluated against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> in mice. Since members of the genus 
 <italic>Kniphofia</italic> have been documented to produce anthraquinones and related phenols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], the total extract was further fractionated into phenolic and nonphenolic fractions. Results of the current study demonstrated that the hydroalcoholic extract, the fractions as well as the isolated compounds significantly suppressed parasitaemia indicating that they possesses blood schizonticidal activity on early infection of mice with 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic>. The results also revealed that the in vivo ED
 <sub>50</sub> values of knipholone (81.25 mg/kg) and dianellin (92.31 mg/kg) correlate well with their reported in vitro activities. After 4 days of treatment with different doses of knipholone and dianellin, there were significant differences in percent parasite suppression among the treatment groups. However, there was no significant change in mean survival time among mice administered with different doses of knipholone and dianellin except that the animals which received 100 and 200 mg/kg of knipholone survived longer than those given 25 mg/kg of the compound. This is an indication that the different doses of the test compounds have the same effect on overall pathologic effect of the parasite in mice concurrent with previous results obtained for the crude extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>Strychnos mitis</italic> leaves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on acute toxicity and in vivo anti-malarial evaluation of 
 <italic>K. folosia</italic> and its constituents.
