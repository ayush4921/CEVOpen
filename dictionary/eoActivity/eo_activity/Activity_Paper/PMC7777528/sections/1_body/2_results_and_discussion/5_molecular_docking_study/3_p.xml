<p id="Par44">The binding modes of knipholone and chloroquine to pfLDH binding site are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Knipholone (− 29.1 kJ/mol) showed stronger binding interaction with pfLDH than chloroquine (− 24.7 kJ/mol). Knipholone forms hydrogen bonds with Ile54 and Val98 amino acid residues. Its carbonyl oxygen (at C-9) and hydroxyl group in ring A (at C-1) of the anthraquinone moiety, and the carbonyl oxygen (at C-3′) of the phloroglucinol moiety together with the 
 <italic>ortho</italic> and 
 <italic>para</italic> hydroxyl groups (at C-1′ and C-4′) are not favourable for binding. From the experimental data, there were seven hydrogen bonds in pfLDH-NADH complex, of which four are observed in this study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Chloroquine on its part showed two hydrogen bonds with Asp53 and Gly99 amino acid residues. One of the N-ethyl groups of chloroquine is not needed in the hydrophilic binding sites. Moreover, the actual pfLDH-chloroquine complex also showed two hydrogen bonds with Glu122 and Gly99 [
