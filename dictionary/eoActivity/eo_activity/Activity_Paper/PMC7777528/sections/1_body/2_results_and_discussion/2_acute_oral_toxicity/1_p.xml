<p id="Par35">Acute oral toxicity test results of this study documented that the 80% methanol extract of 
 <italic>K. foliosa,</italic> knipholone and dianellin were safe at a dose of 2000 mg/kg [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. After 72 h, the animals tolerated the administered dose although immediate mild toxicity signs such as ruffled fur, loss of appetite and slight sleepiness, which disappeared few hours after administration were observed. Also, there was no mortality within 14 days of observation which entails that the LD
 <sub>50</sub>s of the extract, knipholone and dianellin are above 2000 mg/kg.
