<p id="Par26">Blood smear was prepared on microscope slides from blood films taken from the donor (infected) mouse tail. The smear was fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa to count the parasitaemia of the donor under a microscope (Primo Star, Carl Zeiss, Germany). The mice were then inoculated on day 0 with parasitized erythrocytes obtained from the donor by cardiac puncture using a sterile syringe when the parasitaemia level was 30–40%. Blood from the donor was collected on a Petri dish containing 2% trisodium citrate and was immediately diluted with uninfected mouse blood and normal saline in such a way that the final volume contains 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> infected erythrocytes/ml of blood. The diluted blood (0.2 ml) was injected into all the experimental mice intraperitoneally (i.p) [
