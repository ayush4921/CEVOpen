<p id="Par20">NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 125 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C on a Bruker Avance DMX400 FT-NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. All spectra were measured in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub>, except for compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, which was dissolved in CD
 <sub>3</sub>OD. HRMS were determined on a Shimadzu LC‐MS Advanced spectrometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) in the positive and negative modes.
