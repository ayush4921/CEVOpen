<p id="Par25">Acute oral toxicity study was conducted as per the internationally accepted protocol of OECD Guideline 425 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Fifteen healthy Swiss female albino mice weighing 20–25 g were randomly grouped into 3 each having 5 mice. Following 3–4 h of fasting (food only), one mouse from each group was orally administered 2000 mg/kg of the hydroalcoholic extract, KFP-1 and YKFM-2, consecutively. This was repeated on the remaining mice for the following four days. The mice were then observed individually for any physical or behavioural changes, such as loss of appetite, ruffled fur, lacrimation, mortality, and other signs of toxicity for 4 h. The same procedure was followed for the remaining mice for the next five consecutive days and the results recorded. The follow-up observations were continued for all mice for 14 days.
