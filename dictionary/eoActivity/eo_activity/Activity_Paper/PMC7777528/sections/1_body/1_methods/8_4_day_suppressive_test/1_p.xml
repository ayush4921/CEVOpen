<p id="Par27">The standard 4-day suppressive method was used for anti-malarial evaluation of the test substances [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The test was carried out in two phases. The extract and phenol fractions were evaluated in the first phase followed by KFP-1 and YKFM-2 in the second phase. Doses were selected based on the acute toxicity results whereby the middle dose was taken as one tenth of the limit dose which is 200 mg/kg. The higher dose was twice (400 mg/kg) the middle dose and the lower dose was one half (100 mg/kg) of the middle dose [

Groups 1 served as a negative control (distilled water, Vehicle1, 0.2 ml) for the extract and phenolic fraction 2 treated groups, while group 2 animals were used as a negative control (1% tween 80, Vehicle2, 0.2 ml) for phenolic fraction 1 treated group. The third group which served as a positive control was treated with standard pure chloroquine (25 mg/kg/day). The remaining nine groups were treatment groups and received 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/day of the hydroalcoholic extract and the two phenol fractions. The dosage regimen for the pure compounds was chosen from the preliminary test results obtained from experiments carried out on a few mice. Similarly, during evaluation of KPF-1 and YKFM-2, 45 inoculated mice were randomly grouped into 9 groups, each containing five mice. The first two groups were negative controls (distilled water, Vehicle3, 0.2 ml) and positive controls (standard pure chloroquine, 25 mg/kg/day). The rest of the groups were treatment groups and received KFP-1 (25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) and YKFM-2 (25, 50, 100 mg/kg/day). All the test substances were administered orally using oral gavage. Treatment was started 3 h post-infection (p.i) on day 0 and continued daily for the next 3 days (i.e. from day 0 to day 3). On the fifth day (or day 4), two Giemsa-stained blood smears were prepared from each mice to count the number of parasites under the microscope (Primo Star, Carl Zeiss, Germany) with an oil immersion objective of 100× magnification power [
