<p id="Par15">Malaria is one of the most serious life-threatening infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It occurs mostly in poor tropical and subtropical areas of the world, where the Africa region accounted for 93% of all malaria cases and 94% of malaria deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]
 <italic>.</italic> Most often, pregnant women and children under five years old are severely affected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For instance, from the total deaths due to malaria in 2018, 67% or 272,000 were children under 5Â years of age. That is nearly 745 children under age 5 daily or one child under five every two minutes dies of malaria in 2018 alone and most of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition to funding shortfalls and fragile health systems, the major contributor to malarial morbidity and mortality is almost certainly the increasing resistance of malaria parasites to available drugs [
