<p id="Par18">The genus 
 <italic>Kniphofia</italic> belongs to the family Asphodelaceae which comprises 70 species mainly confined to Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Fifteen of these species have been recorded in Eastern Africa, of which five including 
 <italic>Kniphofia foliosa</italic> are endemic to Ethiopia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The rhizomes of 
 <italic>K. foliosa</italic> are traditionally used for the treatment of abdominal cramps, malaria and wounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Previously, six in vitro active anti-malarial compounds were isolated from roots of 
 <italic>K. foliosa</italic> by Wube et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Abdissa et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In continuation of search for lead anti-malarial compounds from Ethiopian medicinal plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], the in vivo anti-malarial activity of the rhizomes of 
 <italic>K. foliosa</italic> and its constituents are investigated.
