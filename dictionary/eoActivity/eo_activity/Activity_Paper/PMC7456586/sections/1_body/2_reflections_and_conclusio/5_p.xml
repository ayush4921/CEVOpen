<p id="para0032">Finally, the authors believe it is important to contextualize the transplant coordination's action plan with regard to the characteristics of the organization. This context is important to keep in mind when assessing the possible applicability to other organizations. As mentioned previously, Andalusia is the largest region in Spain, with 8.5 million inhabitants. In addition, Spain is one of the most decentralized European countries, which means that the health competencies of public health and health care fall on its different regions. On another note, the Andalusian Transplant Coordination is a governmental entity within the regional health care system, which in turn is part of the national health system—a public health system with universal coverage. In the authors’ opinion, being part of a universal public health system, as well as having the support of the most senior health officials, is the main element facilitating the implementation of the plan. The authors hope that the possible extension of the plan to other regions of Spain will be facilitated by the coordination mechanisms of the national health system, which include technical commissions of experts, such as the national transplant commission, in which the regional transplant coordinators of the 17 regions of Spain participate.</p>
