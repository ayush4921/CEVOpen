<p id="para0027">In relation to the interventions carried out, supporting and advising hospitals and clinics regarding their authorization as cell and tissue donation centers, prior to carrying out audits to obtain the corresponding authorization, is an activity that falls under the responsibility of the Andalusian Transplant Coordination and forms part of its normal practice. In addition, collaboration with the health services inspectorate has been intensified, providing them with advice on the evaluation of regional incidents or complaints. One intervention envisaged in the plan is the promotion of the review of evidence of quality, safety and efficacy in each area of regenerative medicine by the corresponding regional scientific societies. Finally, the first steps have been taken to propose the extension of this initiative to other regions of Spain with the support of the Organizaci√≥n Nacional de Trasplantes through the transplant commission of the national health system.</p>
