 <p>With regard to regenerative medicine, the expectations generated over the last two decades and the time involved in developing this type of therapies, together with the availability of devices that allow point-of-care treatments through the rapid isolation of cellular or plasma products from patients in the operating theater, represent the perfect breeding ground for the offering of unproven or unregulated therapies on a global scale. A multidisciplinary approach—one based on the collaboration of institutions that, from the perspective of their area of competence, can contribute to reversing this worrying situation—to this problem is essential. It is a priority for local health authorities to take measures that are adapted to the particular situation and regulatory framework of their respective territory. In this article, the authors present the regenerative medicine action plan promoted by the Andalusian Transplant Coordination (i.e., the action plan for the largest region in Spain), highlighting the aspects the authors believe are fundamental to its success. The authors describe, in summary form, the methodology, phases of the plan, actions designed, key collaborators, important milestones achieved and main lessons they have drawn from their experience so that this can serve as an example for other institutions interested in promoting the ethical use of this type of therapy.</p>
