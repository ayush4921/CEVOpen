<p>Silica gel (100 g) of mesh size 60–120 were mixed with 250 mL of the eluent, toluene: ethyl acetate (80:20) and stirred for 15 min to achieve a uniform consistency. The column was subsequently packed with the silica gel using a funnel, after which SMP1 was introduced by pouring through the wall of the column. This was subsequently eluted at 5 mL volume interval. In all, 80 fractions of 5 mL each were collected. The fractions were spotted on TLC plate and their retention factor (R
 <sub>f</sub>) value calculated. The fractions with similar R
 <sub>f</sub> value were pooled together. Four sub fractions (SMF1, SMF2, SMF3 and SMF4) were obtained in all. These fractions were also subjected to PLA
 <sub>2</sub> activity at 0.4 mg/mL.
