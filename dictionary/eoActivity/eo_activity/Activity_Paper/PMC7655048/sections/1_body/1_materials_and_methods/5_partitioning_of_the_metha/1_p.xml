<p>MESM was partitioned using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and aqueous-methanol (90:10 v/v) according to their polarity as described by Rajbir et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). MESM (10 g) was dissolved in 250 mL of aqueous-methanol and poured into a separating funnel, after which 250 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane was added, shaken vigorously and allowed to stand. This led to the development of two layers; upper and lower layers. The upper layer was collected and designated the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane partition (SMP1). The lower layer was poured back to the funnel and re-washed with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. Dichloromethane was thereafter introduced into the aqueous portion, and was treated as 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. The lower layer represents the dichloromethane partition (SMP2). After re-washing with dichloromethane, ethyl acetate was introduced, treated likewise and the ethyl acetate partition (SMP3) was obtained. The last portion was the aqueous-methanol partition (SMP4). In all, 30 g of MESM was partitioned. The partitions were subsequently concentrated using a rotary evaporator.
