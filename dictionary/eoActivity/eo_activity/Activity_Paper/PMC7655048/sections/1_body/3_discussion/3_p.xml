<p>PLA
 <sub>2</sub> hydrolyses fatty acids at the 
 <italic>sn</italic>-2 position of membrane phospholipids releasing lysophospholipids and arachidonic acid (Cedro et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Arachidonic acid in turn leads to the production of eicosanoids such as prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes (Yui et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which are mediators of inflammatory effect. MESM significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) inhibited PLA
 <sub>2</sub> activity, provoking inhibition comparable to that of prednisolone. The action of PLA
 <sub>2</sub> on erythrocyte membrane creates leakage, causing haemoglobin to flow out into the medium (Oyekachukwu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Agatemor et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The enzyme activity is thus directly related to the amount of haemoglobin in the medium; this is represented by the absorbance values (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Increase in inhibition of PLA
 <sub>2</sub> reduces the amount of haemoglobin released. This suggests that the plant may suppress the synthesis of free fatty acids from membrane phospholipids and consequently deprive prostaglandin synthase of substrates for the production of prostaglandins. This inhibits the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandin E
 <sub>2</sub> (PGE
 <sub>2</sub>). The crude extract was purified to remove all undesirable and inert components so as to increase effectiveness and lessen any taste, odour and colour (Barbosa-Pereira et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The purification process enables a good level of PLA
 <sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity to be obtained from relatively small concentrations of the purified extract. This was responsible for the increase in percentage inhibition of PLA
 <sub>2</sub> activity at the lower concentrations of the partitions and fractions compared to the crude extract (
 <xref rid="t0002 t0003 t0004" ref-type="table">Tables 2–4</xref>). PLA
 <sub>2</sub>-inhibitory activity of this plant could be attributed to alkaloids as chromone alkaloids isolated from 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> possess anti-inflammatory activity against snake venom – which contains PLA
 <sub>2</sub> (Houghton and Woldemariam 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>).
