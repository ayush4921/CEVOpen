<p>The primary metabolites present in MESM shows the presence of alkaloids, terpenoids, phenols, saponins, flavonoids, tannins, carbohydrates and proteins. Alkaloids, phenols and flavonoids present in MESM and its partitions were also obtained from the stem bark extract of 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> as confirmed by Tchouya et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Reducing sugars were also absent in the stem bark extract of 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> (Tchouya et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) in line with this study. The presence of these diverse phytoconstituents in the leaves of 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> is indicative of its diverse biological activities. Alkaloids produce antimicrobial, analgesic, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrogenic and antispasmodic effects (Ibraheem and Maimako 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Renuga and Krishnakumari 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Different chromone alkaloids have been isolated from the stem bark (Akunyili and Akubue 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) and root bark of 
 <italic>S. magnificum</italic> (Houghton and Hairong 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). Terpenoids possess anti-inflammatory, antimalaria, anticancer, sedative, insecticidal or cytotoxic activity. Phenolic compounds possess anti-inflammatory properties (Zhu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>); flavonoids and tannins also have anti-inflammatory properties (Owolabi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The anti-inflammatory properties of flavonoids are due to their ability to inhibit enzymes involved in the production of chemical mediators of inflammation, such as PLA
 <sub>2</sub> (Iwuala et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Owolabi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). They also exert their effects as antioxidants, free radical scavengers, and chelators of divalent cation (Middleton et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Therapeutic properties of saponins include antimicrobial effect (Habu and Ibeh 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), antioxidant (Shirwaikar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), and anticancer activities, stimulation of antibody production and anti-inflammatory properties (Abubakar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Carbohydrates are useful as they supply energy to the cells, spare protein as a source of energy; contribute to fat metabolism and aid assimilation of minerals (Eze and Obinwa 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The presence of protein indicates that the leaves could serve as a vital tool for growth and development, serve as an enzymatic catalyst and cell response mediators (Ojo et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
