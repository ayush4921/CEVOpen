 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> bears slightly flattened, 3–7-fingered, palmately lobed, creamish-colored, tuberous roots measuring 5–12 ± 3.3 cm in length. The peduncle is generally 27–41 ± 6.7 cm tall. Leaves are acuminate or apex obtuse, linear-lanceolate to oblong clustered and sub-opposite towards base. Flowers grow in dense spike inflorescences and are zygomorphic, having fused male and female reproductive organs (a condition referred to as gynostemium, column, or gynostegium) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01644-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Flowers are pink, bearing purple-colored notches with six free perianth segments. The innermost segment forms an enlarged, pink-colored and sculptured labellum, which acts a resting pad for the pollinators, while the rest of the segments are similar in shape and form. Flowers show resupination at 180°, which brings the labellum perpendicular to the ovary. Flowers bear two dark green-colored pollinaria covered inside the anther cap. Each pollinarium bears a central sterile axis which combines with the pale yellow-colored caudicle (stalk). Caudicles at the upper side are separated by rostellum; however, at their base, they are joined by a sticky structure known as retinacula or viscidia. The ovary is tricarpellate, inferior, twisted and consists of one chamber with parietal placentation, having a large mass of ovules. Fruits are loculicidal capsules and minute seeds are generally liberated as immature embryos at the globular stage.
