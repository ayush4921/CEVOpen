<p>Bacterial drug resistance could be overshadowed by resistance provided by efflux pump inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B85-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The efflux pumps are specific and possibly remove either a single class or several classes of antimicrobial compounds [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Pumps from the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of Gram-positive bacteria play a key role in the efflux [

 <xref rid="B97-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] has been studied extensively. The results clearly show the applications of plant-based products as a substitute for antibiotics in overcoming various bacteria-related complications. The capability of a plant to exert a significant effect on efflux pumps expands the potential for its use as a potent efflux pump inhibitor. Besides this, its effectiveness against MDR bacterial isolates open avenues for its use in the design of drugs that can be employed to overcome the problem of drug resistance.
