<p>Antihyperglycemic agents extracted from the leaves and tubers of orchids make the plant ideal for compounds with anti-diabetic properties [
 <xref rid="B99-plants-09-01644" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Anti-diabetic properties of 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> methanolic leaf extract using 3T3-L1 cell line showed no cytotoxic effect. The extract exhibited anti-diabetic properties, manifested by the inhibitory effect on α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes, enhancing the cellular uptake of glucose by inducing the expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) on the cell surface. Inhibition of α-amylase activity occurs at 31.25 µg/mL and 74.53 ± 0.5% inhibition at 500 µg/mL concentration with respect to the standard drug acarbose, which shows inhibition between 31.25 µg/mL and 85.27 ± 1.2%. Inhibition of α-glucosidase activity occurs between 30.16 ± 0.16% and 72.13 ± 0.78% with respect to standard drug acarbose, the positive control drug, which showed inhibition of 43.20 ± 0.09% and 94.41 ± 0.49% at 500 µg/mL. An analysis of the expression of GLUT4 using anti-mouse Glut4-FITC antibody (#NBPI-49533F, Novus Biologicals) with metformin (control) revealed that 
 <italic>D. hatagirea</italic> extract-treated cells showed elevated levels of GLUT4 as compared to untreated cells [
