To understand which secondary compounds determine these pharmacological activities, different metabolites or fractions of the Eucalyptus plants have been isolated and purified, and their properties have been studied. At the same time, lipophilic compounds, such as triterpenoids and phloroglucinol derivatives, attracted particular attention of researchers, since they had the most pronounced and diverse pharmacological activities.
