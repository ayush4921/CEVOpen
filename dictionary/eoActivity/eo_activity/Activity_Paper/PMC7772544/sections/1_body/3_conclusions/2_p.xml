<p id="p0220">An application of UPLC-PDA-HRMS/MS allowed to detect in the LCP isolated from 
 <italic>E. viminalis</italic> plants thirty two secondary compounds: twenty phloroglucinol derivatives (isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol, macrocarpals and sideroxylonals), three other phenolics and nine terpenoids (dehydroursolic acid lactone and its acetyl-, 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl- and feruloyl-esters, loxanic acid, 3β,12α-dihydroxyurs-12-en-28-oic acid and (S)-β-macrocarpene). The major compounds of the LCP were pharmacologically active macrocarpals A and B, dehydroursolic acid lactone and its derivatives. It was supposed that previously discovered antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of the LCP could be due to the presence of these secondary compounds. However, chemical composition of the LCP allow suggesting that its pharmacological activities could be significantly wider than it was shown before. Therefore, further the major macrocarpals and triterpenoids will be isolated and purified in preparative amounts and used as standards for the quantitative analysis of the LCP metabolites, and for determination of their more fine structure and individual pharmacological activities. In addition, the applied technology to obtain the LCP will be optimized taking into account the requirements of green chemistry and to the increasing efficiency and rationality the using of Eucalyptus raw material.
