<p id="p0140">In the LCP were found also five phenolic compounds (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6), which had UV spectra different from those of phloroglucinol derivatives (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The molecular formula of compound (5) and (6) was established to be C14H20O4 in according to the monoisotopic masses 252.1363 (calculated mass 252.1362). Earlier, compound with the same mass and formula was isolated from
