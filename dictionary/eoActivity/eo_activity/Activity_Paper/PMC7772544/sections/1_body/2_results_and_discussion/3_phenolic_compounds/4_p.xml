 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Bharate, 2006</xref>). These macrocarpals are major phloroglucinol derivatives in many Eucalyptus species. They are stereoisomers, which structures have a isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol moiety joined to the sesquiterpene globulol that contained one oxygen in the molecule (monoisotopic mass 222.1984 Da; molecular formula C15H26O) (
