<p id="p0175">Along with dehydroursolic acid lactone, five triterpenoids more (19, 21–24) also contained in the MS/MS spectrum the diagnostic ion 437.34 as a main m/z fragment (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). It suggests, that these triterpenoids are derivatives of dehydroursolic acid lactone. Triterpenoid (19) had monoisotopic mass 495.3391 Da and molecular formula C30H46O. Analysis of MS/MS fragmentation showed that ion 437.34 is belong to fragment [M-Acetyl+H]
 <sup>+</sup> (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, triterpenoids (19) was identified as acetyl-dehydroursolic acid lactone. Earlier, this triterpenoid was isolated and identified in the bark of
