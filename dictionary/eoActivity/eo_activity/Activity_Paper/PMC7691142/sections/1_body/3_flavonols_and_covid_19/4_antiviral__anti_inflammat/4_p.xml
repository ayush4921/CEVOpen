<p id="p0075">The intense and the rapid stimulation of the innate immune response after the infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus triggers the activation of the Nod-like receptor family and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway inducing the release of many proinflammatory cytokines mainly IL-6 and IL-1β. This dysregulated hyper-inflammation is responsible of the complications associated to this infection including the severe lungs tissues injury (
