<p id="par0080">The methanol extract of 
 <italic>D. longicornu</italic> protocorms was evaluated for its antioxidant effect by scavenging the DPPH free radicals. Extract has shown a capacity of scavenge 94.31 % of DPPH free radicals at 1000 μg/mL concentration. The scavenging capacity of extract was found statistically significantly similar to that of same concentration of ascorbic acid (96.19 %), a positive control. The concentration of extract required to scavenge 50 % DPPH free radicals (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was found as 117.56 μg/mL, however, IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of ascorbic acid was 84.47 μg/mL. Statistically, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of extract and control were significantly different (
