<p id="par0110">In conclusion, this study is the first to report seed-derived protocorms of 
 <italic>D. longicornu</italic> are the potential sources of successful plant regeneration and biological activities. The protocol described here could be applied in a propagation program for genetic resource conservation and commercial purposes. Protocorms synthesized the bioactive potential compounds which are rich in antioxidant, anticancer and antimicrobial activities. Due to the presence of bioactive compounds, protocorms extract scavenge the DPPH free radicals which have a potential antioxidant effect. The extract also inhibits the growth of HeLa and U251 cell lines and has moderate anticancer effect toward these cell lines. Further, the extract has a moderate antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic>. Further works on isolation and purification of bioactive compounds from protocorms can reveal the exact potential leads to the discovery of drugs in future.
