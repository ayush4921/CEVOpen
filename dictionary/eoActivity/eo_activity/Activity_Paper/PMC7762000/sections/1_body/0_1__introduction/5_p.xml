<p>The anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> extracts has been determined by different methods using both in vivo and in vitro models. For instance, aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>B. pinnatum</italic> were shown to exert a relevant effect against croton oil-induced ear edema and carrageenan-induced paw edema in murine models, driven by a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines [

 <italic>B. tubiflorum</italic> showed an inhibitory effect on nitric oxide production by lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage in vitro RAW264.7 cell line [
