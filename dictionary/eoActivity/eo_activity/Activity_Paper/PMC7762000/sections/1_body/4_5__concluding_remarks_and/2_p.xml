<p>It has also been described how the development of optimal methods of plant tissue culture for 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. can lead to the valorization of the bioactive compounds of these species, which are highly promising in therapeutics as antioxidant and anti-tumor agents. In this sense, the application of machine learning technology to model and optimize the production of phytochemicals is of extraordinary interest as it could favor their large-scale biotechnological exploitation in the cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical industries.
