<p>After the establishment of axenic cultures, PTC protocols normally are followed by multiplication, rooting and acclimatization stages, throughout the procedure called micropropagation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00444-f003">Figure 3</xref>), with the objective of achieving a large number of fully-developed true-to-type individuals [
 <xref rid="B135-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. The singular asexual reproduction that takes place at leaf margins of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic>, results in the clonal propagation of fully-developed epiphyllous buds, presenting individual aerial and root systems [

 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For this reason, 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> constitutes an outstanding subgenus for the micropropagation of different species. Nevertheless, the micropropagation of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> is not exempt from difficulties due to its particular metabolism and poor nutritional requirements [
 <xref rid="B151-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. In this sense, it was recently reported that ammonium, sulfur, molybdenum, copper, and sodium play a crucial role on growth and plantlet formation on in vitro-cultured 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> in a species-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B153-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Therefore, multiple nutritional modifications may be required to achieve genotype-specific optimization, since mineral imbalances and interactions could directly influence the success of PTC protocols, by affecting micropropagation performance [
 <xref rid="B154-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>], and causing undesirable physiological disorders [
