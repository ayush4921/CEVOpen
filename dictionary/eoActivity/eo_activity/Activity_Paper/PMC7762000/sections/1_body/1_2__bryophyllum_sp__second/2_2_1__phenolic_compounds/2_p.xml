<p>The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> phenolic compounds, focused on the free-radical scavenging activity, has been largely determined [

 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> extracts for preventing the lipid oxidation of omega-3 enriched fish oil emulsions was reported, thus conferring a valuable approach for the application of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic>-derived by-products in the food and pharmacological industries [
 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In the same way, the polyphenols from 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic>-derived extracts may be efficiently purified using environmental-friendly procedures, like the use of activated carbon [
 <xref rid="B80-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. These approaches have been developed in order to allow the industrial exploitation of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> polyphenols, due to the increasing interest in the research of these medicinal plants.
