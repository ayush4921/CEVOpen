<p>It is now well-known that the full set of bioactivities attributed to 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. is developed by a plethora of phytoconstituents, including phenolic compounds, bufadienolides, organic salts, terpenoids and fatty acids [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Phytoconstituents are considered secondary metabolites, since they are biosynthesized by induction of secondary metabolism, which is responsible for the defensive and adaptative plant response against environmental threads and biotic stress [
 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Phenolic compounds and bufadienolides are considered the two main families of secondary metabolites of 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp., widely distributed throughout the subgenus [
 <xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00444" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, they are responsible for the bioactivity associated with 
 <italic>Bryophyllum</italic> sp. and, consequently, a deeper insight into these compounds will be provided.
