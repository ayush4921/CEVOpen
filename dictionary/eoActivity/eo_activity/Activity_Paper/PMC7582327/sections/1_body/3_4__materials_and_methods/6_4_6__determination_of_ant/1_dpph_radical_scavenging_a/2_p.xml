<p>The ability of a methanol extract of DBT34 to scavenge the DPPH free radical was determined by using the stable 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH). Briefly, for the DPPH scavenging assay, 100 µL of different concentrations (10–100 µg/mL) of the methanolic extract was placed in 96-well plate and mixed with 200 µL of DPPH solution (0.1 mM). The samples were kept in the dark for 39 min after which absorbance was recorded at 517 nm using a multi-scan UV/Vis spectrophotometer ((Multiscan
 <sup>TM</sup> GO, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). [

Results were expressed as a percentage reduction of DPPH absorption compared to control. In addition, the antioxidant potential of a methanolic extract of strain DBT34 was also determined with a 96-well plate method using an ABTS radical cation scavenging assay. Ascorbic acid, methanol, and extract without ABTS were used as positive, negative, and blank controls, respectively. The ABTS radical cation decolorization activity was calculated according to the method described by Re et al. [
