<p>All six isolates were identified using the amplification of 16S rRNA as previously described [
 <xref rid="B6-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The best isolate, DBT34, based on the level of catalase and SOD activity, was taxonomically identified through phylogenetic analysis of the 16S sequence of DBT34 with type strains of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> present in the GenBank database using CLUSTAL-X software [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The sequences of the six isolates were also compared with the EzTaxon database [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and a similarity percentage of 96.5â€“99.5% was revealed. A phylogenetic tree was built using the neighbor-joining method [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] with MEGA version 6.0 [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Tamura-3 parameter model (T92 + G + I) was selected based on BIC (2536.234) and AIC (2318.118) values with 1000 bootstrap replicates [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].
