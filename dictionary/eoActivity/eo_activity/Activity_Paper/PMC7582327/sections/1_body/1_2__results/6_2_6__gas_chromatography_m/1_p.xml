<p>Volatile compounds (VOCs) present in the methanolic extract of DBT34 were identified by GC-MS. A total of 11 VOCs was predicted using the NIST library based on the peak area, molecular weight, and formula, the percentage of area and retention time (
 <xref rid="ijms-21-07364-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The maximum percentage of peak area (17.427) was obtained for 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid, 4-Hexadecyl Ester, which exhibited a retention-time of 22.295. The minimum percentage peak area (5.629) was obtained for Benzeneacetic Acid, Alpha-Oxo, Trimethylsilyl Ester, which had a retention-time of 28.488. Among the 11 identified VOCs, two of the compounds, Cathinone (RT: 21.635) and Acetamide, 2-Amino (RT: 22.530) have been reported to possess antioxidant activity [
