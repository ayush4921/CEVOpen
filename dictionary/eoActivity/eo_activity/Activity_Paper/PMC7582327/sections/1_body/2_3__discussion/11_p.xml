<p>Treatment of diabetic rats with the DBT34 microbial extract or sitagliptin mitigated the alterations in insulin resistance, Î²-cell function, and insulin sensitivity by reducing glucose and insulin levels. As reported in previous studies [

 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-07364" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], the mitigation of altered metabolism in diabetic rats may have resulted from the effect of secondary metabolites present in the microbial extract on DPP-4 and other free radical scavenging activities. The decrease in DPP-4 accumulation may be due to the interaction between secondary metabolites in the microbial extract and DPP-4 at active sites [
