<p>The N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin GFL isolated from the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting body exhibited cytotoxicity against HeLa cells [
 <xref rid="B71-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The protein designated GFAHP showed a significant anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV) effect, as reported by Gu and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Glycoprotein is another type of bioactive protein in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. Cui and coworkers isolated the glycoprotein (containing 6.2% carbohydrates) from cultured mycelia of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> and demonstrated its anti-tumor activity [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Zhuang and coworkers patented a bioactive glycoprotein from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, which showed obvious anti-hypertensive, anti-obesity, anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-diabetic effects [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition to the glycoprotein, Chan et al. found that chemical phosphorylation of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> polysaccharide-peptides could remarkably enhance both tumor inhibition in vitro and adjuvant effects in vivo. Meanwhile, modified and unmodified MPSP both showed an insignificant effect on normal cells, indicating their potential application for anticancer therapy without significant side effects [
