<p>As reported by Zhang and coworkers, fatty acids and three compounds, namely ergosterol (1), ergostra-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (2) and 1-oleoyl-2-linoleoyl-3-palmitoylglycerol (3), were extracted from the cultured mycelia of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> by hexane. The fatty acid fraction, together with all three compounds, exhibited cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme inhibitory and anti-oxidant activities [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, which showed specific antifungal activity against the opportunistic human pathogen of 
 <italic>Pseudallescheria boydii</italic> and some plant pathogens [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. Their study suggested a promising possibility of using AGF as medicine for inflammatory pain with 500 mg/kg as the optimal dosage [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> and discovered the inhibitory effect of GF-3 against the proliferation of human tumor cells and α-glucosidase. The major bioactive compounds in GF-3 were detected to be alkaloids (first found in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>), ergosterols and a new compound named pyrrolefronine. Since α-glucosidase was involved in the hydrolysis of starch into disaccharide sugars, inhibition of its activity indicated possible reduction of blood glucose level [

 <italic>o</italic>-orsellinaldehyde, which showed obvious tumoricidal activity, especially selective cytotoxic effect against Hep 3B cells through apoptosis, was also extracted from a submerged culture of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> by Lin and Liu [
 <xref rid="B38-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, other bioactive molecules in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, such as polyphenolics, α-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and flavonoids, were reported to have anti-oxidant properties [
