<p>Apart from the D-fraction and the MD-fraction, other polysaccharide fractions have also been derived from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, with hot water being the most commonly used extraction solvent. Ultrasound [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and other solvents such as hot sodium hydroxide [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and citrate buffer [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have also been utilized. 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> summarizes the chemical properties, sources and extraction solvents of representative bioactive polysaccharide fractions isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. The chemical properties listed include molecular weight, structure information, as well as monosaccharide compositions. For instance, Kubo et al. extracted the X-fraction from the fruiting body of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, which was a (1→6)-β-glucan with (1→4)-α branches. The X-fraction showed anti-diabetic activity, which was found to be directly associated with insulin receptors [
 <xref rid="B23-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Masuda et al. separated the MZ-fraction from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, which had similar structure to the MD-fraction but with a much smaller molecular weight, of around 20,000 Da (the molecular weight of MD-fraction was around 1–2 million Da). The MZ-fraction showed immunomodulatory effects in vitro and antitumor activity in vivo [
 <xref rid="B25-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Moreover, Grifolan (GRN), a gel-forming (1→6)-branched (1→3)-β-D-glucan, was found in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> with immunomodulatory effects [
 <xref rid="B24-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. α-D-glucan could also be extracted by hot water from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. Instead of antitumor activity, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, antioxidative and immunomodulatory effects were discovered [
 <xref rid="B26-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In recent years, Liu’s group from China has isolated various polysaccharides from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> with the names of GFP-A [
 <xref rid="B55-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], LMw-GFP [
 <xref rid="B51-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and GFAP [
 <xref rid="B56-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], all of which exhibited promising anti-tumor activities. Due to variations in external factors such as the fungal source and extraction temperature, the properties of polysaccharide fractions from different sources may vary significantly.
