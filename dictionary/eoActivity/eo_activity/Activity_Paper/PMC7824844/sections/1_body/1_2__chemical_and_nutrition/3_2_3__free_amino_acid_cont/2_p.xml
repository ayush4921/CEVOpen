<p>However, large variations exist in the amount of each amino acid in 
 <italic>G. frondosa.</italic> For instance, Mau et al. (2001) and Tsai et al. (2006) found that threonine was the major free amino acid in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> [

 <xref rid="B44-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], whereas Huang and coworkers found that histidine and glutamic acid were the major free amino acids in the fruiting body (&gt;12 mg/g) and lysine, aspartic acid and tyrosine were the major free amino acids in the mycelium (&gt;17 mg/g) [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Huang and coworkers also obtained a larger amount of free amino acid from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> than other groups in both the fruiting body and the mycelium, a result that might be due to the different sources of the fruiting body and the preparation methods of the mycelium by the different research groups. The choice in cultivation substrate was also found to affect the variety and amount of amino acids in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. As shown in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting bodies cultivated in sawdust and log substrates have different amounts of each amino acid [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], although the total amino acid content was similar. Moreover, GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid), a biologically active compound which is related to the therapeutic effect of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, is mainly detected in the mycelium but not in the fruiting body [
