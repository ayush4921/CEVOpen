<p>In addition to the enhancement of insulin activity, the hypoglycemic effects of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> may be generated through the inhibition of α-glucosidase activity, because an anti-α-glucosidase effect could prevent starch hydrolysis into disaccharides and decrease the blood glucose level. Shen and coworkers examined the hyperglycemic effects of non-polar fractions in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> both in vivo and in vitro. Research findings showed that 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> exhibited strong anti-α-glucosidase activity in vitro, and could significantly lower the blood glucose level in high-fat-diet-fed and streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic animals [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], whereas Wu et al. suggested that the ergosterol peroxide isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> contributed to its anti-diabetic effect [
 <xref rid="B75-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, Su and coworkers concluded that the strong anti-α-glucosidase activity was mainly attributed to the oleic acid and linoleic acid, rather than ergosterol and ergosterol peroxide in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B101-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Some previous studies suggested that the anti-diabetic activity of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> originated from its regulatory effect on gut microbiota, which shall be discussed later in this paper.
