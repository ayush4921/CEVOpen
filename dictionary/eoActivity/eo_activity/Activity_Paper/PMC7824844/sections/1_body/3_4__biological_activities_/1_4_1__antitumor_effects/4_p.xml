<p>In addition to polysaccharide fractions, the ergosterol derivatives from non-polar extracts of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> were also found to have anti-proliferative effects on human tumor cells [

 <italic>ο</italic>-orsellinaldehyde component of submerged cultures of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> exhibited tumoricidal activity against Hep 3B cells via apoptosis [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, such as GFL and GFG-3a, exhibited antitumor effects as well due to their anti-proliferative activity against cancer cells [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> summarizes the testing methods and potency of antitumor activity based on reported studies on 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. The testing methods for in vivo studies mainly include microscopy observation and assessment of the inhibition rate by measuring tumor weight, whereas for in vitro studies, the MTT assay is commonly used to determine cells’ viability. It is worth mentioning that 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> was able to achieve an inhibition ratio of over 90% for the treatment of MM46 liver carcinoma, BEL 7402 cells and TMK-1 gastric cancer cells.
