<p>Several components in 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, including polysaccharides, proteins, fatty acids and some other constituents, have shown notable antioxidant activities. The common activity assay methods and anti-oxidant potencies are summarized in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. As shown in this table, the common antioxidant activity assays include the scavenging abilities of hydroxyl radicals, DPPH radicals, superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide; as well as the reducing power and Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> chelating activity. Lee and coworkers suggested that polysaccharides from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> could be potential ingredients for cosmetic applications due to their antioxidant activity, radical scavenging activity after UV irradiation, proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen biosynthesis [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting bodies, possessed significant inhibitory effects on hydroxyl, superoxide and DPPH radicals [
