<p>Previous studies over the past 30 years have strongly suggested that there are three possible ways by which 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> exerts its anticancer effectâ€”they are protection of healthy cells, prevention of tumor metastasis and inhibition of tumor growth. In other words, 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> can fight against tumors both directly and indirectly via enhancement of the immune system. This section will mainly focus on the direct antitumor function of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, whereas the immunomodulatory effect will be discussed in the next section.
