 <p>Since benzo [ 
  <italic>b</italic> ] thiophene scaffold is one of the privileged structures in drug discovery as this core exhibitsactivities for different biological problems, in this study bis (benzo[ 
  <italic>b</italic> ]thiophene-2-yl) alkyl methanimine derivatives (1-9) were synthesized by reacting benzo[ 
  <italic>b</italic> ]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde with diamines. All newly compounds were characterized by IR, 
  <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
  <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopic methods. Synthesized compounds were investigated using binary QSARbased models on therapeutic activity prediction of synthesized compounds and they showed high predicted activities in following diseases: bacterial, angina, allergy, depression and obesity. Thus, they were then tested for their antimicrobial and antileishmanial activities as a result of this theoretical study. Compound 1(N, Nâ€™- (propane-1,3-diyl) bis (1-(benzo [ 
  <italic>b</italic> ] thiophene-2-yl)) methanimine) was found the most active compound in both diseases. Thus, its molecular docking studies were also carried out.
