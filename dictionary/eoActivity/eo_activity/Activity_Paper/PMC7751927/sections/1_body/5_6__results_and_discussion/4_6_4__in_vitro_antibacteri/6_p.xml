<p>Since the most active compound was found as compound 1 as antibacterial agent, we used crystal structure of wild-type 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> penicillin binding protein 4 (PBP4), PDB ID: 5TW8, and performed dockin simulations. Figure 4 shows 2D and 3D ligand interactions diagram of compound 1 at the binding pocket of the target structure. It can be seen that main nonbonded interactions are constructed with Tyr291 and Tyr268 (π-π stacking interactions) and with Glu297 (ionic interactions). These strong interactions (docking score, -8.33 kcal/mol) show that compound 1 can be considered as promising anti-bacterial agent. Both in silico predictions (ligand-based and target-driven based) as well as performed in vitro assays validate each other for the antibacterial effect of the novel compound (compound 1). Our hybrid molecular modeling approache (combined ligand-based and structure-based) predicted the biological activity of a set of new compounds and these predictions were investigated by in vitro studies.
