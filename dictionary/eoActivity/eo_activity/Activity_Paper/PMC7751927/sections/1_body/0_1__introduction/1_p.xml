<p>Benzo [b] thiophene derivatives display remarkable biological activities such as antiinflammatory, analgesic, antifungal, antidepressant, antiangiogenic, estrogen receptor modulating, antimitotic, anticancer, kinase inhibitors, antituberculosis, anticonvulsant, antimalarial, anthelmintic, antihyperglycemic and pesticide. Benzothiophene derivatives have been used as potential diagnostic agents and amyloid binding in neurodegenerative diseases, treatment of fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors (FAAH), BMP-2 upregulators, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), human nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase inhibitors, BRAF kinase inhibitors, Rho kinase inhibitors, selective linear tachykinin NK2 receptor antagonists, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B inhibitors, histamine H3 antagonists, antiallergic agents and many other activities [1–7]. By replacing the substituents attached to the benzothiophene ring, some of the FDA-approved anticancer drugs such as arzoxifene and raloxifene were also developed [8,9]. Schiff bases, including azomethine functional group (N=CH), possess biological properties such as analgesic, antifungal, antibacterial, antidepressant, anticancer, anticonvulsant and antiinflammatory [10–15]. Schiff bases are also known to be highly effective in synergistic effects on insecticides and plant growth regulators [16–18].</p>
