<p>Nine bis (benzo[b]thiophen-2-yl) alkyl methanimine derivatives were synthesized. All newly compounds were characterized by IR, 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopic methods.Synthesized compounds were investigated using 25 different binary QSAR disease models. Results showed that synthesized compounds may be considered mainly for bacterial, angina, allergy, depression and obesity models. Our in silico-guided design study lead to a hit compound (Compound 1) for its antibacterial effects. In vitro antileishmanial, antifungal and antibacterial activity studies were performed on all synthesized compounds. According to the test results; Compound 1 showed antileishmanial activity (MIC = 1250 Î¼g/mL) and it was concluded that further studies could be continued for this compound 1. The purpose of the control drug study was made to test whether the experimental study was working properly. The substances studied showed antileishmanial activity even if they had a higher value than the MIC of the standard drug Amphotericin B. In this antileishmanial activity study, while aiming to determine the concentration of the compound that is effective against leishmania, the reliability, toxic effect and side effects of the substances should also be evaluated for new drug candidates. Due to the toxic effects of currently used drugs and the increasing resistance to these drugs, the discovery and development of new therapeutic agents is important.Compound 1 also showed better antibacterial and antifungal activity.
