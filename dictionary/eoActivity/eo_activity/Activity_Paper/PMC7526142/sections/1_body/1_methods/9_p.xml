 <italic>Echium amoenum</italic>) were purchased from Tehran drug/medicinal herbal market. They were then approved by Professor Gholamreza Amin at the Herbarium, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences and kept under voucher number PMP-559. EA was crushed and extracted through the decoction method and was then freeze-dried; 150 mg of EA extract was granulated with Maize starch and were filled in 250 mg capsules. The capsules should be consumed three times a day, from the 21st day of one cycle to the 3rd day of the next cycle (10 days on aggregate) for two consecutive cycles. Placebo was prepared by filling only Maize starch in 250 mg capsules with the same shape as the EA capsules.
