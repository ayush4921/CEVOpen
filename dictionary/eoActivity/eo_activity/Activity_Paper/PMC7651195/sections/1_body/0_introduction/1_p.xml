<p>The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to an unprecedented rate of mortality, with Italy, China, Spain and USA being the most hit (WHO., 
 <xref rid="CIT0070" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It is caused by the novel β-coronavirus (enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA virus), SARS-CoV-2 which has a similar sequence identity to that of bat/human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SLCoV) (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Schoeman &amp; Fielding, 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Tian et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Since its origin in Wuhan, China as a cluster of pneumonia cases in December 2019 which has spread globally (da Silva et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), there have been search for effective antiviral remedies against the diseases. Lack of effective treatment coupled with no valid vaccines increases the number of infections and mortalities on a daily basis (Mehta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Onder et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The common symptoms of COVID-19 include sore throat, cough, fatigue, slight dyspnoea, headache, conjunctivitis, diarrhea and fever (Pascarella et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The major cause of COVID-19 mortality is respiratory failure as present treatments are based on symptomatic management and respiratory sustenance (Pascarella et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Underlying ailments particularly diabetes mellitus and obesity have been implicated as high-risk factors of COVID-19 mortalities (Holman et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Boosting the immune system has also been reported as a preventive strategy against COVID-19, as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) characterized by exacerbated levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL)-2 and −7, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and granulocytecolony stimulating factor have been implicated in patients with severe conditions (Mehta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have reported the inhibitory effect of remdesivir and chloroquine on SARS-CoV-2 activity (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), and have shown some therapeutic effects in clinical trials (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). However, studies have reported deaths in COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine and its derivatives owing to severe arrhythmias (Tang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). It has also been shown to suppress the immune system as well as inhibit autophagy and xenophagy (Tang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Interestingly, the dynamics of the said virus largely depends on the molecular interactions between spike protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2). Thus by implication, targeting these biomarkers have been reported as viable strategies for treating the disease (Gurwitz, 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Jiang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).
