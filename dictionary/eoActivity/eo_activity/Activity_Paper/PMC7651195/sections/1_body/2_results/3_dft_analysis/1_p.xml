<p>The optimized geometry of harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside with the key interatomic distances in Angstrom are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>. The calculated broad peak at 3401 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> is assigned to the O—H of the cyclopentane ring. The aromatic ring C = C and C—H stretching vibrations are assigned 1471 and 2851 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> respectively. The C—O—C stretching vibrations are assigned the strong peaks at 1090. The calculated 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum for harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside is presented in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Major hydrogen atoms are designated in the calculated 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum.
