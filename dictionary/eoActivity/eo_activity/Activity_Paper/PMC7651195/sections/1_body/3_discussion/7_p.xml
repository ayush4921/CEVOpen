<p>Phagocytic respiratory oxidative burst has been implicated in innate immunity and inflammatory processes which are the major pathogenesis of COVID-19. Boosting the immune system particularly during the incubation and non-severe stages of the disease, has been recognized as a strategy to eliminate the virus and to suppress the progression to severe stages (Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Phagocytic respiratory oxidative burst involves the generation of ROS from increased non – mitochondrial oxygen consumption arising from dehydrogenation of glucose via the hexose monophosphate shunt (Allen, 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Continuous phagocytic-induced ROS production will lead to an imbalance in the innate antioxidant system, thereby resulting in oxidative stress and provocation of inflammatory cytokines (Ciz et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Exacerbated inflammatory cytokine production often regarded as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has been implicated in the onset and progression of COVID-19 stages (Mehta et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Shi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Thus, arresting phagocytic respiratory oxidative bursts may be a therapeutic strategy in treating and managing the disease and its progression. In the present study, harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside suppressed the production of ROS in PMNs as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4A</xref>. Thus, indicating a suppressive activity on phagocytic respiratory oxidative burst and may be a good drug candidate in the treatment and management of COVID-19 and its complications. This activity correlates with our previous reports on the ability of extracts and isolated compounds from 
 <italic>C. voluble</italic> leaves and flower to modulate phagocytic oxidative burst in whole blood, PMNs and macrophages (Erukainure, Hafizur, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Erukainure, Mesaik, et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Erukainure et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
