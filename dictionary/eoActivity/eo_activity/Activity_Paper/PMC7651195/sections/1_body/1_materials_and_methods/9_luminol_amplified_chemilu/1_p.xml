<p>Blood sample was collected from a consented apparently healthy volunteer, from which neutrophils were immediately isolated as previously described (Alyiu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The isolated neutrophils were subjected to luminol-amplified chemiluminescence assay (Helfand et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). Briefly, the isolated neutrophils (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>/mL) were suspended in modified Hank’s solution (MHS) and incubated with different concentrations (0.5, 5.00 and 50.00 µg/mL) of the isolated compound (harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) for 30 min. Zymosan (1 mg/mL) was thereafter added, followed by 25 µL of luminol (10
 <sup>−5</sup> M). A luminometer (Lab system Luminoskan RS, Helsinki, Finland) was used in recording the total chemiluminescence (CL). Control (+C) consisted of MHS containing cells only.
