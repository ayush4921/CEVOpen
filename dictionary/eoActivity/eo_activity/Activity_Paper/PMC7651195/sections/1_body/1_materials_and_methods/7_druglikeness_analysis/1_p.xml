<p>To determine the druglikeness properties of the selected compounds, a supercomputing facility for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (SCFBio platform; scfbio-iitd.res.in) was used. 3 D structures of the compounds were submitted through the platform and the prediction carried out based on Lipinski’s rule. Lipinski’s rule considered five basic properties including molecular weight, hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, lipophilicity index (LogP) and molar refractivity of a compound (Jayaram et al.,
