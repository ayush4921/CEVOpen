<p>The binding potentials of Harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, Azithromycin, Chloroquine, and Remdesivir was studied by means of molecular docking. The 3 D crystal structures of 2019-nCoV spike protein receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) were downloaded from the protein data bank (PDB) with PDB ID; 6M0J (Lan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) with resolution 2.45 Å. The suitable grid box was determined using AutoDock tools 1.5.4 (Sanner, 
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The ligands (CID_2719, 121304016 and DB00207) were obtained from PUBMED, while the isolated compound (harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) was drawn using ChemDraw Ultra v12.0.2 and the file converted to pdb format. Initial optimization was done using Gaussian 09 (Frisch et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), to obtain minimized conformations. The determined dimension was 
 <italic>X</italic> = 26 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 26 
 <italic>Z</italic> = 26 with 1.00 Å as the grid spacing. The optimum binding site for the ligand (Erukainure et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0073" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) was determined using Lamarckian genetic algorithm method. Gasteiger charges were computed using the AutoDock Tools graphical user interface supplied by MGL Tools (Morris et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).
