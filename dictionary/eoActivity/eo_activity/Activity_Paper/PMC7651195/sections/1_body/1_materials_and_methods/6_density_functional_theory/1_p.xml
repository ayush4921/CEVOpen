<p>The isolated compound (harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside) was fully optimized using density functional theory (DFT) with M06-2X functional with 6-31 + G(d,p) basis. The frequency calculation was computed confirming no negative frequencies. The scaling factor of 0.964 was applied to evaluate vibrational frequencies (Johnson III,

 <sup>1</sup>H magnetic shielding constants, by chemical shifts, obtained on a δ-scale relative to the TMS, used as reference was calculated on complex 1 and 2 using the Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) method developed by Wolinski et al. (
