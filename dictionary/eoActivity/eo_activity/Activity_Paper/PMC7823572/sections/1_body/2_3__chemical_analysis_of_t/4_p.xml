<p>The sesquiterpenoids are generally followed by smaller quantities of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons in 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizome oil (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00044-f001">Figure 1</xref>). This group is characterised by great structural diversity, providing a variety of fragrances and characteristic aromas to the essential oil [
 <xref rid="B131-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Specifically, monocyclic bisabolane derivatives with a C

 <italic>Curcuma</italic> spp. and ginger. β-caryophyllene is also common, widely spread in food plants and derived from α-humulene, with a C
 <sub>9</sub>-ring fused to a cyclobutane ring [

 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> (Sesquiterpene Hydrocarbons (SH): 8.30% ± 1.90% and Oxygenated Sesquiterpenes (OS): 7.10% ± 2.14%) and
