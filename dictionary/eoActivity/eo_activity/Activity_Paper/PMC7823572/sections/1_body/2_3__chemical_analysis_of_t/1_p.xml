<p>The chemical composition of the essential oil obtained from 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizomes has been widely determined through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) (

 <xref rid="B102-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] alone or combined with gas chromatography-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) [

 <xref rid="B105-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] to achieve a quantitative analysis. The determination of the chemical composition is key, because the components of the essential oil and their concentration can be considered a fingerprint conferring specific characteristics and properties [
