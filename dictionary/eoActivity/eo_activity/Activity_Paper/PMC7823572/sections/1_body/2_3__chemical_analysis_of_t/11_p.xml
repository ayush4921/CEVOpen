 <italic>C. longa</italic> nutrition also has a significant impact in the yield and composition of rhizome oil. Especially, fertilizer use can enhance the productivity of volatile oil of

 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizomes. Particularly remarkable is the interaction of KNO
 <sub>3</sub> and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>, which favours the accumulation of sesquiterpenes in turmeric rhizome [

 <italic>C. longa</italic> rhizomes. These optimise the absorption of nutrients and water, augment the metabolic activity of the plant, etc. In consequence, the root system becomes more robust, and the chemical composition of the essential oil is improved, increasing the production of certain compounds, including caryophyllene, α-curcumene, β-bisabolene and β-curcumene, using sustainable technologies [

Concretely, the boiling conditions, way of slicing, type of mill and speed of crushing and presence of heat and oxygen need to be controlled and standardised to obtain essential oils with certain characteristics [
