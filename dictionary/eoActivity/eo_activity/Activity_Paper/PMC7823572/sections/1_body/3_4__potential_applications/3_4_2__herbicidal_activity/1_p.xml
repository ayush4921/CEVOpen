 <xref rid="B221-plants-10-00044" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>]. Alternatives to synthetic herbicides for weed management and food security require the research of natural sources such as essential oils to develop safer and more sustainable herbicides without significantly affecting crops yields. Several essential oils have demonstrated promising herbicidal properties, inhibiting seed germination and/or seedling growth of a broad number of weeds [
