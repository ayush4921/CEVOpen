<p>The baiqiuli levels were determined by GC analysis (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Kusuma and Mahfud, 2017</xref>), and they were measured using GC-smart (Shimadzu. GC-smart, Kyoto, Japan). The gas chromatography equipment incorporated a chromatography DB-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, 0.25 μm). The temperature program was an initial temperature of 120°C, maintained for 2 min, followed by an increase to 150°C at a rate of 5°C/min, maintained for 2 min, then an increase to 160°C at a rate of 5°C/min, maintained for 5 min, and finally a 10°C/min increase to 180°C, maintained for 5 min. The temperature of the injection port was 150°C, the temperature of the detector was 280°C, and the split ratio was 30:1.
