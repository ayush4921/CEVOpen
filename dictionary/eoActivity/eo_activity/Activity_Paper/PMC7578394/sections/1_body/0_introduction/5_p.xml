<p>The CC obstacles in some crops such as watermelon have been effectively overcome through special control measures, however, it has not yet been completely resolved, especially in some medicinal plants such as patchouli. For decades, research on continuous patchouli cropping has focused on allelochemicals. However, previous studies did not use high-throughput sequencing to investigate intercropping patchouli with different species, the effects of the intercrop plants on root microbial communities, and whether they can ameliorate the continuous cropping obstacles that affect patchouli. Therefore, we hypothesized that intercropping turmeric or ginger could alleviate the disadvantages associated with patchouli CC. This study aimed to clarify soil microbial diversity, soil microbial population structure, microbial community metabolic function, and soil physical and chemical properties. Finding the soil microbial factors that lead to the CC yield decreases will provide new research ideas that can be used to solve patchouli CC problems.</p>
