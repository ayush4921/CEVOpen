<p>In the dominant bacteria group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>), Actinobacteria were positively correlated with AN and OM, but negatively correlated with pH and Ca; Acidobacteria were positively correlated with Ca, and pH, but OM was negatively correlated with AN; and Verrucomicrobia and Ca were positively correlated with pH. In the dominant fungi group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>), Mortierellomycota were negatively correlated with OM, AN, and P, but positively correlated with Ca. The pH and Ca were found to be important environmental factors that drove microbial community distribution and also affected the nutrient status of the soil.
