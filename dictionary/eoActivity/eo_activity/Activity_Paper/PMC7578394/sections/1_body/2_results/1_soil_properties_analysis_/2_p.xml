 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the dehydrogenase and urease activities increased and the phosphatase and protease activities decreased in the SPb group. However, the dehydrogenase and urease activities considerably decreased after intercropping with turmeric, and the phosphatase and protease activities increased after intercropping turmeric or ginger. Furthermore, the IGb results were similar to the SPb. The above results showed that intercropping can positively change the soil enzyme activities in the continuous cropping soil so that it becomes closer to the original state of the soil (SPa). These changes in enzyme activities affect the relevant nutrients in the soil. The correlation analysis results for soil nutrients and soil enzyme activities (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) showed that pH and Ca were significantly correlated with all the enzymes; Cu was significantly negatively correlated with phosphatase and dehydrogenase; and that AN, P, and OM were positively correlated with each other. These results confirmed that the nutrients of the soil changed after intercropping with turmeric or ginger, and that there was a significant correlation between soil nutrients and soil enzyme activity.
