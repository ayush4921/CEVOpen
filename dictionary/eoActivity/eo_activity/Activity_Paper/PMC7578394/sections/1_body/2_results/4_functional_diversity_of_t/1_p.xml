<p>PICRUSt was used to predict the functions of the bacterial communities in the SPa, SPb, ITb, and IGb, including their KEGG pathways and the metabolic pathways. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6A</xref> showed that the abundance of function in Amino Acid metabolism, Carbohydrate Metabolism, Replication and Repair, Nucleotide Metabolism, Energy metabolism, Translation, Lipid metabolism, and Cell Motility in SPa was significantly more abundant in SPb (
