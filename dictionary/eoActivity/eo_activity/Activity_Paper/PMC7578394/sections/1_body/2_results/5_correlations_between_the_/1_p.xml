The results of the detrended RDA revealed that the microbial community composition responses to soil gradient factors conformed to the linear model. Therefore, the microbial communities associated with the correlated soil environmental factors were analyzed based on RDA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). The pH and Ca were positively correlated with each other. Furthermore, P, AN, and OM positively correlated with each other, and Ca and pH had the greatest impacts on microbial community composition. Those factors were significantly correlated with the microbial community composition (
