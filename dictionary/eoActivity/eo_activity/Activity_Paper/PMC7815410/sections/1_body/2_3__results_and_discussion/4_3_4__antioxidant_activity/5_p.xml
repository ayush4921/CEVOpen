 <sup>−1</sup>. Although OE presents compounds such as 
 <italic>β</italic>-karyophylene and thymol that have identified antioxidant activity in the literature, in this study, OE showed low activity when compared to the ascorbic acid pattern. The study by Pereira et al. [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that variations in the content of the indole alkaloids coronaridin and voacangin in the extracts of 
 <italic>T. catharinensis</italic> did not alter the antioxidant potential in vitro, while Chizzola et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] verified high antioxidant properties in the extracts and EO of the leaves of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, which presented a greater amount of thymol in their constituents.
