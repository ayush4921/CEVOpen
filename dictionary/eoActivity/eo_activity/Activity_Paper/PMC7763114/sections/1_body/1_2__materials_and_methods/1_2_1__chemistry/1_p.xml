<p>1H NMR (400MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) (Varian Mercury Plus spectrometer, Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) and HRMS (Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto, Japan) spectral techniques were used for the confirmation of chemical structures of the compounds. Chemical shifts (Î´) are reported in ppm, and coupling constants ( 
 <italic>J</italic> ) are expressed in hertz (Hz). Electrothermal 9100/IA9100 instrument (Bibby Scientific Limited, Staffordshire, UK) was used to find melting points. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel 60 HF254 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to check the reaction process. Chloroform: methanol (4.8:0.2) solvent mixture was used as TLC solvent system.
