<p>A mixture of compound 2 (10 mmol), a suitable sulfonamide derivative (12 mmol) [sulfacetamide (3a), sulfaguanidine (3b), sulfanilamide (3c), sulfathiazole (3d) sulfadiazine (3e), sulfamerazine (3f), sulfamethazine (3g)] and sodium acetate (15 mmol) in glacial acetic acid (10 mL) was refluxed at 100 ºC for 18–22 h (3a (20 h), 3b (22 h), 3c (18 h), 3d (21 h), 3e (19 h), 3f (20 h), 3g (19 h)). The reaction process was monitored by TLC. The product was filtered off, washed with water, and dried. It was recrystallized from DMF / C2H5OH / H2O [23]. Compounds 3a–g were synthesized successfully for the first time (except compounds 3c and 3d) according to Figure 2 [31]. Experimental data on compounds 3c and 3d have not been presented in the literature. The spectrum data (1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS) of all compounds (3a–g) are given below; at the same time all of the chemistry data were also given as supporting information.</p>
