<p>AChE inhibitory potencies of the compounds 3a–g were presented in Table. When AChE inhibition potency of the compounds 3a–g were considered, IC50 values of the compounds were found in the range of 9.11–26.65 nM while their Ki values were recognized ranging between 8.91 ± 1.65 – 34.02 ± 5.90 nM. The reference compound tacrine had a IC50 value of 25.78 nM whereas its Ki value was 18.45 ± 2.12 nM. The compounds 3a–g were found as 1.2–2.8 fold more potent inhibitor s than reference drug Tacrine based on IC50 values (except 3e). In addition, the IC50 value of the cyclic compound 2 which has oxazole-5(4H)-ones was 38.50 nM.</p>
