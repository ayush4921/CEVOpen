<p>The most promising compound 3g having 4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl moiety was 7.5× and 12.4× more potent than AZA and compound 2, respectively. On the other hand, when the compound 3g was compared with 3e, substitution of the two methyl groups in 3g led to increasing activity that was 2× more potent. In addition, primary sulfonamide compound 3c was the second lead compound in regards to inhibitory potency on hCA I. Secondary amine derivatives, except 3g, were found less active than that of 3c which has sulfanilamide moiety.</p>
