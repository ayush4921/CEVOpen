<p>As one of the most studied enzyme families that target many diseases, carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are zinc-binded enzymes that catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2. CA isoenzymes play an important role in many physiological and pathological processes such as tumorigenicity, respiration, regulation of pH, electrolytes secretion, biosynthesis of membrane lipids, and nucleotides. Among the most studied isotypes of CAs, cytosolic CA I and CA II isoenzymes act as targets for glaucoma and epilepsy while CA IX and CA XII are promising well-known targets for current anticancer research [12â€“16].</p>
