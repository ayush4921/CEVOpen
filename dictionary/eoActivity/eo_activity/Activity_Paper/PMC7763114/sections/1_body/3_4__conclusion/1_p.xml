<p>In conclusion, a series of the compounds 3a–g were reported as novel enzyme inhibitors of hCA I, hCA II, and AChE. Enzyme inhibitory assays showed that novel benzamides 3a–g had inhibitory potencies against hCA I, hCA II, and AChE enzymes at the nanomolar levels. The Ki values of the compounds were calculated in the range of 4.07 ± 0.38 – 29.70 ± 3.18 nM for hCA I and 10.68 ± 0.98 – 37.16 ± 7.55 nM for hCA II, while the Ki values for AChE were calculated in the range of 8.91 ± 1.65 – 34.02 ± 5.90 nM. The most potent compounds 3g, 3c, and 3f can be considered as the leads of the study with promising results. The use of secondary sulfonamides can be considered as a useful modification to obtain more potent compounds towards AChE, while primary sulfonamide derivative generally had a better effect on hCA I and hCA II isoenzymes.</p>
