<p>A total of 11 
 <italic>i.p.</italic> treatments of HMWp (5 µg/g BW) in MCF7 tumor bearing mice over a period of 21 days had successfully suppressed the growth of the tumors. The tumor volume of the HMWp-treated mice was significantly (

In contrast, the tumors in the control mice grew 3 times larger than its original size. At the end of the experiment, all the control and HMWp-treated mice were sacrificed, and their tumors were excised (
