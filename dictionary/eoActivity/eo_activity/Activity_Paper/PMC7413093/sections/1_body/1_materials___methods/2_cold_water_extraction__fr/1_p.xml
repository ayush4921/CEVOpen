<p>Cold water extraction was performed by dissolving the mushroom sclerotial powder in distilled water, in a ratio of 1:20 (g/mL) and stirred continuously at 4 °C for 24 h. The extract mixture was centrifuged at 8,000 g for 30 min and the supernatant was filtered through Whatman
 <sup>®</sup> Grade 1 filter paper prior to freeze-drying. The Ligno TG-K cold water extract (CWE) was fractionated by Sephadex G-50 (fine) gel filtration chromatography with 0.05 M ammonium acetate as eluent. Elution was carried out by gravity with a flow rate of two mL/min. Three pooled fractions of high (HMW), medium (MMW) and low (LMW) molecular weights were collected based on the distribution of the protein and carbohydrate in each fraction. The initial protein and carbohydrate contents in each fraction were estimated by Bradford (

Total protein and carbohydrate contents of the pooled fractions were determined using 2D Quant Kit (GE Healthcare) and phenol sulfuric acid assay (
