<p>Our previous studies have reported that the TM02 sclerotium contains lectins, serine proteases and immunomodulatory proteins which possess bio-pharmacological activities including antiproliferative, antitumor and immunomodulatory (

 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02. Therefore, it is of interest to identify the protein components in HMWp. Using 1D-SDS-PAGE coupled with shotgun LC-MS/MS proteomics analysis, lectins and serine proteases are the two most abundant proteins detected in HMWp. Mushroom lectins and serine proteases have been reported to exert antiproliferative, antitumor, immunomodulatory, mitogenic and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory effects (

 <italic>L. rhinocerus</italic> TM02 sclerotium exhibited potent cytotoxic selectivity toward MCF7 cells. Our results showed 74.6% of the serine proteases in HMWp is encoded by the same gene as F5 serine proteases (97.3% encoded by GME4347_g).
