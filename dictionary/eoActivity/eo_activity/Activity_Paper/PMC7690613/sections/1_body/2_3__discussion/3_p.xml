<p>Inflammation serves as a body’s defensive biological response to damaged cells and injured tissue. The existence of edema is amongst the major signs of inflammation [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Carrageenan-induced paw edema is an established method to investigate the anti-edematous activity of natural products in rodents [

 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory potential of saffron ethanolic extracts was studied after a sub-planter injection of 1% λ-carrageenan into mice. Test samples represented significant anti-edematous potential by regulating biphasic acute inflammatory response induced by carrageenan and showed the highest edema inhibition in mice after 4 h. Carrageenan induces the inflammatory process in two phases. The initial phase, which occurs during the first 2.5 h post-carrageenan injection, attributes to the release of mediators like serotonin, histamine, and bradykinin on vascular permeability. Serotonin and histamine are produced in the first 1.5 h, while bradykinin is produced within 2.5 h post-carrageenan injection [

 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In addition to these mediators, Nitric Oxide (NO) is also reported to play a key role in carrageenan-induced acute inflammation [

 <xref rid="B63-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Among all the extracts, SEE effectively inhibited the increase in paw volume of carrageenan-induced edema showing a maximum percentage of edema inhibition (77.33%) at the end of 4 h followed by PEE (70.50%) at 800 mg/kg dose. Diclofenac potassium used as a standard drug reduced paw edema volume by 88.87%. Therefore, it can be assumed that the active constituents of the extract might be responsible for the inactivation of inflammation process whose mechanism of action need to be studied. Phytochemicals screening of SAE, SEE, PAE, and PEE on acute inflammation by xylene-induced ear edema indicated that only SAE and SEE at higher doses possessed anti-inflammatory effects in mice. However, SAE, SEE, and PEE showed significant activity against chronic inflammation using formalin-induced edema in rat paw [

 <xref rid="B64-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Similarly, intraperitoneal injection of stigma constituent, crocin at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.2 g/kg significantly attenuated paw thickness and infiltration of neutrophils in paw tissues [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Kumar et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] examined various petal extracts of 
 <italic>C. sativus</italic> Cashmerianus to assess the anti-inflammatory effect by carrageenan-induced paw edema method. Among all the extracts, methanol extract (400 mg/mL) exhibited 63.16% inhibition of paw volume, followed by aqueous (57.89%) and chloroform (50%) extracts. The phytochemical profile of 
 <italic>C. sativus</italic> petal suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of PEE might be due to the presence of nutraceutical compounds, particularly flavonoids (kaempferol, 12.6%
