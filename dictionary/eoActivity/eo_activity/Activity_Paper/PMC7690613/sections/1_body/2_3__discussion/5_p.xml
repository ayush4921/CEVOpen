<p>Depression is one of the most serious psychiatric disorders affecting approximately 4.7% of the global population and is ranked as the eleventh most frequent cause of disease burden worldwide [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Most of the patients have many concerns about commencing synthetic antidepressants in their recommended doses due to the anticipated adverse reactions such as libido, constipation, dry mouth, and dizziness [

 <xref rid="B82-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Immobility or the flouting response of rodents in FST is traditionally considered an indication of depression and anxiety [
 <xref rid="B83-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. During the FST, treatment of antidepressant drugs attenuate immobility, prolong its onset and delay active escape behaviors of the animal [
 <xref rid="B84-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In the present study, a prominent difference in immobility time of saline (141.16 s) and fluoxetine HCl (41.33 s) used as a negative and positive control, respectively, was observed, representing the reliability of the test. Furthermore, the administration of saffron extracts showed a significant effect on reducing the immobility time compared to the saline-treated group. PEE represented itself as a potential antidepressant drug showing a notable diminution in the immobility period (69.66 s) followed by SEE (76.66 s). Moreover, CEE (96.50 s) indicated moderate antidepressant effect, whereas LEE (106.83 s) exhibited mild activity. The potent antidepressant effect exhibited by petal can be strongly linked to the presence of natural flavonoid, kaempferol as it significantly attenuated immobility behaviors in rats and mice and showed an almost similar response to fluoxetine [

Similarly, in an 8-week double-blind, randomized clinical study, dried saffron petal (15 mg bid) had similar antidepressant effects as fluoxetine (15 mg bid) in treating patients with mild-to-moderate depression and no significant differences in observed side effects [

In an investigation comparing the efficacy of saffron stigma and corms with fluoxetine against depression, petroleum ether, and dichloromethane fractions of saffron stigma and corms significantly reduced the immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swimming test at all doses (150, 300, and 600 mg/kg) without altering the locomotor behavior of mice during the open-field test. The authors highlighted that the antidepressant effect of stigma extracts could be due to crocin analogs, particularly crocin 1. However, HPLC analysis of corm extract revealed the absence of safranal, crocin, crocetin, or kaempferol compounds, assuming the presence of other bioactive compounds in saffron corms showing a potent antidepressant effect which need to be further explored [
