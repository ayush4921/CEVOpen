<p>The antidepressant activity of orally administered saffron ethanolic extracts was tested by forced swimming test, and findings in the form of immobility time are graphically depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01414-f005">Figure 5</xref>. Positive control group administered with drug, fluoxetine HCl produced a strong antidepressant effect (41.33 ± 4.71 s) at the concentration of 10 mg/kg against the negative control, saline (141.16 ± 6.40 s). Furthermore, saffron ethanolic extracts significantly attenuated immobility time in mice when compared with the saline-treated control group. At the dose of 800 mg/kg, PEE represented itself as a potential antidepressant candidate showing a significant reduction in immobility time (69.66 ± 7.63 s) with respect to control and equivalent to the standard drug followed by SEE (76.66 ± 6.56 s). CEE significantly declined the mean time spent by mice in the immobile state (96.50 ± 6.28 s), signifying moderate antidepressant effect, whereas LEE exhibited mild activity (106.83 ± 6.24 s) by significantly attenuating immobility time with respect to serine, but not equivalent to fluoxetine HCl.
