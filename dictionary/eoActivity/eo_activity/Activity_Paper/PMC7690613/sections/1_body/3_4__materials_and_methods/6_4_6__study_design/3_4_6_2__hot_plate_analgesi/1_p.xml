<p>The test first reported by Eddy and Leimbach [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-09-01414" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], with some modifications, was performed to measure the analgesic activity of saffron extracts. The standard drug, aspirin (10 mg/kg), and saline (1 mL/kg) were served as a positive and negative control, respectively. The parameter recorded was based on the latency time for fore- and hind-paw licking and/or jumping responses by placing the mice on the surface of a hot-plate (IITC Life Science, USA) set at a temperature of 55 ± 1 °C and initial latency time (Ti) was calculated by taking the mean of two readings. Animals with baseline latencies of &lt;5 s or &gt;30 s were ignored from the study. The final latency time (Tf) was noted after administration of the drug for each group at the intervals of 0.5, 1, and 2 h, with a cut off time of 30 s. The tested extracts (0.8 g/kg) were administered orally, and standard (aspirin, 10 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously. The percentage analgesia (PA) was measured using the equation:
