<p>Saffron corms obtained from the safranor company, France, were planted in plastic trays and pots containing black soil in August. The soil texture of experimental black soil was a clay-loam structure containing 2.74% of total organic carbon and 0.04% of total nitrogen, in addition to 7 ppm of phosphorus, 331.5 ppm of potassium, 64 ppm of calcium, 75.6 ppm of magnesium, and 25.3 ppm of sodium. The corms were incubated in a temperature-controlled (18 ± 1 °C) room under 16 h photoperiod illuminated with white fluorescent tubes at an irradiance of nearly 40 µmol m
 <sup>−2</sup> s
 <sup>−1</sup>. Different saffron parts were collected as per life span of the plant, i.e., petal and stigma were handpicked during October, leaves were collected in May, and smaller corms weighing less than 2 g were harvested in June. Individual parts were air-dried under shade for 7 weeks and ground to powder.
