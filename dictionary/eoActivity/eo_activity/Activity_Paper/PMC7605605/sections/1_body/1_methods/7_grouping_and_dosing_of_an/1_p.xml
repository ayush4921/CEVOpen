<p>In the diabetic mice model, after the mice were randomly grouped a total of 6 groups were used for the experiment, of which the first five groups were diabetic mice and the last one group was normal mice (each group contains six mice). The first group one served as a diabetic control and was given distilled water; the next group two served as a positive control and was given glibenclamide 5 mg/kg; the coming three groups (group three, four, and five) were given the three doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg, respectively) of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> leaf crude extract; and the last group six (normal mice) served as a negative control and was given distilled water.

Before the administration of distilled water, standard drug, and each dose of the crude extract, the fasting body weight, and blood glucose level were determined as a baseline. Then, after overnight fasting (fourteen hours) similar measurement of the body weight and BGL were done on the 7th and 14th day of administration of distilled water, the standard drug, and each dose of the crude extract.
