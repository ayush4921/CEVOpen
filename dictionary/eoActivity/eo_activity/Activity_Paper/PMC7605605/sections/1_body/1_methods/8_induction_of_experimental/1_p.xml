<p>After overnight fasting of all groups of male mice, the body weight and the BGL were measured before diabetes mellitus induction by streptozotocin solution. Then, the streptozotocin solution at a dose of 150 mg/kg, pH 4.5 was injected through the intraperitoneal route. After diabetes induction, five percent glucose was given to all groups of mice after 6 hours of the streptozotocin solution administration (to avoid death secondary to hypoglycemic shock). Seventy-two hours later, the mice were screened for diabetes mellitus. Those mice having &gt;200 mg/dl blood glucose levels were contained within the experiment.
