<p>The crude extract was screened for the presence or absence of secondary metabolites such as tannins, alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, triterpenoid, phenols, steroids, glycosides, and anthraquinones using standard procedures. Detection of terpenoids (Salkowski’s test): The dried 80% methanolic extract (100 mg) was dissolved in 5mL of distilled water. Five milliliters of plant extract solution were mixed in 2 mL of chloroform, followed by the careful addition of 3 mL concentrated H
 <sub>2</sub>SO4. A layer of the reddish-brown coloration formed at the interface indicates a positive result for the presence of terpenoids. Detection of saponins (Froth test): To 0.25 g of the crude extract, 5 mL of distilled water was added in a test tube. Then, the solution was shaken vigorously for 2 minutes and observed for a stable persistent froth. The formation of froth indicates the presence of saponins. Detection of flavonoids (NaOH test): About 0.3g of crude extract was dissolved in 2mL distilled water then three drops of 20% sodium hydroxide solution were added. The yellow color was formed which turn to colorless on the addition of three drops of 20% hydrochloric acid which indicates the presence of flavonoids. Detection of tannins (Braemer’s Test): About 0.25g crude extract was stirred with 10mL of distilled water in a test tube and filtered with filter paper (Wathman No. 1). Then a few drops of 2% ferric chloride were added to the clear filtrate. Then, the filtrate was observed when it gives a green precipitate which indicates the presence of tannins. Detection of steroids (Liebermann–Burchardt test): 0.5g of methanolic crude extract was dissolved in 2mL of distilled water. 2 mL chloroform was added to the solution and an equal volume of concentrated H
 <sub>2</sub>SO4 was added to the test tube carefully. A red color formed in the lower chloroform layer indicates the presence of steroids. Detection of alkaloids (Wagner’s Test): Formation of a reddish-brown color when three drops of Wagner’s reagent were added to 10 mg of crude extract dissolved in distilled water confirms the presence of alkaloids. Detection of phenolic compounds (ferric chloride test): 10mg of crude extract was dissolved in 1mL distilled water and to this 0.5 mL of neutral 5% ferric chloride solution was added. The formation of blue-green color indicates the presence of phenolic compounds. Detection of glycosides (Keller-kiliani test): Half a gram of dried extract was placed into a test tube. About 20 mL of distilled water was added, and after 24 hr, the extract was filtered using a Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Thereafter, 5 mL of the extract was treated with 2 mL of concentrated glacial acetic acid and two drops of 0.1% ferric chloride solution. The mixture was then poured into a test tube of 1mL concentrated H
 <sub>2</sub>SO4. The formation of a brown ring at the interface indicates the presence of glycosides. Detection of anthraquinone (Borntrager’s test): 3mL of the plant extract was dissolved by 3mL of benzene and filtered with Wathman No 1 filter paper. Then 2mL of 10% ammonium hydroxide was added. The formation of a purple ring indicates the presence of anthraquinones.
