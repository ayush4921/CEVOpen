<p>In this study, the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> showed a reduction in fasting blood glucose levels in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. This provides evidence that the extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> improves the metabolic abnormalities related to DM and can retard the risk of complications due to chronic hyperglycemia. Therefore, the beneficial effects of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> in diabetes seem to be attributed to the synergistic effects of its bioactive compounds such as phenols, triterpenoid, flavonoids, saponins, and anthraquinones. Additional investigations are required to identify the lead compounds and quantitative characterization of secondary metabolites existing in 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> with its molecular mechanism of action on histological analysis, PPAR, insulin sensitization, and other insulin targets based on the pathophysiology of DM.
