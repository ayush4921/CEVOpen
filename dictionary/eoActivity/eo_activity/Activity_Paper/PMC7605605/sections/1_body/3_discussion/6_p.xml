<p>Lipid profile is crucial in the diagnosis and treatment of several cardiovascular diseases and control of DM.
 <xref rid="cit0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Several studies have conveyed that cardiovascular complications linked with DM are due to abnormality in lipid metabolism.
 <xref rid="cit0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The results of this study showed a significant increment of lipid profiles in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice such as TC, TG, VLDL-c, and LDL-c, all this combined with a decrease in HDL-c. The administration of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract exhibited a significant improvement in lipid profile. Administration of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> crude extract significantly increased the HDL-cholesterol in diabetic mice. The reductions of TG, TC, and LDL level by the extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> might be due to the involvement of the polyphenolic part of the extract in preventing the formation of AGEs in diabetic mice.
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> The extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> fiber may delay the absorption of glucose and fatty acids, therefore providing fewer substrate for the production of triglycerides.
 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> In addition, the leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> may have inhibitory effects on pancreatic cholesterol esterase and pancreatic lipase which may contribute to anti-hyperlipidemic activities in the diabetic mice. This finding is in line with previous similar studies.
