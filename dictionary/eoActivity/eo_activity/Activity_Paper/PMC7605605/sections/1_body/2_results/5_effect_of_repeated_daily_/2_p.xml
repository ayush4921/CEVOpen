<p>Between-group analysis showed that the middle (200 mg/kg) and the higher (400 mg/kg) doses of the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> showed a statically significant improvement in serum total cholesterol (p&lt;0.001). Similarly, all tested doses (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg) of the crude extract revealed a statically significant improvement in serum lipid profiles: serum triglyceride (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, respectively); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001, respectively); very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, respectively); and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001, respectively) as compared to the diabetic control. Therefore, treatment of diabetic mice with the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> and the standard drug significantly and dose-dependently improved serum TC, TG, and LDL-c, and VLDL-c levels as compared to the diabetic control group. Although a significant increase in serum HDL-cholesterol level was shown in the crude extract of 
 <italic>H. abyssinica</italic> treated groups as compared to the diabetic control (
