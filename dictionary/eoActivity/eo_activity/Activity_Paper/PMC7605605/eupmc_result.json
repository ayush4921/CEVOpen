    "<h4>Background</h4>The leaves of <i>Hagenia abyssinica</i> (Rosaceae) have been used traditionally for the management of diabetes mellitus. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic activity of <i>Hagenia abyssinica</i> leaves crude extract in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.<h4>Methods</h4>Antidiabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic activity of the crude extract of <i>Hagenia abyssinica</i> was studied in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The effects of the extract on fasting blood glucose level, body weight, and serum lipid profiles were analyzed. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used for data analysis and p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.<h4>Results</h4>Hagenia abyssinica leaves crude extract showed significant (p<0.05-p<0.001) blood-glucose-lowering activity. Moreover, the crude extract of <i>H. abyssinica</i> reduced the fasting blood glucose level by 23.21%, 38.20%, 43.53%, and 58.99%, respectively, for CE100, CE 200, CE 400, and GLC 5 mg/kg on the 14th day of treatment. After diabetic mice were treated with <i>H. abyssinica</i> (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) for 14 days, there was a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum triglyceride and a significant increase in body weight, and HDL-cholesterol level as compared to diabetic control.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present findings revealed that <i>H. abyssinica</i> leaves could be useful for the management of diabetes mellitus and other abnormalities related to this metabolic disorder. Thus, the present study may support the traditional use of <i>H. abyssinica</i> for diabetes mellitus treatment."
