<p>Treatments represent four principal scenarios of rainy seasons in the Negev Desert of Israel, differing in the intensity and frequency of rain episodes, as follows: A. low and concentrated (50 mm, comprised of two events); (B) low and scattered (50 mm, spread in ten events); (C) high and concentrated (200 mm, in four events); and, D. high and scattered (200 mm, in ten events) precipitation. Seeds were sown in loess soil at a density of eight seeds m
 <sup>âˆ’2</sup>, in 6 m
 <sup>2</sup> plots. The experiment was organized in a random block design with four replicates. Irrigation was executed using computer-controlled sprinklers, and no fertilizer or soil amendments were used. The amount of water was monitored from germination and included rain. Plants were counted weekly. At harvest in June, tuber number and weight were determined per each surviving plant.
