<p>The HSB project took place at Ramat Negev Desert Agro-Research Center (RN-DARC), Israel (30°58′ N 34°42′ E), 305 m above sea level. Soil texture varies across short distances from sandy dunes to sandy-loam Loess—and consequently differ in water retention and cation exchange capacity. The natural life cycle of HSB occurs in the rainy season, germinating from November and dispersing seeds up to May. Mean annual precipitation is about 82 mm, but the amount of rain can substantially vary among years and locations, as well as the distribution and intensity of rain events. During the growing season, daily average temperatures decline from 17.8 °C in November to about 10 °C in January and then steadily rise to 23 °C in May (
