<p>HaCaT cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 50,000 cells per well in triplicate in 500μL of media and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2–95% air atmosphere. After incubation, cell excitation was performed with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, PeproTech, 300-01A, Cranbury, NJ, USA). Cultures in each well were treated with a final concentration of 50 ng mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of TNFα and 50 µL plant extract. Three different controls were included in all experiments: (a) untreated cells, with neither TNF-α nor plant extracts, (b) cells treated with TNF-α alone, (c) cells treated with TNF-α and the solvent (7% ethanol). The supernatant was taken, and the level of IL-8 was measured 16 h posttreatment using the commercial Human CXCL8/IL-8 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, DY208-05, McKinley Place MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. IL-8 is a common biomarker for inflammatory skin diseases [
