<p>The emerging need for improving human diet has led to increasing interests in traditional nourishments, such as the Mediterranean diet [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01069" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and in primordial therapeutic aids. These are usually based on diverse resources that change through locations, seasons and include numerous wild edible plant species. Attempts to retrieve old beneficial species and recruit them for new commercial use have a vast potential, considering that a very small portion of known plant species has ever been adequately studied for such purposes [

 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01069" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. There is an increasing research activity focused on identifying and characterizing wild plant species with particular attributes to human diet and health [
