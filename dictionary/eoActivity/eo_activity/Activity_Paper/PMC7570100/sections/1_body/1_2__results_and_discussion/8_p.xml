<p>Simulation of various natural scenarios of the precipitation regime from November to May showed that in a relatively dry winter (50 mm), HSB exhibited low seed germination and seedlings survival rates. Conversely, many more plants persisted and grew in a rainy (200 mm) season (data not shown). Interestingly, the effects of water availability on tuber production per plant were very limited within the low precipitation range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f004">Figure 4</xref>). However, tuber production and tuber weight increased significantly when water application increased to 700 mm, supplied consistently using drip irrigation, and no problems of germination or seedling persistence occurred. Moreover, plants produced significantly greater number (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) of substantially larger tubers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Adding fertilizer to the irrigated water had only a small influence on the number of tubers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f004">Figure 4</xref>B), but tuber size increased by more than 50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Thus, application of a basic agricultural practice gave rise to a 10-fold increase in the mean tuber yield of an individual HSB plant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Finally, the difference in plant and crop performance between wild and agricultural environments is unexpected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01069-f005">Figure 5</xref>); the greater germination and survival rates, fortified by enhanced tubers’ growth and development have brought about the current yield potential of cultivated HSB to about 15 Mg ha
