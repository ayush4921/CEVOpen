<p>Wild plant species may hold immense potential resources of nutritional value and therapeutic substances. In the present study, the tubers of 
 <italic>E. crassifolium</italic>, an ignored desert shrub, were shown to harbor significant nutritional values and anti-inflammatory capacities. The catechins found in the tubersâ€™ ethanolic extract have well-established remedial effects in serious human ailments. Furthermore, indications exist suggesting that HSB tubers have a greater medicinal potential. While a demonstrated bioactive capacity is a prerequisite, high productivity is essential in realizing the potential of an underutilized species. The dramatic increase in HSB tubers yield in response to fertigation paves the way for this plant to become a potential industrial crop.
