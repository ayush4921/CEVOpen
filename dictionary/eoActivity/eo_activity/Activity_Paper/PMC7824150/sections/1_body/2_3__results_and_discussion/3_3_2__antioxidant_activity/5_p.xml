<p>The DPPH free radical scavenging method is based on electron-transfer reaction that produces a violet solution. The DPPH radical is stable at 25 °C. Among the investigated species, aqueous extract of fresh leaves of HR and HL exerted a higher radical scavenging potential (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 18.7 and 24.7 μg/mL, respectively) (
