<p>A different result was observed using ABTS radical cation. In fact, in this test fresh 
 <italic>H. lucida</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>taurina</italic> leaves (HT1) showed a comparable radical scavenging activity to that reported for ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.8 and 1.7 μg/mL, respectively). A promising ABTS radical scavenging potential was noted with the blanching water from the blanching of the leaves of the same species (HT3, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.9 μg/mL).
