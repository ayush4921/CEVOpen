<p>Compared to the Calabria sample HRA1, a lower ferric reducing power was recorded for 
 <italic>H. radiata</italic> fresh leaves collected in Liguria that showed FRAP value of 31.1 mM Fe (II) /Kg. More recently, Souilah et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] investigated the antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, dichloromethane and ethyl acetate fractions of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Hypochaeris laevigata</italic> var. 
 <italic>hipponensis</italic>. The highest DPPH radical scavenging activity was exhibited by 
 <italic>n</italic>-Butanol extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.12 μg/mL) followed by ethyl acetate extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.70 μg/mL). This last extract was also able to exert a potent ABTS radical cation inactivation (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.32 μg/mL). The following rank dichloromethane, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol and ethyl acetate in protection of lipid peroxidation was found.
