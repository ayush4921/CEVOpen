<p>Fresh 
 <italic>H. laevigata</italic> leaves (HL1) exerted a promising α-amylase inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 42.7 μg/mL which is lower compared to positive control acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50.1 μg/mL). A notable activity was observed, also in the blanching water (HL5, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 56.8 μg/mL). The HL1 sample showed the greatest α-glucosidase inhibitory activity followed by 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> (HR1) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 31.3 and 37.6 μg/mL, respectively. Both results are comparable with those found for acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 35.5 μg/mL). Also, in this case, blanching significantly affected the bioactivity of the samples. Fresh 
 <italic>H. radiata</italic> leaves (HRA1) showed the highest lipase inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 39.8 μg/mL) whereas, values of 52.4 and 58.2 μg/mL were found for HR1 and HL1, respectively. Unlike what happened for the carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes, the blanching water has only a minimal inhibitory activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 62.8 to 78.8 for HR3 and HT3, respectively) testifying that compounds able to inhibit lipase enzyme are retained in the matrix also after blanching.
