<p>Values of 97.99% at 250 mg/mL and 38.69% at 5 mg/mL were recorded by Senguttuvan et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] for Indian 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> dried leaves in DPPH and ABTS test, respectively. Successively the same research group showed that the oral administration of 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> methanolic leaf and root extracts and isolated compounds proved to be significant, promising candidates able to quench free radicals. The antioxidant effect was more pronounced in the animals treated with root extract, probably due its high content in alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins and terpenoids that could act as antioxidant compounds [
 <xref rid="B41-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Lower antioxidant activity was recorded for 
 <italic>H. radicata</italic> collected in Latium [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] where IC
 <sub>50</sub> average values of 2.02 and 2.33 mg/mL were found for fresh and boiled leaves, respectively in DPPH assay. Average values of 6.2 and 2.3 mmol/kg FW were found for fresh and boiled leaves in ABTS test, respectively.
