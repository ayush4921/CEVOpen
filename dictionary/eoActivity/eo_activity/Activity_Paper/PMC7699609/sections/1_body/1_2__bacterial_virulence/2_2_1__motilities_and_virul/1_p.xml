<p>Motilities allow bacteria to progress through different surfaces and/or tissues and different forms of motilities can be adopted, depending on bacterial species. Briefly, four active motilities have been reported: swimming, swarming, and twitching, that rely on the presence of flagella and/or type IV pili, and gliding that requires a slime production [

 <italic>E. coli</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00830-f001">Figure 1</xref>B) have been reported to swim, swarm, and twitch whereas the non-flagellated 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00830-f001">Figure 1</xref>C) is able of gliding by the production of slime guns. Additionally, two passive surface translocations, called sliding and darting, have been evoked, particularly for bacteria that lack the required flagella and type IV pili such as 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All these motilities allow invasive bacteria to reach appropriate tissues, depending on their tropisms. Once bacteria recognize the host cell receptors or nutrient-rich surroundings, they will colonize the cell surface and release virulence factors.
