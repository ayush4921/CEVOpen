<p>The ability of bacteria to produce diffusible as well as non-diffusible virulence factors is important in the development and perpetuation of infection [
 <xref rid="B20-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Diffusible virulence factors include enzymes, toxins, pigments, and surfactants that allow bacteria to cause damage to host cells and despoil their nutrient. Non-diffusible (‘membrane-associated’) virulence factors—including flagella, pili, and capsule lipopolysacharrides and lipoproteins—allow bacteria to adhere to their host tissues but also to counteract and evade immune responses. Particularly, the encapsulation of bacteria inhibits the capacity of macrophages and neutrophils to phagocyte them [
 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Moreover, the production of virulence factors lead to severe host damage, well beyond colonized regions; this is particularly the case of exotoxins that can severely dysregulate critical cellular processes. For instance, (i) enterotoxins produced by enterotoxigenic 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (ETEC) are a subset of exotoxins that specifically affect the digestive tract and generally result in infectious diarrhea [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; (ii) the redox properties of pyocyanins permit 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to kill competing microbes as well as mammalian cells and to weaken the immune system of infected lungs during cystic fibrosis [
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; (iii) hemolysins and leukotoxins produced by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> lyse red and white blood cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, granulocytes, and macrophages which severely undermines innate immune defenses [
