<p>Among Malagasy endemic 
 <italic>Dalbergia</italic> species, 
 <italic>D. pervillei</italic> Vatke (Fabaceae) exhibited attenuated gall phenotype when infected by the phytopathogen 
 <italic>Rhodococcus fascians</italic> [
 <xref rid="B72-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Further investigations led to the isolation of a prenylated isoflavanone, perbergin, which has been shown to target 
 <italic>attR</italic> gene expression, encoding a LysR-type transcriptional regulator that plays a key role in regulating the expression of virulence genes of 
 <italic>R. fascians</italic>, notably its transition from an epiphytic to a pathogenic lifestyle [
 <xref rid="B72-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Perbergin inhibited the induction of bacterial virulence 
 <italic>attR</italic> gene expression without any apparent loss of bacterial viability at 0.2 µM but demonstrated strong bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>R. fascians</italic> at 10 µM.
