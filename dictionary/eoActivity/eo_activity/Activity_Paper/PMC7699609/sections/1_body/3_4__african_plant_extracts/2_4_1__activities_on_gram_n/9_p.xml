<p>Plants from Eastern Africa have been also investigated for their QQ properties in a 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> model. About 25 medicinal plant extracts (roots, bark, and leaves; ethanol 50% v/v) used in southwestern Kenya to treat gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections were tested against a transformed 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> Top 10 reporter QS strain that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) when induced by exogenous AHLs (3-oxo-C6HSL). Interestingly, the extracts of 
 <italic>Vachellia gerrardii</italic> (Benth.) P.J.H.Hurter (synonym of 
 <italic>Acacia gerrardii</italic> Benth) and 
 <italic>Elaeodendron buchananii</italic> (Loes.) Loes. barks, at 1000 µg/mL reduce the reporter GFP expression (up to 50% inhibition) without any effect on the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm formation [

 <italic>Albizia schimperiana</italic> Oliv. (Fabaceae) and seed petroleum ether extract of 
 <italic>Justicia schimperiana</italic> (Hochst. ex Nees) T. Anderson (Acanthaceae) at 6500 µg/mL interfere with cell-to-cell communication, most likely by interacting with the 3-oxo-C6-HSL signaling pathway in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> reporter strain AI1-QQ.1 [
