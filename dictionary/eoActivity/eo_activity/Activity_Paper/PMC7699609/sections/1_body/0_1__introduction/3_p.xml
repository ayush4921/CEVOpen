<p>The expression of bacterial virulence factors is generally coordinated by quorum sensing (QS) mechanisms, a cell-to-cell communication system that allows bacteria to detect their population density by producing and perceiving diffusible signal molecules that synchronize common behaviors [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00830" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Depending on bacteria species, QS regulates the production of virulence factors, motilities, and/or biofilm formation. Thus, the disruption of QS signaling, also termed quorum quenching (QQ), appears as interesting adjuvant strategies in the fight against bacterial infections [
