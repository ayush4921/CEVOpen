<p>The induction of diabetes provoked anemia characterized by a significant drop of erythrocytes (RBC) count (31.85%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), hematocrit (HCT) (13.83%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), mean concentration of haemoglobin (MCH) by 38.26% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) (20.44%), and increase of mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (20.87%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the diabetic control group compared to normal control. In addition, the level of white blood cells increased (55.67%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), while the lymphocyte percentage decreased (24.96%, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) compared to the normal control. Oral administration of the plant extract induced a significant increase (at least at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) of RBC, HCT, lymphocytes, and platelet rate.
