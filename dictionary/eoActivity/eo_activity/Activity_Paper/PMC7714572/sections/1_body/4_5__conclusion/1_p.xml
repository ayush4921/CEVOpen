<p>The investigation of effects of hydroethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Bridelia atroviridis bark</italic> showed a decrease in hyperglycemia, inflammatory parameters, and a restoration in haematological parameters and an improvement in antioxidative status in the pancreas of nicotinamide-/streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. This is achieved by antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties of the plant extract. 
 <italic>Bridelia atroviridis</italic> could be a good candidate for the formulation of an antidiabetic drug plant based.
