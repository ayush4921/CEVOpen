 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These compounds prevent viral entry by inhibition of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor, acidification of cell membrane, and by immunostimulant activity. However, some reports show that the drug hydroxychloroquine is not effective for those infected with the coronavirus and shows adverse effects in patients with acute renal impairment (Pelle and Callen,
