<p>From the documents of Dr. Lipinski, the molecules are categorized as the therapeutic compounds when they have sufficiently acceptable ADME properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and toxicity profiles to qualify through the Phase I clinical trial on humans. However, his postulate “rule of 5” classifies the molecules only based on the orally active drug phenomena that include molecular weight ≤ 500, clogP ≤ 5, H- bond donor ≤ 5, and H- bond acceptor ≤ 10. They do not evaluate the parameters of direct metabolism, frequency of the molecule or if it contains reactive functional groups.</p>
