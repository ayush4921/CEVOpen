<p>In this present study, SARS-CoV-2 virus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was docked with 145 compounds selected from KK comprising plants. Ritonavir, Lopinavir, Oseltamivir, HCQ, Ivermectin, and Azithromycin are used as standard (Caly et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Cao et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Muralidharan et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These ligands were screened based on their propensity to dock with the receptor molecule and to inhibit the protein activity. The extent of docking was ranked based on the iGEMDOCK scoring function to zero down the most accurate ligand. Eventually, during the virtual screening process, each compound from each plant that bound at different binding pockets of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> has been selected. Based on the highest energy value, best compounds from each plant of Kabasura kudineer complex were exposed to accurate molecular docking. Based on screening process, the highest-ranked compounds (Acetoside, Luteolin 7 â€“rutinoside, Rutin, Chebulagic acid, Acanthoside, Syrigaresinol, Violanthin, Andrographidine C, Myricetin, Gingerenone -A, Tinosporinone, Geraniol, Nootkatone, Asarianin, and Gamma sitosterol) were selected for accurate docking against SARS-CoV-2 virus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and their corresponding energy values are listed in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (Structure of target compounds are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The energy values are inversely proportional to the acceptability of the molecule as a drug. Molecules that scored best by iGEMDOCK scoring functions were identified as potential leads for COVID-19 drug discovery process.
