<p>The present study focused on the main proteases 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> PDB ID (6LU7), as potential target proteins for SARS - COVID-19. Inhibition potential and effectiveness of compounds from Kabasura kudineer (KK) against novel coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> on molecular docking studies using Igemdock were investigated. The proteolytic maturation enzyme Mpro in CoV has been identified as the potential target protein to prevent the spread of infection through the inhibition of viral polyprotein cleavage (Liu and Wang, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The discovery of the Mpro protease structure has facilitated the identification of potential drug candidates for treatment. The protein sequences of the two Coronavirus strains SARS-CoV Mpro and the 2019-nCoV Mpro are 96% identical, and the active sites in both proteins remain free from mutations. In many viruses, proteases play essential roles in viral replication; therefore, proteases are often used as potential targets during the development of antiviral therapeutics (Chang et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, the disruption of protease activity in host cells can lead to various diseases. Hence, the host proteases can be generally used as potential therapeutic targets. Several compounds from medicinal plants have been reported to show antiviral properties (Thayil and Thyagarajan, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Zakaryan et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Jo et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This study was conceived with a strategy of exploring the natural compounds which may impede the SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the viral entry into the host cell or inhibiting the viral polyprotein processing in the cell. In this context, KK comprises 15 individual herbs namely
