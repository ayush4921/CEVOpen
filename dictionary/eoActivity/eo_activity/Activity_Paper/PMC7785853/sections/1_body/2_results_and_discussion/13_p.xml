 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>) from 
 <italic>Cypreus rotundus</italic> exhibit the energy value −62.87 and −62.4 kcal/mol which contain the −57.1 and −52.51 van der Waal interactions and −5.6 and −9.8 kcal/mol hydrogen bonding interactions. Lowest binding energy was observed in these two plants. Thyronine 26 and thyronine 111 are the major active sites to bind with 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Mileva et al. (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) reported the antiviral properties of Geraniol. Any specific anti-viral report on Nootkatone was not published and it is evident from the investigation that we can use Nootakatone as anti-viral agent for future purposes.
