It was predicted that the hydroxyl (-OH), ketone (=O), and ether (-O-) groups in luteolin compounds majorly impact the amino acid residue interactions at the active site of COVID-19 Mpro (Aziz et al.,

 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis showed that luteolin reduces DENV infection through the inhibition of human furin, which is an enzyme involved in the maturation of the virions (Ramana et al.,
