<p>The most significant step in molecular docking is to locate the ligand-binding sites on a protein. The protein-ligand binding sites are located using the novel energy-based method Q-Site Finder developed by Jackson, where the interaction energies of a methyl probe with a protein are analyzed (Laurie and Jackson, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Using the software, the plausible active binding sites of toxins were obtained. The binding sites which are more flexible were preferred for this analysis.
