<p>Lignans and isoflavonoids are the major classes of phytoestrogens [
 <xref rid="B97-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] which showed potential anticancer activity against various cells. Three lignans, namely, (−)-carinol (
 <bold>50</bold>), (−)-carissanol (
 <bold>51</bold>), and (−)-nortrachelogenin, isolated from 
 <italic>Carissa spinarum</italic>,were found to be cytotoxic against A549, MCF-7, and WI-38 cell lines. Among these, (−)-carinol (i.e., a compound with butanediol structure) showed more potent cytotoxic activity against these three cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1 µg/mL, as compared to (−)-carissanol and (−)-nortrachelogenin [
 <xref rid="B98-molecules-25-04032" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Secoisolariciresinol (
 <bold>52</bold>) and matairesino (
 <bold>53</bold>), two lignans isolated from 
 <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic>, exhibited cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 10 and 1 µM, respectively [
