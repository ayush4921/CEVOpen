<p>Despite the traditional use of various Ethiopian plants for the treatment of cancer by herbal medicine practitioners for many decades, only a few active anticancer crude extracts, herbal preparations, and pure compounds were tested and so far no clinical trial was conducted on them. In this review, an attempt has been made to document antiproliferative, antitumor, and cytotoxic natural products small molecules isolated from medicinal plants that are traditionally used to treat cancer in Ethiopia. However, among the reported active compounds, only few have been isolated from plants that are originated and collected from Ethiopian geographic location, despite their wider presence and traditional claim at home. The majority of compounds reported in this review are isolated from plants (corresponding to Ethiopian species) that were collected from different regions of the world. However, the comprehensive list of active compounds (IC
 <sub>50</sub> and ED
 <sub>50</sub> values) provided in this review will help to identify the most potent source(s) of these compounds, as bioactive marker(s), of local flora. Based on the higher frequency of citation 
 <italic>Croton macrostachyus</italic>, 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic>, 
 <italic>Plumbago zeylanica</italic>, and 
 <italic>Vernonia hymenolepsis</italic> are potential candidates for follow-up bioassay guided investigations. Furthermore, plants with reported antiproliferative compounds such as 
 <italic>Podocarpus falcatus</italic>, 
 <italic>Linum usitatissimum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Zehneria scabra</italic> should also be examined for additional cytotoxic compounds and evaluated against a battery of cancer cell lines.
