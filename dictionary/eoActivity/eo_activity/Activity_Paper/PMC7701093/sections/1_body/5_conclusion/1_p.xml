<p>In this short article, we have tried to present various methods of searching for plant compounds with anti-coronavirus activities, as well as approaches that make it possible to accelerate this search. Chemi-informatics methods provide opportunities for primary screening of large amounts of data to find candidate compounds. Genetic engineering methods make it possible to assess the interaction of candidate compounds with their targets in cell-free systems and in cell culture without resorting to the use of viruses, which significantly expands the list of laboratories for such research. Combining these approaches allows for more accurate study of targeting of potential drugs for subsequent trials. Acceleration of the preclinical phase of new drugs testing can be achieved through the use of transgenic animal models.</p>
