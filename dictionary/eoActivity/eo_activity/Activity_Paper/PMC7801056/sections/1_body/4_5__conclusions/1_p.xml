<p>We demonstrated that FXR signaling antagonist z-guggulsterone reduced gastric cancer cell viability through inhibiting cell proliferation, decreasing intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis, and downregulating VEGF and TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>1 levels but upregulating the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> level. Our findings demonstrated that z-guggulsterone exerted as a potential herbal medicinal agent against stomach neoplasms and functioned through decreasing cell survival and regulating the levels of important growth factors/cytokines.
