<p>As the hypoglycemic properties of MC have been generally verified in cell and animal experiments, some small-sample clinical trials have been performed. In 1993, a clinical trial was conducted in 12 male diabetic subjects with mild (postprandial blood sugar of 260 mg%) to severe (postprandial blood sugar of 433 mg%) degree. The result suggests that the hypoglycemic effect of MC is outstanding but cumulative and gradual. MC water extract is much better than dry powder and can delay the onset of cataracts and other secondary complications [

In 2004, Chinese researchers made kugua jiangtang capsule with water-soluble active ingredients of bitter gourd and applied it to 35 elderly male patients with T2DM. After one course treatment (30 days), both the blood sugar and lipid had a remarkable improvement [

In the same period, patients with T2DM in India (50–65 years old) were treated with MC extract (CCl4 + C6H6 MC soft extract) plus a half-dose oral hypoglycemic agent (metformin, glibenclamide, or a combination of both) for 7 days, and ultimately the hypoglycemic effect was greater than that of full-dose hypoglycemic drugs, indicating that MC extract has synergy with oral hypoglycemic drugs [
