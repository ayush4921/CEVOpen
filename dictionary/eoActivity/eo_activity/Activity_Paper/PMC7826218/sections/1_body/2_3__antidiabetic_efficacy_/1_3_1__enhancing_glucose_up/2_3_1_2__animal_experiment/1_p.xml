<p>Animal experiments mostly focus on the therapeutic effect of MC on T2DM through ameliorating insulin signal transduction disorder, while there are few documents confirming the impact of MC on T1DM. In the treatment of diabetic rats induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozocin (STZ), the ethanol extract functions by downregulating the expression of suppressors-of-cytokine-signaling 3 (SOCS-3) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), improving IRS-1/PI3K signal transduction, and upregulating the expression of Akt-2 and GLUT-4 in skeletal muscle and liver tissues, as well as increasing liver glycogen content [
