<p>According to reports, MC extract treatment can inhibit glycogenolysis in liver slices in vitro and in liver tissue in ALX-induced diabetic rats [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Meanwhile, saponins from MC have the ability to promote AMPK phosphorylation, thereby preventing gluconeogenesis in the liver of diabetic mice [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Increased activation of fat 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD1) is currently recognized as an important cause of obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemics. An experiment in vitro with respect to the effect of MC extract on 11
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD1 indicates that the activity of 11
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD1 is inhibited in dose-dependent and selective manner, resulting in the decrease of intracellular glucocorticoids concentrations, and further inhibits phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It is also demonstrated that MC ethanol extract can inhibit hepatic glycosylation in HFD mice, and the effect is attributed to less expression of PEPCK and glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), owing to the increase of AMPK phosphorylation and decrease of liver 11
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD1 [
