<p>Additionally, other mechanisms underlying the antidiabetic effect of MC have been investigated, especially the role of intestinal microbiota disorders in driving type 2 diabetes [

 <italic>Lactobacillus plantarum</italic> NCU116 optimizes the structure of polysaccharides, leading to the improvement of intestinal flora and colon SCFA production, which enhances its antidiabetic effect [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Another report reveals that MC preparation can alter the proportion of specific bacterial flora and influence the intestinal epithelial barrier and intestinal mucosal immunity, thereby adjusting inflammation levels and eventually mitigating insulin resistance and diabetes in diabetic rats. The mechanism is named as “Bacteria-Mucosal Immunity-Inflammation-Diabetes Axis” [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], which may be a potential insight that deserves to be explored in depth.
