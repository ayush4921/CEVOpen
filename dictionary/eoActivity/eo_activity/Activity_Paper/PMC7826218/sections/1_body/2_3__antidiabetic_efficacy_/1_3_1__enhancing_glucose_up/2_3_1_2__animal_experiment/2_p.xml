<p>Other metabolic signaling pathways involved in the hypoglycemic effect of MC were also investigated. Research on T2DM KK-Ay mouse model suggests that water extract of MC affects glucose utilization by activating AMPK in muscle tissue [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Studies on obese rats have shown that MC enhances the activity of AMPK by stimulating the production and function of thyroid hormones and adiponectin, bringing about the increase and translocation of GLUT4 [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]; bitter melon juice exhibits the function of alleviating insulin resistance, and the mechanism may involve the upregulation of leptin and adiponectin [

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] via glycogen synthase [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; cucurbitane triterpenoids can improve cellular uptake of glucose via upregulating the transcription levels of AMPK-
 <italic>α</italic>1 and GLUT4 [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, in vivo and in vitro research has found that MC extract can influence peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) PPAR
 <italic>α</italic>/PPAR
 <italic>γ</italic> and further regulate acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
