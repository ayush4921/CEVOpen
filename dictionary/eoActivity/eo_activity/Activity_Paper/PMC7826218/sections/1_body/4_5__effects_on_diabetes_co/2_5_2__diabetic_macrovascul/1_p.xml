<p>Dietary MC freeze-dried powder can optimize multiple lipid parameters in rats fed with or without cholesterol-enriched diets [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>], and it may be related to the inhibitory effect of diosgenin, dietary fiber, and phytosterols in MC on cholesterol absorption [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Besides, multiple reports have expounded the hypolipidemic activity of 
 <italic>Momordica</italic> saponin [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], MC ethanol extract [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and MC leaf extract [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. A clinical RCT also confirms the improvement of dyslipidemia by bitter melon hot water extract [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. All of the above indicate that MC has antiatherosclerosis potential. In T2DM and related cardiovascular diseases, bitter melon extract enhances cardiac function and mitigates postischemic/reperfused infarct zone, which have correlation with reduced expression of caspase-3 in heart [
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. It is evidenced that MC can be used to treat diabetes-associated cardiac fibrosis because of its inhibitory capacity in fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis, which is mediated by suppressing TGF-
 <italic>Î²</italic>1/Smad pathway and activating Nrf2 [
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Polysaccharide from MC is discovered to have powerful angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory properties (94.1%) [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], pointing to its application in various cardiovascular complications. What is more, it is reported that nanoparticles of MC extract reduce blood viscosity in hyperglycemic individuals [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>] and water extract of MC has inhibitory properties in AGEs accumulation and oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], which are involved in controlling diabetic complications.
