<p>Although many research studies show that diverse MC preparations have no significant toxic effects [

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], there are quite a few reports illustrating the adverse effects of MC. Researchers discovered 
 <italic>α</italic>-momorcharin, a kind of ribosome-inactivating protein in the seeds of MC, and it stimulated the inflammatory response of human monocytes via activating the IKK/NF-
 <italic>ĸ</italic>B and JNK pathways, which increased the risk of acquiring inflammation-related diseases for using MC [
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Toxicological studies of MC on albino rats suggested that subcutaneous injection of MC ethanol extract caused abnormal breathing and heart rate after two hours, and MC juice led to acute poisoning symptoms such as acute convulsions, nervous disorders, jumping, and shortness of breath [

 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. The teratogenicity and cardiotoxicity of MC fruit and seed extracts have been characterized in zebrafish embryos [
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. In female Wistar rats, leaf extracts of MC, oral intake for 30 days, brought about a significant decrease in estrogen and progesterone levels, showing a dose-dependent antifertility effect [
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. However, in male mice, intraperitoneal administration of MC seed extracts displayed an antispermatogenic effect after 48 days [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Therefore, MC application should be recommended with caution, especially for the diabetics who are planning to be or have been pregnant.
