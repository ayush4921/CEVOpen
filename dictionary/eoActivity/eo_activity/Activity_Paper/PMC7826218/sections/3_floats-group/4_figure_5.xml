  <p>Mechanisms of MC in antioxidation. MC agents exhibit extraordinary O
   <sup>2−</sup>, HO·, DPPH, and other free radicals scavenging activity to lighten oxidative stress, resulting in the less production of MDA, AGEs, and CML. MC agents also increase the content of GSH, SOD, and CAT by activating HO-1/Nrf2 pathway. Besides, MC agents have FRAP and capability of ameliorating endoplasmic reticulum stress.
