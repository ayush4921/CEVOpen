<p>The ABST scavenging activity of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> and 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> extracts inhibit ABTS [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The results showed that IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are 0.71 ± 0.02, 0.93 ± 0.06 and 0.62 ± 0.12 mg/mL, respectively, and ascorbic acid were 0.033 ± 0.001, after assessing the antioxidant activity of all plants, the result shown that the extract of 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> significantly (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) is the finest effect. This result agrees with this reported that ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic> had great antioxidant activity.[

 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Although the effect of antioxidant tests on the DPPH and ABTS methods of the three plants will provide different results. In order that it may be due to the rapidity electron transfer during reactions and the phytochemical composition of plants with different antioxidant effects or from other factors, for example, light protection, reaction quality, cleaning, etc.
