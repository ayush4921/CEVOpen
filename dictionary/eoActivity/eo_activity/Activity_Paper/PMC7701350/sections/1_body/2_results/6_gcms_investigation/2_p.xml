<p id="p0165">GC-MS analysis showed many compounds but nitrogen containing compounds are important. 
 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> shows the list of compounds identified. Some of the important compounds containing nitrogen gives the indication of presence of various groups of alkaloids like 2-Ethoxy-3-methylpyrazine, Butanoic acid, 4-hydroximino-4-(2-thienyl)-, methyl ester, 3-Aminocrotononitrile, 2-Methoxy-6-methylpyrimidine 1-oxide, 2,5-Diaminobenzoic acid, 1H-Imidazole-2-carboxylic acid, 2-Mercapto-1,3,5-triazole, Piperidin-4-carboxylic acid, Pyrrolidine, 1-(2-chloroethyl, Pent-3-yn-2-ol, 2-cyclopropyl-5-(1-piperidyl), and 2-Propenal, 2-(diethylamino)-3-(dimethylamino). The chromatograph also showed the presence salicylate compound 2-Ethylhexyl salicylate. The salicylate compound may also have contributed towards the bioactivity Table
