<p id="p0110">The effect of extract of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> fruit (ZAF) and isolated alkaloids (ZAFA) was investigated for writhing response in mice and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. It was found that both ZAF and ZAFA caused a dose-dependent inhibition on the writhing response in 10 min time. The pain was more significantly reduced by ZAF 300 mg/kg dose (40.99%, p &gt; 0.05) and 100 mg/kg of ZAFA (45.91%, p &gt; 0.001) and this result was similar to the standard drug Paracetamol (46.33%).
