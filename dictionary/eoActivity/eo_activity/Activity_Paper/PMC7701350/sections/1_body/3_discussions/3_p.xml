<p id="p0175">Brewer's yeast is used of induction of fever mainly contain protein which is associated with fever development. It may occur due to the production of inflammatory cytokines in the inflammatory reaction. Paracetamol is used for the treatment of fever decrease the levels of prostaglandins hence antipyretic messages in the brain. Effect of methanol extract of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> fruit (ZAF) and isolated total alkaloid fraction (ZAFA) on pyrexia induced body temperature in mice was tested. The subcutaneous injection of 10 ml kg
 <sup>−1</sup> of 15% w/v of yeast suspension markedly elevated the rectal temperature after 19 h of administration. It was found that ZAF and ZAFA effect was significant (p &lt; 0.01, p &lt; 0.001 respectively) in lowering of rectal temperature in mice after 5 h and these result were comparable to Paracetamol. The sample ZAFA (100 mg/kg) showed a similar pattern of pyrexia control as shown by standard drug and temperature was started reducing from 1st h. The maximum effect of ZAL was with 300 mg/kg dose and was significant (p &lt; 0.01) and ZALA showed significant results (p &lt; 0.001) at 100 mg/kg dose and were equipotent with Paracetamol used as standard drug. It was found that ZAB and ZABA at all doses caused less significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction of body temperature in mice as compared to ZAF and ZAL. The root extract and crude alkaloids showed that there was no significant change in pyrexia during the study period from any of the sample used as compared with the standard drug Paracetamol.
