<p id="p0185">The writhing response to acute nociception has been used to test the analgesic activity of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> in mice. In the writhing test, intraperitoneal injection of 1% acetic acid markedly caused in writhing reflex in untreated control group. It was found that both ZAF and ZAFA caused a dose-dependent inhibition on the writhing response induced by acetic acid in 10 min time. The pain was more significantly reduced by ZAF (p &gt; 0.05) and ZAFA (p &gt; 0.001) and this result was similar to the standard drug Paracetamol. The effect of ZAL, ZAR, ZALA, and ZARA from 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> on writhing response in mice showed no significant effect in relieving the pain. Similarly, from bark extract, both ZAB and ZABA caused a significant inhibition of writhing in mice (p &gt; 0.05) and (p &gt; 0.001) dose-dependent inhibition on the writhing response induced by acetic acid. 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> is a well-known traditional spice used as condiments and medicine and has been employed to manage pain in stomach, toothache, and pain of sickle cell disease (
