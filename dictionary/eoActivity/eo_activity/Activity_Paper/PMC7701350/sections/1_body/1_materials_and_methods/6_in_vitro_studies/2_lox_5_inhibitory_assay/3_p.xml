<p id="p0065">Inhibition studies of various concentrations of plant crude alkaloid (1000, 500, 250, 125 and 62.5 μg/ml) as well as reference compound viz., quercitrin (10, 50 and 100 μg/ml) was checked at 234 nm through UV-VIS spectrophotometer. A mixture was made composed of 160 ml of 100 mM Na3PO4 buffer with pH 8.0, 10 μl of extract solution and 20 μl of soybean LOX solution (167 U/ml). This mixture was placed for incubation at 25 °C for 10 min. The reaction was then originated by adding of 10 μl of the substrate (sodium linoleic acid solution). The enzymatic conversion of sodium linoleic acid to form (9Z, 11E) (13S)-13-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9, 11-dienoate was determined by observing the change of absorbance at 234 nm over a period of 6 min using UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The negative control was prepared by replacing 10 μl samples with 2.47 ml mixture of Na3PO4 buffer (5 ml) and DMSO (25 μl) into the quartz. All the reactions were carried out in triplicates. The percentage of inhibition was calculated. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was determined by graphical method (
