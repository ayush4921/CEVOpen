<p>The ABTS scavenging capacity was assessed employing the ABTS
 <sup>+●</sup> free-radical fading assay [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To proceed, we induced the production of ABTS
 <sup>+●</sup> radical cations by the mixing aqueous solution of ABTS (7 mM) and potassium persulphate solution (2.45 mM). The upcoming mixture was incubated in dark at room temperature for twelve to sixteen hours prior to use. Distilled water was employed to dilute the solution in the objective of recording a turbidity of 0.700 ± 0.005 at 734 nm. Later on, 30 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of each plant extract was stirred up with 3 mL of ABTS
 <sup>+●</sup> radical solution and, then, was left for 6 minutes at ambient temperature. Consequently, the turbidity at 734 nm was measured. A standard plot was constructed employing Trolox. The total antioxidants were depicted as 
 <italic>µ</italic>mol trolox equivalents per gram dry weight plant material.
