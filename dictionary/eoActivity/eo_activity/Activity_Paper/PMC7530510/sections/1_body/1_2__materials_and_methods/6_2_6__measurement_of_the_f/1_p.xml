<p>The method of Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was implemented to estimate the flavonoid amount. To start, four milliliter of distilled water was stirred with 1 mL of plant extract. Then, 0.3 mL sodium nitrite solution (5%) was added, followed by 0.3 mL of aluminium chloride solution (10%). Test tubes were incubated for 5 min at ambient temperature, and after that, 2 mL of sodium hydroxide (1 M) was stirred within the mixture. Test tubes were filled up to 10 mL using distilled water and, then, vortexed thoroughly, and the turbidity was read along with the blank at 
 <italic>λ</italic> = 510 nm. Total flavonoid contents were presented as 
 <italic>g</italic> of rutin equivalent per 100 grams dry weight (g RE.100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW) through the calibration plot with Rutin.
