<p>In the current study, coriander, celery, and parsley hydromethanolic extracts evidenced a large (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) protective effect against AAPH-induced oxidative hemolysis (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Among plant extracts, parsley exhibited the highest protective effect (HT
 <sub>50</sub> = 273.64 min) and celery recorded the lowest effect (HT
 <sub>50</sub> = 194.71 min). All extracts displayed high HT
 <sub>50</sub> values compared to the AAPH incubated alone with blood (HT
 <sub>50</sub> = 71.34 min). Moreover, plants extracts showed a tremendous protective effect more than the trolox (HT
 <sub>50</sub> = 157.54 min) being the reference antioxidant.
