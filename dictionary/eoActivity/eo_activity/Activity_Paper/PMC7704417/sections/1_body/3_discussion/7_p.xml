<p id="par0190">Antioxidant and free radical scavenging activity studies of plants and plant products are essential to investigate their role against toxic effects of free radicals in biological systems. Free radicals readily bind and oxidize biomolecules, including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, resulting in tissue damage, cellular death, and various diseases including inflammation and cancer [

 <italic>C. rubens</italic> leaves have been screened for its DPPH radical scavenging, reducing power and total antioxidant properties [
