<p id="par0210">It can therefore be concluded that 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic> leaf contains a wide range of secondary metabolites, which could be responsible for the reduction of gold ions to AuNPs, and thus responsible for the biological synthesis of AuNPs. This further reveals the use of AECR-mediated AuNPs as a potential anticancer agent. 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are underway to provide more information on the targeted anticancer potential of AECR-AuNPs and the mechanism of action of this tool.
