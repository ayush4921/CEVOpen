<p id="par0035">Synthesis of AuNPs using medicinal plant extracts has several advantages over other biological methods (enzymatic and microbial synthesis), in that it is easy to handle, does not require culturing, and can produce large amounts of stable nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several plants and plant products have reportedly been used for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. These include: synthesis of silver nanoparticles using aqueous extracts of dried powders of
