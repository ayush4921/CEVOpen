<p id="par0170">In BNL CL.2 cells, APAP-induced cell death was significantly reduced when cells were pretreated with GMSYS. These results imply that GMSYS pretreatment had a protective effect against APAP-induced liver damage. Therefore, we used APAP-induced liver injury mice model to verify the hepatoprotective effect of GMSYS
