 </xref> In our study, pre-administration of GMSYS at a dose of 1400 mg/kg/day increased HO-1 protein expression, indicating that HO-1 upregulation by GMSYS protected the liver against injury from APAP-induced oxidative stress. Additionally, our histopathology results indicated that inflammatory cell infiltration and severe necrosis were markedly decreased in the livers of GMSYS 1400 mg/kg/day-treated mice.
