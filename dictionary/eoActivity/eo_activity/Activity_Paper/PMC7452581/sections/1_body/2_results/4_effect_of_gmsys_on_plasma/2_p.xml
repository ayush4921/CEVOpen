 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and Supplementary data 1, the activities of ALT (9674.60 ± 369.65 mU/mL, 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a) and AST (3002.73 ± 114.69 mU/mL, 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b) in plasma were significantly increased after APAP injection (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). In contrast, administration with GMSYS at a dose of 1400 mg/kg/day significantly inhibited the activities of ALT (1147.24 ± 401.82 mU/mL) and AST (238.00 ± 70.98 mU/mL) in plasma in APAP-treated mice (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The plasma level of ALT in the GMSYS 700 + APAP group (9880.03 ± 807.05 mU/mL) was not different compared to that in the APAP group (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a). Treatment with GMSYS at a dose of 700 mg/kg/day (1930.27 ± 79.74 mU/mL) caused a significant inhibition of AST activity in plasma compared to that in the APAP-treated mice (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), but still remained at a high level of AST. Administration with silymarin at a dose of 200 mg/kg/day suppressed the activities of plasma ALT (1514.98 ± 738.74 mU/mL) and AST (126.98 ± 32.16 mU/mL) in APAP-treated mice (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Administration of silymarin alone or 1400 mg/kg/day GMSYS alone did not significantly affect the activities of plasma ALT and AST compared to those in the control group.
