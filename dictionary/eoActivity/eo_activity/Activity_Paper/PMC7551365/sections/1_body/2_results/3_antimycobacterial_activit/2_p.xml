<p id="p0090">To test whether fractionation of 
 <italic>A. pluriseta</italic> could lead to improved antimycobacterial activity, as well as determine the MIC of different fractions, we used the BACTEC MGIT 960 system. If the GU of the extract fraction-containing tubes was greater than 100 when the GU of the growth control was 400, we defined the results as non-responsive. However, if the GU values of the extract fraction-containing tubes were ≤100, the results were considered susceptible, and the concentration of that tube was used to define the MIC [

Our results revealed the most robust activity against MTB by more polar ethyl acetate (EA) fraction (MIC 6.25 μg/mL) followed by methanolic (MeOH) fraction (12.5 μg/mL). The less polar dichloromethane (DCM) and petroleum ether (PE) fractions had a MIC of 25 μg/mL, with DCM fraction inhibiting MTB growth in a dose-dependent manner (

 <italic>A. pluriseta</italic> fractionation would lead to robust antitubercular activity, and at a lower concentration. Further, the results are in agreement with other studies that have reported polar solvent extract fractions usually have higher activity than less polar fractions [
