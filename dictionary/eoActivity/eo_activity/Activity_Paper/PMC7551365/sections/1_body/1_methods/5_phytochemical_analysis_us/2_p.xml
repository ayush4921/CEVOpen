<p id="p0065">We performed a preliminary screening for the presence of various phytochemicals such as alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics such as flavonoids, and anthraquinones qualitatively as previously reported by us and others [

An aliquot of the methanolic fraction (1.3 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL dichloromethane and analyzed with an Agilent Technologies 7890A gas chromatography coupled with a 5975C mass spectrometer in full scan mode (EI, 70 eV, Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). The system was equipped with an HP-5 MS low bleed capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness (J&amp;W, Folsom, CA, USA)). An injection volume of 1 μL was subjected to a splitless mode during analysis, with helium used as the carrier medium at a constant flow rate of 1.25 mL/min. The oven temperature was maintained at 35 °C for 5 min, then programmed to increase at 10 °C/min to 280 °C and held at this temperature for 10.5 min. The obtained compound profiles were identified by comparing the corresponding reference retention indices and mass spectral in databases (NIST 05, NIST 08, Adams, and chemical).
