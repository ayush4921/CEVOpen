<p id="p0030">In this study, we used 
 <italic>Aspilia pluriseta</italic> Schweinf. (
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic>) to investigate its potential antimicrobial activity and characterize the phytochemicals responsible for the bioactivity. 
 <italic>A. pluriseta</italic> is locally known as Muuti (in Mbeere, Embu, and Kikuyu), Wuti (in Kamba), Ol-oiyabase (in Maasai), and Shilambila (in Luhya) communities of Kenya [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This plant is widely spread in East, Central, and Southern Africa, especially in open woodlands and grasslands [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In East Africa (especially Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda), the plant has been documented to manage and treat cough, stomach infections, burns, bruises, lacerations, wounds, pimples, ears-, eye-, nose infections, kwashiorkor, fever, worms, and diabetes mellitus with little or no scientific validation [

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. There are reports on antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], molluscicidal activity [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], complement modulating activity [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], antihelmintic activity [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], antimalarial, and hypoglycaemic activities [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] of 
 <italic>A. pluriseta</italic>. However, the scientific evidence of its pharmacological activity against medically important bacteria, especially MTB, is at its early stages. As part of our continuous research efforts to discover novel, potent, antitubercular agents from Kenyans ethnobotanicals, in this study we describe the antitubercular activity of 
 <italic>A. pluriseta</italic> solvent extract fractions. Our findings demonstrate that 
 <italic>A. pluriseta</italic> extract fractions (especially ethyl acetate and methanolic fractions) have remarkable selective antitubercular activity, which is partly if not exclusively associated with phytochemicals such as terpenoids, phenolics, alkaloids, fatty acid alkyl esters detected in the extract fractions.
