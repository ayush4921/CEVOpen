    "<i>Aspilia pluriseta</i> is associated with various bioactivities, although with limited scientific justification. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity, and characterized the phytochemicals of root extracts of <i>A. pluriseta</i> aimed at validating its therapeutic potential. We used BACTEC MGIT™ 960 system to test for antitubercular activity, disc-diffusion together with the microdilution method to evaluate antimicrobial activities and qualitative phytochemical tests together with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to determine the phytochemicals that associated with <i>A. pluriseta</i> extracts activity. We show that methanolic crude extract (at 1 g/mL) had high <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (MTB) inhibitory activity (0 growth unit) and considerable potency against <i>Escherichia coli</i> (11.7 mm), <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (9.0 mm), and <i>Candida albicans</i> (7.7 mm). All the extract fractions exerted remarkable antimycobacterial activities with minimum inhibitory activity of between 6.26 - 25 μg/mL. The highest antimicrobial activity of petroleum ether and dichloromethane fraction was against <i>E. coli</i> at inhibition zone diameters of 8.3 mm, and 8.0 mm, respectively, while ethyl acetate fraction was against <i>S. aureus</i> with an inhibition zone of 8.7 mm. Methanolic fraction exhibited broad-spectrum activity against 87.5% of the tested microbes (inhibition zones 6.3-8.3 mm). Furthermore, we qualitatively detected terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolics such as flavonoids, and anthraquinones in extract fractions. GC-MS analysis detected an abundance of fatty acid esters, 2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethyl ester-hexadecanoic acid, and 2,3-dihydroxy propyl ester-octadecanoic acid and four alkanes. Taken together, we show that <i>A. pluriseta</i> extract fractions (especially ethyl acetate and methanolic fractions) have strong selective antitubercular activity, and thus, we scientifically validate the use of <i>A. pluriseta</i> as a potential source for the discovery of novel antitubercular agents."
