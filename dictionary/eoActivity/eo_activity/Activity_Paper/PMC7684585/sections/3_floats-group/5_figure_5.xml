  <p>SFE alleviated migration and adhesion in H1299 and HCT116 cells. H1299 (a) and HCT116 cells (b) were treated with SFE (0–500 μg/ml) for 24 hr, and migratory cells were quantified as % of control. H1299 (c) and HCT116 cells (d) suspended in media containing SFE (1,000 μg/ml) were plated into gelatin‐coated 96‐well plate, and after 2 hr, adherent cells were quantified as % of control. Different letters (a‐d) indicate significance (
