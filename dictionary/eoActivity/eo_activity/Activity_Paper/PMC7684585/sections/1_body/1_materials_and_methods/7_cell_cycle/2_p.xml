<p>H1299 and HCT116 cells at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well were starved for 24 hr in serum‐free media and then treated with SFE at 500 µg/ml (for H1299) or 1,000 μg/ml (for HCT116) in serum‐complete media for 72 hr. Cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and fixed with 70% of methanol. Cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml RNase and 50 μg/ml PI for 30 min at 37°C. For each determination, 10,000 cells were counted, and cells at different phases such as sub‐G1, G1/G0, S, and G2/M were analyzed using flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).
