<p>Cells induce apoptosis by sensing different stress stimuli, including ROS. Mitochondria play an integral role in generating endogenous ROS by incomplete metabolism of consumed oxygen and electron leakage. Mitochondrial ROS induces sequential events, including collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and further activates intrinsic apoptotic signaling (Lowe &amp; Lin, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Increased production of intracellular ROS and disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity, therefore, are regarded as early events in mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis (Marchi et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). To determine whether SFE‐treated cells were subjected to intracellular ROS‐mediated mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis, intracellular ROS levels, and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured. The treatment of H1299 cells with SFE at 100, 500, and 1,000 μg/ml for 72 hr resulted in increased intracellular ROS levels and decreased MMP in a dose‐dependent manner (

 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) and other earlier time points (24 hr and 48 hr; data not shown). These results suggest that the type of apoptosis induced by SFE in H1299 cells is different to that in HCT116; the SFE‐induced apoptosis in H1299 cells is mitochondria‐mediated intrinsic while the SFE‐induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells is not mediated by intracellular ROS.
