<p>Stimulated growth is the most essential trait of cancer cells (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). To determine the growth‐inhibitory activities of SFE in human lung and colon cells, cell viability assay was performed. As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the treatment with SFE at 100, 500, and 1,000 μg/ml for 24–72 hr inhibited the growth of H1299 and HCT116 cells in a time‐ and dose‐dependent manner (

 <sub>50</sub> values of 260–305 μg/ml).
