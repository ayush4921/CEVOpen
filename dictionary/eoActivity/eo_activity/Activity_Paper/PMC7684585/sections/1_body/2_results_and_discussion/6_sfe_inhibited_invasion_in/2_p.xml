<p>Invasion is a process of cells grown in the primary tumor penetrating into surrounding stroma, which is a critical step of cancer metastasis (Hanahan &amp; Weinberg, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Matrix metalloproteinases, a family of zinc‐dependent endoproteases degrading various proteins in the extracellular matrix, act as major contributors in the invasion and further malignant progression during metastasis (Conlon &amp; Murray, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Treatment with SFE significantly inhibited invasion of H1299 (to 45%–47% of the control, at 500 μg/ml) and HCT116 cells (to 30%–68% of the control, at 100–500 μg/ml) in a Matrigel‐coated transwell assay (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4a,b</xref>). Concomitantly, SFE decreased levels of matrix metalloproteinase‐2, ‐7, ‐9, and ‐10 in H1299 cells (to 74%–90% of the control, at 500 μg/ml, Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Matrix metalloproteinase‐2 and −9 are categorized into gelatinases which major substrate are gelatin and type IV collagen. Matrix metalloproteinase‐7 is a membrane‐type matrilysin degrading fibronectin, laminin, type VI collagen, and gelatin. Matrix melloproteinase‐10 is a stromelysin with a broad range of substrates (Conlon &amp; Murray, 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Our results indicate that SFE possesses inhibitory activities against invasion, and such activities appear to be associated with suppressed levels different matrix metalloproteinases.
