<p>Total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of RSFE were 15.4 mg GAE/g and 43.2 mg QE/g, resp
 <bold>e</bold>ctively, which were similar to those of YSFE, 12.8 mg GAE/g and 48.1 mg QE equivalent/g, resp
 <bold>e</bold>ctively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The total polyphenol content of SFE found in our study was similar to those of snapdragon flowers reported previously (10–28 mg GAE/g) (Gonzalez‐Barrio et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and within the range of other edible flowers (Kaisoon et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>; Song et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The total flavonoid contents found in our study were much higher than those of snapdragon flowers reported previously (1–2 mg CE/g) (Gonzalez‐Barrio et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) but within the range of other edible flowers (11–68 mg rutin equivalent/g) (Kaisoon et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). The differences in the contents are likely due to different botanical origins, extraction protocols, and other experimental conditions used for different studies. RSFE contained significantly higher proanthocyanidin levels (312.6 mg CE/g) but lower total carotenoid levels (8.6 mg/g) than YSFE (182.3 mg CE/g and 243.6 mg/g, respectively). These results were consistent with previous reports showing that the flowers with distinct colors, especially red, purple, or blue, contain high amounts of anthocyanidins, while the flowers with pale colors, like yellow or white, contain low amounts of anthocyanidins but high amount of carotenoids (Garzon et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>; Vukics et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31924-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Our results indicated the richness of phytochemicals in SFE, which allowed us to further evaluate its potential cancer‐inhibitory activities.
