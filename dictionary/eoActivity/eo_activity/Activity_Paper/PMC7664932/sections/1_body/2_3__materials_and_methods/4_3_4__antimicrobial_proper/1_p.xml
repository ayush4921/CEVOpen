<p>The extracted EOs of the Saudi and Egyptian samples of 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> were tested against some pathogenic strains of bacteria according to the technique of agar diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>], as well as fungal strains using the spore suspension method [
 <xref rid="B74-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The tested bacterial strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. They included either Gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC23235, 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> ATCC19615, and 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> ATCC12228) or Gram-negative (
 <italic>S. typhi</italic> ATCC35664, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC25922, 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> spp. ATCC12040, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> ATCC15442) bacteria, while 
 <italic>T. shoenlenii</italic> ATCC22776 and 
 <italic>A. fumigatus</italic> ATCC13073 were the tested fungi.
