<p>The data of both allelopathic and antimicrobial activities were determined in triplicates, where they are subjected to ANOVA, followed by Duncanâ€™s test using CoStat software program (version 6.311, CoHort Software, Monterey, CA, USA). The significance of probability was adjusted at 0.05. Furthermore, the data of IC
