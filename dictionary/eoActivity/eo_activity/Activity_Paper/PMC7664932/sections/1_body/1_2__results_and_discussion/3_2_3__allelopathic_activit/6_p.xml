<p>Based on the IC
 <sub>50</sub> data, it was evident that EO from Egyptian ecospecies was more effective against the weed 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic> since the Egyptian sample had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 52.4, 51.1, and 49.5 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>, for the germination, seedling shoot growth, seedling root growth, respectively, while the Saudi sample attained IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 82.5, 166.0, and 114.9 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The influence of the EO from Egyptian ecospecies on the germination, seedling shoot growth, and seedling root growth of 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic> was ≈1.6, 3.2-, and 2.4-fold of Saudi ecospecies.
