<p>Out of the total identified mass of the Saudi sample, the oxygenated hydrocarbon represented by 5.47%, while the non-oxygenated hydrocarbon attained 1.60%. Methyl palmitate (2.86%) was found as major oxygenated hydrocarbons, while linoleic acid was characterized as a minor one. On the contrary, the hydrocarbons represented the second class rank in the EO of the Egyptian sample with a concentration of 31.96%. Oxygenated hydrocarbons (16.37%) were represented with six compounds, in which linoleic acid (6.36%) and oleic acid (3.51%) were found as main compounds.
