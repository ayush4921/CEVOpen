<p>Overall, it was evident that the EOs of both ecospecies had potent phytotoxic activity against the two tested weeds (
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic>), while the EO of the Egyptian ecospecies was more effective, particularly on the weed 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic>. Consistent with the present results, the EO from aboveground parts of 
 <italic>Pulicaria somalensis</italic> has been reported to have a stronger allelopathic effect on 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic> than 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> [
