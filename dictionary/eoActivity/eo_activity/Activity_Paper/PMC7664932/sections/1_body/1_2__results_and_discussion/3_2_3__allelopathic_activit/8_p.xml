<p>The inhibitory activity of the EOs from Egyptian 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> in the present study could be ascribed to the presence of oxygenated terpenoid compounds, particularly the major compounds such as phytol, 
 <italic>n</italic>-docosane, linoleic acid, 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentacosane, and bicyclogermacrene. However, the phytotoxicity of the Saudi 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> could be attributed to the content of major constituents such as hinesol, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate, 1,4-
 <italic>trans</italic>-1,7-
 <italic>cis</italic>-acorenone, phytol, and myristicin. The hinesol has been reported as an antitumor agent [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and an anti-gastric ulcer agent [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, no study dealt with the allelopathic/phytotoxic activity of this compound; thereby, further study is recommended to determine the allelopathic activity of this compound in a pure form and to assess its mode of action(s) and its biosafety as a bioherbicide. The EOs rich with 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate showed potential allelopathic activity [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The diterpene was considered as rare compounds in plants, while an oxygenated diterpenes phytol was reported here as a major compound in both Egyptian and Saudi ecospecies of 
 <italic>C. procera</italic>. The EO of 
 <italic>Euphorbia heterophylla</italic> has been reported as rich with phytol, whereas this EO exhibited an allelopathic activity on 
 <italic>Cenchrus echinatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].
