<p>There are many drugs available in the management of diabetes mellitus including insulin, Î±-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose), amylin analogs (pramlintide), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (alogliptan, linagliptan, saxagliptin, sitagliptin), incretin mimetics (albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide), meglitinides (nateglinide, repaglinide), non-sulfonylureas (metformin), sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide, glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, tolazamide, tolbutamide), SGLT-2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin), and thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone). Though several different types of antidiabetic agents are currently available, the side effects that are generally associated with oral anti-diabetic agents pose grave problems and challenges to tackle this disease efficaciously. Thus, extensive research for alternative but effective and safer therapeutic agents in ameliorating diabetic syndrome has become a critical field in the latest investigations [

Recently, aldose reductase inhibitors (alrestatin, benurestat, epalrestat, fidarestat, imirestat, lidorestat, minalrestat, ponalrestat, ranirestat, risarestat, sorbinil, tolrestat, zenarestat, and zopolrestat) have been claimed to be an appropriate strategy treatment of diabetic complications [

Additionally, aldose reductase has been found to catalyze the reduction of glucose to sorbitol in the polyol pathway, thereby it has been claimed to be associated with the development of diabetic nephropathy [

Hence, aldose reductase inhibitors can be seen as a potential avenue in the development of new pharmacological therapy in diabetes mellitus. Similarly, there has been a growing interest in antidiabetic agents from natural products, particularly those derived from traditional medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Traditional medicinal plants have always been a rich source of lead compounds and many of the currently available key drugs have been derived either directly or indirectly from them. Hence, the search for more effective and safer therapeutic agents in eradicating diabetic syndromes has continued to be an important area of investigation worldwide [

This review will provide preclinical evidence and elucidate the extent of the pharmacological activities of isoflavonoids, which could prove to be a potential clinical drug in the management of this detrimental disease.
