<p>Isoflavonoids have become an interesting phytoconstituent toward their production as dietary intake supplements for the purpose of health benefits due to their various favorable biological effects on human health. Several studies have reported that isoflavonoids may contribute multiple additional health benefits by reducing cardiovascular risk, osteoporosis, and decreasing the intensity of bone resorption [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reported that isoflavonoids had a structure resemblance with the Î²-estradiol and possessed affinity toward estrogen receptors. This further supports the association of isoflavonoids with anticancer effects against breast cancer and post-menopausal abnormality [
