<p>There are many in vivo and in vitro research studies that display, at physiologically-relevant concentrations (&lt;10 µM), a direct effect of genistein on β-cells. The effects seem to involve cAMP/PKA signaling and there are some studies that suggest an effect on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression [
