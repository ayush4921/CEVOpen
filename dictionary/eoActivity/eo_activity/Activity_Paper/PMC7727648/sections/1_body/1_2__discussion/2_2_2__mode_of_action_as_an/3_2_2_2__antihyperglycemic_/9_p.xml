<p>It is known that peripheral insulin resistance is common during obesity and aging in mice and people. The progression to T2DM is largely due to loss of β-cell mass and function through apoptosis [

 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] further evaluated whether genistein could prevent β-cell loss in T2DM mice. Hence, the effect of dietary supplementation of genistein on glycemic control and β-cell mass and function was determined. Dietary intake of genistein (250 mg/kg diet) improved hyperglycemia, glucose tolerance, and blood insulin level in obese diabetic mice, whereas it did not affect body weight gain, food intake, fat deposit, plasma lipid profile, and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Genistein was found to increase the number of insulin-positive β-cells in islets, promoted islet β-cell survival, and preserved islet mass. In conclusion, it was suggested that dietary intake of genistein could prevent T2DM via a direct protective action on β-cell without alteration of periphery insulin sensitivity.
