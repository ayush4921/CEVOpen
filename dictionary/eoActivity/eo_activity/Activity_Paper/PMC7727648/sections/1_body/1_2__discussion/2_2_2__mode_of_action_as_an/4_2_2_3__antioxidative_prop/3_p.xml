<p>Furthermore, Cheng et al. [

 <xref rid="B114-molecules-25-05491" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>] reported that genistein showed antioxidant enzyme activity and controlled the blood glucose homeostasis and lipid profile in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Meanwhile, a metabolite of daidzein, specifically equol, has been reported to exert a suppressive effect against alloxan-induced oxidative stress in INS-1 pancreatic Î²-cells [
