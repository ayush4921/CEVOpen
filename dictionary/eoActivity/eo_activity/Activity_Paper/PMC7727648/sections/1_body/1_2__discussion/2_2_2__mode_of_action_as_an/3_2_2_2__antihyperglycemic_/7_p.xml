<p>Apart from that, genistein plays an important role in regulating the glucose level in blood as well as induces insulinotropic action viz. stimulating or affecting the production and activity of insulin (an insulinotropic hormone). In fact, genistein exhibited significant glucose consumption-augmenting effects in IR-HepG2 cells [
