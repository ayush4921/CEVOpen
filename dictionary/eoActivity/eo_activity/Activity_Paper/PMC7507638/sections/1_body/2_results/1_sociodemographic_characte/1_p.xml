<p id="Par41">The recipes were provided by seventy-three (73) informants, fifty-one (51) market herbalists and twenty-two (22) traditional healers with an average age of 52 ± 14.65 years. All the traditional healers were men and the market herbalists were women. The average ages of traditional healers and herbalists were 53.54 ± 14.79 years and 51.31 ± 14.63 years respectively, with 40 to 60 years as predominant age group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The majority (90%) of informants were experienced in this activity for at least ten years. And more than half of them (63%) had more than twenty years’ experience (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) but traditional healers seem to be less experienced than market herbalists. Two thirds (67%) of the responders were out of school. However, the traditional healers sub-group has more educated people than the market herbalists (Fig.
