<p>Numerous signaling pathways are mainly involved in T-cell activation and the expression and proliferation of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2 and IFN-γ. IL-2 plays an important role in early T lymphocyte clonal diversity and development. Important transcription factors, such as AP-1, NF-AT, and NF-κB, are mainly involved in IL-2 production in T-cells [

Oxidant-mediated tissue injury is a specific hazard to the immune response, and is closely related to ROS generation, leading to a reduction in the antioxidant defense system. Meanwhile, oxidative stress-mediated tissue injury is associated with immune shortages, resulting in decreased levels of total lymphocytes, IL-2 production, and T-cell subsets [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> water extracts significantly enhanced the production of IL-2 and IFN-γ cytokines in activated T-cells and splenocytes, and elevated the NF-AT transcriptional activity of EL-4 T-cells, but no changes were observed in the NF-κB promoter. Therefore, the strong antioxidant effects of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> could synergistically contribute to its immune enhancing and/or modulating effect, by regulating the IL-2 concentration, total lymphocyte count, and T-cell activation [
