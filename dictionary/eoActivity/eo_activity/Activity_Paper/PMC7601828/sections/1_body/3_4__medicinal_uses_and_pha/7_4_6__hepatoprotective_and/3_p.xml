<p>Recently, Birhanu et al. reported that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg) administration orally daily for 14 days triggered an increase in spleen cells in mice. In addition, T-cell phenotypic investigation indicated that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic>-treated groups showed higher CD8a+, CD11b, and CD3+ T-cell expression, and the significant suppression of inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the IgG super-family was significant downregulated in a concentration dependent manner by 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> administration of 4.5%, up to 43.7% [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> plant extracts suggests a T-cell-mediated immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effect on the immune system.
