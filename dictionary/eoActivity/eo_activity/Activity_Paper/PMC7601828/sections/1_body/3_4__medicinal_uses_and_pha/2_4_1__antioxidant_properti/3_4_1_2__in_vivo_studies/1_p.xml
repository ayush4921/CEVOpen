<p>In a thioacetamide-treated rat model, 50 mg/kg daily of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> administration for six weeks significantly decreased the hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) content and significantly increased the glutathione (GSH) content, as well as ameliorated the catalase (CAT) and SOD activity in thioacetamide-treated rats. As such, the resultant research data suggested that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> intensely prevented hepatic fibrosis by inhibiting thioacetamide-induced oxidative damage [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts on streptozotocin-induced oxidative stress was assessed through measuring antioxidant enzyme activity in the kidneys of diabetic rats. The administration of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> extracts of 25 mg/kg for four weeks significantly reduction in the MDA level and prompted significant enhancements in GSH, CAT, and SOD activities in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> on high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice by evaluating the level of MDA, and the oxidized GSH, SOD, and GSH contents, respectively. Treatment with ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> at 20 and 50 mg/kg significantly decreased the MDA level, and enhanced the level of SOD activity and GSH content in both liver and brain tissues. The study proven that 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> worked as a cellular antioxidant potential through inhibiting the formation of lipid peroxidation in high-fat diet-induced diabetic mice [

 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> in a 100-mg/kg oral administration inhibited cadmium-induced hippocampus oxidative damage in Wistar rats, by regulating lipid peroxidation and the activities of CAT, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) [
 <xref rid="B15-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Similar studies have indicated that oral treatment with 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> 100 mg/kg daily for 12 weeks inhibited the hypothyroidism-induced lessening of antioxidant enzymes, including SOD1, CAT, and GPx, as well as reduced the oxidative stress, as evaluated by lipid peroxidation levels in the hippocampus of the rat model [
 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In a mercury-injected rat model, the oral administration of leaf extract of 100 mg/kg of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> for four weeks significantly attenuated hippocampus oxidative stress by regulating the activities of SOD1, CAT, GPx, and GST, as compared with in the untreated mercury-injected group [
 <xref rid="B24-antioxidants-09-00962" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results recommend that various parts of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> potentially ameliorate neurotoxin-induced oxidative damage in the hippocampus via the induction of antioxidant enzymes. In a clinical trial of 60 healthy subjects, Seo et al. reported that subjects who intake the tablets containing 300 mg 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> leaf extracts daily for 60 days had significantly decreased serum levels of mercury, MDA, and cadmium and significant increase in SOD1 activity. The findings of their study demonstrated that chronic consumption of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> leaf extract can help to protects the antioxidant defense system in humans and excretion of mercury and cadmium from serum [
