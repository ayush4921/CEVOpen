 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> plant parts have been consumed in various quantities and forms by numerous populations around the world for a long period, and no toxicity has been reported. The major edible parts of 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> spp., are the leaves, which produce edible flour that is used in manufacturing cosmetics, and which is used to development of food products. In addition, recent pharmacological studies primarily focused on six 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> spp., namely 
 <italic>D. morbifera, D. gonatopodus, D. Dentiger, D. capillaris</italic>, 
 <italic>D. chevalieri,</italic> and 
 <italic>D. arboreus.</italic> Among these species, only one to date has achieved broad medicinal applications, including treating infectious microbial diseases, asthma, and inflammatory disorders. The in vitro and in vivo biological screening of 
 <italic>D. morbifera</italic> revealed this species to be a promising source of a broad-spectrum of bioactivities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects. Particularly, the extracts to date have showed less to moderate cytotoxic activity. 
 <italic>Dendropanax</italic> plant species contain more than 259 bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins, pyrimidines, essential oils, terpenoids, phenol carboxylic acids, and alkaloids were identified. Moreover, economic and commercial importance of these plant phytochemicals had proven to be suitable for cosmetics, food industries, agricultural, pharmaceutical applications.
