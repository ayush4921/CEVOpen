<p>Several other parts of the 
 <italic>D. morbiferus</italic> plant including the edible leaf, bark, seeds, stems, and roots have been recognized as alternative, folkloric medicine and food additives and registered with Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, Korea Food and Drug Administration (foodsafetykorea.go.kr). Many scientific reports have previously highlighted the antioxidant, nephroprotective, antidiabetic, and anticarcinogenic activities of this plant species [

 <italic>D. morbiferus</italic> leaves have also been reported to potentially improve hippocampal function and alleviated endogenous antioxidant levels in mercury-induced neurotoxic rats [

 <italic>D. morbiferus</italic> has potentially restored behavioral deficits and significantly diminished neuro-inflammatoryâ€“mediated activation in microglia, induced in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxic C57Bl/6N mice [
