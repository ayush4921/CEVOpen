<p>Becker et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-04435" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] evaluated in vitro antiplasmodial activities of 
 <italic>D. anomala</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>Gerrardii</italic> extract. Phytochemicals such as eudesmanolide and dehydrobrachylaenolide were isolated and used in the in vitro parasite lactate dehydrogenase assay against plasmodium falciparum (p. falciparum). Dehydrobrachylaenolide demonstrated anti-malarial activities against plasmodium falciparum. Furthermore, 
 <italic>D. anomala</italic> has anticancer properties that have motivated the researchers to focus on the field of biomedicine. Shafiq et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-04435" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] evaluated the in vitro antiproliferative effects of silver nanoparticles synthesized from the roots of 
 <italic>D. anomala</italic> Sond. against MCF-7 breast cancer cells and NF54 parasitic strains. The study revealed that silver nanoparticles conjugated sesquiterpene have antiparasitic activities against NF54 
 <italic>p. falciparum</italic> strain, and it exhibited anticancer properties by inducing oxidative damage in breast cancer cells. Asita and colleagues evaluated the modulation of 
 <italic>D. anomala</italic> and Cyclophosphamide (CP) in mutagen induced genotoxicity [
