<p>The risk factors associated with cancers are divided into two categories based on their biological nature and modifiability. These are intrinsic and non-intrinsic risk factors. Intrinsic risk factors are simply random errors, which occur during DNA replication. Non-intrinsic risk factors are furthermore divided into endogenous and exogenous risk factors. Endogenous factors include gender, biological aging, genetic susceptibility, hormones, growth factors, and inflammation. While exogenous factors include radiation, chemical carcinogens, tumor-causing viruses, bad lifestyles such as smoking, alcohol consumption, nutrition imbalance, and lack of exercise [

However, it has been estimated that 50â€“60% of people living with cancer in the United States utilize plant-derived agents as an alternative therapy. These plants derived agents may be administered alone or simultaneously with other therapies such as chemo or radiotherapy [
