  <p>Effects of cashew nuts on 5-LOX and Cox-2 expressions. The inhibition of the biosynthesis of inflammatory mediators through the modulation of the activities of 5-LOX and/or Cox-2 considered as a promising approach to treat inflammatory diseases. For these reason we investigated the effect of cashew nuts treatment by Western blots on both enzymes. We found a significant increase after CAR injection, compared to sham, that was significantly decreased in 5-LOX as well as in Cox-2 expression. Representative western blot for Cox-2 (
   <bold>A</bold>) and LOX-5 (
   <bold>B</bold>) and respectively densitometric analysis (
   <bold>A1</bold>,
   <bold>B1</bold>). See materials and methods for further details. #
