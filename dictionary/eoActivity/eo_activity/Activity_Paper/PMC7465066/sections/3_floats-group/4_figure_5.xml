  <p>Anti-oxidant effects of cashew nuts after CAR-induction. Oxidative stress is a major component of acute inflammatory condition. First line of defense against free radical production (
   <bold>A</bold>) is represented by SOD (
   <bold>B</bold>), CAT (
   <bold>C</bold>), and GSH (
   <bold>D</bold>). Administration of cashew nuts at the dose of 100 mg/kg significantly increased the activity of the anti-oxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GSH which had been significantly reduced by carrageenan injection. SOD (
   <bold>A</bold>), CAT (
   <bold>B</bold>), and GSH (
   <bold>C</bold>). See materials and methods for further details. #
