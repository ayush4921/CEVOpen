The changes that happen during acute inflammatory event have physiologically functions in controlling infection and restoring tissue to its normal state. The acute inflammatory state is generally composed of four sub-events distinctly into: (1) Exudation of fluid that helps deliver plasma proteins to sites of damage; (2) infiltration of neutrophils that leads to remove pathogens and cellular fragments; (3) vasodilation that the delivery of necessary proteins and cells (like exudation) and increasing tissue temperature; (4) pain and loss of function help to enforce rest and lower the risk of further tissue damage [
