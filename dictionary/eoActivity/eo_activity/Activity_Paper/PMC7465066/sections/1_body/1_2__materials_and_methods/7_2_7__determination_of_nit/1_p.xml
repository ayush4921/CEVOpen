<p>Levels of nitrite/nitrate production in the paw tissue were determined as previously described by Costantino et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Briefly, at the end of experiment, paws were cut and centrifuged to recover a sample of the edematous fluid. Blood was separated from the fluid sample and nitrite + nitrate (NOx) production, an indicator of NO synthesis, was measured [
