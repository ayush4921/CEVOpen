<p>Western blot examination on cytosolic fraction of the paw tissue was prepared as previously described [
 <xref rid="B59-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Membranes were incubated with anti-5-LOX (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), anti-Cox-2 (1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), and Î²-actin (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) for the standardization. Signals were identified with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system reagent and the relative expression of the protein bands was measured by densitometry with BIORAD ChemiDocTM XRS+software (Bio-rad, Milan, Italy). A representation of blot signals were imported to analysis software (Image Quant TL, v2003).
