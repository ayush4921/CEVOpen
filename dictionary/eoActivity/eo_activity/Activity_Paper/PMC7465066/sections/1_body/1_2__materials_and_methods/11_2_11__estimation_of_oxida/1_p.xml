<p>At the end of the experiment, through the dichlorodihydrofluoresceindiacetate (H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA) staining method we measured the intracellular oxidant levels as previously described [

 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-00660" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Briefly, we dissolved H
 <sub>2</sub>DCFDA probes (Invitrogen Corporation; Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a solution of ethanol with a final concentration of 12.5 mM and we kept it at −80 °C in the dark. Before use, the solution was diluted with potassium phosphate buffer with a final concentration of 125 μM. To obtain the fluorescence reactions, 96-well black microplates were loaded with potassium phosphate buffer to a concentration of 152 μM/well. Then 8 μL diluted tissue homogenate and 40 μL (152 μM dye) were added to get a final concentration of 25 μM. The variation in fluorescence intensity was monitored every 5 min for 30 min with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 485 nm and 538 nm [
