However, there is a lack of in-depth study on the mechanism of action of PQR monomeric compounds, and the mechanism of PQR in animals is not comprehensive enough. Future scholars should combine the biological activity research and clinical application research of PQR to explore the material basis of its therapeutic effect. At the same time, the clinical optimal effective dose and safe dose of PQR also need to be investigated.</p>
