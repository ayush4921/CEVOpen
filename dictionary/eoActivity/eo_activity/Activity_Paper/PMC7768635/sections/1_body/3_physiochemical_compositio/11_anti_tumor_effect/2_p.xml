<p>Inflammation or excessive intake of animal fat are often risk factors for colorectal cancer. The preventive effect of PQR on cancer is related to the reduction of damaged amino acid, organic acid, fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism. The metabolites that PQR can significantly change include arachidonic acid, linolenic acid, glutamic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, tryptophan and fructose, all of which are related to inflammation and oxidation (

Oral administration of PQR could significantly inhibit the increase of IL-1 α, IL-1 β, IL-6, G-CSF, GM-CSF and other inflammatory cytokines in inflammatory mice, and inhibit the obvious changes of intestinal microbial community to prevent colorectal cancer (
