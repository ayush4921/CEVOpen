<p>It is understood that polysaccharides in PQR could stimulate the immune system. PQR polysaccharide is a weaker immune stimulant than lipopolysaccharide, which has the characteristics of immune regulation. Its main action pathway is to promote cell proliferation and regulate the expression of proinflammatory mediators IFN-g, IL-23A, IL-6, TNF - α, MCP-1 and GM-CSF. Stimulation of NOS2 gene expression leads to increased levels of iNOS and downstream the level of NO. Furthermore, studies have shown that its immunoregulatory effects are also related to MAPK (ERK-1/2), PI3K, P38 and NF-κB pathways. And PQR could also be used as an adjuvant or as a nutritional drug, or in combination with other therapies (

The health tea containing PQR and PQR polysaccharide can significantly improve the spleen, thymus index and T lymphocyte proliferation ability of immune mice, and improve the NK cell activity and hemolytic activity to improve the immune ability of mice. In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase) which inhibit oxidative stress are also one of the functions of enhancing immune function (

A new protein (AGNP) isolated from Panaxanthus quinquefolium can also significantly increase the phagocytosis of macrophages, promote the production of nitric oxide, promote the inactivation of TNF-α and the production of IL-6 to play an immunomodulatory role (
