<p>Studies have shown that PQR can delay the time of lipid peroxidation by scavenging DPPH free radicals, peroxidation (LOO•) and hydroxyl (•OH) free radicals, and protect human low-density lipoprotein from the influence of Fe

 <sup>+</sup> mediated oxidation. It also has a similar protective effect on superhelical DNA breaking induced by hydrogen peroxide free radicals. And the antioxidant activity may be related to the content of Ginsenoside Rb1/Rb2 (

PQR berry extract and ginsenoside Re can reduce the oxidative damage of pancreatic cells induced by hydrogen peroxide, which can directly scavenge free radicals, prevent pancreatic cells from oxidative stress damage, and better regulate the blood glucose level in human body (

PDD-ginsenoside can block the production of ROS under ultraviolet exposure, limit the production of MMP-1, and promote the synthesis of type I procollagen. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor and TNF-α by NFAT signaling pathway. PDD-ginsenoside showed antioxidant effects by increasing TGF-β1 level, enhancing Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and limiting AP-1 and MAPK phosphorylation. PDD ginsenoside could inhibit melanin secretion and tyrosinase activity, reduce the content of Melan-A and zebrafish embryos, protect skin from light damage caused by ultraviolet rays, and prevent skin pigmentation (
