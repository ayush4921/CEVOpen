<p>PQR and its active ingredients not only have obvious effects on central nervous system and cardiovascular protection, but also have their own characteristics in other pharmacological effects. For example, ginsenoside Rg3 has anticancer activity, Re has antioxidant and antiemetic effects, and PF11, a unique saponin of PQR, has neuroprotective effect, caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid could help to protect the myocardial cells. Therefore, it is very important to study the biological activity of monomer, because it can exclude the existence of other components, and it is easy to clarify its exact pharmacological mechanism. However, there is a lack of in-depth study on the pharmacodynamic mechanism monomer compounds of PQR, and the mechanism of PQR in animals or human is not comprehensive enough. Moreover, there is a lack of investigation on the clinical optimal effective dose and safe dose. Other pharmacological effects such as immune regulation, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive and so on are less studied, and the mechanism is not fully described. This provides a broad space for future scholars to study PQR. The purpose of this part is to summarize the modern pharmacological research of PQR, find out the shortcomings, and put forward the relevant solutions, so as to provide reference and direction for future scholars to study PQR.</p>
