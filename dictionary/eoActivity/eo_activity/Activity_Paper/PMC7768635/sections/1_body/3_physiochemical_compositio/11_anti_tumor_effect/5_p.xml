<p>The above studies show that PQR has significant effect in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, leukemia and so on. In addition to its potential anticancer effect, PQR is often used as an adjuvant drug in cancer treatment to alleviate the toxic and side effects caused by chemotherapy drugs. However, the above studies are lack of research on monomer compounds, as well as the validation of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and clinical studies. It is difficult to provide scientific basis for clinical development of reasonable and reliable new anticancer drugs. In the future, scholars can further study the anticancer effect and mechanism of compounds such as Rg2, Rg3 and intestinal metabolite compound K in PQR, and add corresponding animal 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical trials to verify their efficacy. It is believed that based on clinical practice, combined with modern pharmaceutical theories and technologies, the development and application of anticancer TCM will make new and greater progress.
