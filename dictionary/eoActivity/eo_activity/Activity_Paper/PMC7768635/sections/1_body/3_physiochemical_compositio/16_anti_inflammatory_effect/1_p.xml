<p>PQR is a popular natural health care product with anti-inflammatory properties. Wilson’s study showed that PQR polysaccharide could play an anti-inflammatory effect by regulating IL-6, NF-κB (Nuclear factor-Kappab), Ccl5 [Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5], TNF-α and other inflammatory factors, and TLR4 receptor could reduce the up-regulation of inflammatory gene expression, and also plays an important role in the regulation of inflammation (

Subsequently, it was found that the neutral polysaccharide PPQN in PQR has a therapeutic effect on inflammation and inflammation-related diseases by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators (NO) and cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) (

The water extract of PQR could significantly inhibit the expression of NOX2, superoxide generation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and TNF-α in the heart during endotoxemia by inhibiting the signaling pathway of NOX2-ERK1/2-TNF-α, and improve the level of inflammatory factors to improve cardiac function (

PQR saponins could inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress and associated chondrocytes' inflammatory response by activating the NF-κB pathway, and protect chondrocytes against triglycerides-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and interleukin-1 -mediated apoptosis, thereby eliminating cartilage degeneration in rats (
