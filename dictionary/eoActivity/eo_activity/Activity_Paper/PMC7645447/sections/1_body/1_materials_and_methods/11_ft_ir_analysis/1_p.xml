<p>FT-IR analysis of the solvent-extracted oil was performed using a Shimadzu FTIR-8400s Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (Kyoto, Japan). The FTIR spectrum was used to identify the functional groups of the active components based on the peaks observed in the infrared region. The extracted oil was encapsulated in a 100-mg potassium bromide (KBr) pellet to prepare a translucent sample disk and the analysis was carried out by scanning the samples across the wavenumber range of 400 to 4,000 cm
