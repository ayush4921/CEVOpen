<p>The total phenolic content of the 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> extract and fractions was measured with the Folin–Ciocâlteu reagent assay and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>. The values varied from 33.2 to 95.8 mg gallic acid/g of dry extract. Chloroform fraction contained the highest amount of phenolics (95.8 mg gallic acid/g), followed by butanol fraction (80.9 mg gallic acid/g), whereas the lowest level was found in the hexane fraction (33.2 mg gallic acid/g). Total flavonoid content of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> extract and fractions was measured with standard aluminium chloride spectrophotometric method and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(b)</xref>. The values varied from 22.6 to 41.5 mg quercetin/g of dry extract. It was shown that chloroform fraction contained the highest total flavonoid content (41.5 mg QU/g), followed by butanol fraction (33.6 mg QU/g), whereas the lowest level was found in the hexane fraction (22.6 mg QU/g).
