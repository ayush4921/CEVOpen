<p>128 grams of the crude extract was subjected to fractionation fractions using increasing polarity organic solvents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA (i.e., 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol) successively. It was transferred to a separatory funnel and suspended in 475 mL of distilled water and partitioned with 3 × 500 mL of each solvent. The filtrate was concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator under reduced pressure at 45 rpm and 40°C. The yield of the dried fractions was 0.86%, 27.56%, and 23.95% for the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fractions, respectively. Then, the dried fractions were transferred into separate vials and stored at −20°C until use.
