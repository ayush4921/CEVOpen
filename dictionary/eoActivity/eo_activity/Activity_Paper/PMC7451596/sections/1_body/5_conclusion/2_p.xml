<p id="p0595">Natural pharmaceutical products are used worldwide because of the numerous side effects of chemical drugs. 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> presents numerous plants that demonstrate active properties against MTB. These plants originate from the MENA region and are members of a wide range of families and species. Their effectiveness has been clearly proven through laboratory tests. Moreover, different compounds have been isolated from these plants. 22 plant species with significant effect with the MIC of ≤50 µg/ml are distributed in the MENA region. They can be used for the synthesis and manufacture of pharmaceutical products in the future. Researchers have attempted to extract crude and bioactive compounds from these plants to develop novel anti-TB drugs. The findings of previous studies may help researchers select plants, such as 
 <italic>I. helenium, K. senegalensis, P. odorata</italic> and 
 <italic>R. officinalis</italic> that contain diverse pharmacological active compounds, and investigate different mechanism that can be used as supportive anti-TB drugs. Therefore, efforts should be made to further investigate and identify the anti-TB activities and toxic constituents of the plants identified in this review.
