Urolithin A (uroA) at the concentration of 5, 10, 40 μM and roscovitine (rsc) at the concentration of 50 μM were used as a control. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM of three separate experiments conducted in triplicate. The experiments were performed with cells isolated from three independent donors. Statistical significance *p &lt; 0.05 increase versus non-stimulated control (NST) (Dunnett’s post-hoc test).
