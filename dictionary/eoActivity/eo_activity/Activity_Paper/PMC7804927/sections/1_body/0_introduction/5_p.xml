<p id="Par20">Neutrophils contribute to the first line of the immune response towards all sort of exogenous factors and pathogens and were shown to play a crucial role in all diseases with the inflammatory background. They are the type of granulocytes that constitute the majority of white blood cells in organisms of mammals

 </sup>. Neutrophils are phagocyte-type cells, they are part of the innate immune system. Their function is facilitated by the expression of TLR family members, allowing the recognition of a wide repertoire of PAMPs and thus triggering the response to invading pathogens. TLR4 is the most studied of all of the neutrophil TLRs, mediating responses to Gram-negative bacteria, which recognises the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide

 </sup>. The neutrophil activation leads to infiltration through the blood vessels and interstitial tissue to the inflamed site, following chemical signals in the chemotaxis process, where they destroy the pathogens
