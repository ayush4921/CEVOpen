<p id="Par56">The UHPLC analysis was performed using Ultimate 3000 series system (Dionex, Idstein, Germany) coupled with Amazon SL ion trap mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Bremen, Germany). The separation was carried out with Kinetex XB-C
 <sub>18</sub> column (100 mm × 2.1 mm × 1.7 µm), Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA). The oven temperature was set at 25 °C. The column was eluted with A (0.1% HCOOH in H2O) and B (0.1% HCOOH in MeCN) with a two-step gradient as follows: 0 min 1%B, 60 min 26%B and finally 90 min 95%B. The flow rate was set to 0.300 mL/min. Five µL of each sample (10 mg/mL) was injected. UV–Vis spectra were recorded in the range of 200–450 nm. Chromatograms were acquired at 254 nm. The ion trap Amazon SL mass spectrometer was operated with the ESI interface. The parameters for ESI source were set as follows: nebulizer pressure 40 psi; dry gas flow 9 L/min; dry temperature 300 °C; and capillary voltage 4.5 kV. The analysis was carried out using a scan from m/z 70–2200. Chromatograms as base peak ion current were recorded in negative mode only.
