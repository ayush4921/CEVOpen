<p id="Par52">The buffy coats were commercially obtained from healthy human donors (only men below 35 years old) from Warsaw Blood Donation Centre. Donors declared that they are non-smokers and not taking any medications. Anonymous buffy coats from healthy blood bank donors were only used if donors had consented scientific use of blood products. Donors were confirmed to be healthy; all routine laboratory test was carried out and showed values within the normal range. The study conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and experiments were performed following guidelines and regulations of Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Warsaw. Neutrophils were isolated using dextran sedimentation and centrifugation in a Pancoll (1.077) gradient (1500 rpm, 4 °C). Erythrocytes were removed by hypotonic lysis. The purity of the neutrophils preparation was over 97%. After isolation cells were suspended in a medium (RPMI 1640) and were maintained at 4 °C before use
