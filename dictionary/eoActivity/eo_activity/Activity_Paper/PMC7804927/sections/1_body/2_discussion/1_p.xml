<p id="Par37">Many scientific sources indicate the bioactivity of plant extracts confirmed on in vivo and in vitro studies, which support their attributed therapeutic effects in many diseases with the inflammatory background. The discovery of biological activity of plant extract in vitro is a crucial go/no go step for the decision of conducting further studies covering bio-guided fractionation, identification of active principles and mechanisms of action followed by in vivo pharmacological examinations. However, none of the hitherto studies on native plant extracts considered the possibility of the presence of pyrogens, which interference with the applied in vitro models can be of great significance. There is no information about the effect of endotoxins on the change in the biological properties of tested extracts as well as about the undertaken actions leading to their removal

 </sup>. We were unable to find any hitherto in vitro bioactivity studies, which would address the issue of pyrogens presence in the tested plant preparations and thus consider their interference with the obtained results. In consequence, there is no protocol specifically introduced to achieve the effective removal of pyrogens from the extracts of plant origin, which could be applied before the introduction of in vitro screening of their biological activities.
