<p id="Par40">We have taken into consideration different strategies to remove the LPS from tested extracts including ultrafiltration, ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, affinity chromatography, sucrose gradient centrifugation and Triton X-114 phase separation

 </sup>. Among these, the ultrafiltration appeared to be the method of choice due to the fact, that it is easily accessible and least potent to cause changes in the phytochemical composition of specialized metabolites in the examined extract. Extract 
 <bold>5</bold> as the one with the highest content of LPS was chosen further experiments. Indeed, UHPLC-DAD-MS analysis confirmed, that the filtration at any of the applied filters, including 30 kDa did not cause changes in tested extract composition. It should be noted, that this process causes not only removal of LPS and other pyrogens, but also the molecules of size higher than 30 kDa e.g. polysaccharides, which are not detected by the applied chromatographic method. However, the consequences of removing potentially active molecules of size &gt; 30 kDa are not of a major significance due to their low bioavailability in unchanged form and limited possibility of interaction with inflammatory processes in tissues.
