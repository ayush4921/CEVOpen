<p id="Par29">After the ultrafiltration process, the LAL test was conducted again for extracts at the highest concentration of 50 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). Extracts 
 <bold>1f.</bold>, 
 <bold>4f.</bold>–
 <bold>7f.</bold> showed lower endotoxin content comparable to native extracts (0.11 ± 0.00; 0.11 ± 0.00, 0.14 ± 0.00; 0.13 ± 0.00; 0.15 ± 0.00 EU/mL respectively), being at the border of applied test analytical sensitivity (0.1 EU/mL). For other extracts, the endotoxin content changed slightly or remained at a similar level as before. The differences between the LAL test for the native and the filtered extract at low LPS content were caused by analytical sensitivity declared by the test manufacturer.
