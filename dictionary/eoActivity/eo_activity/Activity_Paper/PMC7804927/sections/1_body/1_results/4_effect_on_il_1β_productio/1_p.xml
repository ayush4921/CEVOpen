<p id="Par26">For 
 <bold>1n</bold> and 
 <bold>4n</bold>–
 <bold>8n</bold> at 6.25–12.5 µg/mL IL-1β production was higher than the non-stimulated control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Then, at 25 and/or 50 μg/mL the released cytokine values increased and finally reached 71.1 ± 4.5, 69.1 ± 7.4, 75.0 ± 9.6, 63.8 ± 9.8, 69.0 ± 9.2 and 42.6 ± 5.5% for 
 <bold>1n</bold> and 
 <bold>4n</bold>–
 <bold>8n</bold> respectively. For 
 <bold>2n</bold> (at 6.25–12.5 µg/mL), 
 <bold>3n</bold> (at 6.25–50 μg/mL) and 
 <bold>9n</bold> (at 6.25–50 μg/mL) the cytokine production was lower than the non-stimulated control. All extracts except 
 <bold>9n</bold> showed a dependence of IL-1β secretion on the concentration of the extracts. For urolithin A and roscovitine cytokine production was lower than for non-stimulated control.
