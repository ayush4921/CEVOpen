<p id="Par23">None of the tested extracts expressed cytotoxic effect on neutrophils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Most of the tested extracts inhibited the naturally occurring apoptosis showing the percentage of viable cells comparable or higher than the non-stimulated control. The inhibition of apoptosis for extract 
 <bold>1n</bold>–
 <bold>4n</bold> and 
 <bold>6n</bold>–
 <bold>7n</bold> was similar to this observed for LPS, which is known to prevent the apoptosis in human neutrophils

 </sup>. Mostly, the number of living cells increased with extracts concentrations, while the percentage of apoptotic cells simultaneously decreased. Roscovitine (a CDK inhibitor) used as positive control showed a high level of apoptotic cells (93.8 ± 0.3%) and low level of viable cells (6.2 ± 0.3%). Similarly, the extracts subjected to ultrafiltration showed no cytotoxic effect on neutrophils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) However 
 <bold>1f.</bold>, 
 <bold>2f.</bold>, 
 <bold>6f.</bold> and 
 <bold>7f.</bold> were no longer preventing apoptosis as it was observed for respective native extracts. For 
 <bold>1f.</bold>, 
 <bold>2f.</bold> and 
 <bold>4f.</bold>–
 <bold>9f.</bold>, the level of viable, early and late apoptotic cells was similar to the non-stimulated control. For 
 <bold>3f.</bold> and 
 <bold>4f.</bold> the percentage of viable cells was still higher than for non-stimulated control and was comparable with LPS-stimulated control. At the same time, a significant decrease in apoptotic cells was observed. These observations suggest that 
 <bold>3f.</bold> and 
 <bold>4f.</bold> contain agents, which prevent neutrophil apoptosis, being of different nature than the pyrogens eliminated during ultrafiltration.
