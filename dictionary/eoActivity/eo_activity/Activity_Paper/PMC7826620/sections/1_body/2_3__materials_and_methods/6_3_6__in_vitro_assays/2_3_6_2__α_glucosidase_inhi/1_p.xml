<p>The test was realized pursuing the protocol of Pistia-Brueggeman and Hollingsworth [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An amount of 50 μL of WFLE extract was prepared at various concentrations (1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 62, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL) and incubated with the solution containing 10 μL of α-glucosidase (maltase) 1 U/mL and 125 μL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) for 20 min at 37 °C. To start the reaction, a solution of 20 μL of 1 M pNPG (4-Nitrophenyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>- glucopyranoside) (substrate) was added then incubated for half-hour. To terminate the reaction, 50 μL of 0.1 N Na2CO3 was added. The optical density was measured at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. For this assay, acarbose was used as a positive control (α-amylase inhibitor). The experiments were repeated three times for each concentration.
