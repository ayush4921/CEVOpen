<p>The test was realized pursuing Mitra et al.’s protocol [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-26-00293" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To prepare the substrate solution, a solution of 0.5 M Tris–HCl buffer at pH 6.9 was mixed with 0.01 M CaCl2 (0.2 mL) and 2 mg of starch. The substrate solution was distributed into test tubes, boiled (for 5 min) and preincubated (at 37 °C for 5 min). Using DMSO, WFLE extract was dissolved and prepared at different concentrations of 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 62, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL. The plant extract solution (0.2 mL) at different concentrations was added to the test tube containing the substrate solution, and later on, the porcine pancreatic amylase (0,1 mL in Tris–HCl buffer (2 units/ mL)) was added. This reaction was performed out at 37 °C for 10 min and then stopped by adding 0.5 mL of 50% acetic acid in each test tube. A centrifugation was carried on (3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C) and the supernatant optic density was at 595 nm using a spectrophotometer. For this assay, acarbose was used as a positive control (α-amylase inhibitor). The experiments were repeated three times for each concentration.
