 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00293-f004">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity of WFLE. The inhibition effect is correlated to the concentration of the WFLE as the highest concentrations exhibited the highest inhibition activity. The calculated IC50 showed that the inhibition potential of acarbose (IC50 0.084 ± 0.017 mg/mL) is better than that of WFLE (IC50 0.180 ± 0.018 mg/mL). Despite its moderate activity, the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase remains one of the proposed potential mode of action exhibited by WFLE.
