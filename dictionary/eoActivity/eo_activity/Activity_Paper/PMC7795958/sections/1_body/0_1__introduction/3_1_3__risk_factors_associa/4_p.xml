<p>A healthier lifestyle concept includes physical activity and adequate nutritional habits while excluding smoking and alcohol consumption. Chronic inflammatory diseases linked to dietary habits such as type II diabetes and obesity are among the exogenous risk factors frequently associated with cancer cases [

These food sources are widely known to be rich in bioactive compounds and displaying pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, immunomodulatory, antimetastatic, and antitumoral activities which, together, can contribute to delay cancer burden, since they prevent oxidative stress, modulate the proinflammatory status, and control metabolic dysfunction [
