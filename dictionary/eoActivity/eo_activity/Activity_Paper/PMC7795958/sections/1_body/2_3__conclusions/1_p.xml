<p>Although neglected, taro is a valuable source of several health-promoting compounds, such as taro lectin or tarin, bioactive-complex carbohydrates, and natural polyphenols and other antioxidants. In general, these molecules act through individual or synergic pathways and play a role in the modulation of cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and invasion of cancer cells. The antiproliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities in tumorigenic cells are still poorly understood, despite the evidence obtained from in vitro and in vivo assays. The bioactive compounds from taro may interact with plasmatic cell membranes and intracellular receptors, interfere with signaling cascades, regulate enzyme activities, interact with oncogenes and oncoproteins, and bind to gene promoter sequences. The result of such vast interactions can contribute to ameliorate systemic health status by managing oxidative stress imbalance, reducing systemic inflammation, modulating metabolic dysfunctions, and boosting the immune response. The molecular mechanisms of taro active compounds are not yet fully understood, which is probably due to the few studies on taro, which are restricted to specific regions around the globe, as shown along with this review. Further investigation is necessary to determine which signaling pathways are stimulated to achieve cellular immunity through the activation of T lymphocytes, promoting the apoptosis of tumor cells, how macrophages are activated and progenitors protected, as well as how taro bioactivities can modulate gene expression. Thus, many mechanisms remain to be elucidated to better exploit taro extracts, taro derivatives, or individual taro components. The non-toxicity of these molecules toward healthy cells turns taro components into potential candidates for supportive target therapies when associated with traditional drug treatments. In addition, since taro is a food matrix rich in bioactive compounds, spreading its benefits worldwide may enhance its consumption and consequently production while resulting in better population health maintenance.</p>
