<p>Taro mucilage, mainly composed of neutral sugar, absorbs mutagenic/carcinogenic agents and also takes part in anti-hyperglycemic and anti-hyperlipidemic effects. A mucilage-rich extract from crude taro flour inhibits the starch-hydrolytic enzymes α-glucosidase and α-amylase, and pancreatic lipase. [
