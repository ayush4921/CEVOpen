<p>The bioactivities found in taro have been mainly attributed to its polyphenols, proteins, mucilage, polysaccharides, lipids, and non-polyphenol antioxidants. Many of these bioactive principles have already been identified and singly assayed, proving their participation in these claimed activities. Bioactive molecules identified in taro include tarin, taro-4-I polysaccharide, taro polysaccharides 1 and 2 (TPS-1/TPS-2), A-1/B-2 Î±-amylase inhibitors, monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs), and digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDGs). Together, these data clearly indicate that the biological effects exerted by taro are possibly a synergic effect of multiple compounds displaying effectiveness not only against several cancer cell lines but also against some of the main external cancer risk factors, such as free radicals, mutagenic and carcinogenic agents, and physiopathological conditions such as obesity and type II diabetes (
