<p>Antitumoral and antimetastatic bioactivities associated with immunomodulatory effectiveness can be provided by the set of molecules found in taro, as previously demonstrated by in vivo and in vitro preclinical trials. A soluble extract from poi (cooked taro), a popular food traditionally consumed by Hawaiians, inhibits the proliferation of rat YYT colon cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, reaching its maximum effect at 25 mg poi/mL. Rat YYT cells displayed morphological apoptosis characteristics, confirmed by TUNEL (TdT-Mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling) nucleus staining, which is indicative of DNA damage. In contrast, no toxicity to healthy mice spleen cells was observed, reinforcing suitability for antitumorigenic use. Moreover, splenocytes were stimulated to proliferate, displaying a TCD4 phenotype, followed by TCD8, B, and natural killer (NK) cells [

CD8+ T lymphocytes differentiate into cytotoxic cells by antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation, in order to promote the direct destruction of cancer cells. CD4+ T lymphocytes contribute to the fight against cancer by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, TNF-α, and INF-γ, which, in turn, activate T lymphocytes, NK, and macrophage cells, while enhancing antigen presentation [
