<p>All the alkaloids isolated were tested against parasitic protozoa and for cytotoxicity. Ungeremine, pseudolycorine, and haemanthamine showed good activity in vitro against 
 <italic>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</italic>, 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi,</italic> and 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> (half maximal inhibitory concentration) values in the range of 3.66 mM or lower. Ungeremine showed higher toxicity than the other alkaloids but was inactive against 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> and showed cytotoxic activity against L6 cells (rat skeletal myoblasts, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 65.28 mM). Related compounds with quaternary nitrogen showed strong antiprotozoa activity and the anti-plasmodial activity exhibited by ungeremine, pseudolycorine, and haemanthamine does not depend on interactions with heme [

These results increased the knowledge on the structure-antiprotozoal activity relationships in Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, which are scantly investigated. Previously, only the role of a methylenedioxy group and a tertiary non-methylated nitrogen was reported to impart higher activity [
