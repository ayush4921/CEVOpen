<p>This review described the alkaloids and their natural analogues isolated in the last decade from different Amaryllidaceae species, focusing the discussion on the new ones. The world region in which they grow and their diffused use in folk medicine was also reported. Together with the new alkaloids, some new analogues were reported as well as other well-known alkaloids and other metabolites isolated from Amaryllidaceae plants. The description of isolation and chemical and biological characterization of the new alkaloids follows a chronological order and their biological activities in the tests were described and listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05621-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, together with the plant source and literature. In some cases, results on the structure activity relationships were also described.
