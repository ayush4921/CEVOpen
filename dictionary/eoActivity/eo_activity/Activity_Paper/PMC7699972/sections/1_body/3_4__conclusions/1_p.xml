<p>The higher phenolics and flavonoid contents, an abundance of iron, copper, and zinc as trace elements, together with the comparatively enhanced anti-oxidant, and anti-diabetic activity that was measured as an expression of the α-amylase inhibitory potential, established the usefulness of the five commonly encountered halophytic plants, 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic>, 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic>, 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic>, and 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic> of the region as part of the traditional medicinal chest forming the plants’ resources wealth for the population. The strong anti-oxidant potentials and the α-amylase inhibitory activity confirmed the traditional uses of these plants as sugar-control herbs, and the use of 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic> in wound healing as an anti-infection. The better phenolics and flavonoids phytoconstituents concentrations and bioactivities suggested that the plants, 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. lagopoides,</italic> upon further investigations, may provide the active constituents for anti-diabetic biological activity, while the 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic> could yield the anti-microbial agent’s lead molecule, or a molecular template for further development. The 
 <italic>Z. simplex,</italic> active against MRSA may throw up the MRSA-inhibiting active constituent(s). Besides, these plants may also serve as potential nutraceuticals, as food-supplements, and food for drought conditions for humans and cattle alike. The plants are of immense health value in line with their traditional and folk-lore’s medicinal-use reputation, which is also supported by their concurrent investigations, especially for the α-amylase inhibitory activity potential which is an indication of the postprandial blood glucose level reduction capacity in diabetic conditions.
