<p>All the plants were collected in November 2019 from the high salted arid areas in the Qassim region of central Saudi Arabia. The plant materials were identified as 
 <italic>S. imbricata, S. cyclophylla, T. aphylla, Z. simplex,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic> by Dr. Abdulrahman Al-Soeer, Plant Taxonomy Department, College of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Qassim University. For each plant, 20 samples of aerial parts were collected, dried in the shade at room temperature (RT, 24 ± 2 °C), combined, and grinded to a coarse powder by a mechanical grinder. A weighed quantity, 500 gm of each dried plant powder were placed in large flasks (5 L volume) and were extracted with 1.5 L of 5%-aqueous ethanol at RT (24 ± 2 °C) under constant shaking for overnight over a vibrating shaker. The solvents were collected by filtrations, concentrated on a rotatory vacuum evaporator under reduced pressure, and &lt;40 °C temperature. The dried extracts were stored under −20 °C in a deep freezer for further processing.
