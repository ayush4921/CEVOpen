<p>The agar diffusion anti-microbial growth test method was used for estimating the anti-microbial activity of 
 <italic>S. imbricata, S. cyclophylla, Z. simplex</italic>, 
 <italic>A. lagopoides,</italic> and 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic> extracts. The required number of wells were cut on the agar plate using the back of a sterile glass dropper (6 mm diameter) and labeled. The microbial suspensions were prepared by taking a sample from the culture and mixing it with Muller Hinton Broth (MHB). The turbidity/growth corresponding to a 0.5 McFarland was used as standard. The Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates were inoculated with the culture of each microbial suspension by spreading it evenly using sterile cotton swabs. For the fungal culture, SDA (Sabouraud Dextrose Agar) was used. Clotrimazole was used as the control for the yeast strain. The extracts were dissolved using DMSO to get the concentration of 50 mg/mL, followed by the addition of 100 μL of each extract through a micropipette into the agar wells. Gentamicin (10 μg/disc) was used as a positive control for Gram-positive bacteria, while Ciprofloxacin (5 μg/disc), and Oxacillin (1 μg/disc) were the positive control for Gram-negative bacteria. A negative control, DMSO solution of 100 μL, was poured into the wells. The plates were incubated at 37 ± 1 °C for 24–48 h and examined for anti-microbial activity [
