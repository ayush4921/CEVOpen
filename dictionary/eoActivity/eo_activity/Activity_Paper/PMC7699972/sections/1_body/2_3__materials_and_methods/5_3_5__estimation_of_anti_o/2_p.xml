<p>For estimating the iron-metal chelating activity, 1 mL of each plant’s extract (varying concentrations), 50 µL of FeCl
 <sub>2</sub> (2 mM), 0.2 mL of aqueous ferrozine solution (5 mM) were mixed and shaken for 10 min. Absorbance of all the extracts and standard was measured at 562 nm. The percent inhibition of the formed ferrozine–iron complex was calculated according to the Equation (1) [
