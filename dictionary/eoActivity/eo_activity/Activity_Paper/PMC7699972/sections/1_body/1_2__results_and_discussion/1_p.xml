<p>The halophytic plants are capable of over-producing phenolics and flavonoids as part of their defense mechanisms against higher oxidative stress of the excess-salinity soil conditions in difference to their normal (non-salinity) counterparts [

 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic>, 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic>, 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>T. aphylla</italic>, and 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic> were investigated for their phenolics, flavonoids, and mineral contents’ (iron, copper, and zinc) comparative occurrence. Moreover, based on inputs from the prevalent traditional medicinal uses of these plants in the region, the species as part of the regional plant diaspora were evaluated, for anti-microbial and anti-oxidant potentials, as well as α-amylase inhibitory effects as equivalent to the anti-diabetic activity, for comparative purposes. Various pharmacological activities have been linked to the presence of high anti-oxidants potentials of the plants [
