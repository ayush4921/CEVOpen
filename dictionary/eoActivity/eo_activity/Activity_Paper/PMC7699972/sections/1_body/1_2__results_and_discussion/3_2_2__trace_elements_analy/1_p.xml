<p>Trace elements form part of the cellular materials and are necessary for many biological functions. They are also important from the view-point of human nutrition and participate in several vital metabolic activities inside of the body [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The trace elements analysis of these halophytes showed iron in all the plants’ samples under study, wherein the highest iron concentration was detected in 
 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic> (4113 µg/kg of the plant powder), while the lowest iron concentration was found in 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic> (525 µg/kg of the plant powder). The copper, which represents the important constituent of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase enzyme and ceruloplasmin metalloproteinase [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05457" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], was also detected in all the halophytic plants under investigation. The 
 <italic>S. imbricata</italic> contained the highest concentration of copper (11.1 µg/kg of the plant powder) while 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic> contained the lowest concentration of copper at 0.48 µg/kg (of the plant powder). All the studied halophytic plants contained zinc with concentrations ranging from 27.4 µg/kg to 40.1 µg/kg of the respective plant powders (

 <italic>A. lagopoides</italic> contained the highest concentration of zinc at 40.1 µg/kg, while the 
 <italic>S. cyclophylla</italic>, as well as the 
 <italic>Z. simplex</italic>, contained the lowest levels of zinc at 27.4 µg/kg of the respective plant powders (

An earlier study reported that zinc possesses vital functions to perform in the secretion of insulin hormone, and is also involved in increasing the sensitivity of the tissues to insulin action. In addition, zinc has anti-diabetic, and anti-oxidant activities also [
