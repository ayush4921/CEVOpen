<p>This manuscript results have been shown that the V2 phase alcohol extract of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. contains a high amounts of polyphenols, including rutin and rosmarinic acid, which promotes the radical scavenging activity and antioxidant properties of this extract. In contrast, the extract from the F2 phase already at a concentration of 12.5 µg/mL reduces the survival of melanoma cells to 60% with comparison to 90% for melanocytes. In addition, extracts from the beginning of flowering and end of flowering at a concentration of 25 µg/mL, containing significantly less rutin and rosmarinic acid, in combination with irradiation of cells with UVB, significantly increased the lipid peroxidation process, particularly in melanoma cells. These data indicate the possibility of using extracts from 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L to modulate/differentiate the metabolism of normal and tumor skin cells.
