<p>Major essential oil components of 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> L. raw material were determined using SPME and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. Totally 21 volatile compounds were identified and quantified. Results of this analysis revealed five dominating compounds, which are: β-myrcene, p-cymene, γ-terpinene, carvacrol, and β-caryophyllene. Essential oil quantitative composition and its dependence on the vegetation phase are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00053-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The major compound in all the vegetation phases was carvacrol. Carvacrol is predominant and its amount accumulates during all vegetation phases from 47% in V1 to 87% in F3. The maximum concentration of γ-terpinene observed during the intensive growth is later considerably decreased (circa 10 times) and is only 6% at the F2 and F3 phases.
