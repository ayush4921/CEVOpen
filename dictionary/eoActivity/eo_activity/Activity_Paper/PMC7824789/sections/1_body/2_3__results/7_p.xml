<p>The cytotoxicity of alcoholic extracts from 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. was tested against human melanocytes and human malignant melanoma cells. Cells viability was assessed by their ability to reduce MTT to formazan dye after 24-h exposure of cells to 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extract at various concentrations ranging from 12.5 to 100 μg/mL. A concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of the extracts on the viability of melanocytes and melanoma cancer cells was observed. Cytotoxicity was considered whenever the percentage of cell survival was less than 70%. The IC50 for each of extracts were estimated as IC50
 <sub>V1</sub> = 1.250 mg/mL, IC50
 <sub>V2</sub> = 8.535 mg/mL, IC50
 <sub>F1</sub> = 325 µg/mL, IC50
 <sub>F2</sub> = 160 µg/mL, IC50
 <sub>F3</sub> = 25 µg/mL in the case of melanocytes and IC50
 <sub>V1</sub> = 285 µg/mL, IC50
 <sub>V2</sub> = 270 µg/mL, IC50
 <sub>F1</sub> = 195 µg/mL, IC50
 <sub>F2</sub> = 45 µg/mL, IC50
 <sub>F3</sub> = 140 µg/mL for melanoma cells.
