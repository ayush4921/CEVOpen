<p>The results of this study show that terpenes predominate among volatile substances of 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extract, especially carvacrol. However, in the alcohol extract large amounts of phenolic compounds are observed, especially rutin and rosemary acid, which is visible, especially also in the V2 phase. The studies published by other researchers reveal different results, when 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> L. raw material samples are collected from various natural sampling sites. Studies carried out by Gulluce et al. (2003) and Hashemi et al. (2012) demonstrated that thymol and γ-terpinene are the predominant components of essential oil. Carvacrol, p-cymene, β-myrcene, and α-terpinene were determined at lower concentrations [

 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. cultivated in Turkey possess prevailing quantities of carvacrol. However, the samples collected from natural sampling sites possess predominant component-thymol [
