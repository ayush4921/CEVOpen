<p>Due to the action of reactive oxygen species on membrane phospholipids, fragmentation produces unsaturated short chain, reactive aldehydes, such as MDA, while cyclic prostaglandin derivatives result from oxidative cyclization [

The production of these biologically active compounds can disrupt cellular metabolism, but above all, through the metabolism of membrane PUFAs, it affects the modification of the structure and function of biological membranes. Therefore, most studies on the effects of polyphenolic antioxidants focus on their effects on biological membranes, including preventing changes in their structure as a result of the peroxidation process. The results of this work show that the higher level of polyphenols in the 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extract corresponds to the reduction in the level of lipid peroxidation product, which is MDA. Extracts from the vegetative phases F1-3 characterized by a lower level of all phenolic compounds also had a higher level of MDA compared to control cells. In the case of treating cells with extracts from the V1 and V2 phases with low concentrations, a significantly higher level of phenolic compounds was accompanied by preventing the increase in MDA levels even after UV radiation.
