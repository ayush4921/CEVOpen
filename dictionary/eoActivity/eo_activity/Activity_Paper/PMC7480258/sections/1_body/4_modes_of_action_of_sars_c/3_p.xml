<p id="p0060">There is a probability that SARS-CoV-2 employed a similar mechanism as SARS-CoV because its receptor-binding domain (RBD) binding motif consists of the nucleotides associated with ACE2. After SARS-CoV-2 gained entrance in its host cell, ACE2 is cleaved and ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) shed by it into the extra membrane space. This may lead to the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by ACE2, a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin pathway thus, increasing pulmonary vascular permeability and damage the alveoli (

 <sup>2+</sup> ion channel that is related to SARS-CoV-2 is synthesized. It interacts with TRAF3 and activates the transcription of Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-kB) pathway, leading to the transcription of the pro-IL-1B gene (

Second signal like the ROS production, Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx, mitochondrial damage, and caspases activation converts pro-IL-1B to IL-B and results in cytokine production. Another ORF8b protein also activates the inflammasome pathway through NLRP3. This protein is longer in SARS-CoV-2 (
