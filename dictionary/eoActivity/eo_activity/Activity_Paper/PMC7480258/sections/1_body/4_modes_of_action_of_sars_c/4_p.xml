<p id="p0065">JNK is another important pathogenic pathway of SARS-CoV. In this pathway, there is an overproduction of pro-inflammatory factors via activation of ORF3a, ORF3b, and ORF7a which may lead to increased production of proinflammatory factors, critical damage of the lung (

A cytokine profile resembling secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) with a hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by a fulminant and severe hypercytokinaemia with multiorgan failure is associated with COVID-19 disease severity. This is characterized by increased tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (
