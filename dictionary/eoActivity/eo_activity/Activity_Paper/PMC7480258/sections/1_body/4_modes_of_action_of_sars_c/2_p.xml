<p id="p0055">The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences using sequencing technology showed that the complete genome sequence recognition rates of SARS-CoV and bat SARS coronavirus (SARSr-CoV-RaTG13) were 79.5% and 96.2%, respectively (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has specific genes in ORF1 regions that stimulate proteins for viral replication, spikes formation, and nucleocapsid (

The SARS-CoV-2 enter into and affect the host cell by undergoing a few steps of modifications similar to other kinds of beta-coronaviruses. Thereafter, it binds to the ACE2 receptor in the alveoli of the lungs and respiratory epithelium (

These cellular proteases include cathepsins, human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT), and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that split the spike protein and establish further penetration changes (
