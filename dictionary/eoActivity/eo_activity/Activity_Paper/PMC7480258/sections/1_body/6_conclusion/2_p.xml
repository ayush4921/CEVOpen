<p id="p0325">COVID-19 is a highly infectious and severe acute respiratory disorder caused by a pathogenic virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its clinical manifestations include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, and other complications. The mode of actions of SARS-CoV-2 includes hyper-inflammation characterized by a fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinaemia with multi-organ failure; immunosuppression; reduction of ACE2 to enhance pulmonary vascular permeability and damage the alveoli; and activated by ORF3a, ORF3b, and ORF7a via JNK pathway which induces lung damage. These mechanisms of action of the virus can be mitigated by combine therapy of the medicinal herbs based on their pharmacological activities. Furthermore, plant materials and natural products have been very effective in the treatment of symptoms related to COVID-19. Experimental research is needed to prove the efficacy of these medicinal plants and their product against COVID-19. As a recommendation, since COVID-19 is a multifactorial clinical disorder with co-morbidities, we strongly recommend the use of combined therapy such that two or more herbs with specific therapeutic actions are administered to combat the key players in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p>
