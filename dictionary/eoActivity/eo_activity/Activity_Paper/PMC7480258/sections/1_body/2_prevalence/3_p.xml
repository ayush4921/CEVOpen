<p id="p0035">COVID-19 spread rapidly from Wuhan in China to all the continents of the world within four weeks. This confirms that COVID-19 has a very high prevalence and the global population is generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Using the IDEAL model, Majumder et al. documented that the basic reproduction number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.0–3.3 (

 <xref rid="bib240" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2020c)</xref> reported that the R0 is between 2.47 and 2.86 using the SEIR model (

The values of R0 may vary between research groups due to many factors such as duration of infectiousness, probability of infection being transmitted during contact, and rate of contacts in the host population. The calculated R0 values of other beta coronaviruses are 2.2–3.6 (

The median age of cases reported in China was 47 years, 3% of the cases were aged people (≥80 years), 87% of the cases were people between the age of 30 and 79 years. Forty-two percent of the cases were female, suggesting that males may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (
