<p id="p0175">Considering the increasing numbers of risk issues of humans to various harmful diseases, this brought about the need for the use of natural constituents present in dietary and medicinal plants as curative and helpful antioxidants. A vast number of indigenous plants in Nigeria have been reported to reveal antioxidant activity, including

For detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species to be stopped, plants have shown a powerfully in-built enzymatic and non-enzymatic scavenging capacity. These Enzymes included dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and peroxidases (POX) while, non-enzymatic compounds include tocopherols, ascorbate (AsA), glutathione (GSH), and carotenoids. In plants, any form of rise in the levels of antioxidants has been established to exhibit a better resistance to different types of environmental stresses (
