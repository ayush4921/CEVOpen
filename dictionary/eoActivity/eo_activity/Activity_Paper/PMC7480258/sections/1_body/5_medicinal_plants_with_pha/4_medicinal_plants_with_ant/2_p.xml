<p id="p0085">Nigerian plants have shown to house a number of novel compounds with antiviral activities (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). A number of scientific research have elucidated the curative mechanisms by which these plants provide their therapeutic actions while clinical research has presented the ability of some medicinal plants in treating many viral infections and diseases. For instance, 
 <italic>Sida cordifolia</italic> has been reported to be a natural anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agent (
 <xref rid="bib212" ref-type="bibr">Tamura et al., 2010</xref>). One of the active compound isolated from the plant is (10E, 12Z)-9-hydroxyoctadeca-10,12-dienoic acid, a hydroxyl unsaturated fatty acid was found to be an exceptional NES (nuclear export signal) non-antagonistic inhibitor for nuclear export of Rev. Replication of HIV-1 is essentially dependent on the regulatory protein Rev or the Rev protein. Rev protein is involved in the nucleus-cytoplasm export of mRNA, which is very essential for the synthesis of the viral proteins necessary for viral replication. 
 <italic>Sida cordifolia</italic> has also been proven act as an immune booster serving as immune stimulants to strengthen and harmonize degenerative body systems and assists the immune system in its fight against invading antigens (bacteria and viruses) (
