<p id="p0080">High fever and malaria have been reported as clinical manifestations or symptoms of COVID-19. Malaria is a global health burden caused by infection with a parasite of genus plasmodium. Scientific studies have tried to investigate the link between malaria and other diseases such as cancers especially lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma (caused by gamma herpes Viruses, Epstein-Barr virus), Kaposi sarcoma (caused by Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus), nasopharyngeal carcinoma and liver cancer. Nigerian indigenous medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Enantiachlorantha, Khaya grandifoliola, Alstoniaboonei, Morinda lucida,</italic> and 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> are being used extensively in traditional medicine as malaria therapy. Table 1 below show the comprehensive list of indigenous medicinal plants use for malaria therapy. The leaves, barks, roots, or whole plants are used for the treatment. We suggest that any of these plants administered alone or in combinations may offer beneficial effects in alleviating malaria in COVID-19 patients. Recently, an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> screening of african medicinal plants revealed that 6-Acetylswietenolide, a terpenoid from 
 <italic>Khaya grandifoliola</italic> showed significant inhibition against coronavirus 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (
