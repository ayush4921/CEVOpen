<p>Subsequently, we docked major phytoconstituents identified by GC-MS analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) into the homology model of α-glucosidase. The binding energy data of the docked compounds is shown in 
 <xref rid="T9" ref-type="table">Table 9</xref>. The binding energy of these compounds were found in the range of −6.6118 to −4.0372 kcal/mol. Highest activity was shown by bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (
