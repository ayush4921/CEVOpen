<p>In DPPH free radicals scavenging assay, Ec.Chf, Ec.Cr, and Ec.EtAc were the potent fractions. Ec.Chf showed 76.50 ± 0.57, 67.16 ± 0.60, 58.83 ± 0.88, and 52.50 ± 0.28% inhibitions of free radicals at concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml respectively. Similarly, Ec.Cr displayed 73.33 ± 0.60, 64.16 ± 0.44, 52.83 ± 0.72, and 44.50 ± 0.86% inhibitions at concentrations 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml, respectively. Furthermore, Ec.EtAc enzyme inhibitions were 70.16 ± 0.72, 61.60 ± 0.49, 51.70 ± 0.47, and 42.20 ± 0.41% at the same tested concentrations. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for Ec.Chf, Ec.Cr, and Ec.EtAc were 112, 163, and 204 μg/ml, respectively. Standard drug ascorbic acid showed 90.66 ± 0.70, 85.46 ± 0.39, 76.70 ± 0.40, and 69.06 ±0.58% scavenging of free radicals at concentrations 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value calculated for ascorbic acid was 10 μg/ml. Ec.Hex and Ec.Aq also displayed a dose dependent response with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 405 and 580 μg/ml, respectively as shown in
