<p>In α-glucosidase inhibition assay, Ec. Chf was observed to be the most active fraction. Ec. Chf exhibited 59.57 ± 1.18, 52.67 ± 0.11, 43.86 ± 0.02, and 36.72 ± 0.45% enzyme at concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml respectively attaining IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 734 μg/ml. Likewise, Ec. Cr displayed 55.46 ± 0.44, 39.51 ± 1.11, 33.77 ± 1.14, and 27.72 ± 1.45% inhibitions at the same tested concentrations with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 855 μg/ml, respectively. In comparison, the standard drug acarbose showed 76.87 ± 0.06, 73.94 ± 1.92, 67.49 ± 0.22, and 61.53 ± 0.89% inhibitions at concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml respectively with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 25 μg/ml. Other fractions, including Ec. EtAc, Ec. Hex, and Ec. Aq exhibited dose-dependent enzyme inhibition with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 754, 1,388, and 1,208 μg/ml respectively as shown in
