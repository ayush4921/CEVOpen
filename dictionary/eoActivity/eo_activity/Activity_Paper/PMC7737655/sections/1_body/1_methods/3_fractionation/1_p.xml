<p>The successive solvent-solvent extraction method was followed for the fractionation of crude methanolic extract (Shah et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>). In brief, the crude extract of 
 <italic>E. caerulum</italic> weighing 300 g was suspended in 500 ml of distilled water in separating funnel and 500 ml of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane was poured into it. It was vigorously shaken and allowed to stand in a separating funnel to be separated into two distinct layers. The upper 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane layer was collected, and the same procedure was followed until a colorless 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane layer was obtained. After the collection of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction, it was fractionated with other solvents with increasing order of polarity (i.e., chloroform, ethyl acetate and the aqueous fraction). The fractions obtained for 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions of 
 <italic>E. caerulum</italic> were allowed to get converted into semisolid masses weighing 62 g (20. 66%), 37 g (12.33%), 59 g (19.66%), and 110 g (36.66%) respectively.
