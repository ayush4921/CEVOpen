<p>Experimental evidence implies the contribution of free radicals in the inception of DM and more significantly in the progress of diabetic complications (Zeb et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Free radical scavengers are useful in the prevention of DM in experimental diabetic animal models (Sadiq et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Unrelenting hyperglycemia in DM patients can lead to oxidative stress via auto-oxidation of glucose, non-enzymatic glycosylation and polyol pathways. Auto-oxidation of glucose results from the natural reduction of molecular oxygen species to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which, being extremely reactive, reacts with all biomolecules (Sadiq et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>; Jabeen et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). These free radicals also speed up formation of advanced glycation end products like pyrroles and imidazoles. Cross-linking of these glycation end products with proteins in tissues fallout as irregularities in the function of cells and tissues. The third mechanism of free radical generation is Polyol pathway during which a greater amount NADPH is diminished which impair the formation of key antioxidants like glutathione (Giugliano et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). As a result, the protein glycation capability of antioxidant enzymes is also decreased. Long-lived structural proteins, collagen and elastin, experience persistent non-enzymatic cross-linking during aging, and in diabetic individuals (Vasan et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Chronic oxidative stress also leads to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, β-cell dysfunction, impaired glucose tolerance and type-2 DM. Prolonged oxidative stress, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia are principally harmful for β-cells. The impairment of β-cell function leads to under production of insulin, weakened glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, fasting hyperglycemia, and ultimately the development of type-2 DM (Tangvarasittichai,
