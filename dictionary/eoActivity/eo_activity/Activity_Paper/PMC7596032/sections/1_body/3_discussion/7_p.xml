<p>In summary, our results showed that dietary supplementation with RC in laying hens improved the FCR, egg yolk color, serum antioxidant enzyme activity, and activated the Nrf2 gene to increase phase II enzyme performance. RC leaves could be used as phytogenic feed additives and supplied to laying hens. In addition, 0.5% supplementation generated the best results in the FCR, while 2% supplementation increased the phase II enzyme performances levels.</p>
