<p>Studies have suggested that RC leaves contain large amounts of phytochemicals, which provide antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory abilities (

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Jena and Gupta (2012)</xref> found that the main bioactive compounds in RC leaves are present in phenolic and flavonoid compounds; similar results were reported by

  <italic>et al.</italic> (2009)
 </xref>. The results of our study showed that the total phenolic and flavonoid content of RCE was 48.39 mg GAE/g and 9.76 mg QE/g, respectively (

 </xref>), which provide hydrogen ions and chelate free radicals to exhibit antioxidant activity (
