<p>In recent years, the trend in feed additives has shifted from antibiotics to probiotics and phytogenics (

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Mishra and Jha, 2019</xref>). Free radicals such as superoxides, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals produced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative damage, apoptosis, and DNA damage through cellular signal transduction mechanisms (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). Previous research found that some substances contained in plants can scavenge free radicals, including flavonoids (e.g., flavonols, flavones, isoflavones, and anthocyanidins), stilbenes, lignans, and phenolic acids. This is not due to a single mechanism but rather, several mechanisms working together (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) coordinate antioxidant responses in animals. Nrf2 is activated by ROS stimulation and binds to the antioxidant response element to initiate phase II enzyme expression [e.g., heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and glutamatecysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC)] to enhance the antioxidant systemof the cells (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Feng 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010
 </xref>). Studies have shown that Nrf2 can be activated by many phytogenics, such as herbs, fruits, and plants. Therefore, Nrf2 plays an important role in regulating the enzyme antioxidant system and reducing cell damage caused by ROS (
