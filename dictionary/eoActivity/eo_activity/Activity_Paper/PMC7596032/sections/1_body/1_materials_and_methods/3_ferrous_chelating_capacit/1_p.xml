  <italic>et al.</italic> (1994)
 </xref>. Briefly, 0.25 mL RCE was mixed with 0.025 mL 2 mM ferrous chloride solution and 0.925 mL methanol. After 30 seconds incubation at RT, 0.05 mL 5 mM ferrozine was added to initiate the reaction, and the mixture was left to stand at RT for 10 min. Once the reaction was completed, the absorbance of the mixture was measured spectrophotometrically at 562 nm. The percentage of inhibition of the ferrozine-Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> complex was calculated according to the following formula:
