<p>The inhibitory effect of the RCE on liposome oxidation was tested using the methods described by

  <italic>et al.</italic> (2002)
 </xref>. Briefly, 300 mg lecithin was mixed with 30 mL phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and the solution was sonicated in an ultrasonic cleaner until it was completely emulsified. Subsequently, the emulsified solution (2 mL, 10 mg lecithin/mL) was mixed with 25 mM ferric trichloride (0.1 mL), 25 mM ascorbic acid (0.1 mL), and RCE at different concentrations. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37Â°C, and the oxidation level was measured using the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) method described by

  <italic>et al.</italic> (1991)
 </xref>. The absorbance was measured at 532 nm against BHT as a positive control. The inhibition rate was calculated using the following equation:
