<p>A total of eighty 29-week-old ISA brown laying hens were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups for 12 weeks. Their feed was supplemented with 0% (control), 0.5%, 1%, or 2% RC. Each treatment group involved 10 replicates of 2 birds in individual wire cages (43×40×60 cm). The temperature was set at 25°C and the relative humidity at 55%. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the ingredients and nutritional content of the basal diet. The diets were formulated to meet or exceed the nutrient requirements of laying hens (

 <italic>ad libitum</italic> with a light regimen of 17 h of continuous light per day. Eggs were collected, and the egg-laying rate and average egg weight were recorded daily. Feed consumption was recorded on a replicate basis at weekly intervals and calculated as gram/day/bird. The feed conversion rate (FCR) was calculated on a weekly basis for each treatment and expressed as kilograms of feed consumed per kilogram of eggs produced. Eight eggs were collected randomly from each replicate every seven days to measure egg quality during the experimental period. Eggs were weighed and eggshell strength was measured using an eggshell strength tester (DET 6000, NABEL Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). A constantly increasing load was applied to an egg lying lengthways, and eggshell strength was determined based on the time of breakage. Haugh unit values, a measure of egg protein quality, were calculated using egg weight and albumen height, determined using an albumen height analyzer (DET 6000, NABEL Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). Eggshell thickness was determined as the mean of measurements at three locations on the egg (sharp end, blunt end, and middle section) using a dial pipe gauge (Ozaki MFG Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
