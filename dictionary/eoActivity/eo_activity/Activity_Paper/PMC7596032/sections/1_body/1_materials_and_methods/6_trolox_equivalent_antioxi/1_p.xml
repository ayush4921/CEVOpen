<p>Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) was determined according to the methods described by

  <italic>et al.</italic> (1999)
 </xref>. The TEAC reagent was prepared by mixing 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>M), H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (500 
 <italic>µ</italic>M), peroxidase (44 U/mL) and distilled water at a ratio of 1:1:1:6, before the solution was left at RT in the dark for 1 h. Diluted RCE (0.1 mL) was then mixed with 0.9 mL TEAC reagent. The reaction mixture was left to stand at RT in the dark for 10 min before the absorbance was measured at 734 nmwith a spectrophotometer. The TEAC of the antioxidant was calculated by relating the drop in absorbance to that of a Trolox solution. The results were calculated and plotted with respect to the concentrations of BHT, ascorbic acid, and RCE and expressed in mg/mL of Trolox antioxidant equivalent per gram.
