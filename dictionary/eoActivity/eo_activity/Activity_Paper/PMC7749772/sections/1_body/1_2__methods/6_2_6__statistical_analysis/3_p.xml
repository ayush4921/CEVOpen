<p>For assessment of noninferiority, a comparison between the THF-6 group and the diclofenac group on VAS pain was conducted, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 10 mm [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Noninferiority was declared if the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the MD of VAS pain did not exceed a margin of 10 mm.
