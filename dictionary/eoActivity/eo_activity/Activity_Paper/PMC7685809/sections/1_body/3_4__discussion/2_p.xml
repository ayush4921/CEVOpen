<p>In this study, we first isolated and purified the polysaccharide IOP from Inonotus obliquus fungus and investigated its effect on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of osteosarcoma MG-63 cells and U2OS cells in vitro. CCK-8 experiments showed that IOP significantly inhibited the proliferation of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells. In particular, when the concentration of IOP was greater than 80â€‰/mL, the proliferation activity of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells was significantly downregulated compared with the control group. Similarly, cell scratch experiments have confirmed that IOP has a significant inhibitory effect on the migration capacity of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells, transwell experiments have shown that IOP has a significant inhibitory effect on the invasiveness of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells, and further apoptosis experiments have demonstrated that IOP can promote the apoptosis of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells. Therefore, taken all these together, our functional experiments showed that IOP has obvious antitumor activity on osteosarcoma cells and has the potential for clinical application in osteosarcoma treatment.</p>
