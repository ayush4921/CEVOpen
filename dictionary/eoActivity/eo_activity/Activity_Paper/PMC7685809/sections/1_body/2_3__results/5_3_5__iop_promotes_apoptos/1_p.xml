<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, after adding IOP to MG-63 cells and U2OS cells at different concentrations (80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), compared with the control group, the apoptosis rate of the cells was significantly increased in the 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), which was also in a dose-dependent manner. This result indicates that IOP can promote the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells.
