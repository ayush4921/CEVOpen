<p>IOP was extracted according to the method of Xu et al. [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. First, use the savage method to dissolve and remove the protein of Inonotus obliquus, then dialysis with tap water for 24 hours, and then with distilled water for 12 hours. The crude polysaccharide was centrifuged, lyophilized, and further purified in an anion exchange DEAE cellulose column (50cm × 2.6cm). Elute with 0 M, 0.25 m, and 0.5 m NaCl solution at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Elute with 0.15 m NaCl solution in a Sephadex G-200 gel column (1.6cm × 40cm) at a flow rate of 0.18 ml/min. Collect the IOP, make it into a lyophilized powder, and store in an airtight container at 4°C.
