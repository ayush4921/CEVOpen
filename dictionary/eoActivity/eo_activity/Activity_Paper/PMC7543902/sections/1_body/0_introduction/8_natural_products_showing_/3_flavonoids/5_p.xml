 <bold>14</bold>) (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ) are strong inhibitors of SARS-CoV helicase and their effect is mediated through inhibition of ATPase activity. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of myricetin and scutellarein 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> were 2.71 ± 0.19 μM and 0.86 ± 0.48 μM, respectively [

 <bold>13</bold>) nor scutellarein (
 <bold>14</bold>) can affect the growth of MCF10A cells at cellular concentrations close to their IC50′
 <sub>s</sub> [
