<p id="par0075">The expression of nucleocapsid (N) protein essential for MERS-CoV replication was decreased after resveratrol treatment, down regulating the apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Resveratrol also has been found to inhibit herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) replication in a dose-dependent, and reversible manner [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In several toxicity studies, resveratrol was orally administrated at its maximum tolerated doses to access its adverse effects; the results show the lack of carcinogenicity. Reports revealed the absence of acute skin and eye irritation or other allergenicity signs that could be caused by the compound. Despite being an estrogen-like compound, studies provide further evidence that 
 <italic>trans</italic>-resveratrol has low estrogenic potency 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [

 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Resveratrol is widely available on red wine extract, grape seed extract, and Japanese knotweed extract and others. Most supplements on the market are derived from Japanese knotweed as it has the highest concentrations of resveratrol in nature [
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Commercial dietary supplements contain an average between 50â€“500 mg of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-resveratrol (
 <bold>11</bold>), human clinical studies have also been performed up to single doses of 5 g of resveratrol without observing adverse effects [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These data suggest that 
 <italic>trans</italic>-resveratrol (
 <bold>11</bold>) is well tolerated in humans and that 450 mg/day can represent a safe dose for a 70 kg individual [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Resveratrol has low systemic bioavailability and is available in solution form and as a transdermal patch, however, its safety and effectiveness have not been approved by the FDA [
