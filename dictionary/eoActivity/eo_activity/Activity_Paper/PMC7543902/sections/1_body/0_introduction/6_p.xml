<p id="par0025">Drugs currently being investigated for the possibility of use against CoV disease include monoclonal antibodies, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as protease, helicase, and polymerase inhibitors, and immunomodulators such as interferons and corticosteroids. Challenges in the development of CoV antivirals are both general to RNA viruses and specific to CoVs. The process of replication of positive-sense RNA virus genomes is generally characterized by high error rates, high viral yields, short replication times, and abundant homologous and nonhomologous recombination [

Given the urgency of the COVID-19 outbreak, we focus here in this report, on the potential to repurpose existing natural antiviral and anticancer agents with established activity against various coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [
