<p>Network pharmacological analysis revealed that 8 key compounds in 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> and 
 <italic>Astragalus mongholicus</italic> targeted 27 genes and the biochemical pathways in CHD they are involved in. The genes TNF, IL-6, NFKB1, ALB, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, APOA1, and APOA2 might be important targets of the key active compounds neocryptotanshinone II and astragaloside II. The genes targeted by these key active compounds might regulate inflammation-related pathways and the level of albumin and cholesterol in CHD.
