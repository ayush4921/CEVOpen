<p>The recruitment of inflammatory cells to injured vascular tissues could contribute to the formation of plaques by secreting inflammatory mediators. Therefore, inflammatory markers have been considered as risk factors for CHD [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine secreted by activated macrophages and lymphocytes; the risk factors of CHD might elevate IL-6 levels. Social disruption stress showed effects on the increase of atherosclerotic plaque areas in apolipoprotein E
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, probably by upregulating IL-6 levels [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Danesh et al. showed that there were significant correlations between elevated IL-6 levels and increased CHD risk, suggesting an underlying relevance of pathways involving IL-6 in the pathogenesis of CHD [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hou et al. indicated that circulating IL-6 was associated with different kinds of cardiovascular diseases and that IL-6 showed an effect on platelets which were essential for blood coagulation [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hot et al. demonstrated that IL-17 coupled with TNF

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, several genes (TNF, IL-6, NFKB1, etc.) regulated by neocryptotanshinone II were implicated in inflammation-related pathways, such as the IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, and Th17 cell differentiation pathway. Therefore, we speculated that neocryptotanshinone II exerted pharmacological activities on CHD by regulating inflammatory cytokines and their signaling pathways.
