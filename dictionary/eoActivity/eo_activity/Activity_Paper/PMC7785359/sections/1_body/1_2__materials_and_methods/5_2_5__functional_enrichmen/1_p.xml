<p>The gene ontology (GO) functional network analysis was conducted using the ClueGO + CluePedia plugins [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] of Cytoscape with the parameter setting as biological process, adjusted 
 <italic>P</italic> value ≤0.01, and default GO level (global option GO levels 3–8) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The GO functional network was visualized using Cytoscape. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were enriched using clusterProfiler in the R package, and the significant pathways were selected with 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01.
