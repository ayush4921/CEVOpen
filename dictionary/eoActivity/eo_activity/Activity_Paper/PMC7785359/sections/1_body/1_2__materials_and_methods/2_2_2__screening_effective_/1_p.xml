<p>All the components were screened using the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) model [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] from the TCMSP database. OB is one of the most important pharmacokinetic parameters, and components with more than 30% OB are considered to have high bioavailability, a crucial index in evaluating the DL of a potentially effective component. Compounds with a threshold of OB ≥ 30 and DL ≥ 0.18 were screened as effective components.
