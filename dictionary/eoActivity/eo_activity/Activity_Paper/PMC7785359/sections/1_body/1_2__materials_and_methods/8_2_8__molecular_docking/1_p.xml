<p>The three-dimensional (3D) structures of the key target proteins were downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>) and were modified by removing the ligand and water molecules, adding nonpolar hydrogens, amino acid optimization, and calculating Gasteiger charges using AutoDock 4.2 software. The SDF structures of the compounds were downloaded from the PubChem Compound database (

Molecular docking simulations were performed using AutoDock 4.2.6 with the compounds as ligands.
