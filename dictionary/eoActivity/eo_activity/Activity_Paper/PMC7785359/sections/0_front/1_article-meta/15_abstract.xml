 <p>This study aimed to investigate the potential targets and pathways of qi-replenishing, spleen-strengthening, phlegm-dispelling, and blood-nourishing Fufang in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). The composition of Fufang was identified, followed by screening of the active components using ADME. The targets of active components were predicted and screened based on the TCMSP and BATMAN databases and were cross-validated using the CTD database and DisGeNET. A functional enrichment analysis was performed using the ClueGO + CluePedia plugins and clusterProfiler in the R package. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database and Cytoscape. Finally, a pharmacological network was constructed. A total of 27 overlapping targets were obtained after cross-validation. ALB, IL-6, and TNF were the hub genes in the PPI network. The pharmacological network included 59 nodes and 189 relation pairs. Among the 59 nodes, there were 2 herbal medicine nodes (
  <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> and 
  <italic>Astragalus mongholicus</italic>), 8 chemical component nodes (magnesium lithospermate B, neocryptotanshinone II, heteratisine, daphneolone, tanshinone IIA, tanshinone IIB, soyasapogenol B, and astragaloside II), 27 target protein nodes (such as ALB, TNF, IL-6, NFKB1, APOA1, APOA2, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2), and 22 pathway nodes (such as the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway). Therefore, we found that the genes TNF, IL-6, NFKB1, ALB, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, APOA1, and APOA2 might be important targets of the key active compounds neocryptotanshinone II and astragaloside II. These genes targeted by the key active compounds might regulate inflammation-related pathways and the level of albumin and cholesterol in CHD.
