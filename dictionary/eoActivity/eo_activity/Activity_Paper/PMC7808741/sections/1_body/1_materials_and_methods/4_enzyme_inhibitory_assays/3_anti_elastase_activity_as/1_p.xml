 <italic>N</italic>-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-
 <italic>p</italic>-nitroanilide (SANA) 1 mM was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer 50 mM (pH 8.0), knowing that 1 U enzyme (elastase) converts 1 mol of SANA per minute in this buffer at 25 °C. Ursolic acid (100 g/mL) was used as positive control with reported IC

 </xref>, and the sample solvent (DMSO 1% (v/v) in Tris-HCl buffer) as negative control. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 L of SANA and 150 L of Tris-HCl buffer followed by addition of elastase (6 U) and the samples (100 g/mL). The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Formation of 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitroaniline from SANA hydrolysis was detected from absorbance measurements at 405 nm, performed immediately after starting the reaction and then every 30 s for 3 min, in a microplate reader (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). All assays were performed in triplicate. Results were expressed as percentage inhibition (%) according to
