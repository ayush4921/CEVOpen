<p>Further evaluation of the effects on tyrosinase activity of isolated compounds from both organic and aqueous extracts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(C)</xref>) confirm some of the high inhibition values previously found for the extracts. Notably, the abietane diterpenes (
 <bold>1</bold>), (
 <bold>3</bold>) and (
 <bold>4</bold>) present mainly in 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> organic extracts, are able to inhibit tyrosinase activity in more than 46% and up to 75%. Moreover, it is possible to better understand the activity of the 
 <italic>P. porcatus</italic> aqueous extract according to the result obtained for compound (
 <bold>9</bold>) which inhibited tyrosinase activity by 43.9 1.3%. Although this compound is mainly isolated from the acetone extract of 
 <italic>P. porcatus</italic>, which showed low tyrosinase inhibition (28.8 3.4%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>), its presence in the aqueous extract cannot be excluded since the microwave aqueous extraction method has a higher efficiency in the recovery of bioactive compounds

 </xref>. Additionally, (
 <bold>16</bold>) and (
 <bold>17</bold>) were able to inhibit tyrosinase by 47.9 1.4% and 40.4 0.7%, respectively. However, these compounds are not present in high amounts in 
 <italic>P. porcatus</italic> aqueous extracts, therefore it can only be suggested that the extract activity was probably due to the presence of compound (
 <bold>9</bold>). Overall, the results suggest that 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. polyphenols and abietane diterpenes are capable of inhibiting tyrosinase being almost as efficient as kojic acid used as positive control.
