<p>In summary, all the plants had antioxidant properties, with methanolic extract having the highest scavenging activity compared to other organic extracts. The organic extracts showed promising results. 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> acetonic extract, 
 <italic>P. eckolonii</italic> methanolic extract and 
 <italic>P. saccatus</italic> acetonic extract showed high tyrosinase inhibition. The aqueous extracts were not good inhibitors, except for 
 <italic>P. porcatus</italic> extract which was better than the other plants extracts. The isolated compounds (
 <bold>1</bold>), (
 <bold>3</bold>) and (
 <bold>4</bold>), from both organic and aqueous extracts, were able to inhibit tyrosinase. The organic extract showed high collagenase inhibition, the highest anti-collagenase activity was observed for 
 <italic>P. neochilus</italic> methanolic extract. For the aqueous extracts, 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> showed the highest inhibition. Compounds (
 <bold>3</bold>), (
 <bold>4</bold>) and (
 <bold>17</bold>) also showed good inhibition.
