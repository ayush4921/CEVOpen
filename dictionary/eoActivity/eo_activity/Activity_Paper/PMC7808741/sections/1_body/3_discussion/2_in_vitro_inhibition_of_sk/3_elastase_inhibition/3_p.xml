<p>The results on 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(B)</xref> reveal that the aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. plants were not effective as elastase inhibitors (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), being the 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> aqueous extract the only one able to inhibit the elastase enzyme, by 23.8 10.0% (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). This result can be attributed to different and decreased synergy of the polyphenols present in 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> aqueous extract, in comparison with the remaining aqueous extracts

 </xref>. Nevertheless, the isolated compounds from both organic and aqueous extracts were further assessed for their ability to inhibit elastase activity (
