<p>In general, both organic and aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. exerted an inhibitory effect on collagenase, thus isolated compounds were further tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(C)</xref> in order to determine their contribution for the enzymatic inhibition observed. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(C)</xref>, the diterpene abietanes (
 <bold>3</bold>) and (
 <bold>4</bold>) mainly isolated from organic extracts along with (
 <bold>17</bold>), the major polyphenol present in the aqueous extracts, showed the highest ability for collagenase inhibition. Notably, compound (
 <bold>4</bold>) was found to inhibit ChC by 84.6 5.9%, being almost as efficient as positive control EGCG (93.1 5.3%). To our knowledge, this is the first report on the 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> inhibition of ChC by diterpenes with an abietane backbone.
