<p>Verma [
 <xref rid="B140-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>] tested petroleum ether and chloroform extracts of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> in 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic>-infected mice and showed that its bark actively inhibits parasitemia. Simonsen et al. [
 <xref rid="B142-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>] also reported that a crude extract of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> bark has 
 <italic>significant vitro</italic> anti-plasmodial activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 28 Î¼g/mL against a chloroquine-susceptible strain of 
 <italic>P. falciparum.</italic> The stem, root and seeds of this plant are reported to contain a large amount of steroidal alkaloid compounds i.e., conessine, kurchine, conessidine, isoconessine, conkurchicine, and holarrhimine. The chemical compound that is thought to be responsible for the antimalarial activity is conessine, isolated from its stem [

 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> inhibits 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> growth with a 43% suppression rate [
