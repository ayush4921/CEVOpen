<p>Another similar group of natural products; mokluangin A-C and antidysentericine, also exhibited AChE inhibition with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> range of 1.44 to 23.22 μM by the presence of a carboxylic group (-C=O) at C-18 and C-20 on the pyrrolidine ring, and a -CH3 group at C-10 on the steroid moiety [

 <sub>50</sub> = 23.22 μM) compared to mokluangin C (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.44 μM), mokluangin A (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.12 μM) and antidysentericine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.09 μM), which have a -C=O at C-18 and a -CH
 <sub>3</sub> group at C-20 (

Additionally, Zhao’s research demonstrated that the novel steroid-alkaloid conessine potentially crosses the brain-blood barrier at a higher rate in human and mice brain than the imidazole-containing compounds thiopermide and ciproxican, based on a cell and tissue functional assay [
