<p>The gut motility activity of 
 <italic>H. pubescens was</italic> investigated by Gilani et al., [
 <xref rid="B128-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. They investigated the mechanism behind this activity of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> by testing extracts on high K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contractions. The high K
 <sup>+</sup> (&gt; 30â€‰mM) causes contraction of smooth muscles by opening L-type Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channels, thus allowing entry of Ca
 <sup>++</sup> in the cell and producing a contractile effect. Thus, an inhibitor of K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contraction is an inhibitor of the Ca
 <sup>++</sup> influx. In their study, hydro-ethanolic crude extract of 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> relaxed the high K+-induced contractions just like a standard Ca++ antagonist. Thus, it was concluded that it effectively causes Ca
 <sup>++</sup> channel blocking. Therefore, these extracts may be effective for treating gut disorders such as abdominal cramps and diarrhea.
