 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> are important nosocomial pathogen, and treatment options are limited. Their resistance mechanisms include the production of beta-lactamases, efflux pumps, and target-site or outer membrane modifications. When tested at 250 μg/mL, the 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> ethanol extract showed low intrinsic antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and significantly enhanced the activity of the antibiotic novobiocin (concentration = 1 μg/mL, 1/8th of its MIC). Moreover, the extract at 7.8 μg/mL, confirmed resistance-modifying ability (RMA) and may be a candidate as an alternative treatment for MDR infections due to 
 <italic>A. baumannii</italic> [

Novobiocin was chosen because of its weak antibacterial activity against Gram-negative pathogens due to an effective permeability barrier. Interestingly, when tested at different concentration using a two-fold dilution starting from 250 µg/mL, the ethanol extract enhanced the inhibitory effects of novobiocin as well as synergetic effects against all tested clinical isolates [

However, the authors observed no enhancement of the accumulation of ethidium bromide after treatment with the extract, suggesting that it does not act by inhibiting MDR pumps. However, it weakened the outer membrane of the pathogen as exhibited by an increase in the N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine uptake [
