<p>Nondo et al. [
 <xref rid="B141-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] reported that ethanol and methanol extracts exhibit significant antiplasmodial activity against 
 <italic>Plasmodium (P.) falciparum</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.43 μg/mL and 2.05 μg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the fractions isolated from 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> roots are highly active against chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (K1, Dd2) and artemisinin-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Another study [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-01341" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], showed that the steroidal alkaloid conessine isolated from 
 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> bark showed anti-plasmodial activity with an IC₅₀ value of 1.9 μg/mL.
