 <italic>H. pubescens</italic> has demonstrated biological properties. Other major bioactive components are holarrhemine, conkurchine, kurchicine, holarrhenine, kurchine, and conkurchinine. From our brief overview, it is evident that several in vitro effects of crude extracts were reported, but in most cases further work is required to isolate and characterize the bioactive compounds. Moreover, except for the antimicrobial and acetylcholinesterase/neuroprotective activity, all other ones need further follow-up, with the mechanism of action and structure-activity relationship studies to assess more fully their potential as drug candidates.
