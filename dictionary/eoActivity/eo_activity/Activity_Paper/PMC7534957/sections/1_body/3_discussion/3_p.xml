<p>Overall, these results suggest that rutin, nicotiflorin, and their putative human metabolites, can play a key role as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. Such derivatives, which are expected in plasma, are in fact the most likely compounds for targeting these viral proteins, via oral intake of these flavonoid glycosides. However, at least for rutin, intravenous or intranasal administration can be an alternative for prompt bioavailability, without risk of digestive degradation. Our results, and much of the reported data, suggest rutin and nicotiflorin as possible alternatives for combating the COVID-19 virus. Rutin could even be considered an alternative to LMWH, given its anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory effects and its potential protection against ALI. Obviously, further researches, mainly

 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, are necessary to corroborate the docking results reported here, as well as the adequate application of these substances. Furthermore, it is necessary to investigate the risks of 
 <italic>D. ambrosioides</italic> as a phytomedicine for use against COVID-19.
