 <italic>Molecular docking with 3CLpro (main protease</italic> - 
 <italic>Mpro)</italic> - Docking analysis applied to the 3CLpro protein revealed close scoring function values for rutin (-9.2 kcal/mol), nicotiflorin (-8.9 kcal/mol), and the previously described inhibitor X77 (redocking binding free energy = -8.4 kcal/mol, RMSD = 0.8909 Ã…), which suggests the establishment of favorable interactions for the ligand-3CLpro complex. Moreover, glucuronide derivatives from rutin (-8.4 to -8.5 kcal/mol) and nicotiflorin (-8.0 to -8.3 kcal/mol) presented binding free energies similar to X77. Also, the binding free energies for all sulfate derivatives (-8.1 to 8.4 kcal/mol), except 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfates (-7.3 to -7.6 kcal/mol), were close to value for X77. By their turn, quercetin (-7.5 kcal/mol) and kaempferol (-7.2 kcal/mol) presented similar binding free energies to 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-sulfates derivatives.
