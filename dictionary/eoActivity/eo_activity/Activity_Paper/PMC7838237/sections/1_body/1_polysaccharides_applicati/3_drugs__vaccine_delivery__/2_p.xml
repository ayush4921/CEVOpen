<p id="Par12">Polysaccharides-based nanoparticles are gaining more attention as nanometric carriers for the drug delivery system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Polycations, which are prepared by reductive amination reaction between primary amines and periodate oxidized polysaccharides, are considered a new class of non-viral gene delivery systems, cationic polysaccharides are also used as gene transfection vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Hydrogels based on cross-linked polysaccharides are used in key applications, such as drug delivery systems and tissue engineering [
