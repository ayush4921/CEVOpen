<p id="Par13">The tumor is a major health problem, and a leading cause of death worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] antitumor activities can be found in many plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and marine polysaccharides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A wide variety of natural polysaccharides proved to be effective antitumor agents, e.g., lentinan and schizophyllan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It has been indicated that polysaccharide-protein conjugate has antitumor activity and can also enhance the activity of conventional chemotherapeutical drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Recently, many researches have proved the immunosuppressive activity of polysaccharides against tumor growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Mushrooms are rich sources of many therapeutic agents and have been used for a long time as food and medicinal agents, regardless of the differences in the chemical structures and conjugated parts. It has been established that natural polysaccharides derived from mushrooms have been extensively studied for their potent antitumor and pharmaceutical activity activities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Examples of polysaccharides from mushrooms include 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> which proved to have potent in vitro immune activation, and antitumor activity on the breast cancer cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], and 
 <italic>Lentinus edodes</italic>, which exhibited a marked antitumor effect against subcutaneously transplanted sarcoma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Polysaccharides derived from mushrooms can produce their antitumor effects through the following proposed mechanisms oncogenesis prevention, immune system enhancement, and induce apoptosis of tumor cells through its direct tumor-inhibitory effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Besides the antitumor activity, mushrooms polysaccharides exhibit a wide range of therapeutic activities and are used in clinical trials to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents and minimize their side effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Algae polysaccharides are also of great importance because they have a diversity of pharmacological activities, including antitumor activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Polysaccharides activate effector cells, such as macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells to express cytokines, such as TNF-α, IFN-c, and IL-1β, cytokines invariably possess antiproliferative activity, cause apoptosis and differentiation in tumor cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), and also secrete products like reactive nitrogen, oxygen intermediates, and interleukins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. Nanoparticles covered with saccharides display a higher circulation lifetime in the bloodstream. Additionally, they significantly accumulate in tumor tissues [
