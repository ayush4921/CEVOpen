<p id="Par18">Among the diversity of polysaccharides properties, anticoagulant activity was extensively studied, unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins are sulfated polysaccharides that used as anticoagulant drugs, but unfortunately, they have side effects like bleeding and thrombocytopenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. It was proved that polysaccharides, specially sulfated polysaccharides, have many biological activities like anti-tumor, antioxidant, and anticoagulant activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The high content of sulfate is a key factor in the anticoagulant activity of these sulfated polysaccharides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. Natural polysaccharides obtained from different marine sources like shellfish (shrimp, crab, squilla, lobster, and crayfish, etc.), marine macroalgae (seaweeds), marine fungi, microalgae, and corals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], and plant-derived polysaccharide, e.g., pectin, could be considered as potential anticoagulant agents [
