<p>More phytochemical analyses should be performed to identify more potent bioactive compounds from these plants. From these single chemical entities, it is possible to perform quantitative structural activity analysis to find out the potency of the fraction leading to the synthesis of more active compounds for drug development. Alternatively, through a systematic approach, one can prepare a reproducible and stable active extract for the development of a patentable product without adverse effects. Furthermore, the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of these active extracts should be further explored to correlate the in vitro effects with in vivo efficacy and set a basis for clinical studies. In conclusion, the genus 
 <italic>Curcuma</italic> is a treasure waiting for researchers interested in the development of safe and effective anti-inflammatory agents. Further studies on this genus will extend their clinical applications. The combined use of natural phytochemicals identified with other anti-inflammatory agents will open a new area of research.
