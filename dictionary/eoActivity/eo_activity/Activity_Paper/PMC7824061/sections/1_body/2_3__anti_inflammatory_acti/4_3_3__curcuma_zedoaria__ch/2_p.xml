<p>One of the studies demonstrated the significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) anti-inflammatory effects of all extracts from it, except methanol extract, in albino rats that were given carrageenan and histamine, resulting in hind paw edema. The effects were compared to a 10 mg/kg indomethacin intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) and 200 mg/kg of rumalaya forte, but amongst these extracts, 200 mg/kg of petroleum ether and 400 mg/kg of chloroform extracts exerted the greatest anti-inflammatory activity during the second to sixth hours [

 <italic>C. zedoaria</italic> has also shown significant anti-inflammatory activity against the same study model [

 <italic>C. zedoaria</italic> possesses significant anti-inflammatory activity against a carrageenan-induced inflammatory response in rats in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the plant may possess one or more secondary metabolite(s) that have central and peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity [
