<p>Inflammation is a pattern of response to injury, which involves the accumulation of cells, exudates in irritated tissue, which allows protection from further damage. A variety of in vitro and in vivo experiments has shown that certain flavonoids and saponins possess anti-inflammatory activity [

 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] studied the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of methanol and butanol extracts and two saponins, viz. balanin-B1 and balanin-B2, isolated from 
 <italic>B. aegyptiaca</italic> bark in rats with edema induced by carrageenin. Both extracts exhibited a significant reduction of rat paw edema. The inhibition produced by methanol extract, butanol extract, balanin-B1 and balanin-B2 were 32%, 68%, 62% and 59%, respectively. Likewise, the influence of seed oil on liver and kidney fractions in rat serum was evaluated [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Seed oil (100 mg/kg) in the rat diet decreased nitrogen oxide and lipid peroxidation. Further, mRNA and protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-Î± and interleukin-6 were downregulated, leading to a reduction of cyclooxygenase-2, reflecting anti-inflammatory activity.
