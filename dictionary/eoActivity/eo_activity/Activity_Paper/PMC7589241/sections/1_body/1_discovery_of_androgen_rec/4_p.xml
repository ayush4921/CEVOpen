<p>In round 3, the reaction array harnessed, in addition to 
 <bold>A1</bold> and 
 <bold>A3</bold>, four additional structurally related substrates (
 <bold>A1a</bold>, 
 <bold>b</bold> and 
 <bold>A3a</bold>, 
 <bold>b</bold>). The substrates were each treated with a dirhodium carboxylate catalyst (6 alternatives) in a specific solvent (3 alternatives). After screening at tenfold lower concentration (total product concentration: 0.1 μM; Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, right), the most promising reactions were scaled up, and the products purified and structurally elucidated (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). All three products were found to be sub‐micromolar modulators of AR: the agonists 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> and the partial agonist 
 <bold>2</bold>. Crucially, none of the ligands were based on scaffolds with any previously annotated activity against AR.
