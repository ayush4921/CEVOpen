<p>The hit reactions from all three rounds were scaled up, and the products purified, structurally elucidated and characterised. It would found that the fragment 
 <bold>4</bold> could be productively grown by cyclopropanation (→
 <bold>5</bold>, round 1; →
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold> or 
 <bold>9</bold>, round 2), C−H insertion into indole (→
 <bold>6</bold>, round 1), O−H insertion (→
 <bold>10</bold>, round 3) or reaction with a nitrile (→
 <bold>11</bold>, round 3). ADS had thus enabled fragment growth to afford four distinct chemotypes in parallel, and the yields of bioactive products were always good. The activity of the fragment 
 <bold>4</bold> had been improved ∼125‐fold in the case of the most active product 
 <bold>11</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub>=730 nM).
