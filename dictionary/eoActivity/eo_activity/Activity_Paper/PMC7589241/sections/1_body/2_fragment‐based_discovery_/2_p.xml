<p>In round 1, 192 of the 480 possible combinations of the 4 α‐diazo substrates (
 <bold>B1</bold>–
 <bold>4</bold>), 9 co‐substrates (
 <bold>C1</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold>; plus no co‐substrate), 6 dirhodium catalysts and two solvents were explored. After screening the product mixtures at a total product concentration of 10 μM, hit reactions were found that involved the diazo substrate 
 <bold>B1</bold> and either cyclohexene (
 <bold>C1</bold>) or indole (
