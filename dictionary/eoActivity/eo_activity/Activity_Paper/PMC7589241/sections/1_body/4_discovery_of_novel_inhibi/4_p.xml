<p>The intermolecular hit reactions from round 1 informed the design of a second array of 196 reactions. The array exploited six diazo substrates (including the new substrates 
 <bold>F3a</bold>, 
 <bold>F2a</bold> and 
 <bold>F7a</bold>), 16 co‐substrates (including 11 new co‐substrates) and the same two dirhodium catalysts. After screening, six additional hit reactions were identified (Figure
