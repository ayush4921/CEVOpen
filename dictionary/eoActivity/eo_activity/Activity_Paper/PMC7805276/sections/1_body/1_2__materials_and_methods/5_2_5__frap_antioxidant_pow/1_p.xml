<p>The Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power was determined as previously described [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Appropriately diluted aliquots of the plant extracts (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were mixed with 1800 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of freshly prepared FRAP solution. The FRAP solution contained 3.75 mL of 10 mM TPTZ in 40 mM HCl, 3.75 mL of 20 mM iron(III) chloride solution, and 37.5 mL of a 0.3 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6). The mixtures were allowed to stand for 10 minutes at room temperature before the absorbance was measured at 593 nm using a spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity was expressed as ascorbic acid equivalents (AAE 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/g sample) and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC 
 <italic>μ</italic>mol/g sample) using an ascorbic acid and Trolox standard curve.
