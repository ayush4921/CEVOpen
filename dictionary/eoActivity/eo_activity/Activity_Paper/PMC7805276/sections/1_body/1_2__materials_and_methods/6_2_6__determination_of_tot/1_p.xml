<p>The total phenolic content (TPC) of the plant extract was determined with the method of Scalbert et al. with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. 0.5 mL of the extract was mixed with 2.5 mL of a 10-fold diluted Folin–Ciocalteu's phenol reagent and 2 mL of 7.5% sodium carbonate solution in the test tube and shaken vigorously. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, absorbance was recorded at 760 nm with a spectrophotometer. The total phenolics content in the extract was calculated and expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE mg/g sample) using a gallic acid standard curve. Analyses were run in triplicate and the results were expressed as average with the standard deviations.
