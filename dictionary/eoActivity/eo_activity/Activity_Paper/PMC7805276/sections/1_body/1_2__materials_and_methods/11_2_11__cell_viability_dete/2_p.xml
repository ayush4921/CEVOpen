<p>Cell viability was determined using the MTT reduction assay (Abcam). After treatment with extracts, cells were incubated with culture media supplemented with MTT reagent for 3h at 37°C. Then, the culture media supplemented with MTT reagent was removed, and MTT solvent was added to the wells. The plate was covered with foil and was shaken for 15 minutes on an orbital shaker. The absorbance was read at 590 nm in a Synergy H1 microplate reader. Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of the absorbance of the treated cells in relation to the absorbance of control cells. Four independent experiments were conducted.</p>
