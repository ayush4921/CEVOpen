<p>Radical scavenging activity against the stable radical 1,1-diphenyl,2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>) (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, USA) was conducted as previously described [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], to estimate the antioxidant potential of the three extracts. Serial dilutions of all extracts were prepared. In short, an aliquot of 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of diluted extract was added to 975 
 <italic>μ</italic>L DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> solution (2 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M) and the mixture was vortexed and kept at room temperature. The decrease in the absorbance was determined at 517 nm, by using a U-2000 Hitachi spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), in a 10 mm quartz cuvette. The absorbance of the DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> radical without any extract was measured. The DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> concentration in the reaction medium was calculated from the calibration curve. For each extract concentration tested, the percentage of DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> remaining in the steady state, was calculated in the following way:
