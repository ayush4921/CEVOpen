<p>Similar results to the FRAP assay were produced with the DCFDA assay where the ability of the various SF extracts to scavenge ROS in living cells was demonstrated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All three SF extracts of this study were able to significantly reduce ROS presence in SH-SY5Y cells treated with TBHP, with the most efficient one being the SFM. The optimal SF concentrations for each extract, in terms of antioxidant activity, were 50 and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. In lower extracts' concentrations (2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), ROS levels appear higher, showing a dose-dependent antioxidant impact of the extracts. Remarkably, in the presence of the oxidant TBHP, treatment with SFM (at 50 or 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), or SFD (at 50 or 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), dropped ROS levels much lower than of cells not treated with TBHP.
