<p>All the fractions from the plant material were evaluated for their antioxidant activity using various assays. Radical scavenging activity expressed as EC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 0.336 to 1.477 mg dry extract/mg DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>. In particular, the SFD fraction possessed the greatest antiradical activity, followed by the SFM. The weakest antioxidant was the SFP fraction. Trolox, known for its good antioxidant activity, was used as standard, and in comparison with the SF extracts, only the SFD extract exceeded approximately half the value of Trolox's antiradical potential (
