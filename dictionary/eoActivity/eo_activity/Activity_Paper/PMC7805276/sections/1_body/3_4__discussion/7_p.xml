<p>According to this study, specific SF extracts display a statistically important neuroprotective effect in concentrations of 20 to 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (the SFD at 20 and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and the SFP at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). In smaller concentrations, the protective effect against A
 <italic>β</italic> neurotoxicity tends to fade away, while in higher concentrations cytotoxic effects antagonize with the extracts' neuroprotective potential. Similar competition phenomena in relatively high concentrations have been observed in other plant species extracts, such as extracts derived from 
 <italic>Frankenia thymifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Caliphruria subedentata</italic>, 
 <italic>Piper sarmentosum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sasa senanensis</italic> [
