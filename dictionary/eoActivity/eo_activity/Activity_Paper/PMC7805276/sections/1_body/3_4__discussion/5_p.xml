<p>These findings confirm the difficulty in evaluating the antioxidant potential of a plant tissue or product by using only one single assay and highlight the need to employ various methods to truly uncover the antioxidant capacity of a sample, possibly due to the different mechanisms underlying each assay [

 <sup>•</sup>, FRAP, and DCFDA) confirm that the SF extracts of this study exhibit important antioxidant activity and add to the previous reports of SF extracts of various regions possessing similar properties [
