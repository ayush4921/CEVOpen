 <sup>2</sup>) were found to be 0.955 and 0.912, respectively. The statistical analysis showed a positive and significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) correlation between TPC and RSC, which supports the role of glucose in the synthesis of various phenolic compounds. The two basic pathways for the synthesis of plant phenolic compounds are the shikimic acid pathway and the acetate-malonate (polyketide) pathway. The shikimic acid pathway requires substrates such as erythrose-4-phosphate from the pentose phosphate pathway and phosphoenolpyruvate from glycolysis. These pathways, which are involved in the synthesis of substrates, utilize glucose as a first pivotal molecule [
