<p>The RSC in the present studied plant samples has not been reported till date. The RSC in plant samples may vary depending upon genotype, age of the plant, soil quality, geographical location, climatic conditions, cultivation method, and abiotic stress [

The determination of RSC in the plant helps to quantify the degree of acrylamide formation in plant-derived food cooked with high heat, which subsequently helps in determining the quality of food and improving the health of an individual [
