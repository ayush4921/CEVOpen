<p>The extraction yield of various plant samples is given in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Among the different plant samples tested, the extraction yield was found highest in 
 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic> and lowest in 
 <italic>A. erubescens.</italic> The extraction yield of 
 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic> was almost 2.6 times greater than 
 <italic>A. erubescens.</italic> The reasons behind these differences in the extraction yield values are attributed to the fact that there is a variation in bioactive compounds in between plant samples and these bioactive compounds have different solubility profiles in the extraction solvent. The greater the solubility profile of the bioactive compounds in the extraction solvent, the greater will be the extraction yield value and vice versa [
