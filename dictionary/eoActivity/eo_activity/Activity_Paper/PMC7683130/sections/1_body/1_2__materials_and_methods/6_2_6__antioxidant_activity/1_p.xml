<p>The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of plant samples was measured according to the method described by Blois [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with slight modification. Different concentrations of plant extracts (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) were prepared by using ethanol. Ascorbic acid was taken as the standard antioxidant. Briefly, an equal volume of plant extract and DPPH solution (60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) were mixed in a test tube. Then, the mixture was left at room temperature in a dark condition for 30 min. Finally, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer.
