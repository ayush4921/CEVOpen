<p>The vast array of inflammatory cytokines released during sepsis include proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, tissue necrosis factor (TNF)-
 <italic>α</italic>, interferon (IFN)-
 <italic>γ</italic>, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-14, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-
 <italic>β</italic>. The uncontrolled release of these cytokines, which can damage tissue and organ by triggering inflammatory cascade, presents a major threat to sepsis patients [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Another important proinflammatory cytokine—high mobility group box (HMGB)-1, is a late phase mediator of sepsis. Its production is regulated by NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B activation, but the exact mechanism still remains unclear [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. HMGB-1 has pleiotropic effects on different immune cells, triggering the release of proinflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and endothelial cells, as well as inducing the maturation of dendritic cells [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Besides that, sepsis is also linked to prostaglandins (PGs), which are lipid mediators produced by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme in response to inflammation or infection [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Since PGs are involved in various unfavorable outcomes of sepsis, such as impaired tissue perfusion and organ failure, COX inhibitors targeting the inducible form of COX (COX-2) had been tested clinically, but none of the studies reported a promising outcome [
