<p>In order to develop drugs for the treatment of sepsis, several strategies which specifically target sepsis-associated cytokines, inflammatory enzymes, or the coagulation cascade have been attempted. These include TNF-

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but none of these enhanced the survival rate of sepsis patients. Nevertheless, a recombinant form of human activated protein C, drotrecogin alfa (activated), was approved by FDA in 2001 for the treatment of severe sepsis after it was demonstrated to improve the patients' survival rate in the PROWESS trial [

On the contrary, the advantage of using corticosteroids remains elusive as a recent meta-analysis revealed that the use of corticosteroids in critically ill patients with sepsis possibly results in a small reduction in mortality but, at the same time, also possibly increases the risk of neuromuscular weakness [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Two other drugs, thrombomodulin alfa (ART-123) and toraymyxin, are currently in phase III clinical trials, while several others are yet to reach phase III [
