<p>Two other triterpenoids, namely, madecassic acid and asiaticoside G, have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effect 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Won et al. [
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>] reported that madecassic acid had a stronger inhibitory effect on the production of NO, PGE
 <sub>2</sub>, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, and IL-6 in LPS-induced macrophages compared to madecassoside. In addition, asiaticoside G, a new ursane-type triterpenoid glycoside isolated from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> leaves, has been shown to have stronger inhibitory effect against LPS-induced NO and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> production in macrophages compared to asiaticoside and asiatic acid [
 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Thus, it would be interesting to further investigate whether these two compounds have therapeutic effects in sepsis animal models (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).
