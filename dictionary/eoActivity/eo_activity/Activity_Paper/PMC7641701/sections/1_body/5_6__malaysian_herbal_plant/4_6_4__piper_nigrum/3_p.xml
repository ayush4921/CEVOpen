<p>Piperine is the core constituent that gives black pepper its natural aromatic fragrance [
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Piperine injection via intraperitoneal route improved the survival of mice with endotoxemia induced by LPS, as well as reduced serum levels of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Another study showed that intragastric administration of piperine reduced the secretion of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> in mice intraperitoneally infected with 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, suggesting its ability to suppress systemic inflammation caused by bacteria [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. This finding is consistent with results from an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study, whereby piperine also suppressed the release of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> and HMGB-1 by LPS-stimulated macrophages [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Additionally, intraperitoneal injection of piperine also attenuated LPS-induced ALI in mice, most probably due to the reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> [
