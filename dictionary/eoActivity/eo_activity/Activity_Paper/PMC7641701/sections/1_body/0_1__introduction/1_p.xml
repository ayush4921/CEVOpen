<p>The term sepsis was historically used to describe rotting flesh or putrefaction [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the current medical context, sepsis refers to a condition in which dysregulated immune responses towards infection lead to organ failure [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Sepsis may develop secondarily to bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. At present, the terms “sepsis” and “severe sepsis” are used interchangeably, whereas “septic shock” refers to a subset of sepsis which is associated with circulatory and metabolic abnormalities and thus increased risk of mortality [
