<p>Sepsis can be triggered by infectious agents or certain molecules they express, also known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The pathogens or PAMPs may cause direct toxicity and injury to tissues, but in the context of sepsis, the underlying damage is primarily attributed to the immune responses [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The exposure of immune cells to PAMPs, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), will trigger numerous responses in the body, including vasodilation to increase recruitment of immune cells, followed by rapid production of cytokines by activated immune cells to eradicate the invading pathogens [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While such cellular responses are required to remove the pathogens, the same responses could also lead to profound disturbance and harm to the host. Vasodilation may subsequently lead to shock, whereas the cytokine storm may cause tissue damage and eventually leads to organ dysfunction and failure [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is, in essence, a form of “friendly fire” that arises from the body's attempt to eradicate the pathogens.
