<p>In comparison to 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic>, more than one active constituent with antisepsis potential has been identified from 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. Specifically, these constituents are piperine and pellitorine from 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> and asiaticoside and asiatic acid and madecassoside from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>. Piperine was demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting the systemic inflammatory responses induced by LPS as well as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], whereas pellitorine is more likely to be an active compound that protects the endothelial barrier as it has been shown to inhibit vascular endothelial dysfunction, both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Piperine and pellitorine can also be found in the other member within the same genus such as 
 <italic>P. longum</italic>, which is commonly known as long pepper [
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Asiaticoside, asiatic acid, and madecassoside, on the contrary, were demonstrated to protect against organ dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>–
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. These three active principles, together with madecassic acid, are triterpenes that are believed to be the major components that contribute to the medicinal value of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Notably, these active constituents were all given within a similar dose range (1 to 100 mg/kg) via different routes (oral, intragastric, intraperitoneal, and intranasal), except pellitorine which was injected intravenously at a substantially lower dose of 4.5 to 9.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mouse [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This finding indicates that the active compounds may be required at a relatively lower dose to achieve the desired therapeutic effects if they are administered intravenously compared to the other routes.
