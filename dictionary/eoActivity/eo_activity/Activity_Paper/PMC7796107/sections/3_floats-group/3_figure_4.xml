  <p>Chromatograms of high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC), preparative HPLC, and analytical HPLC for the separation and purification of compound 
   <bold>2</bold>. (
   <bold>A</bold>) HSCCC separation of 
   <bold>2</bold> from the mixture of 
   <bold>1</bold> and 
   <bold>2</bold> (
   <bold>C</bold>). The eluate was monitored at 225 nm (line) and 250 nm (rectangle) and was automatically collected according to 250 nm; (
   <bold>D</bold>) Compound 
   <bold>2</bold> separated by HSCCC; (
   <bold>B</bold>) preparative HPLC chromatogram for purification of 
   <bold>2</bold> from impure compound 
   <bold>2</bold> (
   <bold>D</bold>); (
   <bold>E</bold>) HPLC chromatogram of the purified 
   <bold>2</bold> by preparative HPLC. Moreover, compound 
   <bold>2</bold> is later identified as shikimic acid.
