<p>In a single run of polarity-stepwise elution CCC, six compounds with a wide range of polarities were directly separated; however, due to the big difference of the 
 <italic>K</italic> values appeared in these compounds caused by their wide range of polarities, a multi-run of conventional HSCCC would be required for the separation or fractionation of these compounds, which would be quite laborious and time- and solvent-consuming. Nevertheless, the components from natural products, e.g., plant resources, are typically complex and carry a wide range of polarities, and therefore, the separation or fractionation of these compounds is usually difficult. Our result suggested that the polarity-stepwise elution CCC holds the potential to be used for the efficient separation or fractionation of the components with a wide range of polarities from natural products.
