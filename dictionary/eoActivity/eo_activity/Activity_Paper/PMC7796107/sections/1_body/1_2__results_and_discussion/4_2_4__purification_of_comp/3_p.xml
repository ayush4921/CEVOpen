<p>Then, the separation was carried out as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot9dot1-molecules-26-00224">Section 3.9.1</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, about 52.5 mg of compound 
 <bold>7</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>D) was separated from 165 mg of a mixture of 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>C); however, it was not pure at 300 nm, as detected using another HPLC column (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>F). Then, compound 
 <bold>7</bold> was further purified using preparative HPLC, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>B. About 10 mg of high-purity compound 
 <bold>7</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>G) was separated from 50 mg of the impure sample (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>F). Notably, the HPLC peak in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>D at 35 min and the HPLC peak in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f005">Figure 5</xref>F all belong to compound 
 <bold>7</bold>, but they were determined by two different HPLC columns, as described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot6-molecules-26-00224">Section 3.6</xref>.
