<p>A successful pH-zone-refining CCC separation usually relies on the selection of a suitable solvent system that has a satisfactory 
 <italic>K</italic> value under both acidic (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>acid</sub> ≫ 1) and basic (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>basic</sub> ≪ 1) conditions [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00224" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00224-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, three solvent systems were modified with 26 mM of trifluoroacetic acid and 45 mM of ammonia solution, respectively, and then, the modified solvent systems were used to determine the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>acid</sub> values and 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>basic</sub> values of compounds 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold>. Since the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>acid</sub> value (15.80) and 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>basic</sub> value (0.03) that the solvent system 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol/water (1:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) offered were acceptable, the solvent system 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol/water (1:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was selected for pH-zone-refining CCC separation. Briefly, the solvent system 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol/water (1:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) was first partitioned to upper and lower phases, and then the partitioned upper layer was acidified with 26 mM of trifluoroacetic acid to be used as the stationary phase; while the partitioned lower layer was basified with 45 mM of ammonia solution to be used as the mobile phase.
