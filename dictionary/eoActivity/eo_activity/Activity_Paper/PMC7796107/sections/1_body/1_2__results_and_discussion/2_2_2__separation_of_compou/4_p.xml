 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot7dot2-molecules-26-00224">Section 3.7.2</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f002">Figure 2</xref>, compounds 
 <bold>10</bold> (13.4 mg), 
 <bold>6</bold> (18.0 mg), 
 <bold>4</bold> (55.1 mg), 
 <bold>9</bold> (57.8 mg), 
 <bold>3</bold> (27.7 mg), and 
 <bold>8</bold> (42.1 mg), with polarities from low to high, were sequentially separated from the 70% methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic> (2 g, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) by polarity-stepwise elution CCC using mobile phases I to V. The purity of the separated compounds was determined to be 95.8%, 98.9%, 99.7%, 95.1%, 98.4%, and 94.2% for compounds 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, and 
 <bold>10</bold>, respectively, using HPLC at 250 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> were retained in the stationary phase due to their high polarity, which were collected and evaporated (1.320 g, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Moreover, an enrichment of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (56.6 mg, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>E) and compound 
 <bold>7</bold> (172.0 mg, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00224-f003">Figure 3</xref>G) was also achieved by polarity-stepwise elution CCC. The final stationary phase retention ratio was measured to be about 25%. In this stepwise elution CCC separation, mobile phases II to V were individually prepared in glass bottles without mixing with the stationary phase prior to use, thereby reducing the solvents used. However, using the mobile phases that have not previously been saturated (or mixed) with the stationary phase may change the composition of the stationary phase, resulting in the loss of the stationary phase, as happened in this study (the final stationary phase retention ratio was about 25%). Therefore, future CCC separation using this stepwise elution CCC solvent systems is suggested to saturate the mobile phases prior to use by a suitable amount of stationary phase as previously described [
