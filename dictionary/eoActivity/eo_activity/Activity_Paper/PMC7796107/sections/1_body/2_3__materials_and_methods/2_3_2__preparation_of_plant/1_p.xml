<p>The dried leaves of 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic> (331 g) were extracted twice, each time two days, using 4 L of 70% methanol aqueous solution at room temperature (about 25 °C). Then, the extraction solution was combined, filtrated (5 µm, Advantec #2), and evaporated by rotary evaporation at 37 °C to yield about 71 g of dried extract.
