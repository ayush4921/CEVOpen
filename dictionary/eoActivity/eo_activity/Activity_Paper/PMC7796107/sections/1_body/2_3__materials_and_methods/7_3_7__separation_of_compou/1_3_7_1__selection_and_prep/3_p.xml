 <italic>v</italic>) and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/ethyl acetate (3:5,

 <italic>v</italic>), each 1 L, were thoroughly mixed in a separating funnel and separated after settling. The partitioned lower layer, methanol/water (1:5,

 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/ethyl acetate (3:5,

 <italic>v</italic>), was selected as the first step mobile phase, mobile phase I; whereas solvents

 <italic>v</italic>), 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/ethyl acetate (1:5,

 <italic>n</italic>-butanol (4:1, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), each 500 mL, were individually prepared in 1 L glass bottles and selected as mobile phase II, mobile phase III, mobile phase IV, and mobile phase V, respectively. The stationary and mobile phases were degassed by sonication for at least 20 min before use.
