<p>The experimental procedure was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) of Hallym University (approval number Hallym-2016-95). The eye lenses of 10-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats (weight 250–280 g) were removed and kept at −70 °C. For the extraction of AR, the rat eye lenses were grounded in a precooled mortar (−70 °C) and extracted using 0.1 M PBS (pH 6.2; about 0.5 mL of PBS per two frozen rat lenses). Then, they were centrifuged at 10,000×
