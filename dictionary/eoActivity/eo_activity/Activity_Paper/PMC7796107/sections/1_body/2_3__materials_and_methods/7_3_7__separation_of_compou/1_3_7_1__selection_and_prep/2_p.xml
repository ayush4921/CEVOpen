<p>The settling times of each newly paired solvent system, consisting of equal volumes of upper and lower phases (each 3 mL) in a 30 mL glass tube, were checked immediately after vigorous shaking of the solvent system. Additionally, the phase ratio, the upper layer to lower layer, of each newly paired solvent system was also determined. Briefly, equal volumes of upper and lower phases (each 4 mL) were prepared in a 10 mL glass graduated cylinder; then, they were vigorously mixed using a pipette for at least 20 s. After settling, the volume ratio of the upper phase to the lower phase was calculated.</p>
