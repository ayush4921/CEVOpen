<p>In a single run of the polarity-stepwise elution CCC, six high-purity compounds, with a wide range of polarities, and two concentrated CCC fractions were obtained. The two CCC fractions were further separated and purified using conventional HSCCC, pH-zone-refining CCC, and preparative HPLC. It is worth highlighting that these eight compounds, identified as shikimic acid (
 <bold>2</bold>), gallic acid (
 <bold>3</bold>), protocatechuic acid (
 <bold>4</bold>), 4,4′-dihydroxy-3,3′-imino-di-benzoic acid (
 <bold>6</bold>), miquelianin (
 <bold>7</bold>), rutin (
 <bold>8</bold>), quercitrin (
 <bold>9</bold>), and quercetin (
 <bold>10</bold>), are reported from 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic> for the first time. Notably, except for shikimic acid, all other compounds showed anti-diabetic potentials via antioxidant, antiglycation, and aldose reductase inhibition. Our results suggested that the polarity-stepwise elution CCC can be used for the efficient separation or fractionation of compounds with a wide range of polarities from natural products. Moreover, 
 <italic>M. volcanica</italic> and its bioactive compounds are potent anti-diabetic agents and are worth being subjected to further in vivo study to verify its anti-diabetic properties. Additionally, the potential synergistic/antagonistic effects among the tested compounds have yet to be studied.
