 <italic>M. pinnata</italic> (L.) Panigrahi may be due to the presence of polyphenols and flavonoid contents which was performed upon the oral administration of the extract (300Â mg/kg body mass) in the albino rat. There was a significant increase in the reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase levels whereas, a decrease in the levels of conjugative dines, hydrooxyperoxide, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances were found.
