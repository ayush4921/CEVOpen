<p id="p0145">Studies were carried out to observe the anti-cholinesterase activity of the ethanol n- BuOH extracts of seed of 
 <italic>M. pachycarpa</italic> Benth. which showed potent activity where n- BuOH extract also showed significant anti-cholinesterase activity. The bio-assay guided isolates of EtOAc extract was evaluated by Ellman’s methods and also showed better anticholinesterase activity which showed moderate to weak acetylcholinesterase activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value ranging from 17.14 to 131.17 μM, which is the future prospect to analyze as a definite agent for Alzheimer’s therapy (
