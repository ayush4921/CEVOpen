<p id="p0150">Assessment of the anthelmintic activity of chloroform extract of leaves and stems of 
 <italic>M. auriculata</italic> Brandis was carried out using 
 <italic>Pheretima posthuma</italic> at a dose of 10 mg/mL against the standard drug Albendazole, where, the leaves extracts were found to be more potent as compared with stem extract and standard. Here Albendazole plays an inhibitory mechanism on the helminthic β-tubulin polymerization by interfering with microtubule-dependent functions such as uptake of glucose and depletion of glycogen (
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Das and Ganapaty, 2014</xref>). The probable mechanism behind the anthelmintic activity maybe due to the availability of the rich source like flavonoids, triterpenes, and phenolic contents, which is responsible for the death of parasite by damaging the glycoprotein.
