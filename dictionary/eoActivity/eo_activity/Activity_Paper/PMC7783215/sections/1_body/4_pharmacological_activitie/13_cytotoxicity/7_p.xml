 <italic>M. brandisiana</italic> Kurz was reported for having significant cytotoxicity activity against mammalian cancer cell lines such as HepG2, A549, HuCCA-1, HeLa using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT assay). This study revealed the reports about the efficacy of isolated flavonoids having good aromatase inhibition activity and antioxidant activity (ORAC assay) as well. These results draw a probable mechanism that the bioactive flavonoids could be of importance for advance studies as prospective cytotoxicity and cancer chemopreventive agents (
