 <italic>Millettia</italic> species have been used as a conventional medicine across the globe as it a rich source of isoflavonoids, rotenoids, sterols, phenolic compounds, coumarin, terpenoids, resin, saponins, etc (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Derese et al., 2014</xref>). The present review reports traditional uses, phytochemical constituents and pharmacological activities based on ethnopharmacological claims of genus 
 <italic>“Millettia”.</italic> Extensive literature survey revealed that most of the species are used traditionally in different African and Asian countries including India, Pakistan, China, France, Burma, Malaysia, Thailand, Kenya, etc where, only a few species were scientifically evaluated for their phytochemical constituents that could mediate particular pharmacological activities. 
 <italic>M. pinnata</italic> (L.) Panigrahi has been the most investigated species and it plays an important role in biodiesel production (

 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Madhu et al., 2016</xref>). The major traditional use of 
 <italic>Millettia</italic> species as reviewed involved in the treatment of joint pain, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis amenorrhea, tuberculosis, chronic bronchitis, the fish poison, insecticide, skin disease, vermifuge which have been validated scientifically. It is observed that most of the pharmacological activity studies were limited to both 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> screening where, the mechanisms of action, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are not explored clearly. Furthermore, a number of studies were done for the bioassay-guided extraction and isolation of phytochemical constituents. Further research should target on the exploration and validation of traditional claims of other species by focusing the bioassay-guided drug discovery along with the formulation and mode of administration of drugs which we found lacking in most of the reviewed literature. An additional extensive use that requires to be evaluated is in the menstrual irregularities. Even though these species have ethno claims to be used for the female disease but it has not been evaluated significantly. So, further well designed and more clinical in-depth studies are required by focusing on the mechanism-based 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies for understanding the underlying mechanisms linked to ethnopharmacological uses.
