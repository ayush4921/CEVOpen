 <italic>α</italic>-hydroxyrotenone identified from 
 <italic>M. pervilleana</italic> showed of TPA-induced ornithine decarboxylase inhibition at the level of its m RNA expression and act as a potent cancer chemo-preventive agents (

 <italic>M. pervilleana</italic>. 4- prenyloxyderrone, isoflavones, chalcone, pterocarpan were isolated from 
 <italic>M. dura</italic> Dunn and another compound i.e. 6α, 12α-didehydro-6-oxodeguelin was also screened having an insecticidal activity which inhibits phytotoxins of ornithine decarboxylase (
