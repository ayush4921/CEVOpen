<p id="Par21">Compressive strength was evaluated according to ISO 9917-1:2007 using cylindrical molds (4.0 mm diameter × 6.0 mm height). Ten specimens were prepared for each group, powder and liquid were mixed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (1:2). Then materials were packed into the mold between polyester strips and thick glass plates on both sides to obtain a smooth surface. One hour later specimens were removed from the mold, grinded with silicon carbide paper and stored in deionised water for 24 h. Malformed specimens or those with voids were discarded. The diameter of each specimen was checked using a digital micrometer gauge (Digimatic, Mitutoyo Europe GmbH, Neuss, Germany). The specimens were then placed in vertical position in a Zwick universal testing machine (Zwick Zmart Pro, ZwickRoell GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Ulm, Germany). Compressive load was applied on the long axis of the specimens at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min until fracture. The maximum force applied when the specimen fractures was recorded to calculate the compressive strength values in MPa [
