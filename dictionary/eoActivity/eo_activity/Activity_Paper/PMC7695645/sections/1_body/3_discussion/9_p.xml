<p id="Par38">The antimicrobial activity might be attributed to the different phytochemical constituents in each of the three incorporated PE. Identification of volatile and semi-volatile compounds in the PE in the current study was made using a combination of two analytical techniques; GC and mass spectrometry. GC can separate compounds with high resolution, but it cannot identify them. Mass spectrometry can provide detailed structural information on most compounds to be accurately identified and quantified after their separation [
