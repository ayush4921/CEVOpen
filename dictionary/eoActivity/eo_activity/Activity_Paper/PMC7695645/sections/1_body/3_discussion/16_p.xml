<p id="Par45">Results of compressive strength tests showed insignificant difference between all of the control, 1:1 PE, 1:2 PE, and CHX-GIC groups; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Such findings are in accordance with Farret et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], Marti et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], and Jaidka et al. [
