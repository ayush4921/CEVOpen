<p id="Par33">Antimicrobial activity was assessed using the agar well diffusion method against 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> and 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic>. These microorganisms were chosen because 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> has been identified as the major causative agent of dental caries, playing a main role in carbohydrate fermentation and acid production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], whereas M. 
 <italic>luteus</italic> is a very sensitive indicator strain for the release of antibacterial compounds. 
 <italic>M. luteus</italic> was also the most predominant opportunistic pathogen among all isolates from the teeth and gums of children belonging to age group 7â€“16 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].
