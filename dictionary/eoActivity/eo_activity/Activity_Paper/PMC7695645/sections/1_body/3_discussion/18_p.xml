<p id="Par47">Surprisingly, the 2:1 PE group showed a significant improvement in the compressive strength values from the control and the other modified groups; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. This could be explained on the basis of the phytochemical analysis of PEs that revealed the presence of silica in
