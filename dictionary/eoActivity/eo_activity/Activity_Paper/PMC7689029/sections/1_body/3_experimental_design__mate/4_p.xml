<p id="para0017">Through the review, Gawé Dorjé confirmed his sources as consistent with these other definitive works. His-texts provide a comprehensive compilation of materia medica data from these transmitted texts, practices and oral instructions, while simultaneously developing ecological descriptions of each specimen making the information highly accessible and relevant to research interlocutors. He has sought out and confirmed traditional identifications of physical specimens of the materia medica with preeminent scholars and practitioners of medicine compounding throughout Tibet, and as such has developed the definitive work for materia medica descriptions, growth patterns, ecological niches and identifications in the traditional classical system. Nevertheless, developing such a definitive work has some limitations. For one, the work assigns standardized identifications of the accepted Latin botanical names for these specimens according to a more centralized geographic region. Compared to the larger scope of Sowa Rigpa influence, this approach can collapse the heterogeneity with which the traditional Sowa Rigpa identification permits a given materia medica specimen to have acceptable regional identification variations and distinctions in potency relevant to locality, evading political economies of regulation. Yet, Gawé Dorjé’s work attempts to integrate regional variations and modifications within the text and allows for previous descriptions of superior (
 <italic>mchog</italic>) and inferior (
 <italic>dman</italic>) types to simply be enumerations within the larger category of the traditionally described plant specimen. Previous distinctions between schools of thought in plant recognition such as the Jang and Zur schools contribute variations of perspective within the text instead of conflicting paradigms to which one must align.
