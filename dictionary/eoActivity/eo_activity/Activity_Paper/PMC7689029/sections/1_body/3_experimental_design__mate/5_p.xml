<p id="para0018">In Gawé Dorjé’s classification 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, he systematized materia medica into eight major divisions that follow some of the classical classification modes, but also integrate several from contemporary taxonomical approaches. His-eight divisions are as follows: (1) precious substances (
 <italic>rin po che'i sman sde</italic>); (2) non-precious geologically-derived substances (
 <italic>sa rdo'i sman sde</italic>); (3) salt classes (
 <italic>tshwa sna'i sman sde</italic>); (4) extracts (
 <italic>rtsi sman gyi sde</italic>); (5) woody plants (
 <italic>shing sman gyi sde</italic>); (6) shrubs and herbaceous plants (
 <italic>sngo ldum gyi sman sde</italic>); (7) domesticated grains, legumes and pulses (
 <italic>’bru yi sman sde</italic>); and (8) fauna-derived substances (
 <italic>srog chags kyi sman sde</italic>). Within the category of precious medicines, he retained the classic subcategories of meltable (
 <italic>bzhu ba'i khams</italic>) and un-meltable substances (
 <italic>mi bzhu ba'i khams</italic>). The fauna further delineate into subcategories of mammals (
 <italic>’o ’thung srog chags</italic>; literally, “animals which drink milk”); birds (
 <italic>bya rigs</italic>); and insects, reptiles, amphibians and fish (
 <italic>’bu srin gyi sde</italic>).
