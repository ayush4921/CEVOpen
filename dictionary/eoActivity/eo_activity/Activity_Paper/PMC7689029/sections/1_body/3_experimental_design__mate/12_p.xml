<p id="para0025">The FoC database [26] is a collaborative database of vascular plants of China maintained by Beijing's Science Press and Missouri Botanical Garden. Additional Chinese editorial collaborators include CAS Institute of Botany (Beijing), the Kunming Institute of Botany, the Jiangsu Institute of Botany (Nanjing), and the South China Botanical Garden (Guangzhou); and non-Chinese editorial collaborators including Harvard University Herbaria, the California Academy of Sciences, the Smithsonian Institution, the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Kew Royal Botanic Gardens, and the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle (Paris). Though it is a specialized database compiling published data on plants of China, its entries are not as frequently updated as those of the MPNS, WCSP and WFO.</p>
