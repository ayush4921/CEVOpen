 </sup> AD is characterized by an intracellular and extracellular plaque of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and intracellular tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.

 </sup> Another hallmark of AD is the fall off of forebrain cholinergic neurons, and a reduction in the Ach level leads to cognitive/memory impairment.

 </sup> The mechanism involved in AD includes induction of amyloid plaque deposition, expression of inflammatory mediators, increase in oxidation stress, reduction in steroid hormones, etc.

 </sup> Although many studies have been done on AD treatment, a promising intervention for curing the disease remains a challenge. Thus, this present research focuses on the potential of spice oleoresins as a potent neuroprotective agent against AD.
