<p>GSH was measured spectrophotometrically. A reaction mixture consisting of 50 μL of the supernatant, 1.1 mL of 0.25 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and 130 μL of 0.04% 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) was prepared. The final volume of the mixture was made up to 1.5 mL with distilled water, and the absorbance was recorded at 412 nm.
