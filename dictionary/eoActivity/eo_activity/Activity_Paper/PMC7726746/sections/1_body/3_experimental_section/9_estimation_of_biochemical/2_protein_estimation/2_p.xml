 </sup> The brain homogenate (20 μL) was added to 200 μL of Bradford reagents and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the absorbance was measured at 596 nm in a microplate reader (Spark 10M, Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland). Bovine serum albumin was taken as the standard (0.1–1 mg). The protein content in the brain homogenate was expressed in mg/μ.
