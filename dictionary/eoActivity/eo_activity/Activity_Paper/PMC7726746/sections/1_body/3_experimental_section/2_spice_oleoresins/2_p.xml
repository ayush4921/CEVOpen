<p>Black pepper (Panniyur), turmeric (Alleppey), and red chili (Byadgi) were procured from the Pepper Research Station, Panniyur, Kerala; planters from Alleppey, Kerala; and Byadgi, Karnataka, respectively, and authenticated by a qualified botanist from the University of Mysore, Mysuru, India. All of the spices were cleaned for extraneous materials and powdered in a mechanical grinder and mixer (Philips, India). Each 100 g powdered spice sample was mixed with 300 mL of ethanol (1:3 w/v) in a glass column.The extracts were collected six times at an interval of 1 h. The further solvent was recovered by the flash evaporator (Heidolph Laborota 4000 Efficient, Triad Scientific, Inc. Manasquan). The resin yield was recorded and stored in ambient temperature in dark conditions for further studies. The black pepper, turmeric, and red chili contained 47–50% (w/w), 34–35% (w/w), and 1.7–1.9% (w/w) of piperine, curcumin, and capsaicin, respectively.</p>
