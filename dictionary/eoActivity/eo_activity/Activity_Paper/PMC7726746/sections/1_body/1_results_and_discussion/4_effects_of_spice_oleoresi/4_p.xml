<p>In this study, GSH is decreased significantly in scopolamine-treated rats compared to that in normal animals. It was increased in the chili oleoresin group compared to pepper-turmeric-oleoresin-administered rats, as shown in

 </xref>c. Similarly, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is also found to be slightly less in scopolamine-treated rats compared to that in the normal group. There is no significant difference in other groups (

 </sup> GPx catalyzes the reduction of H

 <sub>2</sub> by GSH, which can protect the cells from damage.

 </sup> The depletion of GSH and GPx in scopolamine-treated rats may be due to the elevation of the MDA level in the brain. GSH is considered as the first-defense endogenous antioxidant against oxidative stress produced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>.

 </sup> The present study is consistent with previous studies; the GSH and GPx levels decreased with scopolamine administration; further, they were slightly increased with co-administration of spice oleoresins.
