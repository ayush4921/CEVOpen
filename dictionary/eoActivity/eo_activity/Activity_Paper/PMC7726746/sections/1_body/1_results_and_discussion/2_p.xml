<p>AD is clinically characterized by a degradation of neurons, decline in memory, and disturbance in neurobehavior. Although many drugs and treatments are available, the severity of the disease has not been under control yet. Therefore, alternative treatments with natural and herbal supplements are rising to manage the AD. Thus, this study was designed to examine cognitive and behavioral functions with the administration of spice oleoresins. A pharmacologically scopolamine-induced AD model has been used widely for the screening of potential cognition-enhancing agents. The improvement in cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine was investigated after the administration of spice oleoresins using behavior and biochemical parameters.</p>
