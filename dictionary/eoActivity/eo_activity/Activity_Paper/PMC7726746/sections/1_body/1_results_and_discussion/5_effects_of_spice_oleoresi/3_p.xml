<p>The results of this study suggest that chili- and pepper-oleoresin-administered rats showed marked improvements in cognitive function when compared to scopolamine-, turmeric-, and drug-administered rats. This study also suggests that spice oleoresins possess neuroprotective effects by scavenging ROS and provide protection against oxidative damage induced by scopolamine. The antioxidant activity and AChE inhibition reveal the contributory effect of spice oleoresins against dementia.</p>
