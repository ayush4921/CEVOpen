<p>The AChE activity was found to be prolonged in scopolamine-administered rats compared to that in normal animals. The activity was reduced 5–15% in pepper-, turmeric-oleoresin- and drug-administered rats. However, 50% of AChE was reduced in rats administered with chili oleoresin. There was no significant difference (

 </sup> AChE activity was measured to explore the effect of spice oleoresins on the cholinergic function, which governs vital aspects of memory and other cognitive functions. In this study, scopolamine elevates AChE activity, an enzyme responsible for the deterioration of Ach. The previous research on the inhibitory effect of pepper oil showed that 93% of AChE activity was inhibited, with an IC50 value of 5.97 μg/mL.

 </sup> Curcuminoids showed the AChE inhibitory effect, and reported curcuminoids and bisdemethoxycurcumin were able to reduce 60 and 80% of AChE activity, respectively.

 </sup> An in vitro study on chili oleoresin has reported that the maximum inhibition (78.3%) of AChE was found at 140 μg/mL.
