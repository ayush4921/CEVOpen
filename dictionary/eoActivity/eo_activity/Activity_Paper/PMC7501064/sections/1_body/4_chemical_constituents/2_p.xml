<p id="par0050">The first report of the chemical components has been documented in the 1880s. It was reported by Greenish et al that it is composed of oils, proteins, carbohydrates and fibres (
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">Greenish, 1880</xref>). There have been many studies to find out the chemical nature of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> and it was found that the medicinal value of 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> is mainly due to the presence of its quinone constituent which is also known as thymoquinone (TQ) (
 <xref rid="bib0650" ref-type="bibr">Sahak et al., 2016</xref>). TQ is the main constituent of the volatile oil and has a variety of pharmacological properties such as hepatoprotective (

 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr">Laskar et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0655" ref-type="bibr">Saheb et al., 2016</xref>), anti-inflammatory (

 <xref rid="bib0685" ref-type="bibr">Shaarani et al., 2017</xref>), antibacterial (

 <xref rid="bib0685" ref-type="bibr">Shaarani et al., 2017</xref>). There is also literature showing evidence for the molecular mechanism of this molecule (
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">Gholamnezhad et al., 2016</xref>). Other components found in the 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> includes p-cymene, carvacrol, thymohydroquinone (THQ), dihydrothymoquinone (DHTQ), α-thujene, thymol, t-anethole, β-pinene, α-pinene, and γ-terpinene (
 <xref rid="bib0650" ref-type="bibr">Sahak et al., 2016</xref>). The important constituents of the 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> have been summarized in
