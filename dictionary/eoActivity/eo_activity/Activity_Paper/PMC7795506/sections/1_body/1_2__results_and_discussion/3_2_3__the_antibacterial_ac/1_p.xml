<p>In the current study, we tested the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> ethanolic extract against four identified bacterial strains, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, B. subtilis,</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</italic> The antibacterial activity was tested against different concentrations of 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and calculating of the average inhibition zone in millimeters by measuring the distance from the center of the disc to the borders of the area at which the growth is inhibited [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00130-f004">Figure 4</xref>, all bacterial strains were sensitive for the treatment with tetracycline. 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> extract showed a strong inhibitory effect against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> at all concentrations, while only the 100% solution showed some inhibitory effects against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> without any observed inhibition against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>,
