<p>AF-AgNPs were prepared as shown by Mladenova and colleagues in 2018 [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Briefly, an amount of 85 mg of silver nitrate (AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>) was dissolved in distilled water with vigorous stirring using the BOECO Magnetic Stirrer MMS 3000 (BOECO co., Hamburg, Germany) at room temperature. Then, 0.5 mL of 4% of the ethanolic plant extract was added wisely to the AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> particles, from the previous step, and the volume was adjusted to 100 mL with distilled water. Later, the prepared samples were subjected to the sunlight for 30 min, when the mixture color turned to an intense yellowish-brown. The biogenic characterization of the prepared nanoparticles was assessed by UV spectroscopy, DLS, FE-SEM, FT-IR, and GC-MS.
