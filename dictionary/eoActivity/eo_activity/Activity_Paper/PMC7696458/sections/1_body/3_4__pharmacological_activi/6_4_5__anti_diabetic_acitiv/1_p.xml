The oral administration of the extract at the dose of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg showed significant decrease in serum glucose level at 28th day of administration. In the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in normal mice, the oral administration of extract (1000 mg/kg ) increased the glucose tolerance [
