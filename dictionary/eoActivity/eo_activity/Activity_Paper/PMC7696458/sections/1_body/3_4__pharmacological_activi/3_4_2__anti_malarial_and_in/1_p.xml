<p>Brahmam and Sunita carried out the in-vitro antimalarial activity of different extracts of roots of 
 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> against two 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> strains, i.e., 3D7 (chloroquine sensitive strain) and K1 (chloroquine resistance strain). The chloroform and methanol extracts showed potent activity against both strains. [

 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> against malaria vector 
 <italic>Anopheles subpictus</italic> larvae and the different extracts showed potent activity with a percentage mortality at 24 h and emergence inhibition values: hexane extract (60 ± 2.04 and 75 ± 2.44), choloroform extract (78 ± 2.56 and 85 ± 1.50), ethyl acetate extract (86 ± 1.29 and 69 ± 1.71), acetone extract (100 ± 0.00 and 68 ± 2.13) and methanol extract (81 ± 1.08 and 100 ± 0.00) [

 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> against 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles subpictus</italic> [
