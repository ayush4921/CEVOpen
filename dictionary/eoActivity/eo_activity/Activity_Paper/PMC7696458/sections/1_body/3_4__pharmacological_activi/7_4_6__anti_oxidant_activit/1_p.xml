<p>Srikanta and Dharmesh evaluated the anti-oxidant activity of the aqueous extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and reducing power assay, and the extract showed potent DPPH free radical scavenging assay with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.75 ± 0.3 μg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/ml and reducing power activity with the value of 65.17 ± 4.8 U/mg GAE. The extract also showed the total phenolic content of 31.83 ± 3.1 mg GAE/g [
