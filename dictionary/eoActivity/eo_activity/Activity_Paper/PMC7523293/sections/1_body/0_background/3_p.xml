<p id="Par16">This investigation was therefore set up to target a functionally diverse range of Mtb kinase enzymes as a mechanism of identifying potential Mtb drug targets using the complexity found in medicinal plant extracts as the source of chemical diversity. It was also decided to select a range of Mtb kinases which, where possible, do not occur within mammalian biochemistry. Kinases have been classified into 25 families of homologous proteins, with the families assembled into 12 fold-groups based on the similarity of their structural folds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It has further been demonstrated that each of the 12 fold-groups has a distinct phosphoryl transfer mechanism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and it was therefore decided to select the kinase enzyme targets from 6 of the 12 fold-groups, thereby representing 6 distinct phosphoryl transfer mechanisms. The six identified phosphoryl transfer mechanisms all have distinct ATP binding motifs. The selection of these kinases should therefore identify different classesâ€™ compounds capable of binding ATP. The enzymes selected are crucial for the metabolism and survival of Mtb. As relatively large number of enzymes was to be comparatively simultaneously assessed it was envisaged to keep the enzyme purification and assays as simple as possible.
