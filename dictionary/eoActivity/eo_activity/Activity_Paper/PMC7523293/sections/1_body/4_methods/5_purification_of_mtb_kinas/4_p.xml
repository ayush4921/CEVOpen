<p id="Par36">The concentration of the proteins was determined using the Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies. USA) and Qubit Protein Assay Kit, as recommended by the manufacturer. A volume of 50 μl of all proteins except AK and GK, were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C until assayed. For AK and GK, aliquots of 50 μl of the dialysed protein were mixed with 50% [v/v] glycerol before storage at − 80 °C.</p>
