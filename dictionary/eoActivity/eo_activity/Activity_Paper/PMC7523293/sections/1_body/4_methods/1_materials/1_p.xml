<p id="Par28">H37Rv genomic DNA was received from Professor Ian Wiid, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. The Mtb 
 <italic>aroK</italic> gene (encoding Shikimate Kinase) in pET15-b was received from the laboratory of Chris Abell, University of Cambridge. All other genes were cloned in-house as outlined in section 5.3. All PCR reagents were from Kapa Biosystems (KAPA HiFi for gene amplification and KAPA 2G Fast for screening), and cloning materials were purchased from Epicentre Technologies, USA (Fast-Link™ DNA Ligation Kit) or Zymo Research, USA (Zyppy™ Plasmid Miniprep kit and Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery Kit). Oligonucleotides for gene amplification were obtained from IDT Inc. (USA). All other chemicals used were at least analytical grade and were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
