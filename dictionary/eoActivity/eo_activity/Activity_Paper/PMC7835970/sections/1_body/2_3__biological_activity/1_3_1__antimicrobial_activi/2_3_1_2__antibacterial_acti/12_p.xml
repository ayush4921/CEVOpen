<p>Antimicrobial tests were used for the disc diffusion method. Two Gram-positive methicillin-resistent 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (ATCC 6633), two Gram-negative 
 <italic>pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 9027), 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (ATCC 6539), were used. Compound 
 <bold>176</bold> showed strong antibacterial activity against the 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and MRSA with the MIC values of 1.67 µg/mL and 3.36µg/mL, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>177</bold> exhibited significant antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> with the 
 <italic>MIC value</italic> of 5.25 µg/mL. Positive control for antifungal tests were used by Ampicillin with the MIC values of 0.15 µg/mL, 0.15 µg/mL and 0.07 µg/mL against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, MRSA (Methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, respetively. The results indicated that the methylester displayed improved biological activity and showed a selective antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and MRSA. Compound 
 <bold>176</bold> exhibited more strong antimicrobial activity than compound 
 <bold>177</bold> [
