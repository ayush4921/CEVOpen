<p>The phytotoxic activities of

 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L.) with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (0.3 µg/mL) as the positive control. Compounds 
 <bold>295</bold> and 
 <bold>296</bold> each inhibited the growth of both roots and hypocotyls at 30 µg/mL. Furthermore, 
 <bold>295</bold> suppressed seed germination at 100 µg/mL [
