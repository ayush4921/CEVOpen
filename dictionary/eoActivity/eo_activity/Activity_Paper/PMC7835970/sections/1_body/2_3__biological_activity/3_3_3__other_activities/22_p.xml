<p>The Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitory activity assay of compounds 
 <bold>284</bold>–
 <bold>286</bold> were carried out. The results showed that compound 
 <bold>285</bold> possessed significant inhibitory activity against IDO with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.11 μM. Epacadostat, as the positive control, was one of the most potent IDO inhibitors with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.05 μM. For compounds 
 <bold>284</bold> and 
 <bold>286</bold>, they showed relatively strong inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.47 μM and 6.36 μM, respectively [
