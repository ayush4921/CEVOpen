<p>In vitro anti-inflammatory effects of compounds 
 <bold>258</bold>–
 <bold>261</bold> were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. 
 <bold>258</bold>–
 <bold>261</bold> exhibited excellent inhibitory effects on the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and nitric oxide (NO) in LPS-induced macrophages with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 16.21 ± 1.62 μM to 35.23 ± 3.32 μM, from 19.83 ± 1.82 μM to 42.57 ± 4.56 μM, from 16.78 ± 1.65 μM to 38.15 ± 3.67 μM, respectively, similar with the positive control indomethacin. Those results indicated that, terrusnolides A–D (
 <bold>258</bold>–
 <bold>261</bold>) might play a significant role as a lead compound in the study of anti-inflammatory agents. In addition, compounds 
 <bold>258</bold>–
 <bold>261</bold> were also investigated for the inhibitory activities against BACE1 by M-2420 method and acetylcholin esterase (AchE) using Ellman’s method. Compound 
 <bold>260</bold> exhibited weak AchE inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 32.56 ± 3.16 µM, compound 
 <bold>261</bold> exhibited weak BACE1 inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 37.45 ± 4.56 µM. LY2811376 and Donepezil were used as the positive control in BACE1 and AchE inhibitory assay with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.25 ± 0.04 µM and 0.05 ± 0.01 µM, respectively [
