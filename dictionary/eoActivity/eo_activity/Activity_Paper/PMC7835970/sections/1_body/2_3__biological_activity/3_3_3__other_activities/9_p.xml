<p>Monitoring the NO level in LPS-activated cells has become a common approach for evaluating the potential anti-inflammatory activities of compounds. Isolates 
 <bold>82</bold>–
 <bold>92</bold> were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against NO production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 marcrophages, while indomethacin was used as a positive control. Compounds 
 <bold>89</bold>–
 <bold>91</bold> exhibited inhibitory effects with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 21, 24 and 16 μM, respectively, which are lower than that of the positive control indomethacin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 38 ± 1 μM), while compound 
 <bold>85</bold> exhibited moderate inhibition with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 42 μM. Preliminary structure–activity relationships revealed that the analogues with the S absolute configureuration at C-18 (e.g., 
 <bold>89</bold>–
 <bold>91</bold>) significantly enhanced the activity, as exemplified by compound 
 <bold>89</bold> showing inhibition against NO production in RAW 264.7 marcrophage cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 21 μM, whereas compound 
 <bold>87</bold> exerted less than 40% inhibition at 50 μM. In addition, all isolated compounds (
 <bold>82</bold>–
 <bold>92</bold>) were tested for their inhibitory activity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase B (MptpB). Compound 
 <bold>89</bold> displayed inhibition with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 19 μM, comparable to the positive control (oleanolic acid, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22 ± 1 μM). Compounds 
 <bold>83</bold>, 
 <bold>85</bold>, 
 <bold>86</bold> and 
 <bold>90</bold> showed moderate inhibitory activity of MptpB with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 39 ± 2 μM, 42 ± 3 μM, 28 ± 1 μM and 35 ± 1 μM, respectively [
