<p>The potential phytotoxicity of 
 <bold>246</bold> against lettuce seedlings (
 <italic>Lactuca sativa</italic> L.) was studied. Aqueous solutions of 
 <bold>246</bold> ranging between 25 and 200 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, were assayed for its effects on seed germination, root length, and shoot length of the lettuce. Compound 
 <bold>246</bold> showed the most robust inhibitory effect on root growth. Compound 
 <bold>246</bold> inhibited root growth by 50% at a concentration of 25 µg/mL. In addition, the highest concentration of 
 <bold>246</bold> (200 µg/mL) strongly exerted an inhibitory effect on seed germination (90% inhibition) [
