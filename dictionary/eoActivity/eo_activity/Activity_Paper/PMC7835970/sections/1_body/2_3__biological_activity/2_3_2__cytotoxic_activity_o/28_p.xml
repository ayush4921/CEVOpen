<p>The cytotoxic effect of 
 <bold>389</bold> was evaluated in vitro towards ovarian (SK-OV-3), epidermoid (KB), malignantmelanoma (SK-MEL), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), colorectal adenocarcinoma (HCT-116), and ductal (BT-549) carcinomas. Doxorubicin (positive control) and DMSO (negative control) were used. It had selective and potent effect towards BT-549, MCF-7, SKOV-3, and HCT-116 cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub>s 0.09 ± 0.05, 21 ± 0.07, 1.23 ± 0.03, and 0.59 ± 0.01 µM, respectively, compared to doxorubicin (IC
