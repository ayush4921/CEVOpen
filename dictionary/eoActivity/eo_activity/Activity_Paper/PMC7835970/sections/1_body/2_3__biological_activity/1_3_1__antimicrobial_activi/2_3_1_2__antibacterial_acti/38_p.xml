<p>The new compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against five terrestrial pathogenic bacteria, including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (ATCC 27154), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus albus</italic> (ATCC 8799), 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (ATCC 11778), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), and 
 <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> (ATCC 10240) by the microplate assay method. The result showed that Compounds 
 <bold>392</bold>–
 <bold>393</bold> showed moderate antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with the MIC values of 25.0 µg/mL and 12.5 µg/mL, respectively. Ciprofloxacin was used as positive control with the MIC value of 0.39 µg/mL [
