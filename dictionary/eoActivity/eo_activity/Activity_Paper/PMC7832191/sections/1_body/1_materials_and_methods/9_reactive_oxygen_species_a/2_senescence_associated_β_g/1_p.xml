<p>According to the manufacturer's instruction, the cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL) were incubated with fixing solution for 15 min at room temperature. After that, the assay was incubated with the SA-β-Gal detection solution for 24 h. Finally, the cells were investigated under phase contrast microscopy for counting the SA-β-gal-positive cells (blue) as a percentage of the total cell number.
