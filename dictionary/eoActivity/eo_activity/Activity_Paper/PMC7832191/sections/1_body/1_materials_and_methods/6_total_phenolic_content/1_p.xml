<p>The total phenolic content was investigated by using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent and external calibration with gallic acid. In brief, 800 μl of samples was added with 200 μl of Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. After 5 min, 1 ml of a 7.5% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> solution was mixed in the dark for 60 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 756 nm using a spectrophotometer. The results were averaged which expressed as micrograms of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 100 μg of extract sample.
