<p>According to our present study, it was found that MH has potency in the reduction of negative responses in aging neuron; hence, we then investigated the role of MH on synapse in aging neuron. This study revealed that MH treatment in aging neuron markedly decreased AchE activity and promoted the synaptopysin expression (
