<p>This study showed the result of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced aging in SK-N-SH cells that it significantly decreased in cell viability at 10 μM comparing to control (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and it also affected to cellular formation (data not showed) and promoted SA-β-gal expression over than 50% of total cells. The reduction of cell survival in senescence neuron is one of the major events in aging response and it was commonly recorded with the high level of apoptosis.[
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] This study found that the SK-N-SH cells exposing to H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> significantly decreased of cell survival (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) that closely related to the significantly increased of apoptotic cells (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The high number of apoptosis might cause by the activation via intrinsic apoptotic pathway that correlated with the intracellular stress from ROS production.[
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] From our result, we found that the decline of cell survival in SK-N-SH treated-H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was closely associated with the overproduction of ROS content. Thus, we suggested that the ROS plays an important role in cell survival and apoptosis response in aging neurons. Sirt-1 plays an important role in cellular division, cellular defense system, and autophagy induction. Previous study found that the high level of cellular stress from free radical could suppress both cellular defense system and Sirt-1 protein leading cell aging, dysfunction, and death.[
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] From our results, we suggested that the Sirt-1 might be the target of free radical-induced aging which mostly reports in several evidences.[

 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This study revealed that the treatment of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in SK-N-SH cells mediated the AchE activity (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and suppressed the synaptophysin protein expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) comparing to control. In accordance to the results, we suggested that the loss of synaptic plasticity in neurons might be closely associated with the negative responses in aging. However, the treatment of brain disease was mainly focused on the promotion of synapse by using the drug-inhibited enzyme degraded neurotransmitter or drug influencing neurotransmitter, and the reduction of negative response-suppressed synapse did not recommend.[
