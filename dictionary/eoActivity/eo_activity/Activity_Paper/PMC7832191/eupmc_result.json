    "Cellular senescence is the key mediator of cellular dysfunction before undergoing degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease. The aging process was mainly by the overactivation of senescence associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) enzyme before mediated several negative responses, including intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cellular senescence regulation, and death prior encourage synaptic loss. Thus, in the recent work, we evaluated the <i>in vitro</i> effects of aqueous extract of <i>Millingtonia hortensis L.</i> (MH) from flower in hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-induced senescence in SK-N-SH cells. Herein, we demonstrated that MH significantly increased cell viability and decreased both of apoptotic cells and ROS production in a dose-dependent manner comparing to aging group (<i>P</i> < 0.01) using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, flow cytometry, and ROS assay. Furthermore, the number of SA-β-gal-positive cells was also reduced in MH treatment (<i>P</i> < 0.01) together with the promotion of Sirt-1 protein. Importantly, MH also promoted the synaptic plasticity by decreased acetylcholinesterase activity and increased synaptophysin expression in aging neurons comparing to aging group (<i>P</i> < 0.01). Hispidulin (the active ingredient in MH) was also revealed the similarly effects to MH. Therefore, we suggested that MH might be beneficially for neurodegenerative disease that caused by aging."
