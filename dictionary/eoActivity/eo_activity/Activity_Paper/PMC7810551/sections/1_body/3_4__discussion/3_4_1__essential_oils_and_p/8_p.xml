<p>Thymol is a monoterpene found in essential oils extracted from plants belonging to the Lamiaceae family such as the genera 
 <italic>Thymus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic>, 
 <italic>Origanum</italic>, 
 <italic>Satureja</italic>, 
 <italic>Thymbra</italic>, and 
 <italic>Monarda</italic> [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This molecule is a phytoconstituent with several biological activities described, including anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], local anesthetic [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and antifungal and antibacterial [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] activities. Thymol has been reported to have strong antifungal activity against strains of the 
 <italic>Candida</italic> genus, acting on the fungal cell membrane and producing a synergistic effect when used with nystatin to inhibit the growth of these strains [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].
