 <italic>C. cassia</italic> has been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antipyretic, antiangiogenic, larvicidal, and antifungal properties [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> was reportedly active against four 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp. strains, namely, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>, as well as against 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic>, and three dermatophyte isolates (
 <italic>Microsporum gypseum</italic>, 
 <italic>Trichophyton rubrum</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. mentagraphytes</italic>). 
 <italic>C. Cassia</italic> EO was effective in reducing the number of pseudohyphae in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> cultures, which is considered an important virulence factor [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Mouse models and in vitro assays have also proved the antiproliferative activity of 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> EO against oral candidiasis (
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection). Cinnamaldehyde was reported as the main compound responsible for the antifungal effects observed in 
 <italic>C. cassia</italic> EO [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].
