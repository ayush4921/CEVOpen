<p>To investigate and identify the active QSI active compounds in CFEE, UPLC-MS/MS was used to determine the composition of CFEE. CFEE contains numerous phenolic acids, such as caffeic acid, gallic acid, ferulic acid, coumaric acid and isophthalic acid, and most of these compounds have previously been reported to be AI-1 type QSIs. Meanwhile, CFEE also contains many organic acids, including malic acid, quinic acid, and succinic acid, whose relative content comprise 46.503% of the total 23 compounds. Additionally, citric acid and a small amount of salicylic acid are present in CFEE. QSI activities have not been reported for any of these organic acids with the exception of malic acid, which has an inhibitory effect on AI-2 QS of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> O157:H7 and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. Further experiments demonstrated that malic acid and succinic acid were excellent AI-1 QSIs. These two organic acids may play a major role in the QSI activities of CFEE. Future research on malic acid and succinic acid will explore their molecular mechanisms and the targets of their anti-QS effects. In summary, CFEE and its malic acid and succinic acid components are potential QSIs that could be used to develop new therapeutics targeting Gram-negative bacteria.
