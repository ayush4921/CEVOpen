<p>Swarming motility assays were performed as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Briefly, 5 mL molten soft-top LB medium (containing 0.3% agar) was mixed with CFEE at final concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 μg/mL, respectively. These mixtures were immediately overlaid on solidified LB agar plates. Once the overlaid agar had solidified, prepared pathogen strains were applied to the center of the plate using an inoculation needle and were then cultivated at 37 °C for 30 h. Swarming migrations were observed and migration distances of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 were measured. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are presented as means ± standard deviation.
