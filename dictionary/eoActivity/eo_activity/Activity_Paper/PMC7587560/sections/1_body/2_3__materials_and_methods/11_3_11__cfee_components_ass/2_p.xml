<p>The mass spectrometer was operated in full scan of positive and negative mode in a range of 
 <italic>m/z</italic>: 70–1050. The resolution of MS data was set at 70,000; the spray voltage was set at 3.2 kV for negative mode; the capillary temperature was set at 320 °C; the auxiliary gas heater temperature was 350 °C; the sheath gas flow rate was 35 units; the auxiliary gas flow was set at 15 units; the S-lens RF level was 50; the AGC target was 1e6; the maximum injection time used was 100 ms; and the resolution of MS/MS acquisition was set at 17,500. The top eight ions in each full scan were isolated with a 1.0 Da window, fragmented with a stepwise collision energy of 20, 40 and 60 units, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms with an AGC target of 2e5. The acquired raw data were analyzed using Compound Discover 3.2 (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MN, USA) with the metabolite database (mzCloud, mzVault, Masslists, and Chemspider).
