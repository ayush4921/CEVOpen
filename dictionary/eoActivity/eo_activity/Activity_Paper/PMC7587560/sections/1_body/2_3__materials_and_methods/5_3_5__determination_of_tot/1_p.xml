<p>The total polyphenol concentration was analyzed using the previously described Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. CFEE (1 mL, 100 μg/mL) was mixed with Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (1 M, 0.5 mL) for 3 min, then 3 mL of 7.5% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> was added and the mixture was allowed to react for 2 h with intermittent mixing. The absorbance of the mixture was measured at 750 nm using a U-3210 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). A standard curve, using gallic acid (methanol solution), was prepared using the same method.
