<p>CFEE was prepared according to a previously report with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Polar macroporous resin was selected as the preparation filler because of the strong polarity of organic acid and polyphenols. The crude 
 <italic>C. grandiflora</italic> extract was filtered, diluted with deionized water, and applied to the glass column (17 × 300 mm) containing activated macroporous resin HPD600 (Qinshi Technology Ltd., Zhengzhou, China). The column was washed with deionized water (200 mL) to remove impurities, and the CFEE was eluted using 80% ethanol with a flow rate of 1 min/mL. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporator and the CFEE was re-dissolved in deionized water. The CFEE sample was then lyophilized (at 108 ± 5 Pa chamber pressure and −83 ± 1 °C cold collector temperature after pre-freezing at −20 °C for 24 h), and stored at −20 °C for further experiments. Lyophilized material was re-dissolved in methanol before use in experiments.
