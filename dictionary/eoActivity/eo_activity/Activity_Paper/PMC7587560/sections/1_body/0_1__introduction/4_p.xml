<p>Natural compounds from Chinese herbs, including polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenes, and other herbal ingredients, can be used as QSIs [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Previously, we screened natural food materials for active QSI substances, and revealed that aqueous polyphenols from 
 <italic>Rosa rugosa</italic> flower have anti-QS activities [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Here, 38 kinds of Chinese herbs were screened for natural compounds with QSI activity. Active substances were selected to verify their effects on AI-1 QS-related bacterial phenotypes, including violacein synthesis, migration, and biofilm formation. This work provides the theoretical foundation for the development of new antibacterial drugs.
