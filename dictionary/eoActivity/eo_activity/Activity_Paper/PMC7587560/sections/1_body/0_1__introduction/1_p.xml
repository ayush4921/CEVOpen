<p>Since their discovery, antibiotics, have played a vital role in the treatment of bacterial infections and diseases in humans and animals [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria are currently one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Without intervention, it is expected that various “superbugs” will emerge one after the other in the future. Therefore, a major challenge for researchers is to develop novel therapies to control diseases caused by these drug-resistant pathogens.
