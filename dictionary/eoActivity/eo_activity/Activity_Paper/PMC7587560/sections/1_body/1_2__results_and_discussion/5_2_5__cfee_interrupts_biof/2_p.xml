<p>The total yield of the biofilms formed by 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 significantly (0.01 &lt; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) decreased as the CFEE concentration increased. This indicated that CFEE could inhibit 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 biofilm formation and that the rate of inhibition was positively correlated with CFEE concentration. In 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, the total yield of biofilms did not significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) change with the increasing CFEE concentrations up to 100 μg/mL. However, CFEE at concentrations greater than 100 μg/mL could inhibit biofilm formation by 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12. CFEE also inhibited biofilm formation by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 at concentrations greater than 200 μg/mL. In contrast with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12, the biofilm productions formed by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 increased significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) with increasing CFEE concentrations from 25 to 100 μg/mL. These findings indicate that CFEE can interfere with the normal formation of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 biofilms, which is regulated by the QS system. Although the amount of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 biofilm increased in the presence of increasing concentrations of CFEE, the structure of the biofilm may have changed. Naringin can loosen the biofilm structure of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, with an apparent increase in thickness of the biofilm and decrease in density, which is also a typical feature of QSI activity [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. CFEE may therefore induce changes in the biofilm structure as observed with naringin. Consequently, the scavenging capacity of CFEE on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 biofilms was investigated.
