 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 is often used for screening QSIs. When the 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 CviR receptor is bound by exogenous C6-HSL, violacein expression regulated by the QS system is activated. Phenolic compounds can inhibit the QS system by competitively binding to the CviR receptor, thereby blocking the production of violacein [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], Thus, inhibition of 
 <italic>C. violaceum</italic> 026 violacein production by CFEE must be the result of active QSI molecules. These molecules require identification and further study.
