<p>QS influences the initiation and maturation of bacterial biofilms [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. CFEE inhibited biofilm formation in the tested strains and destroyed mature biofilms. This is congruent with our previous observation of 
 <italic>Rosa rugosa</italic> polyphenols [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-04727" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, CFEE is a potential QSI for Gram-negative bacteria, and it is worth investigating the active molecule composition and their mechanism of action.
