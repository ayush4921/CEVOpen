    "Chinese herbs are a useful resource bank for natural drug development, and have attracted considerable attention to exploit quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs). This study was designed to screen QSIs from raw Chinese herb materials. Of the 38 common herbs examined, the ethanol extract of <i>Campsis grandiflora</i> flower had the strongest QSI activity. The <i>C. grandiflora</i> flower ethanol extract (CFEE) was purified by HPD600, and the QSI activities were examined in further detail. CFEE inhibited violacein production of <i>Chromobacterium violaceum</i> 026 in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibit the swarming abilities of <i>Escherichia coli</i> K-12 and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PAO1. Furthermore, CFEE could inhibited biofilm formation and destroyed mature biofilms of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> PAO1. The composition of CFEE was determined by UPLC-MS/MS to distinguish active QSI compounds, and 21 compounds were identified. In addition to gallic acid and caffeic acid, two organic acids, malic acid and succinic acid, were confirmed for the first time to have autoinducer type 1 QSI activities. Therefore, CFEE is a potential QSI that could be used as a novel antimicrobial agent and should be considered for medicinal development."
