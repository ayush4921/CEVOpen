<p>Optical rotations were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Model 241 polarimeter in a 100 Ã— 2 mm cell in CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>. IR spectra (neat) were recorded on a Beckman IR 4230 spectrophotometer. NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker WM-400 spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 100.6 MHz for 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra, and were referenced to the residual deuterated solvent peaks. EI-MS spectra were recorded on a Varian MAT 711 spectrometer (70 eV, direct inlet), CI-MS were recorded on a Varian MAT 44 spectrometer (isobutane used as ionization gas).
