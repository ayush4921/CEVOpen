<p>Only small populations of the endemic 
 <italic>Ferula</italic> species, here considered to represent the silphion plant, exist in three locations in Anatolia all associated with the locations of former Greek villages. These locations were discovered serendipitously with the help of local villagers, and these plant populations grow in protected enclaves such as stone-walled orchards. No other populations have been found to exist except for a small population found in an adjacent lot of the original plant material collection site. Conservation studies have been initiated to preserve and propagate this species. Details of the initial conservation study and training of the local villagers to protect this plant species while providing them potentially valuable economic resource will be discussed.
