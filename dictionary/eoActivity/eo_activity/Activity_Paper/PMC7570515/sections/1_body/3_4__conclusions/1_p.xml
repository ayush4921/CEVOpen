<p>This study does not support the current morphological classification of the genus 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> in Kenya, where the coastal population is said to be composed of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>viscosa</italic>, whereas the in-country are classified as 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>angustifolia.</italic> The metabolomics data indicate the Gazi coast (
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>viscosa</italic>) population to be chemically similar to the Nanyuki and Machakos populations that are composed of plants that have been designated to be 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic>. Therefore, a revision of the taxonomic classification is recommended as the Narok and Nairobi collections had no relatedness with Nanyuki and Machakos plants that are all currently regarded as subspecies 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic>. Further characterization of these populations is needed and a molecular phylogenetic analysis would provide new insights into the taxonomy of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> in Kenya. From the four compounds isolated (two diterpenoids and two flavonoids), hautriwaic acid lactone (
 <bold>3</bold>), and catechin (
 <bold>4</bold>) were the most active in terms of antimicrobial activity. This is the first report on the isolation of 5,7,4′,5′-tetrahydroxy-3,6,2′-trimethoxyflavone (
 <bold>2</bold>) from this species. We also recommend studies of different pharmacological activities (both in vitro and in vivo) to determine whether the 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> populations are different in terms of their bioactivity.
