<p>Analysis was performed using a Waters Synapt G2 quadrupole time-of-flight High Definition Mass Spectrometer (Milford, MA, USA), linked to a Waters Acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) and Acquity photo diode array (PDA) detector. Ionization was achieved with an electrospray source using a cone voltage of 15 V and capillary voltage of 2.5 kV in negative mode. Nitrogen was used as the desolvation gas at 650 l h
 <sup>−1</sup> and the desolvation temperature was set to 275 °C. A Waters UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm particle size) was used and 3 μL was injected for each analysis. The gradient started with 100% using 0.1% (

 <italic>v</italic>) formic acid (solvent A) and this was kept at 100% for 0.5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 22% acetonitrile (solvent B) over 2.5 min, 44% solvent B over 4 min, and finally to 100% solvent B over 5 min. The column was subjected to 100% solvent B for an additional 2 min. Then, the column was re-equilibrated over 1 min to yield a total run time of 15 min. A flow rate of 0.4 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> was applied. The MSE mode was used to acquire the data with a low collision energy scan followed by a high collision energy scan with collision energy ramped from 20 to 60 to obtain both molecular ion [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> and fragment data at the same time. For each biological replicate of the materials collected, there were three technical replicates analyzed.
