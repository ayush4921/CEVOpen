<p>Ground material of (800 g) of 
 <italic>Dodonaea viscosa</italic> Gazi coastal plants was exhaustively and sequentially extracted with a sufficient amount of methanol (CH
 <sub>3</sub>OH)/dichloromethane (CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>) in the ratio of 1:1, for 72 h. The resultant extract was filtered to remove debris and the solvent was removed in vacuo using a rotary evaporator and resulted in 220 g of the crude extract. A portion of this extract (50 g) was adsorbed in 100 g of silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh) and subjected to column chromatography on silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh) (700 g) packed under 100% 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. The column was eluted with 100% 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane followed by increasing polarity of EtOAc in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane starting from 1% to 100% of EtOAc, followed by CH
 <sub>3</sub>OH in EtOAc in increasing percentages. A total of 240 fractions, each 400 mL, were collected and combined on the basis of TLC (on silica gel 60 F254, Merck) analysis. Elutions made at 1–15% of EtOAc in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane did not yield any compound but resulted in oily substances. Fractions eluted between 15% and 30% of EtOAc in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane were combined and washed with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/EtOAc (3:2) to give a white amorphous solid 
 <bold>1</bold> (100 mg). Elutions obtained at 40% of EtOAc in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane were combined and washed with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/EtOAc (3:2) to yield a yellow powder of 
 <bold>2</bold> (11 mg). Fractions obtained between 40% and 100% were further combined to yield 10 g, and further separated by column chromatography over silica gel using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane containing increasing polarity of EtOAc and yielded a white amorphous compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (29 mg) at 30% of EtOAc in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane elution.
