<p>From the score plot of the OPLS-DA test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04130-f004">Figure 4</xref>A) it was apparent that the Machakos and Nanyuki collections were distinct from each other based on chemical composition. The members within the Machakos population differentiated into two distinct sub-clusters, suggesting inherent chemical bias within this population of plants (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04130-f003">Figure 3</xref>A. This sub-clustering could be due to intraspecific hybridization, with members from populations occurring in adjacent ecological zones. Intraspecific hybridization is important for developing environmentally adaptive traits [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04130-f004">Figure 4</xref>B) revealed that sets of unique chemicals which were absent in the Nanyuki group were present in the collections from the Machackos area and vice versa. The chemical discriminants identified in the Nanyuki population were santin, pinocembrin, and dodonic acid, whereas those from the Machakos region were kumatakenin, penduletin, and 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-3′-(4-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-5′-prenyl-3,6-dimethoxyflavone. Therefore, the OPLS-DA was powerful in diagnosing the differences between two systems or groups by determining the variables with high discriminatory power [
