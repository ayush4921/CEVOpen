<p>Principal component (PC) 1 and 2 accounted for 28% and 17.2%, respectively, of the variance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04130-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). Principal component 1 usually accounts for the major variation on the x-axis while PC 2 accounts for minor variation in the y-axis. According to the two PC scores, the Nanyuki and Machakos clusters fell in the same quadrat and appeared to cluster closer to each other in addition to production of similar metabolites in almost equal relative amounts leading to our choice of using an orthogonal partial least square-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) test to further separate them. The OPLS-DA test is suitable for diagnosing the differences between two groups or systems which are closely related, as it has the potential to reduce the dimensionality of metabolomics datasets [
