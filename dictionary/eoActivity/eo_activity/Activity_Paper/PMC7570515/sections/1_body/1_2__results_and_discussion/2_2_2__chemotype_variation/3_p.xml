<p>Absolute quantification of discriminants identified from the five different collections of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> plants (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04130-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) showed that the Nanyuki population had the highest relative abundance of six chemical markers (santin, pinocembrin, dodonic acid, p-coumaric acid ethyl ester, terpenticin 2, and hypophyllin E) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04130-f005">Figure 5</xref>). The Gazi coastal and Nairobi plants each had higher levels of three and two chemicals, respectively, that discriminated the collections based on site. For the coastal types, two dimers of terpentecin and terpenticin 1 were differentially accumulating. As opposed to this, the Nairobi group had kumatakenin and ent-16j-hydroxy-labdan-3a,8b-dihydroxy,13(14)-en-15,16-olide as the chemicals that were upregulated.
