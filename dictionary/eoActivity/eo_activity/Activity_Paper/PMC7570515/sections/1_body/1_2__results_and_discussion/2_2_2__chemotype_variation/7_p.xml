<p>It can be argued that the metabolite production by the different populations of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> in Kenya is possibly based on prevailing environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This is probably influenced by epigenetic mechanisms which enhance phenotypic plasticity possibly as an adaptation to address the different levels of environmental stresses and in such cases, this can be transmitted successfully to the next offspring for numerous generations ultimately leading to transgenerational changes that evolve over time [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04130" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We propose this idea as the plants that are currently classified as 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>viscosa</italic>, growing in the Gazi coast, are in fact more similar in their phytochemical composition to the Nanyuki and Machakos populations that are composed of plants that have been designated to be 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic>. On the contrary, the Narok and Nairobi populations, which are composed of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>angustifolia,</italic> were found to have no relatedness with Nanyuki and Machakos populations, which were also composed of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> subsp 
 <italic>angustifolia</italic>. This is the first report on the relatedness of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> populations in Kenya, and based on the data presented in this study, a revision of the taxonomic classification is needed. Other molecular based techniques, such as a phylogenetic analysis could provide new insights into the taxonomy of 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> in Kenya.
