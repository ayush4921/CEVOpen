<p>We used the complete chloroplast genomes sequence of 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> and 9 other related species and 
 <italic>Brassica napus</italic> and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> as outgroup to construct phylogenetic tree. The 10 chloroplast genome sequences were aligned with MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and then the Neighbour-joining tree was constructed by MEGA 7.0 (Kumar etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The results confirmed that 
 <italic>S. tora</italic> was clustered with 
 <italic>S. bicapsularis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).
