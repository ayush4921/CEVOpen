<p>The antibacterial activities of the isolated compounds (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03683-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) provide new information. Eldeen and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported that anolignan b, termilignan b (lignans) and arjunic acid (triterpenoid) are the major antibacterial constituents of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark. However, our study suggests that the ellagitannins also play a role in the antibacterial activities. Remarkably, although resveratrol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-rutinoside and sericoside are major root metabolites, they do not seem to contribute directly to the antibacterial activity of the root bark.
