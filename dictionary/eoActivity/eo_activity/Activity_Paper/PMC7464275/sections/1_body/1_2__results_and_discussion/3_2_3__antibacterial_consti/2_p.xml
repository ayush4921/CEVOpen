<p>Ellagic acid (

 <bold>9</bold>) were isolated as the active compounds, with the lowest MIC value obtained for (
 <bold>7</bold>) as 0.05 mg/mL against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>. Surprisingly, bioassay-guided fractionation did not reveal anolignan b, termilignan b and arjunic acid, previously associated with antibacterial activity [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and these were therefore not isolated during this part of the study. Among all the compounds tested, flavogallonic acid dilactone (
 <bold>5</bold>) and methyl- flavogallonate (
 <bold>6</bold>) yielded broad-spectrum activity. In previous studies, ellagic acid displayed antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC value 0.13 mg/mL) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MIC value 0.25 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Arjunetin isolated from the bark of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic>, displayed antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> with an MIC of 0.13 mg/mL, but was not active against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MIC &gt; 0.5 mg/mL) or 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MIC &gt; 0.5 mg/mL) [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-03683" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our study is the first to report the antibacterial activities of isolated compounds of 
 <italic>T. sericea</italic> root bark against a wide range of pathogens.
