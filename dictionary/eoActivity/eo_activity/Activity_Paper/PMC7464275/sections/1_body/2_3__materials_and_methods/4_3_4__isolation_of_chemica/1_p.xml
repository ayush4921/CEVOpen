<p>Approximately 1.2 kg of the powdered bulk root bark was soaked in dichloromethane:methanol (1:1) for 48 h. The solvent was removed from the filtrate under reduced pressure at 40 Â°C to obtain 365 g of crude extract. A portion of the crude extract (140 g) was dissolved in methanol and adsorbed onto silica gel (Kieselgel 60, Merck). The dried sample was layered onto a silica gel column, which had been slurry-packed in ethyl acetate. Compounds were initially eluted with ethyl acetate, and finally with ethyl acetate:methanol (90:10) to obtain two corresponding fractions, namely Fraction 1 (18.56 g) and Fraction 2 (87.42 g).</p>
