<p>Root bark samples from 42 individual trees were collected from 10 populations (labelled P1 to P10) across Limpopo Province, South Africa (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03683-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), between May and June 2015. Twenty-five samples (six populations) were collected from Vhembe District, while nine samples (two populations) were collected from Mopani District. The remaining eight samples were collected from the Waterberg District. Composite samples were also prepared from the collected samples. The trees were identified by Prof Peter Tshisikhawe (Department of Botany, University of Venda, Thohoyandou, South Africa). For each population, a voucher specimen was prepared and deposited in the herbarium of the Department of Botany (voucher numbers are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03683-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). After debarking and washing to remove debris, the root bark was air-dried for two weeks and then ground to a fine powder using a grinder (Büchi Labortechnik, Flawil, Switzerland). A 5.0 g portion of each sample was soaked in 200 mL 1:1 dichloromethane:methanol (analytical grade, Merck, Germany) (1:1) for 24 h and filtered (Whatman No 4 filter paper). The filtrates were evaporated to dryness using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland) at 45 °C. The extraction procedure was repeated twice, and the filtrates were combined. The dried crude extracts were weighed and stored at −20 °C.
