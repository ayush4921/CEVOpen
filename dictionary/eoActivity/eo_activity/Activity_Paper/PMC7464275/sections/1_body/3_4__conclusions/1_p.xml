<p>This study has revealed chemotypic variation that is not population-specific, within root bark samples. Three groups, characterised by high concentrations of sericic acid, an unidentified triterpenoid glycoside and sericoside, respectively, were identified, suggesting that even more variation may exist amongst natural populations. Although the activities recorded against a range of gastro-intestinal and respiratory pathogens were in most cases not noteworthy, the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of individual compounds (flavogallonic acid dilactone and methyl flavogallonate) deserves further attention. Throughout the study it became clear that a delicate balance between the active and non-active compounds strongly influences the activities of the crude extract. This aspect will have to be further investigated using pure compounds, to determine additive, synergistic or attenuating interactions between the compounds, if root bark extracts are to be fully commercialised.</p>
