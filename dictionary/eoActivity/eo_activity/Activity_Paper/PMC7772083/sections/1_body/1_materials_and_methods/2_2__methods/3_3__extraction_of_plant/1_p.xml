<p>A fresh plant (aerial parts) was collected, shade dried, and powdered in an electrical grinder. The coarsely powdered plants were sieved through sieve no. 30. The powdered were extracted with 96% ethanol and water as a solvent at room temperature using the cold maceration process. 100 grams of the plant materials were soaked in 250 ml of solvent separately for 72 hours in a conical flask. Filtrations were done using Whatmann No.1 filter paper and the filtrate was collected in a conical flask and then covered using aluminium foil.
