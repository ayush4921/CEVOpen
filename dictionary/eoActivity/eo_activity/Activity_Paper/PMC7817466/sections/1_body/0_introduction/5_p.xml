<p id="p0045">The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, along with the lack of targeted medicaments and vaccines, forced the scientific world to seek new antiviral formulations. This article reviews the feasibility of using polyphenols extracted from plants as a source of bioactive components (e.g., gallates and quercetin), effective in mitigating SARS-CoV-2 and boosting the immune system. There is potential for the utilization of plant-derived polyphenols as functional foods and pharmaceutical formulations. The method of employing such formulations is fast because the raw materials for their preparation, namely herbs and useable plants, are permitted for human consumption worldwide. Approximately 100 research papers were selected from Science Direct, Scopus, MDPI, PubMed, and Web of Science to review the recently published papers on the related topic with the aid of relative keywords.</p>
