 <italic>D. chryseum</italic> was found being effective as well in inhibiting U251 cells in a dose-dependent manner with moderate percentages of inhibition and corresponding IC50 values: 28.76% (612.54 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for DCW and 17.15% (1059.92 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) for DCT. The cytotoxic activities of wild and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> samples differed in such a way that the inhibitory action of samples derived from wild-grown plant material was better than that from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>-grown samples. However, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>-grown samples still provided substantial inhibition of the investigated human glioblastoma cell proliferation (
