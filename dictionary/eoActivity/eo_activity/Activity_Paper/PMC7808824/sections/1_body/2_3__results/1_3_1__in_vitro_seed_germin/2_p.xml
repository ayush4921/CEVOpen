<p>All the tested conditions responded to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> seed germination and protocorm development of 
 <italic>D. chryseum</italic>. The earliest response for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> seed germination was observed on 1/2 MS medium alone and on FMS medium supplemented with 5% and 10% CW which took three weeks of culture for germination (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). This medium condition was also found to be effective for the earlier development of protocorms which took four weeks of culture incubation (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, a large number of protocorms was observed on 1/2 MS medium specified with the highest dry biomass yield of 3.5â€‰g as compared to other tested conditions. Thus, obtained protocorms were used for the phytochemical extraction (
