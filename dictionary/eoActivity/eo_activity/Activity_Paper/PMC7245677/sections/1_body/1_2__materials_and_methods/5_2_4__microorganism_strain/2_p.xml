<p>These strains were preserved in 25% glycerol at −80°C. One strain tube was thawed rapidly at 37°C and cultured in 10 ml Brain heart infusion (BHI, Merck) at 37°C over 24 hours. The bacteria were streaked on BHI agar (BHA, Merck) at 37°C over 24 hours. One to five colonies were used to prepare bacterial suspension to match a 0.5 McFarland standard (1–1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml). Mueller-Hinton agar medium (MHA, Merck) and MHA supplied 2% glucose medium (MHGA, Merck) were used for determination antibacterial and antifungal activity, respectively.
