<p>The well agar diffusion assay was used for analyzing the activity of the investigated extracts. The results showed that only the ethyl acetate fraction from 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> had antibacterial activity against tested isolates. MIC values of the ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>A. conyzoides</italic> were determined by the agar dilution assay on the isolates of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> that had minimum and maximum diameters of growth inhibition zone and on ESBL-producing isolates. The width of inhibition zones and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab8" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>. In detail, the IZD on 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> is indicated from 10.83 mm (E3) to 23.72 mm (E72) and from 9.33 mm (K18) to 19.73 mm (K17), respectively. 
 <italic>A. conyzoides'</italic>s ethyl acetate fraction displayed MIC values on E3, E72, K17, and K18 being 12.5, 5, 10, and 1.25 mg/ml, respectively. ESBL-producing strains, E68, and K26 expressed MIC 6.25 and 2.5 mg/ml, respectively.
