<p>All nine ethanol extracts were capable of capturing DPPH free radicals. 
 <italic>T. erecta</italic> extracts had the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, 17.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, which is only 2.4 times higher than the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of ascorbic acid. This result could be due to the presence of a large amount of flavonoid and phenolic compounds in 
 <italic>T. erecta</italic> as mentioned in preliminary phytochemicals. In the previous studies, marigolds displayed to contain quercetagetin, glucoside of quercetagetin, phenolics, syringic acid, methyl 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxy benzoate, quercetin, thienyl, and ethyl gallate [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Quercetin and ethyl gallate are potent antioxidant compounds in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Containing many compounds with strong free-radical scavenging effects of 
 <italic>T. erecta</italic> showed the ability for treatment of diseases caused by free radicals such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular. However, this capacity needs to be evaluated more accurately by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests.
