<p>Here, we present preliminary findings of antibacterial activities of crude extracts of 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> against twenty clinical isolates of MRSA. Both plants are equally effective against MRSA at a MIC of 0.064 mg/mL, but 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> is more effective since the hexane extract inhibited more than 50% of MRSA strains at significantly lower MIC of 0.012 mg/mL. Presence of phenolic compounds, alkaloids, and flavonoids identified in a previous study confirmed the presence of possible active compounds responsible for the antimicrobial effect in both 
 <italic>E. divaricata</italic> and 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>. Since hexane extract was proven as the most active extract, low polar active phytochemicals present in the plant extracts may be responsible for this antimicrobial activity. Fractionation, purification, and identification of active compounds are essential in developing these extracts as potential therapeutics. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies will be performed with purified active components to investigate their pharmacokinetics and toxic effects in the future.
