<p>Bacterial susceptibility was tested using the disc diffusion assay. Crude extract, 10-fold, and 100-fold dilutions of each plant extract were prepared in 10% DMSO. Bacteria cell suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards to prepare 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml inoculum. Each standardized inoculum was introduced and evenly distributed on the surface of sterile Mueller–Hinton agar plates. Previously prepared sterile filter paper discs (Whatman No. 1, diameter = 6 mm) were soaked in 10 
 <italic>μL</italic> of each plant extract. They were placed on the seeded Mueller–Hinton agar plates. Vancomycin (30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/disc) disk was used as the positive control, and 10% DMSO-soaked filter paper disk was used as the negative control. The same procedure was used for all the MRSA strains used. The plates were incubated aerobically at 35 ± 2°C for 18–24 hr. After incubation, diameters of the zones of inhibition were measured using a Vernier caliper. Each test was carried out in triplicate, and the average values of the diameters were considered. Activity index (AI) and relative percentage inhibition (RPI) for each extract were calculated using the following formula [
