<p>Trong Le et al. reported antimicrobial activities of essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>Paramignya trimera</italic> and 
 <italic>Limnocitrus littoralis</italic> which were used in the Vietnamese traditional medicine [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. trimera</italic> strongly inhibited 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 43300 and the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> clinical strain with MIC and MLC (minimum lethal concentration) values of 2% (v/v), but 
 <italic>L. littoralis</italic> did not inhibit 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Oil extracted from 
 <italic>P. trimera</italic> consisted of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene oxide, 7-epi-
 <italic>α</italic>-eudesmol, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-muurolene as major components. This suggested that the presence of 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene and 
 <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene oxide may be responsible for the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>P. trimera</italic> against 
 <italic>S. aureus.</italic> Another Vietnamese study on essential oil extracted from the leaves of 
 <italic>Leoheo domatiophorus</italic> inhibited 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 43300 and the 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> clinical strain [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains were inhibited at MIC of 0.25% (v/v) and MLC of 0.5% (v/v). GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) analysis of the essential oil of 
 <italic>L. domatiophorus</italic> indicated the presence of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, oxygenated sesquiterpenes as the main classes of compounds. Viridiflorene, (−)-
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>-muurolene were present at higher concentrations, while 
 <italic>α</italic>-muurolene, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-cadinene, (+)-aromadendrene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-cadinol, and globulol were present at lower concentrations.
