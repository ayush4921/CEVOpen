<p id="Par49">SOD is an endogenous antioxidant enzyme that catalyses the dismutation of superoxide anion (O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) into hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O
 <sub>2</sub>). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a, PC-12 cells treated with 400 μM corticosterone significantly decreased the SOD activity to 70.24 ± 4.78% or 1.4-fold lower compared to negative control (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, pre-treatment with 0.25 mg/mL HESAE did not increase the activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Neither 0.25 mg/mL HESAE nor desipramine increased the activity, and therefore higher concentrations of HESAE at 0.5 and 1 mg/mL were tested for SOD activity. Pre-treatment with 0.5 and 1 mg/mL HESAE significantly increased the activity up to 99.97 ± 21.6% and 99.46 ± 3.20% or 1.4-fold higher compared to corticosterone, respectively (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 1.6-fold higher compared to desipramine (
