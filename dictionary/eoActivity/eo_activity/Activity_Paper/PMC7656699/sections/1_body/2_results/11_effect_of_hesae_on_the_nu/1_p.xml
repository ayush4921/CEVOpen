<p id="Par55">Hoechst 33258 emits blue fluorescence upon binding with DNA to distinguish apoptotic cells from normal cells. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a, PC-12 cells in the negative control group exhibited homogenously dim blue oval-shaped nuclei after staining with Hoechst 33258. 400 μM corticosterone caused an increase in bright blue fluorescence compared to the negative control, indicating cell apoptosis. However, pre-treatment with 0.25 mg/mL HESAE markedly decreased the fluorescence intensity. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>c, 400 μM corticosterone significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells from 100.00 ± 7.72% to 184.5 ± 3.85% (
