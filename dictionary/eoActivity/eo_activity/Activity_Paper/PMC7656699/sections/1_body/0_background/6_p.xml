<p id="Par30">Thus, antioxidant defence system comprising of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants are required to combat oxidative stress for optimal cellular functioning and maintain redox homeostasis in living organisms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Typical primary antioxidants include phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids, tocopherols, phospholipids, amino acids, phytic acid, ascorbic acid, sterols and pigments. Phenolic compounds act as free radical terminators and able to upregulate the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and therefore indirectly attenuate oxidative stress [

 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> have been attributed to its remarkably high phenolic acid and flavonoid contents [

 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> appears to have anti-inflammatory properties that can counteract the detrimental effects of free radicals.
