 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The present study aimed to examine several key questions pertaining to neuroprotective role of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> in association with cellular and mitochondrial consequences of oxidative stress. We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> standardised aqueous extract (HESAE) in a depression mimicking condition through the establishment of high-dose corticosterone-induced oxidative stress model in PC-12 cells, and analysed the major chemical constituents in the extract. The PC-12 cells possess high levels of glucocorticoid receptors that mediate the rapid response to high-dose corticosterone, which has been widely used as an in vitro experimental model to study depression [
