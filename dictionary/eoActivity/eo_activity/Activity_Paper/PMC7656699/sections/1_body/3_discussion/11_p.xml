<p id="Par70">Adenosine from 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> fruiting bodies was first discovered by Mizuno [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is an endogenous nucleoside classified under glycosylamines consisting of an adenine attached to a ribose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The yield of adenosine at 0.46% is 3.3-fold higher compared to that of 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (Curtis) P. Karst. (0.14%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] but almost 2-fold lower than that of 
 <italic>Cordyceps militaris</italic> (L.) Fr. (0.81%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Adenosine is a neuromodulator that acts through multiple mechanisms, including regulation of neurotransmitter releases from synaptic vesicles, neuronal hyperpolarisation or depolarisation, and glial cell activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Adenosine has both excitatory and inhibitory effects through its A
 <sub>1</sub> and A
 <sub>2A</sub> receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. On the other hand, isolation of herierin III from 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> mycelium grown on solid media was pioneered by Qian et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] followed by its discovery in the mycelium produced by submerged fermentation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Herierin III is a heterocyclic compound classified under pyrones. The yield of herierin III at 0.05% is 5-fold higher than the amount (0.01%) reported by Zhang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Although the compound has also been isolated from mycelium of 
 <italic>Morchella</italic> Dill. ex Pers. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], 
 <italic>Hericium americanum</italic> Ginns
 <italic>, Hericium abietis</italic> (Weir ex Hubert) K.A. Harrison and 
 <italic>Hericium alpestre</italic> Pers. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], its beneficial effects in human health is still poorly understood. Taken together, further investigation on the neuroprotective effects of adenosine and herierin III derived from 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> can be conducted in pre-clinical models of depression.
