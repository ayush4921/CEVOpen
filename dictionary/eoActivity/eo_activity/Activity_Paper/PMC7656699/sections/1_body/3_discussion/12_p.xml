 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. We propose that the exogenous antioxidant compounds in HESAE possess neuroprotective effects against high-dose corticosterone-induced oxidative stress in PC-12 cells. The antioxidants can pass through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm and mitochondria. They upregulated endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities of SOD and CAT, prevented mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by the restoration of MMP levels and the prevention of MMP depolarisation in the inner mitochondrial membrane, reduced intracellular ROS levels, decreased LDH release and inhibited apoptosis. Reconstruction of mitochondrial functions showed the prevention of downstream apoptotic cascades in the maintenance of cellular integrity. However, these antioxidants failed to increase the depleted levels of GPx in the cytoplasm and aconitase in the mitochondrial matrix. Remarkably, the neuroprotective effects were similar to that of desipramine, a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant and a potent inhibitor of the noradrenaline reuptake. However, the anti-cholinergic and H
 <sub>1</sub>-antihistaminergic activities of desipramine can cause adverse effects such as blurred vision, postural hypotension, dry mouth, tremors, seizures, confusion, delirium and sedation [
