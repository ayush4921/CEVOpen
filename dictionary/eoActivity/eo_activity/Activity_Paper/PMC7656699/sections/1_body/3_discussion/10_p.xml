<p id="Par69">HESAE was further extracted with ethanol to obtain compounds with lower polarity and the phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of adenosine and herierin III. Hydro-alcoholic extractions have been recommended for the recovering of biologically active compounds of mushrooms including phenolic compounds and flavonoids [
