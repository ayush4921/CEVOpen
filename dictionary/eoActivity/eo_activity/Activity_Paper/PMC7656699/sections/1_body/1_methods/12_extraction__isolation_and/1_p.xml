<p id="Par43">The HESAE was macerated and extracted with 95% ethanol. The ethanol extract was then concentrated in vacuo and subjected to two different isolation methods based on size exclusion and polarity. In the size exclusion-based method, ethanol extract was fractionated using gel permeation chromatography [Sephadex LH-20, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden; methanol (MeOH)] into 10 fractions for which a major compound was derived from the 8th fraction. In the polarity-based method, ethanol extract was partitioned with water and n-butanol into two solvent fractions. The n-butanol fraction was then fractionated using preparative radial chromatography (Silica gel 60 PF
 <sub>254</sub>, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Solvent systems used for preparative radial chromatography were chloroform (CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>) and 1–15% MeOH−CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>. The procedure was repeated for three runs to give 10 to 13 fractions. Another major compound was obtained from the 6th fraction of first run, and 5th fraction from second and third runs. The two major compounds were analysed using spectroscopic methods:
