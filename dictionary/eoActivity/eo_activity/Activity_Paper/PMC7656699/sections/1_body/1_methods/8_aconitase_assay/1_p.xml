<p id="Par39">The PC-12 cells were seeded onto a 6-well plate at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37 ± 2 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>-humidified incubator. The cells were then incubated with HESAE or desipramine for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h. Cells were homogenised in an assay buffer and centrifuged at 800 x 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. The aconitase activity was determined using an aconitase assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a multimode microplate reader (SpectraMax M3; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). The activity was expressed as a percentage of the negative control level.
