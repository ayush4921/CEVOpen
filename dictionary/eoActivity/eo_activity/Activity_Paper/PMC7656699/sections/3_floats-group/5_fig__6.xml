  <p>Effect of HESAE on the intracellular ROS levels and nuclear apoptosis in PC-12 cells treated with high-dose corticosterone. 
   <bold>a</bold> DCFH-DA staining showing green fluorescence indicating intracellular ROS in PC-12 cells following pre-treatment with HESAE for 48 h and high-dose corticosterone of 400 μM for 24 h. Hoechst 33258 staining showing blue fluorescence indicating apoptotic nuclei in PC-12 cells following pre-treatment with HESAE for 48 h and high-dose corticosterone of 400 μM for 24 h. (I) Negative control; (II) cells treated with 400 μM corticosterone; (III) cells pre-treated with desipramine followed by exposure to high-dose corticosterone; and (IV) cells pre-treated with 0.25 mg/mL HESAE followed by exposure to high-dose corticosterone. Scale bar = 100 μm. 
   <bold>b</bold> Effect of HESAE on intracellular ROS levels in high-dose corticosterone-treated PC-12 cells. Data are expressed as mean ± SD and statistically analysed by Tukey’s test. Asterisks (*) and hash signs (#) indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in fluorescence intensity compared to the corticosterone group and desipramine group, respectively. 
   <bold>c</bold> Effect of HESAE on percentage of apoptotic cells in high-dose corticosterone-treated PC-12 cells. Data are expressed as mean ± SD and statistically analysed by Tukey’s test. Asterisks (*) and hash signs (#) indicate significant differences (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to the corticosterone group and desipramine group, respectively
