Depression can greatly impact one&#x02019;s daily life and can lead to suicidal thoughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Malaysia, the overall prevalence of depression ranged from 8 to 12% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], but it is seldom prioritised by patients or clinicians. Currently, the combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological (including self-care or psychotherapeutic approaches) treatments for depression have only moderate to short-term efficacy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line antidepressants commonly used in clinical practice, however, they can have poor tolerability, delayed onset of therapeutic effects and limited efficacy in patients with milder depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, around 50% of patients experience recurrent depression within 6&#x02009;months after discontinuation of treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to develop and establish Traditional Chinese Medicines that can mimic the desirable antidepressants effects with minimal adverse consequences.</p><p id="Par26"><italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> (Bull.: Fr.) Pers. is a medicinal mushroom belonging to the division of Basidiomycota (Aphyllophoromycetideae, Hydnaceae). It grows on dying or dead oak, beech, maple, sycamore, walnut and other broadleaf trees. This mushroom, commonly known as Lion&#x02019;s Mane, Monkey&#x02019;s Head (Houtou in Chinese), Hedgehog Fungus, Satyr&#x02019;s Beard, Pom Pom Blanc, Igelstachelbart and Yamabushitake is native to Europe, North America and Asia. <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> has been well-known for over a thousand years in China and other Oriental countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Its pharmacological effects have been scientifically examined in the past 35&#x02009;years. Studies involving human subjects at the Third People&#x02019;s Hospital of Shanghai confirmed its effectiveness against ulcers, inflammations and tumours of digestive tract, and extended the life expectancy of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Commercial cultivation of <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> began in Malaysia two decades ago (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) by mainly using abundantly available waste lignocellulosic materials and rubber-wood sawdust. The isolation and characterisation of diterpenoid derivatives, namely hericenones from the fruiting bodies and erinacines from the mycelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], have prompted research into using this mushroom as a functional food.

A generally presumed mechanism of the pathogenesis of depression is that the neuroendocrine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis becomes hyperactive. Normally, the HPA axis is activated in response to stressors and ensures an organism responds appropriately to ever-changing environmental challenges, which is essential for survival. Blood glucocorticoid levels are sensitively controlled by the HPA axis via negative feedback regulation. An elevation in blood glucocorticoids in response to chronic stress or depression can disrupt HPA axis function. Chronic elevation of cortisol secretions in some depressive subtypes is thought to be responsible for cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], premature osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and other medical morbidities. Moreover, persistently high levels of blood glucocorticoids can lead to the mobilisation of energy stores (liver, fat and muscle), inflammation, neuronal death and even exacerbate depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Prolonged elevation of blood corticosterone has been reported to induce depressive-like behaviours in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and damage to the hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoids regulate mitochondrial function associated with neuroprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], ROS generation and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Chronic exposure to glucocorticoids was shown to enhance generation of ROS primarily triggered by damaged mitochondria, diminished cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and disrupted antioxidant systems. Furthermore, excessive ROS formation induces oxidative stress, leading to cellular damage and subsequent cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Indeed, oxidative stress in and around mitochondria has been postulated to underlie the pathogenesis of mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Thus, antioxidant defence system comprising of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants are required to combat oxidative stress for optimal cellular functioning and maintain redox homeostasis in living organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Exogenous antioxidants can be easily obtained through natural resources including medicinal mushrooms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Typical primary antioxidants include phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids, tocopherols, phospholipids, amino acids, phytic acid, ascorbic acid, sterols and pigments. Phenolic compounds act as free radical terminators and able to upregulate the activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and therefore indirectly attenuate oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The potent antioxidant properties of <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> have been attributed to its remarkably high phenolic acid and flavonoid contents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

The present study aimed to examine several key questions pertaining to neuroprotective role of <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> in association with cellular and mitochondrial consequences of oxidative stress. We evaluated the neuroprotective effects of <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> standardised aqueous extract (HESAE) in a depression mimicking condition through the establishment of high-dose corticosterone-induced oxidative stress model in PC-12 cells, and analysed the major chemical constituents in the extract. The PC-12 cells possess high levels of glucocorticoid receptors that mediate the rapid response to high-dose corticosterone, which has been widely used as an in vitro experimental model to study depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Mushroom sample</title><p id="Par32"><italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> standardised aqueous extract (HESAE; NevGro&#x000ae;; batch No. 7H2308X) was obtained from Ganofarm R&#x00026;D Private Limited, Tanjung Sepat, Selangor, Malaysia.

Our previous findings showed that HESAE contains a substantial amount of phytochemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. HESAE was able to attenuate oxidative stress induced by L-Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in fibroblasts derived from a patient with Friedreich&#x02019;s ataxia, which was attributed to the exogenous antioxidants of HESAE. Friedreich&#x02019;s ataxia constitutes an excellent example of a pathology involving oxidative stress associated with excess iron uptake in cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Here, we extended our investigation of HESAE into its neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress in PC-12 cells that mimics the effects of depression. We are particularly interested in elucidating endogenous antioxidant defence capabilities of HESAE on the maintenance of mitochondrial function.</p><p id="Par61">Antioxidants that inhibit the detrimental consequences of ROS are generally considered as promising therapeutic approach to neuroprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. An imbalance between the generation of ROS and the activity of antioxidant defence against ROS has been implicated in depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Oxidative stress caused by excessive ROS production has received considerable attention in recent years and has been proposed as a contributing factor to the pathophysiology of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, Behr et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] highlighted the antioxidant effects of antidepressant drugs and the mechanisms of antioxidants executing the neuroprotective capabilities in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).</p><p id="Par62">Several cellular mechanisms of high-dose corticosterone-mediated oxidative stress in PC-12 cells have been documented including the generation of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], introduction of mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and fragmentation of DNA leading to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Consistent with this, we showed that high-dose corticosterone markedly reduced the viability of PC-12 cells and increased the release of LDH into the extracellular space, confirming neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells. However, pre-treatment with HESAE at 0.25 to 1&#x02009;mg/mL prior to exposure to 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;M corticosterone significantly increased the viability in a dose-dependent manner. Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and Yu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] observed a similar degree of apoptosis in PC-12 cells treated with 400&#x02009;&#x003bc;M corticosterone, which support our findings on the dose of corticosterone that induces neurotoxicity in PC-12 cells.</p><p id="Par63">Neuroprotective effects of HESAE might be mediated by non-enzymatic antioxidant defence systems involving phenolic compounds and flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and by enzymatic antioxidants including SOD, CAT, GPx, glutathione reductase (GR) and paraoxonase 1 (PON1). In this study, pre-treatment with HESAE successfully restored the SOD and CAT activities confirming the enzymatic antioxidant defence mechanisms of HESAE. Our findings are in accordance with Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and Han et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] found that a polysaccharide derived from the mycelium (designated as EP-1) increased intestinal serum SOD activity in a rat model of acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis and in human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cellular model of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress. Han et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] found that a polysaccharide derived from the fruiting bodies increased CAT levels in a rat model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. The SOD is important in controlling cellular ROS levels, as it is responsible for the dismutation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, the principal ROS formed by the mitochondria to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par64">On the other hand, pre-treatment with HESAE failed to restore the activity of GPx following exposure to high-dose corticosterone. We hypothesised that the neuroprotective effects of HESAE were mediated through a glutathione-independent mechanism which resulted in compensatory increased in SOD and CAT. CAT serves as a major defence in high level of oxidative stress especially when there is a limited content of glutathione or decreased GPx activity, whereas glutathione redox cycle involving GPx serves as a major defence in low level of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">Depression is a complex multifactorial disease with many possible causes. Major depressive disorder is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction leading to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Mitochondria are widely recognised as a source of ROS, and overproduction of ROS leads to compromised antioxidant defence systems and oxidative stress. The interaction between energy metabolism and ROS is evident during the aging process and in the onset and progression of many age-related diseases. Upon exposure to high-dose corticosterone, dysfunction in mitochondrial autophagy machinery and impaired autophagy may increase mitochondrial ROS formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In this study, we observed that PC-12 cells treated with high-dose corticosterone had decreased cell viability, reduced endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, disrupted mitochondrial function, and increased oxidative stress and apoptosis. Pre-treatment of PC-12 cells with HESAE prior to the oxidative stress had prevented mitochondrial dysfunction, reduced intracellular ROS levels and attenuated apoptosis.</p><p id="Par66">Metabolic enzymes, such as &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and aconitase, are highly sensitive to O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>. Aconitase has been found in both cytosol and mitochondria, and it is involved in the metabolic regulation of iron and as a Krebs cycle intermediate for maintaining ROS homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Nevertheless, our findings reveal that pre-treatment with HESAE at higher concentrations of 0.5 and 1&#x02009;mg/mL did not appear to increase the aconitase activity upon exposure to high-dose corticosterone. This is in accordance with Lian and Stringer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] who demonstrated that a pre-treatment with glutamine, an exogenous antioxidant did not prevent the decrease in aconitase activity in the rat cortical astrocytes after exposure to cortical spreading depression and fluorocitrate, a selective inhibitor of astrocytic Krebs cycle.</p><p id="Par67">Monitoring the relative MMP in living cells can be a direct measurement of mitochondrial function. The mitochondrial electron transport chain creates an electrochemical gradient of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane driving ATP synthesis via mitochondrial ATP synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The electron transport chain is also involved in the formation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Excessive ROS production induces the rapid depolarisation of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential and subsequently impairs oxidative phosphorylation. Disruption of MMP triggers the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins leading to cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In this study, high-dose corticosterone reduced MMP levels in PC-12 cells, which is in line with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Conversely, pre-treatment of PC-12 cells with HESAE restored MMP levels, a key indicator of mitochondrial activity.</p><p id="Par68">Excess cellular ROS levels can activate apoptotic cell death pathways. Morphological changes associated with apoptosis include cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies, leading to changes in plasma membrane permeability and plasma membrane damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. In this study, HESAE was shown to attenuate apoptosis following exposure to high-dose corticosterone. Likewise, a biomass preparation of <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> also showed protective activity against Di-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP)-induced apoptosis mediated by caspase activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">HESAE was further extracted with ethanol to obtain compounds with lower polarity and the phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of adenosine and herierin III.

It is an endogenous nucleoside classified under glycosylamines consisting of an adenine attached to a ribose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

(0.81%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Adenosine is a neuromodulator that acts through multiple mechanisms, including regulation of neurotransmitter releases from synaptic vesicles, neuronal hyperpolarisation or depolarisation, and glial cell activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Adenosine has both excitatory and inhibitory effects through its A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. On the other hand, isolation of herierin III from <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> mycelium grown on solid media was pioneered by Qian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] followed by its discovery in the mycelium produced by submerged fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Herierin III is a heterocyclic compound classified under pyrones. The yield of herierin III at 0.05% is 5-fold higher than the amount (0.01%) reported by Zhang et al.

Taken together, further investigation on the neuroprotective effects of adenosine and herierin III derived from <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> can be conducted in pre-clinical models of depression.</p><p id="Par71">The possible neuroprotective mechanisms of HESAE are presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. We propose that the exogenous antioxidant compounds in HESAE possess neuroprotective effects against high-dose corticosterone-induced oxidative stress in PC-12 cells. The antioxidants can pass through the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm and mitochondria. They&#x000a0;upregulated endogenous antioxidant enzyme&#x000a0;activities of SOD and CAT, prevented mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by the restoration of MMP levels and the prevention of MMP depolarisation in the inner mitochondrial membrane, reduced intracellular ROS levels, decreased LDH release and inhibited apoptosis. Reconstruction of mitochondrial functions showed the prevention of downstream apoptotic cascades in the maintenance of cellular integrity. However, these antioxidants failed to increase the depleted levels of GPx in the cytoplasm and aconitase in the mitochondrial matrix. Remarkably, the neuroprotective effects were similar to that of desipramine, a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant and a potent inhibitor of the noradrenaline reuptake. However, the anti-cholinergic and H<sub>1</sub>-antihistaminergic activities of desipramine can cause adverse effects such as blurred vision, postural hypotension, dry mouth, tremors, seizures, confusion, delirium and sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].
