<p id="p0065">The use of BGN traditionally to treat many human diseases is prominent across sub-Saharan Africa countries (South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal) and therefore provides many opportunities for more study on the therapeutic importance and application of the crop [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several authors [

 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] have reported the presence of phytochemicals with antioxidant properties in legumes, and in particular, higher amounts of phenolic compounds including nutraceutical and functional ingredients have been found in the hull of BGN compared to other parts of the plant [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarises the nutraceuticals reported to be present in BGN and their functions. It is noted that the pre-processing techniques and extraction methods can affect the concentration and type of phenolics in BGN [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. For example, boiling dry beans have been reported to reduce the phenolic content (protease inhibitors) by 80%–90% and treatment with 60% ethanol improved the nutritional quality of BGN flour and dehulling was reported to reduce the tannins content by up to 92% [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Cooking red BGN was reported to enhance its nutraceutical profiles as the free radical scavenging speed was increased by 10-fold compared to the uncooked using methanolic extraction optimisation [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The work done by Mbagwu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] on the phytochemical components of BGN showed the presence of more alkaloids in the crop than other legumes and differences among the hulls of BGN landraces have been noted [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In a study aimed at identifying the medicinal properties of BGN, Harris et al. [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] found higher amounts of flavonoids and tannins in the hulls of both brown and red BGN landraces. Among the flavonoid compounds present in the hull of brown BGN, higher amounts of rutin (24.458 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and myricetin (1.800 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) were reported, and in the hull of red BGN, chlorogenic acid (0.115 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and ellagic acid (0.105 mg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) were the highest tannin compounds reported [
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In addition, a previous study found polyphenols (especially more catechin and epicatechin) in nuts of two market classes of BGN commonly grown in Zambia and the authors showed that their nutraceutical and antioxidant activities are enhanced after processing by cooking [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Furthermore, HPLC-PDA-ESI-MS profiling revealed new phenolic compounds (Quinic acid, (E) GC-hexoside, catechin glucoside, medioresinol, p-coumaric acid, salicylic acid, caffeic acid derivative and catechin dimer) in cooked seeds of BGN [
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Interestingly, differences in phenolic compounds were noted when the two market classes of BGN were compared [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which implies that there is potential do discover more novel phytochemical components of BGN making the crop a potential source of nutraceuticals. Although phenolic compounds (alkaloids, flavonoids, lignans, phenolic acids and tannins) in BGN are noted to treat some diseases, however, literature is scant on the correlation between the phenolic compound type, its content and remedy potency of BGN extracts for most ailments. Furthermore, literature is scant on the effect of pre-processing techniques and extraction methods of optimisation to fully utilise the nutraceutical potential of BGN. Therefore, there is need for more research geared towards assessing the nutraceutical value and antimicrobial potentials of this crop.
