<p id="p0070">There is an increasing knowledge of the benefits of nutraceuticals which have attracted the interest of researchers globally. Although limited works have been done on BGN, some works done on BGN have demonstrated their potentials as a source of nutraceuticals. This review examined the uses of BGN and found that the crop has varieties of uses which cut across medical and nutritional uses. However, it was noted that limited works have been done on the nutraceutical value of the crop and the effect of pre-processing techniques on the quantity and quality of phytochemicals including the methods of extraction for their optimisation. Most of the identified antimicrobial potentials of the crop were mainly against human pathogens placing the crop as a potential natural product that can be used in the future to synthesize drugs. This review suggests further research work is needed on the nutraceutical value and antimicrobial potentials of BGN.</p>
