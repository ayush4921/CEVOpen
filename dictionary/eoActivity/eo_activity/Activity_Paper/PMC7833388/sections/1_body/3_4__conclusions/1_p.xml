<p>After screening a large spectrum of articles dedicated to endophyte research, natural product drug discovery, combinatorial chemistry, genomics, metabolomics ethnobotany, modern medicine, and multidisciplinary science, we curated 101 specific plant-derived medicinal compounds efficiently biosynthesized by hundreds of endophytic fungi. Nonetheless, the exciting progress that has been made in the field of functional genomics, genome mining and genome scanning, fermentation technology, green combinatorial chemistry, and systems biology might remove the roadblocks in the way of commercial success of this innovative approach [

 <xref rid="B413-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">413</xref>]. In conclusion, the pursuit of the idea of endophyte-dependent enhanced in vivo and in vitro production of plant-derived valuable metabolites is of prime importance for the pharmaceutical industries, for the health care systems, and for a “green drug revolution”.
