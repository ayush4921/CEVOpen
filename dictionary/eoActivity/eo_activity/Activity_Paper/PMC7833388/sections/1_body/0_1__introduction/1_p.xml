<p>Several recent reports suggest that natural products may play a substantial role in the drug discovery and development process as a source of diverse and novel templates for future drugs [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With the rapidly evolving recognition that significant numbers of natural products are either produced by microbes or a result of microbial interactions with their hosts, the area of endophyte research for natural products is positioned to take the drug discovery and development process to the next level [
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the backdrop of the past 25 years of studies, endophytes may be defined as a polyphyletic group of unique microorganisms residing in healthy living internal tissues of the plants with covert and/or overt positive effects on their hosts. They establish a variety of intricate biological intra- and inter-relationships among them and with their hosts, respectively. Endophytes are able to produce a multitude of secondary metabolites with diverse biological activities [

 <xref rid="B8-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, merely 0.75–1.50% of known plant species has been explored for their endophytes yet. So, the opportunity to find new potential bioactive metabolites from cryptic endophytic microorganisms of nearly 374,000–400,000 plant species congruently occupying millions of biological niches is considered high [

 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This opportunity has increased further with the innovative discovery of biosynthesis of 
 <italic>Taxus</italic> derived anticancer compound ‘taxol’ from its endophytic fungus 
 <italic>T. andreanae</italic> in 1993 by Stierle et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This discovery leads to renewed attention in endophytic fungi for isolating plant-derived medicinal compounds [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Later, a series of works revealed that a reasonable number of plant-derived compounds are synthesized by endophytes rather than hosts [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, there are unsettled and contradictory reports regarding the phylogenetic origin of genes related to the biosynthesis pathway of such plant-derived compounds in host plants and their microbial endophytes [
 <xref rid="B16-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The above facts prompted us to use the word “plant/host-derived” rather than “plant/host-origin” for such compounds. Nevertheless, it is now an established fact that endophytes can co-/produce, induce, and/or modify a plethora of “specific plant-derived” metabolites in-/outside of host plants [
 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Such discoveries opened the new horizons for the up-scaled production of plant-derived medicinal compounds from endophytes. The recent increase in demand for natural products and difficulties in accessing them from plants make endophytes interesting targets for the assessment and isolation of typical host-derived compounds [
 <xref rid="B18-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since medicinal plants are an inherent source of many therapeutic compounds, it is vital to explore their endophytes to isolate such compounds. The current review aims to provide an up-to-date overview on the globally isolated specific plant-derived bioactive compounds synthesized by fungal endophytes from the period 1993 to mid-2020. It will also focus on applications and modes of actions of such compounds. This review will also provide insights about different challenges in employing endophytes as an alternative source for the synthesis of plant-derived bioactive compounds and their application in drug discovery. Its outcome would certainly lead to strategize the use of endophytes as an efficient novel source for plant-derived metabolites.
