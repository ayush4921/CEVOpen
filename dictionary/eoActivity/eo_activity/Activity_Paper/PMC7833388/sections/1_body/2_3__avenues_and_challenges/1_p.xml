 <xref rid="B298-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. Reports regarding the biosynthesis of plant-derived natural compounds from endophytic fungi coupled with recent dynamic progress in fermentation, extraction, purification, characterization, and bioassay techniques have enabled us to rapidly characterize valuable novel natural products and access earlier inaccessible endophytic resource [

 <xref rid="B404-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">404</xref>]. Generally, the fermentation process for fungi is short, simple, and economically feasible with a great degree of flexibility for modulation by feeding precursors, elicitors, special enzymes, and modifiers for the efficient enhanced production of bioactive compounds. Endophytes can uniquely biotransform original plant-derived bioactive compounds to their more efficient derivatives, leading to structural and functional diversification [

 <xref rid="B136-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B146-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. These studies have evidenced the incredible manipulability of fungal secondary metabolism. There are cases where endophytes up-regulated the synthesis of host compounds and the expression of related genes in the plant host. Hence, each report of the biosynthesis of plant-derived natural compounds from fungal endophytes clearly presents a hopeful way for the efficient and specific production of valuable bioactive natural compounds using endophytes as stable and smart “bio-laboratories”.
