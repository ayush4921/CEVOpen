 <italic>Rheum palmatum</italic> is a highly regarded traditional medicinal plant with cathartic, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antiaging properties. The dominant biologically active constituents in the medicinal roots of 
 <italic>Rheum</italic> are anthraquinones rhein, emodin, and physcion. The hepatoprotective activity of rhein is exerted by its lipid lowering, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant actions. Rhein also suppresses the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which are indicative of decreased hepatic stellate cell and myofibroblast activation [

Nephroprotective properties of rhein arise from its anti-inflammatory action along with the suppression of α-SMA, TGF-β, and fibronectin expression. The anti-inflammatory activity of rhein involves inhibition of the NF-κB pathway, which plays a role in the production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines [

 <italic>F. solani</italic> from the roots of 
 <italic>R. palmatum</italic> also produced the host-derived compounds rhein and emodin [
