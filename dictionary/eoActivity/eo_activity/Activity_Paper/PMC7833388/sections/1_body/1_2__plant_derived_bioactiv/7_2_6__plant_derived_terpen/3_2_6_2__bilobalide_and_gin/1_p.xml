<p>Bilobalide and ginkgolides, two main terpenoids found in the leaves and bark of 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic>, are accountable for the therapeutic implication of its whole extract [
 <xref rid="B301-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">301</xref>]. Ginkgo products, including EGb-761 registered as a phytomedicine in Europe, are now among the best-selling drugs in the world with US$ 1.26 billion worldwide sales in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B302-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>]. Widely consumed bilobalide (sesquiterpene) has neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic potential and inhibits the diffuse pneumonia caused by

Similarly, ginkgolides are considered as possible drugs based on their key antagonistic effects on the platelet-activating factor (PAF), neuroprotective effects, and protective effects in cardio-cerebral ischemia reperfusion injuries mediated via regulation of TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)/ fibroblast growth factor-inducible molecule 14 (Fn14) signaling pathway [
