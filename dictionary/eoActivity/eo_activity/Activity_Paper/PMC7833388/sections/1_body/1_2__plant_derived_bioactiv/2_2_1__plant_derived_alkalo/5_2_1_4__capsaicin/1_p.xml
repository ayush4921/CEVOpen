<p>Capsaicin, a spicy alkaloid of red pepper 
 <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> first crystallized in 1878, has antilithogenic, anti-inflammatory, thermogenic, gastro-stimulatory, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and anticancer attributes [
 <xref rid="B87-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Capsaicin selectively binds to calcium channel protein targeting transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) expressed by nociceptors and lowers its opening threshold, resulting in nociceptor depolarization. That is why capsaicin is linked to the sensation of heat and pain as well as obesity regulation via increased thermogenesis. Capsaicin decreases glucose tolerance by inhibiting adipose tissue inflammatory responses via decreasing adipose tissue macrophages and levels of inflammatory adipocytokines like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interleukin (IL)-6, and leptin. It also induces the TRPV1-dependent secretion of insulin and antihyperglycemic hormone glucagon. The potential beneficial effects of capsaicin on cardiovascular and gastroprotective systems are exhibited through the TRPV1-mediated release of neurotransmitter calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP). Capsaicin exerts its anticancer activity via the activation of cAMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)-induced apoptosis, down-regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) target gene B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), cell-cycle arrest by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6), modulation of the human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) pathway and p27 expression, down-regulation of p38mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase B (PKB or AKT), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation, and degradation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α [
