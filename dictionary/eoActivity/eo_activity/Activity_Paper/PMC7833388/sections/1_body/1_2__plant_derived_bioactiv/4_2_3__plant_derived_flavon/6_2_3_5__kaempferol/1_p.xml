<p>Kaempferol is a potent antioxidant, anticancer, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, and antidiabetic compound found in fruits and vegetables. It blocks the expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1B and TNF-α), COX-2 protein, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Kaempferol inhibits various cancer cells by arresting cell cycle at the G
 <sub>2</sub>/M phase, targeting several signaling pathways (MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT) that are essential for the survival of cancer cells and modulating expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers. It prevents the EGF-induced activation of activator protein 1 (AP-1) and NF-κB, and phosphorylation of AKT. It enhances cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A) levels via the reduced expression of c-Myc and enhanced level of p53 protein [
