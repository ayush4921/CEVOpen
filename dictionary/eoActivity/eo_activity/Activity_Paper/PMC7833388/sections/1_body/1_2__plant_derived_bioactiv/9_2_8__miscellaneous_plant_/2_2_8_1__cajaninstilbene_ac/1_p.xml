<p>The major active constituent of leaves of therapeutic pigeon pea extract is cajaninstilbene acid (CSA), which is a low-molecular weight compound containing two benzene rings joined by a molecule of ethylene. Pharmacological studies have shown that CSA exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and neuroprotective effects. Its cytoprotective effects against oxidative stress is exhibited by inducing the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant pathway and gene expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and glutamate–cysteine ligase modifier subunits by activation of PI3K/AKT, ERK, and JNK signaling pathways [

In a study, CSA attenuated the impairment of learning and memory induced by Aβ (1–42) oligomers by stimulating Aβ clearance and inhibiting microglial activation and astrocyte reactivity in the hippocampus. It also decreased the high levels of Glu but increased the low levels of GABA. In addition, CSA inhibited the excessive expression of GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and up-regulated the downstream protein kinase A (PKA)/CREB/ BDNF/ tropomyosin receptor kinases (TrkB) signaling pathway. The above findings imply that CSA could be a potential neuroprotective agent at the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease [
