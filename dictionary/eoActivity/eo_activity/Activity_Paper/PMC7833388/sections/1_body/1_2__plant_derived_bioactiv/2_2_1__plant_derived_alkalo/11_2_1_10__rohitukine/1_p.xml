<p>Rohitukine, a lead for the semisynthetic potential anticancer drugs flavopiridol (Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) and P-276-00 (Piramal Healthcare Ltd., Mumbai, India), is mainly isolated from the bark of 
 <italic>Dysoxylum binectariferum</italic>. However, the removal of bark poses a threat to the survival of the source medicinal plant. Rohitukine exhibits anticancer activity through the up-regulation of p53 and caspase-9 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein [

 <italic>Fusarium proliferatum</italic> from 
 <italic>D. binectariferum</italic> that produces host-derived rohitukine [

 <italic>D. binectariferum</italic> and
