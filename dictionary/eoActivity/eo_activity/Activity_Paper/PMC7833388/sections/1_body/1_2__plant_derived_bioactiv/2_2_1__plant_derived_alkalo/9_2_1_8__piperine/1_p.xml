<p>Anti-inflammatory and anticancer alkaloid piperine is found in the fruits of 
 <italic>Piper longum</italic> and 
 <italic>Piper nigrum</italic> and responsible for their pungent taste. Piperine enhances hepatic-oxidized glutathione and decreases renal glutathione concentration and renal glutathione reductase activity, showing its antidiabetic activity. Piperine decreases liver marker enzymes activity, inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of interferon regulatory factor, reduces the activation of STAT1, and inhibits the release of Th-2-mediated cytokines indicating its anti-inflammatory activity. Piperine expresses its anticancer activity through the following mechanisms: activates caspase-3 and caspase-9, cleaves poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), decreases Bcl-2 protein expression and increases Bax protein, reduces the expression of phosphorylated STAT3 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) transcription factors, blocks extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), p38 MAPK, and AKT signaling pathways, and suppresses epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression [

 <italic>Periconia</italic> sp., 
 <italic>C. gloeosporioides</italic>, and 
 <italic>Mycosphaerella</italic> sp. isolated from 
 <italic>Piper</italic> spp. [
