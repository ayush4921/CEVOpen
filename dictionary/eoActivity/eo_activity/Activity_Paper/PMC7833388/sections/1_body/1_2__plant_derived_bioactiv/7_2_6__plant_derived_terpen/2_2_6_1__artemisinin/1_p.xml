 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> (sweet wormwood) has been in use for the treatment of fever since more than 2000 years. In 1971, Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone with endoperoxide trioxane moiety, was isolated from the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> as its active antimalarial principle by Tu Youyou [

 <xref rid="B298-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. Its antimalarial parasite activity is mediated by ROS generation, causing protein damage and compromising parasite proteasome function, inducing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response [

Iron (heme), which is a prerequisite for cancer cells multiplication, also activates an endoperoxide bond of artemisinin, creating cytotoxic/cancer-killing carbon-centered free radicals. As an alternative source, Huang et al. isolated artemisinin from an anonymous fungal isolate of
