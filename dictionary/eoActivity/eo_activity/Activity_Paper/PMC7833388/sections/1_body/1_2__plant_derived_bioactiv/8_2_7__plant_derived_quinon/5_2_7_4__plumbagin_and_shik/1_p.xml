<p>Plumbagin and shikonin are anticancer naphthoquinones found in 
 <italic>Plumbago</italic> and 
 <italic>Lithospermum</italic>, respectively. Both can induce in vitro mammalian topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage [
 <xref rid="B358-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">358</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying the potential antitumor effects of plumbagin involve increased oxidative stress, caspase activity, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, induction of cytochrome c release, FasL expression, and high Bax levels via activation of the JNK pathway, down-regulation of expression of NF-κB, suppressed TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p65 and IκB kinase (IKK), degradation of IκBα, and blocking STAT3/ polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)/AKT signaling [

 <xref rid="B360-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">360</xref>]. Shikonin can induce apoptosis also via ROS generation and the down-regulation of AKT and receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1)/NF-κB activity [
 <xref rid="B361-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">361</xref>]. Both the compounds have also been produced by endophytic fungi, as listed in
