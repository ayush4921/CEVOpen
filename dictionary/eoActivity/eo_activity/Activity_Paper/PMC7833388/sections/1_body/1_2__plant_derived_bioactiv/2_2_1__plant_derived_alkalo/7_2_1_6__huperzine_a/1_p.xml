<p>A tropical medicinal moss 
 <italic>Huperzia serrata</italic> is clinically used for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="B54-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Its biologically active alkaloid huperzine A (HupA) acts as a strong acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI), which is a class of medication that improves the level of neurotransmitters in the brain and is hoped to be a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Li et al. in 2007 first isolated an HupA-producing endophytic fungus 
 <italic>Acremonium</italic> from 
 <italic>H. serrata</italic> [

 <italic>H. serrata</italic> and three from 
 <italic>Phlegmariurus</italic> spp. have been reported by different workers (
