<p>Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid found in 
 <italic>Berberis</italic> spp. and some other plants (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00197-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), is widely used in the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and neural disorders. The antidiabetic efficacy of berberine is comparable to that of the popular drug metformin. Its hypoglycemic effect is exerted via inhibition of mitochondrial function, stimulation of glycolysis, activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/AMPK pathway, and increasing insulin sensitivity. Moreover, berberine has additional advantageous effects on diabetic cardiovascular complications due to its antihypercholesterolemic, anti-arrhythmias, and nitric oxide (NO)-inducing properties. The antioxidant and aldose reductase inhibitory activities of berberine is useful in alleviating diabetic nephropathy [

 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> isolated from 
 <italic>Phellodendron amurense</italic> and 
 <italic>Coscinium fenestratum</italic>, respectively [
