<p>Xanthatin, a natural sesquiterpene lactone of 
 <italic>Xanthium</italic> spp., has significant antimicrobial, trypanocidal, and antitumor activities. Xanthatin exerts its trypanocidal activity by inhibiting both prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis and 5-lipoxygenase activity, thereby avoiding unwanted inflammation commonly observed in trypanosomiasis. It also permanently inhibits the parasite-specific trypanothione reductase [

 <sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint and apoptosis via disrupting the NF-ÎºB pathway [

 <italic>Paecilomyces</italic> sp. from
