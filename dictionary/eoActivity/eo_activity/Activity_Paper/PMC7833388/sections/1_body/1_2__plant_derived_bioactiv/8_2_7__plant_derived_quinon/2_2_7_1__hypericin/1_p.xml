<p>Hypericin (naphthodianthrone) is a 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic>-derived antidepressive, antineoplastic, antitumor, antiviral, and photosensitizer compound. Hypericin exerts its antidepressant activity by the inhibition of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake, increases in IL-6 activity, and the agonist action of sigma receptors [

Due to preferential accumulation in neoplastic cells, hypericin can be used in photodynamic diagnosis as an effective fluorescence marker for tumor detection and visualization. Light-activated hypericin is used as a strong pro-oxidant agent in photodynamic therapy to induce the apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy of cancer cells due to its high affinity for neoplastic cells [

 <italic>C. globosum</italic>, 
 <italic>Thielavia subthermophila</italic>, and 
 <italic>Epicoccum nigrum</italic> isolated from 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> were also found to produce hypericin [
