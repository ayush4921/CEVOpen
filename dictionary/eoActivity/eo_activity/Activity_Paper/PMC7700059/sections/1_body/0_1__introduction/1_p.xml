<p>Polyphenolic bioactive compounds derived from plants are of great importance in the medical sciences because of their therapeutic potential as chronic disease protectors and chemopreventive agents [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Owing to their chelating and antioxidant activities, polyphenolic bioactive compounds act as free radical scavengers and neutralize dangerous reactive oxygen species (ROS) [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous reports in the field of free radical biology revealed that free radicals play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of many chronic diseases including cancer [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. High level of free radical oxygen species including singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> promotes oxidative stress cells. These free radicals are unstable and extremely harmful for the biological system; they interact with cellular components and cause damage to cell membrane proteins, lipids, and DNA molecules [
