 <italic>Tamarix articulata</italic> (TA) which is commonly called Athal in the Arabic language is a halophytic plant [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Owing to its fine interaction with salinity regulated microbial communities to maintain optimum salt concentration around the roots, the plant can grow in extremely harsh conditions [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The plant belongs to the Tamaricaceae family and may reach a height of 20 meters [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. From ancient times, TA has been used as a fork medicine by the Tafilalet population—a tribal people in the south-eastern region of Morocco—against various ailments including hair loss, hypertension, ulcers, and gastrointestinal disturbances [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, we investigate whether TA extract could also have the potential to protect cells against H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress. Using cell cytotoxicity (MTT), the current study evaluates the cytotoxicity profile and antioxidant potential of methanolic extracts of TA after being challenged with hydrogen peroxide- (H₂O₂-) mediated oxidative stress in Hs27 skin fibroblasts.
