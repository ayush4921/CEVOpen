<p>Using absolute methanol as solvent for all four parts of TA (dry and fresh leaves, stem, and root) extraction by constant stirring for 5 days, the amount (g/100 g) of yield extracted from all four parts was the highest in dry leaves (12.78%) followed by fresh leaves (9.87%), root (9.13%), and stem (8.34%) as shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The determination of polyphenol content was analyzed by Folin–Ciocalteu assay which was expressed as gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram of extract. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the polyphenol content for all four extracts of TA is 409.92 mg GAE/g for dry leaf extract followed by 387.08 mg GAE/g for root extract, 141.75 mg GAE/g for stem extract, and 137.12 mg GAE/g for fresh leaf extract. These figures suggest that TA extracts have an abundant quantity of polyphenols and are believed to possess bioactive compounds with potential antioxidant activity.
