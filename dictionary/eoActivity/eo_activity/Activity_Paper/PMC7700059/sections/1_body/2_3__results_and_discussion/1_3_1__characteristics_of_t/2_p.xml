<p>Our group's previous study revealed that owing to the presence of an abundant quantity of polyphenolic compounds in all four parts of TA extract and related species, they exhibited promising antioxidant activity by DPPH assay [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. To support and validate the antioxidant potential of TA extracts, we evaluated the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of all four TA extracts via phosphomolybdate assay. Our results demonstrated that the highest antioxidant capacity was shown by standard compound ascorbic acid (187.23 ± 10.34 mg equivalents) followed by dry leaf extract (107.21 ± 5.38 mg equivalents), root extract (105.72 ± 6.19 mg equivalents), stem extract (92.77 ± 4.17 mg equivalents), and fresh leaf extract (83.27 ± 5.31 mg equivalents) (

 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Together, these results suggest that all four parts of TA extract exhibit promising antioxidant activity that is able to neutralize reactive oxygen species. In this way, protection against free radicals produced during metabolic reactions is offered.
