<p>The determination of total phenols of TA extracts (methanolic) was determined by the standard Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (FCR) method. The standard compound gallic acid (GA) was taken as a reference compound to determine total phenols in the TA extract [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, 1 ml each of FCR and extract (1 mg/mL) of various parts of TA in a glass tube were mixed properly using a vortex for 5 minutes. After proper mixing of the 3 ml substance, sodium carbonate (2%) was added, and the mixture was properly mixed again for 5 min to ensure this was thorough. The mixture in glass tubes was allowed to incubate in the dark for 3 h at room temperature. By using a spectrophotometer, the absorbance at 760 nm of each solution in the glass tubes was determined against the blank which contains all reagents except test samples or gallic acid under similar conditions. All the readings/absorbance were carried out in triplicate. The total polyphenolic content is expressed as milligrams of GA equivalent per gram dry weight (mg/GAE/g DW). The following formula was used to calculate the phenolic content:
