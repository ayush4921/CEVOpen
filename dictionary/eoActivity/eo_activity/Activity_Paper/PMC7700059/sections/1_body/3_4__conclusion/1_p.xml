<p>The present study demonstrates that all four parts of TA extracts contain large amounts of polyphenolic bioactive compounds and exhibit promising antioxidant potential. Dose- and time-dependent exposure of skin fibroblasts (Hs27 cells) to TA extracts reveals a negligible cytotoxicity to Hs27 cells when exposed for 4 h. However, 24 h and 48 h TA extract treatment to Hs27 cells exhibits significant toxicity. Additionally, we observe that TA extracts offer protection to Hs27 skin fibroblasts against free radicals generated by H₂O₂-mediated oxidative stress. These kinds of extracts can potentially be used in cosmetic products to offer protection to skin fibroblasts against free radicals generated by environmental toxicants and UV radiation. However, further research is very much needed to evaluate the underlying mechanism for the protective effect of TA extracts (dry leaf extract) using human skin fibroblasts as cellular models.</p>
