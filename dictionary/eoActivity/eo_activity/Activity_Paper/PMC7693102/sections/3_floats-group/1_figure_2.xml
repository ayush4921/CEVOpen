  <p>Anticancer effects of ursonic acid (UNA). UNA is known to exert various anticancer effects. It was reported that UNA inhibited proliferation of HONE-1 nasopharyngeal cancer cells, KB oral epidermal cancer cells, HT29 colorectal cancer cells, nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (A549, H460) cells, and leukemia (Jurkat, K562, HL60, and K562-Lucena 1) cells. UNA showed cytotoxic effects in A549 NSCLC cells, SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells, SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells, SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells, XF498 glioblastoma cells, HCT15 colon cancer cells, and HL60 leukemia cells. UNA also induced apoptosis in MGC-803 gastric cancer cells and PC3 prostate cancer cells. Most recently, antimetastatic effects of UNA were reported in A549 and H1299 human NSCLC cells.</p>
