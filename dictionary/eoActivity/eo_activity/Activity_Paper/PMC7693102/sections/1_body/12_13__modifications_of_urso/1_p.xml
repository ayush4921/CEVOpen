<p>Despite the strong pharmacological potential of UNA, there is a disadvantage that triterpenoids, including UNA, have poor water solubility, which is one of important parameters for bioavailability parameters, such as absorption, permeation, first effects, and elimination of drugs [

This factor should be considered, since poor bioavailability can result in an abnormal gap between in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. Therefore, molecular modifications of UNA may be needed to improve this limitation. In a recent study, the C-2 position of UNA was brominated by an organic reaction using copper (II) bromide [

 <sub>50</sub> = 3.6 µM), and induced cellular apoptosis, mitochondria depolarization, and cell cycle arrest. Also, 2α/2β-bromo UNA showed high solubility in water and stability in human plasma, indicating high bioavailability for in vivo tests [
