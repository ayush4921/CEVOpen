<p>Oxidative stress, which is induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), can affect various cellular events such as cancer proliferation, inflammation, and aging [
 <xref rid="B89-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Some studies conducted assays regarding the antioxidant activity of UNA. In a previous report, UNA effectively reduced ROS levels of HL60 leukemia cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 55 µM), although this effect was weaker than the effect of ULA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 26.2 µM) [
