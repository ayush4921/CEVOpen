<p>ULA (3β-hydroxy-urs-12-en-28-oic-acid) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid which has C30H48O3 as its molecular formula and a molecular mass of 456.7 g/mol (

 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ULA has low polarity and poor solubility in water. Instead, ULA is highly soluble in organic solvents, including 2-propanol, ethyl acetate, methanol, and ethanol [

 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As polarity of UNA is also low, ethanol and methanol, which are less polar than water, can be used to dissolve UNA [

ULA and UNA commonly belong to ursane-type triterpenoids and their basic structures are characterized by five rings, a double bond between C-12 and C-13, and a carboxyl group at the C-28 position, as confirmed by previous NMR studies [

 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In fact, the carboxyl group at the C-28 position significantly enhances the pharmacological potency of triterpenoids [

 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The structure of UNA is quite similar to that of ULA, with UNA possessing a keto group at the C-3 position instead of the β-hydroxy group found in ULA. This difference at the C-3 position may be an important factor explaining the dissimilar biological activities of the two compounds.
