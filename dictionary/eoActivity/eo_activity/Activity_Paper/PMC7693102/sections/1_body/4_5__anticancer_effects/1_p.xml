<p>Cancer is a deadly disease, representing the second leading cause of death in the United States [
 <xref rid="B42-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Major hallmarks of cancer include sustained proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, which can be accomplished by modulation of molecular mechanisms in cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B43-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Various cellular mechanisms of resistance to existing anticancer agents disrupt the efficacy of modern chemotherapy, indicating that development of new bioactive molecules is needed to solve this problem [
 <xref rid="B44-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Triterpenoids are considered constituents of anticancer reagents [
 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Previous studies consistently reported that UNA demonstrates cytotoxicity to cancer cells originating from several tissue types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01505-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Ryu et al. reported cytotoxic effects of UNA against A549 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.7 μM), SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.1 μM), SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.2 μM), XF498 glioblastoma cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.9 μM), and HCT15 colon cancer cell lines (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.6 μM) [
 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In other studies, UNA effectively exerted antiproliferative effects in HONE-1 nasopharyngeal cancer cells, KB oral epidermoid cancer cells, and HT29 colorectal cancer cells with low IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5.2 μM, 4.0 μM, and 6.3 μM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. UNA also impeded the proliferation of A549 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 23.6 μM) and H460 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.6 μM) lung cancer, and Jurkat (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 23.9 μM), K562 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12 μM), HL60 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.8 μM), and K562-Lucena 1(IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 12.6 μM) leukemia cells in vitro [
 <xref rid="B47-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These results were comparable with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of ULA in same cancer cells, which were 8.8 μM, 8.2 μM, and 4.7 μM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Cytotoxicity of UNA was also shown in other cancer cells, including B16F0 murine melanoma (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 19.8 μM), L1210 murine leukemia (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.9 μM), SK-MEL-2 human melanoma (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.6 μM), and HL60 human leukemia cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 54.9 μM) [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. UNA significantly increased survival days of mice bearing S180 sarcoma cells by seven days compared to nontreated mice, and this antitumor effect of UNA was reported to be correlated with the inhibition of topoisomerase-I (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.5 mM), one of targets for cancer treatment [
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, UNA isolated from 
 <italic>Toona sinensis</italic> reduced the viability of several cancer cell lines and induced apoptosis of MGC-803 gastric cancer cells and PC3 prostate cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Noticeably, UNA exerted a relatively weaker cytotoxic effect in NIH3T3 noncancer murine fibroblast cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 50 μM), whereas the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of UNA on cancer cells ranged from 13.6 μM to 26.5 μM, suggesting that UNA can selectively reduce the survival of cancer cells while minimizing side effects against normal cells. UNA also repressed human cathepsin B for 49% at 20 μM [
 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Since cathepsin B plays a critical role in the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, it is expected that UNA may facilitate chemotherapy of cancer by targeting cathepsin B of cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B52-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In studies regarding both UNA and ULA, cell viability and proliferation assays revealed that the antitumor effects of UNA were similar to, or stronger than, those of ULA [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,

 <xref rid="B54-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Of note, in HCT15 colon cancer cells, the effective dose of UNA to exert cytotoxicity was 1.23 μM, which was remarkably lower than the concentration of ULA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 20 μM) and the well-known anticancer agent Cisplatin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.52 μM) [
 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These reports consistently demonstrated that UNA has strong antitumor potential comparable with ULA.
