<p>Hyperglycemia, which is highly associated with diabetes mellitus and acute stress, is a condition in which cellular glucose uptake fails and blood glucose levels aberrantly increase [

 <xref rid="B71-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Increased blood glucose levels can elevate mortality, as this can impair immune responses, promote inflammation, and worsen cancer progression [

 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Pentacyclic triterpenoids have the potential to control hyperglycemia, as they upregulate glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells [

 <xref rid="B74-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In a previous study, UNA inhibited the activity of yeast α-glucosidase in vitro (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 101 µM) more effectively than the FDA-approved antidiabetic drug acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 236.3 µM) [
 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. UNA inhibited biological activity of rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase a, which is closely linked with blood glucse control (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 57 µM) [

 <xref rid="B76-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. In another study, UNA effectively inhibited α-glucosidase of baker’s yeast (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.47 µM), and this suppression was significantly stronger than that by ULA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.08 µM) and acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 573.5 µM) [
 <xref rid="B77-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. It was also reported that UNA increased protein expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) in the plasma membrane and promoted glucose uptake in L6 rat skeletal muscle cells, without affecting cell viability, while ULA showed no significant effect and reduced cell viability [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. ULA is also well-known for its antihyperglycemic effects [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In some contexts, ULA could inhibit α-glucosidase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.4 µM) more strongly than UNA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 101 µM) in vitro [
 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Also, dietary supplementation (0.01 and 0.05 g per 100 g of diet) and oral administration (200 and 300 mg/kg per day) of ULA successfully lowered blood glucose levels of diabetic mice and rats, respectively [
 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, there is a possibility that ULA cannot upregulate the transportation of glucose in some contexts [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In preparation of this case, UNA could be developed as a complimentary drug for protection from, and improvement of, hyperglycemia.
