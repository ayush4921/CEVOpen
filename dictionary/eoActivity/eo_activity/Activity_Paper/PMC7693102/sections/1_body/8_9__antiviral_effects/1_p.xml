<p>It was reported that several types of triterpenoids can exhibit antiviral activities [

 <xref rid="B83-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Earlier studies highlighted that UNA possesses antiviral potential as well. In previous research, UNA suppressed cytopathic effects of herpes simplex virus types I and II infecting Vero monkey kidney cells [

 <xref rid="B84-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. In particular, the inhibitory effect of UNA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.6 µM) against herpes simplex virus type I was stronger than the antiviral effect of ULA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 175.1 µM) [

 <xref rid="B85-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. While ULA inhibited about 20% of EBV induction at a dose of 6.5 µM and did not reduce cell viability, 6.5 µM of UNA completely suppressed EBV induction, and cell survival decreased to 20% at 65 µM [

 <xref rid="B85-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. There was an attempt to design a theoretical model of a carbon nanotube–UNA drug matrix to block the entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [
 <xref rid="B86-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Moreover, a recent document demonstrated that UNA has the potential to strongly interact with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Nsp15, an endoribonuclease which is essential for the lifecycle of coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B87-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Molecular docking and dynamics analyses show that UNA is predicted to bind stably with the catalytic residues of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 via hydrogen bonds, suggesting that UNA may represent one of drug candidates to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
