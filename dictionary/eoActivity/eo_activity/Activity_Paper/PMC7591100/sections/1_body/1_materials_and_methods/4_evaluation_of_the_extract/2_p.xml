<p>The vero monkey kidney cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL (100 μL) in 96-well microtitre plates and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and a humidified atmosphere. After 24 h incubation, 100 μL of extracts/fractions at varying final concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, and 0.625 mg/mL) were added to the wells containing the cells and then incubated for 12 hr. Thereafter, the medium in each well was aspirated from the cells, which were then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and finally fresh medium (200 μL) was added to each well and incubated for a further 48 hr. Then, 30 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified environment for 4 h. After incubation, the medium was aspirated from the wells and DMSO was added to solubilize the formed formazan crystals. The absorbance of the mixtures in the 96-well microtitre plates was measured on a BioTek Synergy (BioTek, USA) microplate reader set at 570 nm. Doxorubicin was used as a positive reference and the blank control with equivalent concentrations of acetone was also included.
