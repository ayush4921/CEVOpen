<p>The method used for evaluating the anti-15 LOX action of the extracts/fractions was adapted from a previous study.
 <xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In brief, an aliquot of 12.5 µL of the extracts/fractions dissolved in DMSO was added to 487.5 µL of 15-LOX (Sigma-Aldrich, South Africa) in a 96-well microtitre plate and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. After incubation, 500 µL of the substrate solutions that was made up of 10 µL linoleic acid dissolved in 30 µL ethanol and made up to 120 mL with 2 M borate buffer at pH 9.0 was added to the mixture. The mixture was further incubated for 5 min at room temperature and the absorbance was measured thereafter with SpectraMax 190 microplate reader set at 234 nm (Molecular devices, USA). Quercetin (1 mg/mL) was used as a positive control, while DMSO was used for negative control. The negative control represents the 100% enzyme activity or the activity of the enzyme without inhibition. The percentage enzyme inhibition by the test extract/fraction compared with the negative control was calculated using the equation;
