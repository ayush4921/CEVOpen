<p>Pathogens and other exogenous stimuli are capable of activating inflammation-promoting mediators including cyclooxygenases (COX) and lipoxygenases (LOX). Cyclooxygenases and 15-LOX are the key enzymes responsible for the synthesis and release of prostanoids and eicosanoids from poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), respectively, that exacerbate chronic inflammation and other pathogenic and allergic disorders.
