<p>The results indicated that the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction (HF) of 
 <italic>G. mollis</italic> leaf extracts significantly (p≤ 0.05) inhibited COX-1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> =0.97±1.9 µg/mL) and COX-2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> =1.13±0.2 µg/mL) better than the indomethacin reference compound (IC
 <sub>50</sub> =1.3±0.6 and 1.52±0.2 µg/mL) respectively (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In particular, the inhibition of COX-2 is preferred because COX-1 has beneficial physiological functions in the gastric mucosa and on platelet aggregation.
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is little information on the anti-COX activity of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction of 
 <italic>G. mollis</italic>, and this probably represents the first report. Furthermore, the presence of triterpenes in the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of the roots was confirmed in our study and has been reported elsewhere.
