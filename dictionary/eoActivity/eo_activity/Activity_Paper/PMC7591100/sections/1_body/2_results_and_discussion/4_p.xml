<p>In 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, all the extracts and fractions of 
 <italic>G. mollis</italic> had relatively lower cytotoxicity compared to the doxorubicin positive control. This result supports earlier reports that investigated the in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity of the extracts of 
 <italic>G. mollis</italic> respectively
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In addition, the selectivity index of some of the extracts and fractions further suggested that the observed activity could be as a result of metabolic effects rather than bioactivity. For example, the crude acetone fraction (GMCA) had an SI value range of 1.04â€“1.89 on vero monkey kidney cells. This raised a serious safety issue and suggests that the fraction may contain compounds that were cytotoxic to the cells. This observation has been reported previously by others.
