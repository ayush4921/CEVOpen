 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], hypolipidemic [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], hepatoprotective [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], and nephroprotective effects [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], as well as cardioprotective properties [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The peel and the pericarp of dry fruits have been shown to contain benzophenones, pedunculol (
 <bold>27</bold>), garcinol (
 <bold>28</bold>), cambogin (
 <bold>29</bold>), and hydroxycitric acid (HCA; 
 <bold>30</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], some of which are potent antioxidants. Some research has suggested that benzophenones and garcinol present protective effects against the toxicity of carbon tetrachloride in hepatocytes of rats [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and anti-inflammatory effects in hepatocytes of mice [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. An ethanolic extract of the fruit showed significant hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and hypoglycemic activities in the treatment of Long Evans rats with a daily dose of 1000 mg/kg for 21 days [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The nephroprotective effect detected with the administration of a water extract of the fruit peel at concentrations of 200 and 400 mg/kg of weight was attributed to its general cytoprotective effect, which promptly impeded the ischemic damage caused by acute toxicity by cisplatin, a cytotoxic agent that has effects on the kidneys, liver, and neural tissues [
