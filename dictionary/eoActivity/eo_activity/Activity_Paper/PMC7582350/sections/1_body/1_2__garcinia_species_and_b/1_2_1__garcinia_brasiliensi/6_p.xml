<p>A study evaluated the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of benzophenone 7-epiclusianone extracted from the epicarp of 
 <italic>G. brasiliensis</italic> using experimental models of rats and mice [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the test, benzophenone 7-epiclusianone (
 <bold>12</bold>) exerted an anti-inflammatory effect, which was verified through the reduction of mouse paw edema induced by carrageenin and the inhibition of recruitment of leucocytes to the peritoneal cavity, as well as the nociception induced by intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid. The substances associated with the extract components were capable of absorbing ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation, preventing the induced inflammatory process. The absorption of UVB radiation by components of the ethanolic extract could impede the installation of oxidative stress and, consequently, lipidic peroxidation, antioxidant capacity, and removal of free radicals, contributing to a photoprotective effect [
