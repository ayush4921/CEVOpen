 <italic>Garcinia gardneriana</italic> (Planch. &amp; Triana) Zappi (
 <italic>Rheedia gardneriana</italic> Planch. &amp; Triana) (
 <italic>Clusiaceae</italic>) is native to the Atlantic forest and grows throughout Brazil. It is an easily cultivated fruit tree which is often found in domestic orchards. It is regionally known as “bacupari”, “bacopari”, “bacopari-miúdo”, or “mangostão-amarelo” [

A study on its fruits identified two phytosterols—sitosterol and stigmasterol—which have already presented anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities in other studies, with the isolation of these compounds achieved in fruits of the genus
