<p>Another effect presented by the species is leishmanicidal activity [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04513" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The leishmanicidal activities of the hexane extract and ethyland ethanolic acetate at 5.0 mg/mL were evaluated, as well as those of molecules obtained from the extraction of the pericarp of 
 <italic>G. brasiliensis</italic> in an in vitro model. The hexane extract presented the best activity on extracellular (promastigote) and intracellular (amastigote) forms of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> (
 <italic>L</italic>.) 
 <italic>amazonensis</italic>, compared with other extracts. Following those results, fractions of the most efficient extract were made, resulting in three purified prenylated benzophenones, 7-epi-clusianone (

 <bold>13</bold>), and guttiferone-a (

 <italic>G. brasiliensis</italic> have relevant leishmanicidal activities and provide potential compounds for the development of new drugs against leishmaniasis. The compound found in the extract, morelloflavone-7,4′,7′′,3′′′,4′′′′-penta-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl (
 <bold>15</bold>), was prepared by acylation and alkylation reactions from the compound morelloflavone isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>G. brasiliensis</italic> fruits, which demonstrated leishmanicidal, antiproteolytic, and antioxidant activities, as well as low cytotoxicity in in vitro models, at a concentration of 400 μg/mL [
