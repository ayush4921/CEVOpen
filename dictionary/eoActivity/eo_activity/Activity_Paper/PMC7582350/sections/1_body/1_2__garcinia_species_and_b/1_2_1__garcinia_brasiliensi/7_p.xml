<p>Treatment with 7-epiclusianone (
 <bold>12</bold>) altered the cell-cycle progression; furthermore, the capacity to form cell colonies was significantly reduced, demonstrating long-term effects. This demonstrated that 7-epiclusianone (
 <bold>12</bold>) is a relevant natural benzophenone with antineoplastic activity in a model of glioblastomaâ€”a tumor with chemoresistance, demonstrating influence on growing cells, cell-cycle dynamics, apoptosis, and ability to form colonies [
