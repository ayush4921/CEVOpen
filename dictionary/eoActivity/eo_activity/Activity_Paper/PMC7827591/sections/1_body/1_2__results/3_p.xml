<p>The rhizome has a relatively higher antioxidant activity than the leaves and petiole of both species (
 <xref rid="metabolites-11-00042-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values varying between 47.08 and 473.04 mg/mL. 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> rhizome has demonstrated the highest antioxidant activity, whereas the leaves of 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> shows the second-highest antioxidant activity. The inhibitory concentration of α-glucosidase inhibitor from separated parts of the plant shows a different pattern with the values of IC
 <sub>50</sub> varying from 155.25 to 553.38 mg/mL. The 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> extract from the rhizome and leaves parts showed the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory activity among the other extracts from Sinjai-Puncak (RLSK and LLSK). Meanwhile, the 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> extract from leaves and rhizome parts showed a weak effect as an inhibitor for α-glucosidase activity.
