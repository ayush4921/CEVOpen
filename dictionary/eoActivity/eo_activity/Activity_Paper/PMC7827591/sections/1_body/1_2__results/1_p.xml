<p>We designed the experiment based on the code samples, designating the species, the plant parts, and geographical location origin, which are summarized in 
 <xref rid="metabolites-11-00042-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The highest total phenolics content was found in the rhizome of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> originated from Sinjai-Puncak (RLSK) (452.47 ± 0.12 mg GAE/g). In contrast, the lowest content of total phenolic contents was found in the leaves of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> from Sinjai-Biji Nangka (LLSB) (142.09 ± 0.63 mg GAE/g). The rhizome of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> harvested from different regions (RLSB and RLSP) also presented high total phenolics content, while 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> rhizomes, regardless of their region, contained low phenolic content. In both species, phenolic compounds are accumulated more in the rhizomes than in the leaves and petiole of plant parts (
