<p>The chemical compounds, such as unknown-185 at a retention time of 30.920 min (peak L) and unknown-85 at 23.900 min (peak I), represent a strong (negative) signal to the antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="metabolites-11-00042-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). These chemical compounds predicted having a significant contribution to antioxidant activity and the inhibition of α-glucosidase, which are accumulated the highest in LLSB and LOBM samples and are all found in the leaves of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> and
