<p>A typical chromatogram of UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS from both 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-metabolites-11-00042">Figure S2</xref>, and it indicates abundant chemical compounds in their respective plant parts. This chromatogram profile shows a distinct variation in the retention times of 0.50–3.50, 14.00–16.00, and 23.00–27.00 min among parts of samples, i.e., leaves, petiole, and rhizome. The variation profile from sample ion chromatogram at these retention times can be distinguished in the number of peaks detected, peak height, and area.
