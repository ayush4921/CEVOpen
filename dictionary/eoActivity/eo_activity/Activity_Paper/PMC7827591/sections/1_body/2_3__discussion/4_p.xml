<p>Phenolic compounds prevent the enzymatic hydrolysis of carbohydrates by inhibiting α-amylase and α-glucosidase, with a mixed mechanism (competitive and uncompetitive) [

 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> and 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic>. However, in this work, we found that only the rhizome of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> showed high antioxidant activity and potent inhibition of α-glucosidase enzyme associated with the high phenolic compounds in plants. In general, high phenolic content, along with high flavonoids in the samples, strongly correlates with antioxidants and α-glucosidase inhibition activities [
