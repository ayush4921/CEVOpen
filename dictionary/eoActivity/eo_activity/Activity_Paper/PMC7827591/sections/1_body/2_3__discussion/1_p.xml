<p>The total phenolic and flavonoid contents in 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>C. orchioides</italic> varied depend on their harvest time, the origin of growth location, and the plant parts. The total phenolics compounds are all accumulated in the rhizomes part of plants. In this study, the total phenolic and flavonoid contents in RLSP, RLSB, and RLSK of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> samples are affected by its altitude. Its soil nutrient condition might influence the phenolic content in all 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> samples, the soil moisture (microclimate), and the harvest time. RLSB and RLSK samples were harvested during the monsoon season and contained higher phenolic compound contents than the RLSP sample, which was harvested during the drought season. Oxidative stress caused by excessive or low soil water availability and unfavorable temperature can induce phenolic compoundsâ€™ synthesis for the plant survival [
