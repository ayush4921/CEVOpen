<p>The FTIR spectra derived from 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species show a distinct difference even though both plants are from the same genus. This is associated with both species having differences in the compound composition and content level of metabolites. The functional groups obtained from both extracts of 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> species are C–O, C=C, –CH, –COOH, and –OH, which are likely to be associated with antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibitor. This assumption has been reported and described by Saleh et al. [
