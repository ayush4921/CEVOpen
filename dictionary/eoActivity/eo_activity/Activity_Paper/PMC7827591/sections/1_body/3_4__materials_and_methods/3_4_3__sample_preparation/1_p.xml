<p>The plant samples were air-dried for three days in a drying cabinet at 40 °C. Each sample (0.5 kg) was pulverized and sieved with a 40-mesh sieve. The samples were extracted by the maceration method using 5 L of ethanol (70%) for 24 h at room temperature. A similar procedure was repeated twice. Then, the sample was filtrated, which was followed by filtrate evaporation using a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor R-210, BÜCHII Labortechnik, Switzerland) below 50 °C until obtaining a dry condition.</p>
