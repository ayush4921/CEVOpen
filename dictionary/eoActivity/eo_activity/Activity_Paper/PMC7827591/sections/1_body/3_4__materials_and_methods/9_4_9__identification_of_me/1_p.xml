<p>This qualitative analysis referred to the method developed by He et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with various modifications. Approximately 50 mg of dried extract was ultrasonically extracted (Branson Ultrasonic Corporation, Danbury, CT, USA) with 1.5 mL of methanol at 30 °C for 15 min. Then, the mixture was filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter membrane (SY25TF PTFE mdi), and the filtrate was collected in a vial. Metabolite profiling was performed in a Vanquish Flex UHPLC-Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometer using Accucore
 <sup>TM</sup> Phenyl Hexyl (100 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm) as the separation column and UV detector at 254 nm. The source of MS ionization used was electrospray ionization (ESI) and Q-Orbitrap was used as the mass analyzer. The collision energy used for fragmentation was 18, 35, and 53 eV. Other conditions were as follows: spray voltage 3.8 kV, a capillary temperature of about 320 °C, sheath gas and auxiliary gas flow rates of 15 and 3 mL/min, respectively.
