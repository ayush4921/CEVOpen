<p>The processed data from FTIR (spectra data) [
 <xref rid="B15-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS (peak area value) [
 <xref rid="B46-metabolites-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] were analyzed using the UnscramblerX ver. 10.4. (CAMO, Norwegia) for multivariate data analysis (MVDA). In order to access the information of patterns of sample grouping, similarities, and differences among species and plant parts, principal component analysis (PCA) was used. In this PCA method, data preprocessing uses a spectroscopic model, validation with full cross-validation, and an algorithm using singular value decomposition (SVD). The partial least squares (PLS) method was conducted to analyze further the correlation of antioxidant and Î±-glucosidase inhibitory activity with functional groups and the chemical compounds in the 
 <italic>Curculigo</italic> spp. samples. In the PLS method, data preprocessing uses a spectroscopic model, validation with full cross-validation, and an algorithm using the Kernel PLS.
