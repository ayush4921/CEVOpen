<p id="p0140">Considering the number of identified species, 
 <italic>Menispermaceae</italic> were the most represented plant family, with a total of 5 species used as antimalarial medicine in Papua Island, as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">FigureÂ 2</xref>. This 
 <italic>Menispermaceae</italic> family is made up of 70 genera with 420 species. In addition, some survey literature in Africa showed that about 21 genera have used as medicine, while other continents used 29 different genera. Some of the genera used as medicine include; 
 <italic>Arcangelisia, Cissampelos, Cocculus, Cyclea, Diploclisia, Dioscoreophyllum, Fibraurea, Jateorhiza, Menispermum, Sinomenium, Sphenocentrum, Stephania, Tiliacora, Tinospora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Triclisia</italic>. The most active compound in 
 <italic>Menispermaceae</italic> widely used in treating various diseases is bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Most species of 
 <italic>Menispermaceae</italic> have detoxification, antidysentery, antigastroenteritis, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antimelanogenesis, hepatoprotective, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anticancer, and antimalarial properties. Some genera of 
 <italic>Menispermaceae</italic> are the main ingredients contained in most traditional herbs used as medicine in various countries, such as 
 <italic>Cocculus</italic> and 
 <italic>Tinospora</italic> in Bangladesh [

 <italic>Arcangelisia</italic> and 
 <italic>Fibraurea</italic> in South Vietnam [

 <italic>Stephania</italic> in Asia and Cambodia, 
 <italic>Triclisia</italic> in Tanzania [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and 
 <italic>Albertisia</italic> and 
 <italic>Cissampelos</italic> in South Africa [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The data of RISTOJA in Papua Island support the potential use of 
 <italic>Menispermaceae</italic> family in the development of antimalarial.
