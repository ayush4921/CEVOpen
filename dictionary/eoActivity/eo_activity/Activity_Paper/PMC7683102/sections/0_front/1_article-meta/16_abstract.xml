 <p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) was first described in 1907 and got its name after Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist. This disease starts slow, increasing gradually to worsen in the due course of time. AD is mainly characterized by the associated dementia, which is a decline of cognitive effects such as memory, praxis, and orientation. The dementia is further highlighted by the presence of psychological and behavioral symptoms. Additionally, AD is also associated with the multiple interconnected pathways linked neuropathological changes such as the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β plaques inside the brain. AD therapeutics have been of prime concern over the decades, resulting in the elucidation of promising therapeutic targets. The requirement of AD stage dependent optimized conditions has necessitated a combinatorial approach toward treatment. The priority in AD research has remained to develop disease-modifying and development-reducing drugs for treatment regimens followed during the early and later stages, respectively.</p>
