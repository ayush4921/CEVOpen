<p>Traditional African literature highlights the neuropharmacological potentials of 
 <italic>E. alba</italic>. Research suggests that the plant shows learning and memory modulating properties. Luteolin, an active component of the plant, helps in minimizing the cognitive and memory deficits formed due to cholinergic dysfunction. It also can control the neuronal tissue degeneration obtained as the result of stress perturbations. Thereby indicating that 
 <italic>Eclipta alba</italic> can be treated against AD, as a potential memory modulatorÂ [
