 <italic>As a G protein-coupled receptor:</italic> G protein-coupled receptor(s) typically binds to a ligand(S) to induce a G protein complex trimer, eventually dissociating into the G

 </sub> and G
 <sub>
  <italic>βγ</italic>
 </sub> dimer subunits. These subunits are used to activate the intracellular downstream signaling pathways. G protein-mediated AβPP activation is not very well understood owing to the complexities involved in understanding the G protein coupling and pathways linked to it. Notwithstanding, its involvement in synaptic and in neural activity is very well established [
