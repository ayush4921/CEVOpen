<p>The tau hypothesis postulated that AD was caused due to the formation of abnormal tau proteins [

 <xref rid="ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This resulted in a collapse of the neuronal transport system caused due to cytoskeleton destruction characterized by microtubule disintegration [
 <xref rid="ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Eventually leading to the breakdown of neuronal signaling and their death [
