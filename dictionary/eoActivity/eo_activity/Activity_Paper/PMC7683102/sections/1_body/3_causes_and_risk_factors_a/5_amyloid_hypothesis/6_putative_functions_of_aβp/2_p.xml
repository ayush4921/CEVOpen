 <italic>Cell adhesion:</italic> Several domains of AβPP help in binding to substrates such as collagen, laminin, and heparin. The cell surface AβPP is relatively suitable as a cell adhesion protein given its stability and time taken to degrade. The possible role of AβPP in cell adhesion is that it involves in the tightly regulated synapse formation [
