<p>Surprisingly, AD is not usually inherited due to autosomal inheritance but due to mutational risk factors such as the genetic and environmental differences, so termed sporadic AD. The best-known example for such sporadic causes is the genetic inheritance of

 <italic>APOE</italic>. Supporting this, about 40% to 80% of the reported cases indicate at least one
