<p>The patient may be tested to evaluate their mental health and brain conditions associated with the cognitive skills. The interpretation of symptoms might indicate a wide range of conditions, like vitamin B-12 deficiency, thyroid disorder, dementia, or AD. To rule out or overcome this problem, certain confirmatory test will have to be conducted at a laboratory. Medical imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and/or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been extensively utilized to diagnose the AD. Notwithstanding, they may not be useful to differentiate between the other conditions mentioned above [

The present generation imaging techniques have evolved to help identify and differentiate brain tumors, hemorrhages and strokes, apart from the different types of neurodegenerative diseases [
