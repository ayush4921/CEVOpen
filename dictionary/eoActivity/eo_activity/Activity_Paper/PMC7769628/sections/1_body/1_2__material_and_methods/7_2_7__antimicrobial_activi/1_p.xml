<p>The antibacterial effect was determined using seven strains of bacteria which were brought from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC): 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 9027), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, (ATCC 13883), 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> (ATCC 8427), 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (ATCC 700221), and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923) as well as against the growth of a diagnostically confirmed Methicillin-Resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA). The antifungal activity of (PJ) samples was evaluated against the growth of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 90028). However, the antimicrobial activity of (PJ) four fractions used in this study was estimated using the broth microdilution method (7, 8).
