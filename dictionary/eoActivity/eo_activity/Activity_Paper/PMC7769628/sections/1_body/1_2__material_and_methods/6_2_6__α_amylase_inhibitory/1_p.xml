<p>The 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory activity of each extract fraction was carried out according to the standard method, with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Each plant fraction was dissolved in 3 ml of 10% DMSO and then further dissolved in buffer (0.02 M of Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>/NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 0.006 M NaCl, at pH 6.9) to give concentrations of 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, from which the following dilutions were prepared: 10, 50, 70, 100, and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The porcine pancreatic 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase enzyme solution was freshly prepared at a concentration of 2 units/ml in 10% DMSO.
