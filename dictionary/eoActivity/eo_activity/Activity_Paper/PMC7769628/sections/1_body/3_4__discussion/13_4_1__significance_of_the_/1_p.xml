<p>Acarbose is an antidiabetic drug that acts by inhibiting 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase enzymes but with deleterious side effects [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The lipase inhibitor Orlistat is currently the sole antiobesity agent available in many countries [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, gastrointestinal side effects are common and may limit the use of Orlistat [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Antibiotics are frontline therapy against microbial infectious diseases and many antibiotics are known to cause several side effects in humans [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although the effectiveness of cancer treatments has improved over time, adverse effects persist with each treatment [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The significance of this work came from the ability of PJ to inhibit 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and inhibit gastric and pancreatic lipase, in addition to the antibacterial, antifungal, and antiproliferation effects of PJ. All this happens naturally by PJ contents without any reported side effects.
