<p>The seeds (30 g) of 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> were extracted and pulverized three times with MeOH (200 mL each) for 3 days. The MeOH extract was condensed under reduced pressure at 35 °C, and the residue (fraction A, 5.46 g) was obtained. Fraction A (5.46 g) was purified by column chromatography (CC) (220 g of silica gel, 70–230 mesh; 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane/acetone gradient) to afford 10 fractions: A1–A10. Part (76 mg) of fraction A4 was further purified by preparative thin layer chromatography (TLC) (silica gel; dichloromethane/methanol, 19:1) to afford dehydrodiisoeugenol (10.3 mg) (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.78). Part (112 mg) of fraction A5 was further by preparative TLC (silica gel; dichloromethane/methanol, 19:1) to obtain malabaricone B (6.9 mg) (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.40) and malabaricone C (35.4 mg) (R
 <sub>f</sub> = 0.31).
