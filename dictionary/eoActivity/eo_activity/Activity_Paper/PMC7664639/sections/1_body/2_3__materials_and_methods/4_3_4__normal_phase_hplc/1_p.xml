<p>Normal-phase separations were performed using a Cosmosil 5SL-II column (5 μm; column of dimensions 10.0 × 250 mm) from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. High performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) chromatographic fingerprints were obtained with a LC-2000 Plus HPLC system (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a Jasco PU-2080 Plus pump, a G1379A micro vacuum degasser, a MD-2010 Plus diode array detector, and the ChromNAV software (version 2.0, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) with LC-Net II/ADC system. Gradient separation using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (solvent A) and ethyl acetate (solvent B) as mobile phase was as follows: 0–10 min, linear gradient from 10 to 20% B; 10–30 min, 20% B with isocratic elution; 30–40 min, linear gradient from 20 to 30% B; 40–45 min, 30% B with isocratic elution; 45–48 min, linear gradient from 30 to 90% B; 48–50 min, 90% B with isocratic elution; 50–55 min, back to initial conditions at 10% B; and 55–60 min, at 10% B. The flow rate was 2.0 mL/min and the injection volume was 500 μL. Peaks were detected at 270 nm. Different compounds were identified by retention time. To guarantee peak purity, DAD acquisition from 200–650 nm was conducted to register UV-spectra. For the quantitative analysis of three compounds in the extracts, aliquots of samples were dispersed in 10 mL of an CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>/
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (60/40, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) solution by sonication for 5 min. Then, the samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm, and the supernatant extracts were filtered through 0.45 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) syringe filters (Zhejiang Sorfa Medical Plastic Co., Ningbo, China). Aliquots of filtrate were examined by the described HPLC conditions and calculated by standard curves. Quantification of three components from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> in each solvent extract followed as the method described previously [

 <italic>S/N</italic>) of 3 and 10 under minimum concentration were defined as the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ), respectively [
