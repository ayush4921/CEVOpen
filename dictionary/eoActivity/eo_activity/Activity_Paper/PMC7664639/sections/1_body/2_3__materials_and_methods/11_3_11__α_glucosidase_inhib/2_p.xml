<p>α-Glucosidase inhibition (%) = (A
 <sub>c</sub> − A
 <sub>t</sub>)/A
 <sub>c</sub> × 100, where A
 <sub>c</sub> is the absorbance of the control, and A
 <sub>t</sub> is the absorbance of the test sample. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of all tested activities were determined by the liner regression of the percentage of remaining α-glucosidase against the sample concentration.
