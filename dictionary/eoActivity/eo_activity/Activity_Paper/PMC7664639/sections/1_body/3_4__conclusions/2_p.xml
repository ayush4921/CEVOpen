<p>In conclusion, this study showed that extraction solvents for 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> affected extraction yield, antioxidant activities, and bioactive component levels. The methanol, ethanol, and acetone extracts displayed relatively high TPC level and antioxidant activities. The methanol extract contained the largest amount of polyphenols among extracts. The active antioxidant components in 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> were identified as dehydrodiisoeugenol, malabaricone B, and malabaricone C based on their antioxidant activities. The above active extracts and their isolates can be used as natural antioxidants in the food industry, as well as dietary supplement against oxidative damage. Furthermore, the methanol and ethanol extracts can also be used as natural Î±-glucosidase inhibitors.
