<p>In previous studies, phenolic derivatives from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> were well identified and separated by HPLC with normal- and reversed-phase column chromatography [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05198" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The HPLC methods using both normal- and reversed-phase column for the quantification of three components were verified regarding linearity, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ). The linearity was validated by the data from six different concentrations (1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 25.10, 50.0, and 100.0 Î¼g/mL) of the standard solutions. The linear regression parameters of calibration curves, correlation coefficient, LOD, and LOQ were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05198">Table S1</xref>. Six concentrations of each standard were analyzed in triplicate to generate respective calibration curve. The linearity (R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.9996) between Y (the peak area of the analytes with external standard) and X (concentration of the standards) was achieved in the tested stage. Thus, we confirmed that three major components in 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic> were malabaricone B, malabaricone C, and dehydrodiisoeugenol. Structures of three components are shown in
