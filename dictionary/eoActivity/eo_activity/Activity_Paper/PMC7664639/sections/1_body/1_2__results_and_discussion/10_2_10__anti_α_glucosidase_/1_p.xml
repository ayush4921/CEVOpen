<p>For further evaluation of the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity, we conducted further investigation on major components isolated from 
 <italic>M. fragrans</italic>. Among the isolated compounds, we found that malabaricone C possesses stronger inhibitory activity against α-glucosidase. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05198-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the dose-response curves of malabaricone C on α-glucosidase inhibition with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 20.97 ± 0.17 μg/mL.
