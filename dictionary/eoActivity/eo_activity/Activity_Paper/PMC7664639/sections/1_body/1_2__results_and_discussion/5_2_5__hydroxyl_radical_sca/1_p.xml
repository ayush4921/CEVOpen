<p>This assay displays the abilities of the extracts to suppress the degradation of hydroxyl radical-mediated deoxyribose in the mixture containing FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-ascorbic acid and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> reaction. The extracts exhibited high scavenging activities of hydroxyl radical at low concentration and the values of IC
 <sub>50</sub> were lower than BHT (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05198-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), except of the solvents extracted by dichloromethane and chloroform. The hydroxyl radical scavenging activity of methanol (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 37.81 ± 1.56 μg/mL) exhibited the strongest activity, followed by acetone (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 42.99 ± 0.19 μg/mL), n-hexane (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 51.94 ± 0.79 μg/mL), ethyl acetate (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 55.25 ± 1.25 μg/mL), ethanol (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 56.05 ± 2.52 μg/mL), chloroform (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 82.39 ± 2.62 μg/mL), and dichloromethane (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 88.19 ± 2.09 μg/mL).
