 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. (2016)</xref> investigated the inhibitory potential of nine alkylated chalcones (isobavachalcone, 4-hydroxyderricin, xanthoangelol, xanthoangelol F, xanthoangelol D, xanthoangelol E, xanthoangelol B, xanthoangelol G, xanthokeistal A) and four coumarins extracted from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic> (Miq.) Koidz. The alkylated chalcones inhibited SARS-CoV PLpro in a significant dose-dependent manner with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 1.2 ± 0.4 to 46.4 ± 7.8 µM. On the other hand, the analyzed coumarins did not show a significant inhibitory effect toward SARS-CoV PLpro. Kinetic studies revealed that isobavachalcone was a mixed inhibitor whereas the other chalcones were noncompetitive. Interestingly, xanthoangelol E, an –OOH substituted analogue, exhibited the most enhanced inhibitory effect (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.2 ± 0.4 µM), which was 40-fold higher when compared to other tested chalcones. This important inhibitory activity of xanthoangelol E was confirmed using 
 <italic>in silico studies.</italic>
