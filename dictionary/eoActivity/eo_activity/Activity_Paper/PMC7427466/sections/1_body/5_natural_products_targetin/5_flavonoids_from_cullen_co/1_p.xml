<p>Ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Cullen corylifolium</italic> (L.) Medik. seeds showed an important inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV PLpro with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15 µg/ml. Furthermore, six flavonoids present in the extract (Bavachinin, neobavaisoflavone, isobavachalcone,40 –O-methylbavachalcone, psoralidin, and corylifol A) inhibited SARS-CoV PLpro activity in a dose-dependent manner with IC
 <sub>50</sub> estimated to be 4.2–38.4 µM. The highest inhibitory effect was exerted by psoralidin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.2 ± 1.0 µM) and isobavachalcone (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.3 ± 0.8 µM) (
