Some therapeutic approaches have been suggested such as nucleoside analogs, Remdesivir, anti-inflammatory drugs or Lopinavir/Ritonavir to treat COVID-19. At present, more than 200 clinical trials, some of them analyzing these drugs or others, have been registered in clinicaltrials.gov. Nevertheless, the clinical usefulness of these drugs against COVID-19 infection remains unclear (
