 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Park O. K. et al. (2012)</xref> investigated the inhibitory potential of 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> Bunge towards SARS-CoV-3CL(pro). They found that 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> Bunge ethanolic extract (30 µg/ml) resulted in 60% inhibition of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro). Furthermore, they demonstrated that six tanshinones of the plant (lipophilic fraction) exerted marked inhibition of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) in a dose- but not–time- dependent manner. IC
 <sub>50</sub> was estimated at 14.4–89.1 µM. Dihydrotanshinone I exhibited the most important inhibitory effect with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 14.4 ± 0.7 µM. With regard to the kinetic mechanism of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) inhibition, 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> Bunge tanshinones were found to be noncompetitive inhibitors.
