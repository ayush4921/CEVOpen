<p>The angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was found to be a key functional receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 allowing its attachment to human and bat cells and therefore its replication (

SARS-CoV-2 binds the host cells through interaction between the receptor binding motif of the spike protein—receptor binding domain (RBD) and the ACE2 receptor. This interaction will trigger conformational changes of the C-terminal S2 subunit (responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion) of the spike protein. The complex S protein-ACE2 is then proteolytically processed by the host cell-type 2II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 leading to the ACE2 cleavage and therefore to viral entry into the host cell (

After entry and uncoating, the genomic RNA is translated into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) which undergo a proteolytic cleavage generating 15–16 nonstructural proteins. The double-membrane vesicle is then formed from the rearrangement of cellular membrane induced by the nonstructural proteins. On the other hand, the genomic RNA is transcribed into subgenomic RNA which in turn leads to the synthesis of structural (spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid) and accessory proteins. Finally, virions are assembled in the ER-Golgi intermediate complex, and then released
