<p>The as-prepared AgNPs showed considerable dose-dependent antibacterial activity against the tested pathogenic bacterial strains. The measured zone of inhibition (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05042">Table S1; Figure S2</xref>) suggested that, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> was more sensitive to the AgNPs, followed by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>; while 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> showed comparatively minimal sensitivity toward the AgNPs. This was also confirmed from the MIC of AgNPs measured against these bacteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05042-f003">Figure 3</xref>). 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> showed the least MIC than others. This could be explained by higher affinity of 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells to colloidal AgNPs than the other tested bacterial strains [

These results showed that as-prepared AgNPs has significant effect on growth inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria than that of Gram-positive bacteria. This might be due to differences in the structure and composition of the cell wall of these bacteria [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05042">Table S2</xref>), the order of the observed antibacterial activity could be listed as 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>. Antibacterial activity occurs in two steps; firstly phytochemicals adhered on the surface of AgNPs cause damage to the outer cell membrane by damaging the cell wall proteins which causes leakage of cellular matter. According to the widely accepted mechanism, the AgNPs enters into cell membrane, which rupture and the intracellular substances leak, which in turn affects the respiration process by inactivating the respiratory chain dehydrogenases and finally inhibits the respiration, as well as bacterial growth [
