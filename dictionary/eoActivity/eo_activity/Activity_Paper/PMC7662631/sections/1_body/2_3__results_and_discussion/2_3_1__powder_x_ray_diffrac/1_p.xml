The Braggs reflections noticed at 2θ = 38.61°, 46.43°, 65.52° and 78.28° correspond to (111), (200), (220) and (311) lattice planes, respectively which can be further attributed to the face centered cubic crystal structure of silver. Furthermore, the XRD pattern revealed the crystalline nature of as-obtained AgNPs.
