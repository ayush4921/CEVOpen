<p>The broth microdilution method was carried out in a 96-well microtiter plate to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The different concentrations of compounds (1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 mg/mL) were diluted in Mueller Hinton broth and the final volume was maintained at 100 µL. The final concentration of DMSO was less than 1%. Five (5) µL of an overnight grown bacterial culture was added to the test medium to bring the final inoculum size to 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/mL. The agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h and the absorbance was read at 600 nm. The percent growth inhibition was calculated by comparison with a control using the formula indicated below. The lowest concentration of the compound that inhibits the complete growth of the bacterium was determined as the MIC, mentioned in the below Formula (1):
 <disp-formula>% of growth inhibition = Control − Test/Control × 100.
