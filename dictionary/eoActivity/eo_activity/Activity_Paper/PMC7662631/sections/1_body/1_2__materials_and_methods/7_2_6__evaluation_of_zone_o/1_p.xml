<p>The bacterial lawn was prepared on sterile agar plates by using spread plate method. Cultures of 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> were used to make a lawn culture. Three wells of approximately 8 mm diameter were made. AgNPs of different concentrations were placed inside each well with a blank well with sterile water, including a streptomycin standard antibiotic. The plates were kept for incubation at 37 °C overnight. Zone diameter was measured. Values are expressed as mean ± SE. Statistical significance was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and values with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.
