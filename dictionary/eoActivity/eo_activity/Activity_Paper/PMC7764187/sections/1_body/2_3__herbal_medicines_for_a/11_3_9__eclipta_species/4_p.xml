<p>Preclinical studies: The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. alba</italic> resulted in improvement in learning and memory abilities in passive avoidance and the elevated plus maze test in rats after both acute and chronic administration [
 <xref rid="B207-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>]. Saponins, the main chemical constituent of butanol fraction of 
 <italic>E. prostrate</italic>, prevented ethanol induced memory impairment in rats [

 <xref rid="B209-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>] also reported that butanol fraction increased ACh content, decreased MAO-B activity and reduced oxidative stress in the rat brain. Lipid lowering and antioxidant activities of 
 <italic>Eclipta</italic> plants have also been reported [

 <italic>E. alba</italic> also possesses antiviral, antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, bronchodilator, antibacterial, antipyretic, tonic, expectorant and hepatoprotective activity [

 <xref rid="B212-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. Previous study also reported the improvement in learning and memory functions of rats [
 <xref rid="B213-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. Based on the animal data available, the herb needs to be evaluated clinically.
