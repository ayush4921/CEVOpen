<p>Water insolubility is a major limitation for curcumin, which has been overcome, to some extent, by synthesis of biodegradable poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) coated curcumin nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were found to be able to destroy amyloid aggregation and exhibit antioxidative activity without a cytotoxic effect [

 <xref rid="B100-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Nanoliposomes of curcumin have high affinity for Aβ1-42 fibrils and were found to inhibit the formation of fibrillar and oligomeric Aβ in-vitro [
