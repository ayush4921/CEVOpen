 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> aqueous leaf extract showed improvement in learning and memory in rats, and modulated dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and noradrenaline systems in the rat brain in-vivo [
 <xref rid="B56-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The leaf extract also had sedative, antidepressant and cholinomimetic activities [
 <xref rid="B57-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] suggesting its suitability for treatment of AD associated cognitive dysfunction and depression and anxiety. The leaf extract stimulated dendrites of neuronal cells in the rat brain [
 <xref rid="B51-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and induced neurite elongation in human SH-SY-5Y cells and accelerated axonal regenerate in rats [
 <xref rid="B58-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Cyclic AMP response element binding property (CREB) and its phosphorylated form are involved in memory formation [
 <xref rid="B59-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Reduced level of phosphorylated CREB has been reported in AD patients and experimental models of AD [
 <xref rid="B60-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> leaves enhanced phosphorylation of CREB in both neuroblastoma cells, which express inducible Aß and in cortical primary cells, which were chronically exposed to external Aß in-vitro. The extract increased neuronal dendritic arborization and axonal regeneration in rats [
