<p>Herb-drug interaction: Coadministration of herbal drugs with prescribed drugs may result in serious adverse effects. Herbal drugs contain numerous unidentified constituents, which make it difficult to assess the nature of interactions. Additionally, it is generally believed that herbal medicines are safe since they belong to a natural origin but recently many of the herbs were found to exhibit adverse drug reactions [

 <xref rid="B269-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>]. Heterogeneity in doses and frequency of use also obstruct precise assessment of drug interactions. CYP450 is involved in the metabolism of drugs used for management of AD [

 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> when given with donepezil cause an increased effect in AD due to additive cholinergic activity. However, when it was given with phenytoin, it causes breakthrough seizures due to the induction of CYP2C19. Curcumin increase the oral bioavailability of celiprolol due to inhibition of intestinal CYP450 enzymes and p-glycoprotein [

Such interactions may be prevented with disclosure of concomitant use by the patients and awareness of physicians. In the elderly population, the absorption, metabolism and elimination of drugs are already impaired. Concomitantly use of herbal medicines may worsen the impairment. Therefore, herbal drugs should be used cautiously in elderly patients.
