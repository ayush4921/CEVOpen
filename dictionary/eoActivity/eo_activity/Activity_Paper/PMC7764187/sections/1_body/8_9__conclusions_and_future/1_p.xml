<p>The alternative systems of medicine have been used since ancient times and different extracts of medicinal plants and herbal formulations have demonstrated potential for use in AD. Medicinal plants provide a fertile ground for new drug discovery because of the presence of various chemical constituents and their ability to act on different biological targets. However, much work remains to be done to translate this potential into actual medicine. Standardization of plant extracts is an urgent need in herbal drug research. Phytoconstituents responsible for pharmacological activities should be isolated, identified and systematically tested.

The present article reviewed the reported efficacy of herbal medicines against AD in experimental and clinical studies.</p>
