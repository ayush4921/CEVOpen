<p>Trasina is a polyherbal formulation of some Indian medicinal plants, which are classified as Medhya rasayana in Ayurveda. It consists of 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> (80 mg), 
 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> (190 mg), 
 <italic>Eclipta alba</italic> (10 mg), 
 <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> (10 mg), 
 <italic>Picrorrhiza kurroa</italic> (10 mg) and shilajit (20 mg). It has shown significant nootropic effect at a dose of 200 and 500 mg/kg, p.o when administered for 21 days in colchicine and ibotenic acid induced cognitive impairment. Trasina, dose dependently, improved both memory and cholinergic markers like acetylcholine concentration, choline acetyl transferase activity and muscarinic cholinergic receptor binding in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rat brain after 14 and 21 days of treatment. Thus, its nootropic effect may be attributed to the correction of cholinergic dysfunction [
