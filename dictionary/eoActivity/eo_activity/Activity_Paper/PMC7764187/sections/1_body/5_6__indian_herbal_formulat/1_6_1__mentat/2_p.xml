<p>Mentat has been shown to augment acquisition and retention of learning in rats and prevented cognitive deficits induced by variety of insults including prenatal undernutrition, postnatal environmental impoverishment, sodium nitrite hypoxia, aluminum, increasing age and electroconvulsive shock induced antero-grade and retro-grade amnesia [

 <xref rid="B249-brainsci-10-00964" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>] reported that administration of BR-16A facilitated learning and memory in rats on the Hebb Williams complex maze as compared to control. BR-16A also showed dose dependent improvement in learning and memory in scopolamine induced amnesia in rats [
