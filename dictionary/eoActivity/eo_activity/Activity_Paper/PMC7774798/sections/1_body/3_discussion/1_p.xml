 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. They stated that in the skin, the spontaneous wound healing process occurred through a contractile mechanical area to make collagen fiber meshwork. They also noted that contraction and regeneration of wounds are belligerently related to each other, where wound contraction is a dominant process during the natural healing of wounds.
