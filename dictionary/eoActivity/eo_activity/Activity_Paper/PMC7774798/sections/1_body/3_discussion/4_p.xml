They also stated that marigoldsâ€™ pharmacological aspects have antibacterial, antifungal, larvicidal, insecticidal, nematocidal, mosquitocidal, and wound healing activity. Various phytochemicals such as thiophenes, flavonoids, carotenoids, and triterpenoids are isolated from different parts of the plant.

Different phenolic composites (gallic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin, and scopoletin) were recognized and measured for blood coagulation. The counts of white blood cells and platelet were increased significantly by the marigold extract. Several alkaloids and calcium ions in the marigold extracts shortened the bleeding and clotting times [
