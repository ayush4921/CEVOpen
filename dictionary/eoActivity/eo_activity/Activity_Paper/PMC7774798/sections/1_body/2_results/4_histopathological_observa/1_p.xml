<p>For the histopathological study, biopsies were collected on D
 <sub>1</sub>, D
 <sub>3</sub>, and D
 <sub>7</sub> postoperative days from various surgical wounds, which focused on the presence of tissue debris, hemorrhages, and infiltration of reactive cells, indicating the degree of inflammation. The epidermal regeneration and the propagation of connective tissue were also observed (4x) to understand wound healing progress (

 <sub>1</sub> demonstrated that less tissue debris and hemorrhage were present in the wounds treated with marigold leaves paste and turmeric paste than the control group (

 <xref rid="figure3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, and
