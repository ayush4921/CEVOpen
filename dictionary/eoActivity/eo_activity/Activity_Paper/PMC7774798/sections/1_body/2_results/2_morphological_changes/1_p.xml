<p>In this study, parameters such as swollen area (mm), the altitude of suture line (mm), wound contraction, and girth of sutured area (mm) of wounds were estimated. The swelling was detected up to D
 <sub>3</sub> post-operation in all groups. The more swollen area (11.78 ± 0.38 mm) in the wounds was seen in the case of the control group treated with normal saline solution. Marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste-treated groups resulted in swollen areas of 11.44 ± 0.20 mm and 11.52 ± 0.27 mm, respectively, which were lesser than the control. However, the differences in swelled areas of wounds among the groups differed insignificantly.
