<p>Sterile cotton buds were used to collect samples aseptically from the experimental wounds. Then, samples were transferred into the nutrient broth in screw-capped test tubes. Samples from wounds were incubated for 12 h in nutrient broth at 37°C. After that, the samples were inoculated in the specific agar according to the streak plate method. Then, the inoculated samples were incubated overnight to grow bacterial colonies at 37°C [
