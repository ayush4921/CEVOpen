<p>Paul et al. [
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] used marigold flower and turmeric root in the goatâ€™s wound healing. They studied some physical parameters and histological appearances of the wound, but they did not test these herbs for antimicrobial activities. Moreover, marigold leaves might be more available than flowers in terms of quantity year-round. Miah et al. [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] used turmeric in the wound healing of black Bengal goat and carried out antimicrobial tests and histological and morphological parameters. However, they did not compare the efficacy of turmeric with other herbal plants. No such comparative study of the herbal plants on wound healing of sheep was carried out in Bangladesh. In this study, we tested the relative efficacy of marigold and turmeric to recover surgical wounds. We also justified the antimicrobial activities and observed histopathological changes of wounds treated with marigold leaves paste and turmeric paste.
