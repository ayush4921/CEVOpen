 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Local communities began to settle in the neighborhoods of these mining areas since the decade of 1940, most of them comprised descendants of German, Italian, and Portuguese immigrants who work in mining [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Before the arrival of European immigrants, the broad region was inhabited by Guarani and Xokleng Amerindians, with no other industrial or mining activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As a new mineral extraction area was discovered, the forest cover vegetation was removed and a settlement was developed in the surroundings, to serve the mining workforce [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Along the time, the major settlements gave rise to the urban areas of the region such as Crici√∫ma and Lauro Muller [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Today, most inhabitants are descendants from those European immigrants and from the process of formation of a Brazilian identity which also mixed other cultures and ethnicities; groups of Amerindians remain in small groups, most of them restricted to very few indigenous territories [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The major period of coal mining was between 1975 and 1985, with an increase of these settlements; yet, coal mining is still one of the main economic activities together with agriculture [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. From the decade of 1980 onwards, the number of mining areas increased, but the number of local communities settled nearby these areas remain the same [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. As a result of this historic process, some communities were settled very close to mines, or even partially on restored mined areas.
