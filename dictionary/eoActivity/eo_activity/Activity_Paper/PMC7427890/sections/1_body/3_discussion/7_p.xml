<p id="Par29">We did not find a difference between species cited by women and men. This homogeneous distribution of knowledge across genders was also observed in other studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This may be related to the different social roles of each gender: men are the ones who work or worked in the mining areas, contributing to their knowledge of the plants that occur there. Even though women usually provide initial health care in communities and therefore have greater medicinal plant knowledge, in these localities, men have a greater knowledge of the mined areas and of species found there, which seems to balance the knowledge of plant uses [
