<p id="Par27">Invisible contaminants are those that cannot be detected by human sensory abilities, i.e., cannot be seen and do not exude odor, taste, or sound [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Since they are not perceived, these contaminants can be unwittingly consumed and, in the case of heavy metals, for example, can impact human health causing neurological damages and metabolic disorders [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. People tend to think of environmental impacts as futuristic and distant from their reality, associated with governments failing to present more effective strategies involving local people, and within a framework of contemporary cultural and social issues [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. The social understanding of risk, such as food security risk, is built on views and beliefs associated with the social and cultural forces of each society or community [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The construction of this perception goes through a comparison stage. For a mining community to perceive the risk to their own food security, it needs to see that a similar situation was identified as a risk, in another community that is culturally, socially, and historically similar to its own [
