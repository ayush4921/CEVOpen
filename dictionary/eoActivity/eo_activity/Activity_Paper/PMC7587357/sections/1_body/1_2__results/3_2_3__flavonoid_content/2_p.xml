<p>There was a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in flavonoid content among plant parts, as was expected. The great differentiation between parts of the plant appears to be related to the high levels of flavonoids in some parts of these plants, especially in the leaves and roots of the species in this study. The flavonoid content in the different parts of 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> was higher in the leaves than in the rest of the parts of the plant regardless of the solvent applied to the macerated and decocted samples. In general, for 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> under maceration conditions, ethanolic and acetonic extracts were the extraction solvents that recorded the highest flavonoid levels, regardless of the part of the plant, in almost all samples studied. The flavonoid levels derived from the different parts of 
 <italic>Physalis</italic>, in both the macerated and decocted samples, were given in the following descending order: roots and leaves &gt; stems &gt; flowers (
