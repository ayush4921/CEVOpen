<p>In contrast to the results of the yields obtained by maceration, the yields obtained by decoction when methanol was used as an extractant solution (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04672-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were the highest yields, with averages of 21.58 ± 0.24% for 
 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic>, 20.89 ± 0.14% for 
 <italic>Physalis peruviana</italic> and 21.57 ± 0.26% for 
 <italic>Solanum muricatum</italic> on four samples (leaves, flowers, stems, roots), while acetone gave the lowest yield for 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic>, 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic>, with averages of 14.83 ± 0.15%, 14.39 ± 0.14% and 11.15 ± 0.23%, respectively. 
 <italic>Physalis peruviana</italic> exhibited the highest extraction level from its roots when methanol was used, showing a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in comparison with other parts of the plant, such as leaves and stem. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> in general yielded higher levels of extraction in both roots and leaves, with significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between these plant parts, especially for 
 <italic>Solanum</italic>.
