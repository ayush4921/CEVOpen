 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In total, 200 μL of each extract was taken in duplicate to be analyzed and was added to 300 μL of 50 mM phosphate buffer solution, 2.5 mL of FC reagent and 2 mL of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> at 1 N. The mixture was vortexed and then placed in a water bath at 50 °C for 5 min. The blank was performed by replacing the extract with the solution of phosphate buffer. The absorbance was measured at 760 nm using a UV-1700 Pharma spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The results were expressed in mg gallic acid equivalent/g of dry vegetable material with reference to the calibration curve of gallic acid. All samples were analyzed in duplicate (
