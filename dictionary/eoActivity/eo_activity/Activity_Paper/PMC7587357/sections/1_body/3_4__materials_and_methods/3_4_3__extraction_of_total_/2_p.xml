<p>Extraction by decoction—In order to extract bioactive compounds by decoction, we performed the protocol described by Chavan et al. [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Quantities of 1 g of the powders of the different parts of the three plants were added to 40 mL of the different extraction solvents asmethanol, ethanol, acetone (diluted 7:3 in water) and MeOH/water (8:2), containing 2 mM NaF. Each mixture was boiled inside hermetically-sealed flasks in triplicate for 30 min in a water bath before it was filtered using a muslin cloth. The filtrates were recovered and centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min and then stored at −80 °C until analysis of the extracted sample.
