<p>Determination of the antioxidant activity in the hydrophilic phase (H-TAA)—In total, 890 μL of 50 mM glycine buffer solution was mixed with 30 μL of 10 mM ABTS solution, 30 μL of 1 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 25 μL of 10 µM peroxidase. The absorbance of this mixture was measured at 730 nm against a blank prepared from the glycine solution buffer instead of a sample. In total, 25 μL of each water-soluble phase was added to the preceding mixture by duplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) and the absorbance was measured again at 730 nm after 1 min. The results were expressed in mg trolox equivalent/100 g of dry vegetable material with reference to the trolox calibration curve [
