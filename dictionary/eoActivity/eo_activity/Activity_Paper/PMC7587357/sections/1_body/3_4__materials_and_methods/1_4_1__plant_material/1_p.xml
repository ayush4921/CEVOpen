<p>Blue passion flower (
 <italic>Passiflora caerulea</italic> L.), cape gooseberry (
 <italic>Physalis peruviana</italic> L.) and pepino (
 <italic>Solanum muricatum</italic> Aiton) were harvested in September 2018 in Oran (Algeria). These plant species were harvested early in the morning with pruning shears and were tagged and transported in plastic bags. Leaves, flowers, stems and roots were separated, then dried at room temperature in darkness for 21 days and crushed using a grinder. Then samples were packaged in sealed polyethylene bags and transported to Spain at the University Miguel HernÃ¡ndez.
