<p>The present work is the first study reporting information on these species of medicinal plants, with respect to the different plant parts. The extraction of total phenolic compounds and flavonoids is an important step in the evaluation of bioactive compounds and functional properties. The choice of the appropriate solvent and extraction technique is necessary in order to preserve the biological properties of these bioactive substances. From this work, decoction with methanol:water (8:2) containing 2 mM NaF was the preferred method of extraction of the total polyphenols. On the other hand, maceration with this solvent, and also with ethanol and acetone, were successful techniques for extracting flavonoids, especially from leaves (

This study reveals the difficulty of determining a single extraction process suitable for all different parts of the plant, showing significant differences between the three species studied. In all of them the results showed that the leaves and roots contain higher amounts of bioactive compounds, increasing their total antioxidant activity in comparison with other organs of the plant. In conclusion, with this research and regarding the medicinal possibilities of the different plant parts, the knowledge obtained increases the potential use of these medicinal plants in the prevention or treatment of many diseases affecting human health. In this sense, further investigation should be addressed elucidating the individual compounds with antioxidant properties that these species can provide.
