<p>The high levels of TAA in some plant parts and the low levels in other parts are related to their chemical compositions, functional groups of major compounds, and polyphenol content [

 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In fact, in 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> the total polyphenol content in the leaves is twice as much as that in the flowers when applying most of the solvents studied in this research, especially with the decoction method. A similar pattern was observed in samples obtained after maceration, but the level of TPC extracted using this method was lower in the 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> flowers, suggesting that maceration could extract the lower levels of these bioactive compounds located in the 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> flowers (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04672-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Antioxidant activity generally depends on the number and position of the hydroxyl groups relative to the functional carboxyl groups [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In this sense, the TPC and flavonoid levels were in consonance with the TAA evaluated. Phenolic compounds are not the only contributors to the antioxidant activity in the water-soluble phase, since other compounds, such as ascorbic acid, show antioxidant activity in the water-soluble fraction. On the other hand, in the lipophilic fraction, different bioactive compounds, such as tocopherols, carotenoids and terpenes, also contribute to the total antioxidant activity of a particular sample [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In all the flowers evaluated, anthocyanins are present, conferring their characteristic purple color on some parts of this organ and contributing to the hydrophilic fraction with other phenolic compounds, such as isoorientin and orientin for 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic>, or quercetin for 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic>, especially in the leaves and roots. On the other hand, Salih et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], in a different study, showed that lipophilic extracts were richer in tannins (mainly ellagic acid derivatives). In this study, the lipophilic fraction could also provide the antioxidant activity of other compounds, such as myristic acid for 
 <italic>Passiflora</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or Î²-carotene for 
 <italic>Physalis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-04672" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>].
