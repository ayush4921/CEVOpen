<p id="Par23">In the west central region of Morocco, 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> is widely distributed spatially in highlands of the inlands in the High Atlas and Anti-Atlas. The species is the most common medicinal plant in Morrocco (Zrira 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2017</xref>). 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> is used in traditional medicine to treat various diseases as helminthiasis, diabetes mellitus, colds, gastric pains, rheumatic diseases and possess spasmolitic, carminative, emmenagogue, diuretic, sedative, intestinal antiseptic, cholagogue, antihypertensive antimicrobial, antioxidant, antispasmodic, neurological, and pesticidal activities (Eddouks et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2017</xref>) and Morocco holds 90% of the global market (Taleb

 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> and 
 <italic>A. herba</italic>-
 <italic>alba</italic> are harvested from wild sources and constitutes a precious source of income for communities. For these plants therapeutic properties have been established scientifically. Khouya et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2019</xref>) showed that extracts from leaves of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> develop antiinflammatory activity in animal models and limit cancer cell proliferation in in vitro assays. Aqueous extracts, total polyphenols and total flavonoids of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> give marked antioxidant and antihemolytic activities in erythrocytes of rabbit blood (Ramchoun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2015</xref>). Several studies have reported antimicrobial, antifungal, and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. satureioides</italic> essential oils (Jamali et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2013</xref>; Boubaker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>) due to the rich content of thymol borneol and carvacrol.
