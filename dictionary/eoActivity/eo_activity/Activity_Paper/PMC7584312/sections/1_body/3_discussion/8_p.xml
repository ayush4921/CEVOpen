<p>The low response rate from trials and sponsors is such that we would seek to see the findings reproduced and considered in other populations and disease areas before definitive conclusions could inform future policy. Whilst we purposefully, but pragmatically, limited the search criteria to include studies relevant to older adults and neurology, some trials may have been omitted which could be of relevance given the criteria search on EudraCT, e.g. studies which were relevant to older adults but did not tag 'Elderly' on the database.</p>
