    "Background/Aims Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented an unprecedented challenge for non-COVID related clinical trials of investigational medicinal medicines (CTIMPs). These challenges are considerable for trials run in high -risk groups, such as older adults. Clinical trials must ensure the safety of their participants, whilst also considering the potential, and often long-term, benefits of the trial intervention to public health. Here we sought to provide a brief perspective on the response and conduct of CTIMPs relevant to older adults and neurology in the UK to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study, surveyingÂ CTIMP teams running trials broadly relevant to older adults and neurology in the UK, as well as sponsors and Clinical Trials Units (CTU), to understand the response and preparedness to the pandemic. Results Due to the pandemic, active recruitment has been suspended in more than half of the trials. The primary driver for the temporary halt of recruitment activity was considerations of patient safety. Interestingly, the majority of trials, sponsors and CTUs did not consider pandemic or epidemic outbreaks in their risk assessments before January 2020. Conclusion These findings support the need to re-evaluate the risk-management approach whereby clinical trials establish contingency plans for predicted but rare events to minimise the disruption to recruitment and clinical trial delivery."
