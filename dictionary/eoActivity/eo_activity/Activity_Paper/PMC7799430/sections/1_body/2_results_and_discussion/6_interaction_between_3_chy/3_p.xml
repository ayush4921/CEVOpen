<p id="Par24">The docking score for compounds present in 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> ranged from − 6.10 kcal/mol (for andrograpanin) to − 7.80 kcal/mol (for neoandrographolide) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) which is on par with the remdesivir showing the score of − 7.90 kcal/mol. During replication of the viral genome, the 3CLpro cleaves the C-terminal of polypeptide protein at 11 distinct sites to generate various nsps (Qmar et al.
