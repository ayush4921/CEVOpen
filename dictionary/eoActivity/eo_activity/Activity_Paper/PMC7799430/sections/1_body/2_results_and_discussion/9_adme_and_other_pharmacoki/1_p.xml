<p id="Par32">The pharmacokinetic evaluation and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) properties predictions of pharmacological compounds in advance are important methods to save huge monetary expenses in drug discovery (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2011</xref>). Apart from that, it mainly helps in reducing the potential risk during clinical development as it provides very crucial information to determine whether a compound is suitable to proceed to clinical stage. SWISS-ADME (

Among the 35 compounds from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic> evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 by in silico docking analysis, 15 compounds (9 compounds from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 6 compounds from 
 <italic>A. paniculata</italic>) were selected for ADME and other pharmacokinetic properties predictions. All these 15 compounds selected showed better binding ability than the remdesivir. The ADME properties of the selected 15 compounds have been represented in supplementary Fig.Â 2.
