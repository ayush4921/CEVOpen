<p id="Par20">The S protein undergoes conformational changes to produce closed and open state based on down and up positions, respectively, in the receptor-binding domain. Hence, docking analysis was carried out in both the conformational states with 21 selected phytochemicals from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 14 phytochemicals from 
 <italic>A. paniculata.</italic> There was no significant difference in the binding affinities of the compounds with both closed and open state S protein. The range of binding affinities of 21 selected phytochemicals from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> with closed state S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was − 6.60 (for melatonin) to − 10.10 kcal/mol (for geraniin). Seven compounds, geraniin (− 10.10 kcal/mol), furosin (− 9.60 kcal/mol), corilagin (− 9.60 kcal/mol), quercetin (− 8.80 kcal/mol), quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside (− 8.60 kcal/mol), quercitrin (− 8.60 kcal/mol) and hinokinin (− 8.50 kcal/mol) have shown better binding affinity than remdesivir (− 8.40 kcal/mol). Among these, geraniin with maximum binding affinity of − 10.10 kcal/mol has formed two hydrogen bonds with CYS291, SER750 amino acid residues of closed state S protein. In case of open state S protein, the dock score of 21 phytochemicals from 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> ranged between − 6.10 kcal/mol (for niranthin) and − 10.10 kcal/mol (for geraniin). Six compounds, geraniin (− 10.10 kcal/mol), corilagin (− 9.50 kcal/mol), furosin (− 9.40 kcal/mol), quercetin (− 8.80 kcal/mol), quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside (− 8.60 kcal/mol) and quercitrin (− 8.60 kcal/mol) have shown favourable binding affinity than remdesivir (− 8.50 kcal/mol). Geraniin with maximum dock score of − 10.10 kcal/mol form five hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues, GLU988, ARG995, TYR756, THR998 of closed state S protein.
