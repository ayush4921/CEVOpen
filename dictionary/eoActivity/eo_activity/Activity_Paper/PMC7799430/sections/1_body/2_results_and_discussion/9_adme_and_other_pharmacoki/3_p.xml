<p id="Par34">The logS value is directly related to the solubility of the drug in water which ideally ranged between − 6.5 and 0.5 (Nisha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2016</xref>). All the screened compounds lie within this range. The solubility of the molecules in water significantly facilitates drug developmental activities (Diana et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>). The selected phytochemicals have passed the carcinogenic test and all exhibit non-carcinogenic nature (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Among 15 phytochemicals, seven phytochemicals (kaempferol, quercetin, hinokinin, isoandrographolide, 14-deoxy-14,15-didehydroandrographolide, 14-Deoxyandrographolide and 19-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-14-deoxy-11, 12-didehydroandrographolide) have shown high gastrointestinal or human intestinal absorption. Remaining eight phytochemicals (astragalin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin, corilagin, furosin, geraniin, neoandropholidae and 5-hydroxy-7, 8, 2′, 5′-tetramethoxy flavone) have exhibited low gastrointestinal or human intestinal absorption. The positive control remdesivir also has low human intestinal absorption value. As all the compounds have exhibited non-carcinogenic nature and good pharmacokinetic properties these compounds individually or in combination may be effective against the SARS-CoV-2. Further, inflammation of lungs resulting in breathing problem is a major symptom in the critical patients suffering from Covid-19 (Li and Ma 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>). In addition to all the prediction studies, the plant extracts of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> have shown anti-inflammatory properties in rat Kupffer cells (Kiemer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2003</xref>). The pharmacokinetic predictions suggest that compounds from the two plants species studied in the current study are found to be biologically safe and can be utilized as therapeutics against SARS-CoV-19. However, more studies need to be conducted to decipher the exact mechanism involved in the interaction between these phytochemicals and the viral receptor proteins.
