For closed and open conformational state of spike protein, the active sites were chosen based on the receptor-binding domain, which interacts with the ACE2 receptors on the host cell membrane of humans (Gur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>). In case of 3CLpro protein, the binding site was selected based on the location of co-crystallized inhibitor N3, which was developed using computer-aided drug design and has shown specific inhibition to SARS and MERS with good binding affinity in the binding pockets of crystal structure of 3CLpro (Jin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>). The optimized ligands and proteins in PDBQT format were subjected to molecular docking with the aid of AutoDock Vina software (Trott and Olson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2010</xref>). AutoDock Vina predicts the interaction between protein and ligand by utilizing its scoring function (binding affinity). In the process of molecular docking, based on predicted active sites, the grid box was set to 60 Å × 60 Å × 60 Å centred at 225.616, 226.490, 225.337 (XYZ coordinates) for spike protein 6VSB, grid box was set to 80 Å × 80 Å × 80 Å centred at 223.220962, 190.082990, 263.907088 (XYZ coordinates) for spike proteins 6VXX (closed) and 6VYB (open), grid box 26 Å × 26 Å × 26 Å centred at − 10.712, 12.411, 68.8312 (XYZ coordinates) for 3CLpro, grid box 60 Å × 60 Å × 60 Å centred at − 8.611, 38.916, − 41.012 (XYZ coordinates) for PLpro and grid box 60 Å × 60 Å × 60 Å centred at 138.751, 163.504, 136.636 (XYZ coordinates) for RdRp. The value of exhaustiveness was set at 24 (Froli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>). The output file obtained after docking analysis consists of top nine binding poses with their respective binding affinity in kcal/mol. The ligand binding pose showing highest binding affinity with least root mean square deviation (RMSD) was selected. The protein–ligand interaction in 3D structures was visualized in PyMOL. Similarly, 2D structure was visualized in Biovia Discovery studio 2020. The 3D visualization represents the exact location or the binding pocket of the target protein, whereas the 2D structure visualization represents the different bonds formed between the amino acid residues of the viral target protein and the ligand. The workflow of in silico molecular docking analysis is represented in Fig.
