<p id="Par12">The drug-likeness analysis was carried out based on Lipinski’s rule of five (Lipinski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2004</xref>). Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) are pharmacokinetic properties of a ligand that deals primarily with its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in the human body. The major parameter, Lipinski’s rule of five was generated using SWISSADME (Daina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>) for evaluating the pharmacological significance. The ligands in PDB format were converted to canonical SMILES format and uploaded to SWISSADME prediction (
