 <p id="Par1">The 
  <italic>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-</italic>2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in outbreak of global pandemic, fatal pneumonia in human referred as Coronavirus Disease-2019 (Covid-19). Ayurveda, the age old practice of treating human ailments in India, can be considered against SARS-CoV-2. Attempt was made to provide preliminary evidences for interaction of 35 phytochemicals from two plants (
  <italic>Phyllanthus amarus</italic> and 
  <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> used in Ayurveda
  <italic>)</italic> with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (open &amp; closed state S protein, 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp) through in silico docking analysis. The nucleotide analogue remdesivir, being used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2, was used as a positive control. The results revealed that 18 phytochemicals from 
  <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 14 phytochemicals from 
  <italic>A. paniculata</italic> shown binding energy affinity/dock score &lt; − 6.0 kcal/mol, which is considered as minimum threshold for any compound to be used for drug development. Phytochemicals used for docking studies in the current study from 
  <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
  <italic>A. paniculata</italic> showed binding affinity up to − 9.10 kcal/mol and − 10.60 kcal/mol, respectively. There was no significant difference in the binding affinities of these compounds with closed and open state S protein. Further, flavonoids (astragalin, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin-3-
  <italic>O</italic>-glucoside and quercetin) and tannins (corilagin, furosin and geraniin) present in 
  <italic>P. amarus</italic> have shown more binding affinity (up to − 10.60 kcal/mol) than remdesivir (up to − 9.50 kcal/mol). The pharmacokinetic predictions suggest that compounds from the two plants species studied in the current study are found to be non-carcinogenic, water soluble and biologically safe. The phytochemicals present in the extracts of 
  <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
  <italic>A. paniculata</italic> might have synergistic effect with action on multiple target sites of SARS-CoV-2. The information generated here might serve as preliminary evidence for anti SARS-CoV-2 activity of phytochemicals present from 
  <italic>P. amarus</italic> and 
  <italic>A. paniculata</italic> and the potential of Ayurveda medicine in combating the virus.
