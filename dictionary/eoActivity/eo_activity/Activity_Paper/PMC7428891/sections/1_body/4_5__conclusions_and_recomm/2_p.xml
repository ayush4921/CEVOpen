<p>Nevertheless, there is a need to bio-screen the studied extracts of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> to identify and isolate the specific compounds with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. This way, new compounds might be discovered, which will be used for treatment of the two conditions: pain and inflammation. Additionally, future studies should focus on elucidation of the possible mechanism(s) for analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions of the aqueous and methanolic stem bark extracts studied herein. In addition to acute toxicity, there is a need to evaluate chronic toxicity to determine the safety of the bark extracts in animal models.
