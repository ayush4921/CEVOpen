<p>Fresh barks of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> were obtained from Embu County, Kiang'ombe forest, in the natural habitat where the plant grew, with the help of a reputable local herbalist. Identification and authentication were done by a plant taxonomist at the East Africa Herbaria (National Museums of Kenya), and the plant was assigned the voucher reference number NMK/BOT/CTX/1/2. Duplicate voucher specimen was prepared and deposited at the Department of Biological Sciences, Chiromo Campus, University of Nairobi. The collected plant samples were cut into small fragments, air-dried in a well aerated room, with regular grabbling for 14 days, and ground into a coarsely powdered material using an electric mill. The powder was kept in well labelled manila bag and kept in a dry place awaiting extraction.
