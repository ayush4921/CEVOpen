<p>Peripheral analgesic effects of the aqueous and methanolic stem bark extracts of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> were evaluated using the acetic acid-induced writhing method of [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in Swiss albino mice. A completely randomized study design was adopted, from which the experimental design was drawn. In this design, experimental mice were randomly assigned to six groups (I, II, III, IV, V, and VI), with each consisting of 5 animals. Groups I, II, III, and IV received an oral treatment of 4 mg/kg bw, 20 mg/kg bw, 100 mg/kg bw, and 500 mg/kg bw, respectively, of the studied plant extracts 
 <italic>p.o</italic>. On the other hand, groups V and VI received 75 mg/kg bw of acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) and 10 ml/kg bw of distilled water orally as positive and negative controls, respectively. After 30 minutes, writhing was induced in each experimental mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.6% v/v acetic acid. All the drugs were administered at a volume of 200
