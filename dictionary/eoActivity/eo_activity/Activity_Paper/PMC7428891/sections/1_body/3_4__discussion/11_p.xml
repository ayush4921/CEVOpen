<p>It has been demonstrated that oxidative stress plays a role in inflammatory processes, and that antioxidant compounds play major roles in amelioration of inflammation [

 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> have shown presence of flavonoids and phenols among other antioxidant phytocompounds [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Further, an earlier study by Kwaji et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] on the aqueous leaf extract of 
 <italic>P. thonningii</italic> showed presence of antioxidant phytochemicals which are associated with anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is therefore anticipated that the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of the studied extracts could be due to these secondary metabolites.
