<p>These results indicate that the aqueous and methanolic stem bark extracts of this plant are nontoxic to laboratory rodents. Studies have shown that the presence of toxic secondary metabolites is responsible for the adverse side effects reported when some plants or their products have been consumed [

Indeed, based on the results herein, the studied plant extracts, either lack the toxic amalgams, or are present in too low levels to cause any observable signs of toxicity. Therefore, these results partly support the traditional use of the studied plant extracts in the management of pain, and inflammation, among other claimed conditions [
