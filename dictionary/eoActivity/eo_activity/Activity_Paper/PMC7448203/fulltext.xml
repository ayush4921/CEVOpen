Introduction</title><p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a clinical symptom characterized by an acute loss of renal function with high morbidity and mortality (9.5% of in-hospital mortality) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. AKI can be caused by renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, nephrotoxic damage, and sepsis. The pathogenesis involves excessive inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and an imbalance in the renal cell injury and repair; however, specific treatment targets in the pathological process and effective therapies are still lacking [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The main treatments for AKI include rehydration therapy, antibiotics, dialysis, and the discontinuation of certain medicines until renal function recovers. Although AKI is a reversible condition that can be cured, it can progress to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Given AKI is considered a global health problem, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies.</p><p>Drug-induced AKI accounts for up to 60% of all cases, resulting in a severe threat to hospitalized patients [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cisplatin is one of the most efficient and widely used antineoplastic drugs; however, its application is restricted due to the side effects, including nephrotoxicity [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, the cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is occurred as high as 30&#x02013;40% [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The nephrotoxicity involves oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, apoptosis/necrosis, and inflammation, especially in the proximal tubules and collecting ducts [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many target-based treatments including anti-inflammatory (i.e., <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-lipoic acid and ABT-719) and antioxidant (i.e., selinium and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-tocopherol) reagents and others (i.e., rhIGF1, ANP, and dopamine) have been reported to be effective in both in vivo and in vitro AKI models. However, their clinical application has shown inconsistent results [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which suggests that monotarget -based drugs can be not sufficient for treating AKI. Current standard cares are limited to vigorous hydration with saline and the simultaneous administration of mannitol [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, patients who have progressed to end-stage renal disease have only two treatment options: dialysis or kidney transplantation. The limited treatment options for AKI have led to an increased interest in alternative therapies using traditional herbal medicine.</p><p>Asian traditional herbal medicine based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used for the treatment of kidney disease in China, Korea, and Japan for a long time. Although several herbs containing constituents such as aristolochic acids and other plant alkaloids have been found to cause side effects, including nephrotoxicity [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], increasing evidences show that some polyherbal formulas, single herbs, and their main components have significant efficacy in AKI models via anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or antiapoptotic activities [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Notably, Xuebijing consisting of <italic>Radix Paeoniae Rubra</italic>, <italic>Chuan dome</italic>, <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, safflower, and Chinese angelica improves renal function in patients with scald injury-induced AKI [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Traditional polyherbal formulas are designed to control the balance of body functions, and the formula containing various medicinal herbs has been developed for greater synergistic and fewer side effects based on information in clinical records accumulated over time. Systems pharmacology has recently emerged as a useful tool for understanding the nature of traditional medicine formulas and their mechanisms [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In traditional Korean medicine, <italic>Bojungikki-tang</italic> (BJ, <italic>Buzhongyiqi-tang</italic> in Chinese and <italic>Hochuekki-to</italic> in Japanese), <italic>Palmijihwang-tang</italic> (PJ, <italic>Baweidihuang-tang</italic> in Chinese and <italic>Hachimijio-to</italic> in Japanese), <italic>Oryeong-san</italic> (OR, <italic>Wuling-san</italic> in Chinese and <italic>Gorei-san</italic> in Japanese), and <italic>Wiryeong-tang</italic> (WR, <italic>Weiling-tang</italic> in Chinese and <italic>Irei-to</italic> in Japanese) are used to treat the symptoms of kidney disease [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Traditional pharmacology categorizes BJ for invigorating <italic>Ki</italic>, PJ for tonifying the kidney, and OR and WR for promoting diuresis. These polyherbal formulas were approved by the Korea Food and Drug Administration as general pharmaceuticals, and they are commercially available. Among these, OR has been reported to prevent renal injury in diabetes-induced renal dysfunction, nephrosis, and hyperuricemic models [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and systems pharmacology has revealed that its mechanisms of action involve the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) for treating hypertension [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Case reports for treatments with BJ have shown improved symptoms in patients with chronic renal failure [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, there have been few studies on treatments of BJ, PJ, or WR for AKI, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, we investigated the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of action of four different polyherbal formulas on cisplatin-induced renal cell injury.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1.

Discussion</title><p>In this study, we showed that four traditional polyherbal formulas potentially prevented cisplatin-induced renal cell injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death and enhancing cellular proliferation. Traditional polyherbal formulas consisting of natural products have advantages over chemical compound-based drugs, including less side effects, variable bioavailability, and vigorous biological activity. Many traditional Korean medicine-based polyherbs are commercially available because accumulated clinical results prove that they have been effective for a long time. However, scientific evidence is still needed to clarify their efficacy and therapeutic mechanisms. We have screened potentials of anti-AKI polyherbal formulas with multitargeting to complement the treatment limitations of monotargeted agents. Considering that a goal of drug discovery is developing optimal combinations consisting of effective compounds for treating diseases, verifying the efficacy in traditional polyherbal formulas already proven clinically can be the most efficient and fastest strategy for novel drug development in AKI treatment.</p><p>Many medicinal herbs have been reported to improve the nephrotoxicity of AKI via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Cisplatin produces excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induces mitochondrial dysfunction and macrophage activation, which further increases ROS release and decreases the cellular antioxidant defense system [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since the process promotes renal neutrophil infiltration and tubular cell apoptosis, the polyherbs of BJ, PJ, and WR showing strong free radical scavenging activities and enhanced levels of SOD and catalase activities might reduce annexin-V-positive cells and activation of caspase 3 that plays a key role in apoptosis. Actually, the deletion of extracellular SOD3 has been shown to lead to functional deterioration in AKI [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There are concerns that the antioxidant activity of polyherbal formulas might compromise the antitumor activity of cisplatin. However, oxidative stress can increase cisplatin-resistance, and antioxidant reagents can also sensitize tumor cell to cisplatin [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Conversely, even though OR showed no antioxidant properties, it inhibited apoptosis and prevented cisplatin-induced cell death. Furthermore, while BJ, PJ, and WR showed cellular proliferative effects, those of OR were particularly prominent. The fact that OR promoted the cell growth under serum-free conditions for 3 days is interesting because it suggests potential regenerative effects in the kidney. There have been few reports involving the renal signaling pathways; one study has shown that OR has nephroprotective effects by suppressing the activation of the toll-like receptor 4/myeloid differentiation factor 88 signaling and pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome in hyperuricemic mice [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanism is completely uncertain in this study, and we are planning the future study to clarify the signaling pathways related to antioxidant and proliferative properties.</p><p>Many studies have shown efficacy of individual herbs and their main compounds on AKI models and the relevant mechanisms such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effects [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The effective single herbs on AKI include <italic>Astragalus</italic> root, ginseng, and <italic>Glycyrrhiza</italic>, which are constituents of the BJ formula; Hoelen in PJ, OR, and WR; moutan root bark and <italic>Cornus</italic> fruit in PJ; and <italic>Peony</italic> root and <italic>Magnolia</italic> bark in WR. TCM-based polyherbal formulas also showed preventive effects on AKI [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For instance, the combination of <italic>Angelica gigas</italic> and <italic>Astragalus</italic> roots, as the herbal components of BJ, improves renal blood flow by increasing nitric oxide production [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and <italic>Zhibai Dihuang Wan</italic>, which included the same four herbal components as PJ, attenuates renal injury and apoptosis [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Given that the polyherbal formula consists of several medicinal herbs containing hundreds of compounds, the mechanism studies on the multiple targets are difficult to analyze. However, traditional polyherbal formulas can be a useful source of novel herbal combinations for the treatment of AKI from a different perspective. For example, OR is used traditionally as diuretic, and its main herbal component, <italic>Alimatis rhizoma</italic>, has been currently reported to have remarkable diuretic activity [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The systems pharmacology approach has demonstrated the improvement of hypertension by the activation of the RAAS [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is expected that multitargeting of the five herbal components of OR may have synergistic effects of diuretic activity coupled with antiapoptotic and proliferating effects in protecting against cisplatin-induced AKI.</p><p>The clinical application of traditional herbal medicines in patients with kidney disease is rarely recommended because of previous reports on potential nephrotoxicity [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the present study showed the protective effects of BJ, PJ, OR, and WR on cisplatin-induced renal cell toxicity. Furthermore, some studies have shown the favourable effects of some of these polyherbal formulas in cancer: BJ restores the immune system in end-stage cancer [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and OR ameliorates nephrotic syndrome induced by the antitumor drug, Adriamycin [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Traditional herbal formulas provide enormous resources for discovering novel medicinal combinations for treating AKI. This study clearly demonstrated that the polyherbal formulas of BJ, PJ, OR, and WR protected against cisplatin-induced renal cell injury via antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and proliferative effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the 2018 Yeungnam University Research Grant (218A061030 and 218A380123), the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (grant number 2018R1A5A2025272), and the Basic Science Research Program through the NRF funded by the Ministry of Education (grant number 2017R1D1A3B03031470).</p></ack><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>VinayKumar Dachuri and Phil Hyun Song contributed equally to this work.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rewa</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bagshaw</surname><given-names>S.
