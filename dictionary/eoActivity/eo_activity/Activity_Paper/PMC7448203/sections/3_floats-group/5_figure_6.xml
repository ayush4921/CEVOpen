  <p>Proliferative effects of polyherbal formulas in renal epithelial cells. NRK and HK-2 were treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR at 1 mg/ml under serum-free conditions for 3 days, and the viabilities were assessed (a, b). The Ki67-positive cells were measured by flow cytometry (c, d). Blue and red lines indicate the polyherb treatment and vehicle control (Veh), respectively. The black is for experimental control omitting primary antibody in staining. Values are represented as a percentage of the Veh.
