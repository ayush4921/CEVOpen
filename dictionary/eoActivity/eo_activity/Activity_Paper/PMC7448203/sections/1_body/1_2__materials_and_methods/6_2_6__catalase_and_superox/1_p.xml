<p>Activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase, and SOD were measured using their specific assay kits (#707002 and #706002, respectively, Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were scraped and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. For catalase activity, the cell pellet was sonicated on ice in cold buffer consisting of 50 mM potassium phosphate containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, pH 7.0) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. For SOD activity, the pellet was sonicated in 20 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 210 mM mannitol, and 70 mM sucrose and centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The resultant pellets were reacted with formaldehyde for catalase and tetrazolium salt for SOD; they were then assessed at 540 nm and 450 nm, respectively, using a microplate reader, under the standard curves.</p>
