<p>The data are expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD). Since there were no significances in the Leven test for the homogeneity of variance, the results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey's post hoc tests. Each experiment was performed at least three times. A
