 <italic>Wiryeong-tang</italic> (WR, 
 <italic>Weiling-tang</italic> in Chinese and

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Traditional pharmacology categorizes BJ for invigorating 
 <italic>Ki</italic>, PJ for tonifying the kidney, and OR and WR for promoting diuresis. These polyherbal formulas were approved by the Korea Food and Drug Administration as general pharmaceuticals, and they are commercially available. Among these, OR has been reported to prevent renal injury in diabetes-induced renal dysfunction, nephrosis, and hyperuricemic models [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and systems pharmacology has revealed that its mechanisms of action involve the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) for treating hypertension [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Case reports for treatments with BJ have shown improved symptoms in patients with chronic renal failure [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, there have been few studies on treatments of BJ, PJ, or WR for AKI, to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, we investigated the protective effects and underlying mechanisms of action of four different polyherbal formulas on cisplatin-induced renal cell injury.
