<p>NRK and HK-2 cells were treated with the polyherbal formulas at 1 mg/ml under serum-free conditions for 3 days, and the cell growth was assessed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Comparing to the vehicle treatment, the cells were significantly increased by 1.1-folds in NRK treated with OR and by 1.6-, 1.5-, 1.4- and 1.3-folds in HK-2 treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR, respectively (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Consistently, the Ki67-positive cells were observed more in NRK treated with OR and in HK-2 treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR. There were significant differences among the groups in NRK (
 <italic>F</italic> = 15.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and HK-2 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 23.1, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The Ki67-positive cells were significantly increased by 1.2-folds in NRK with OR and by 1.3-folds with BJ and OR and by 1.2-folds in HK-2 with PJ and WR, as compared to the vehicle group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
