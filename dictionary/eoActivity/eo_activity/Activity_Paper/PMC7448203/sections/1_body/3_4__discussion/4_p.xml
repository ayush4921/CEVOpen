<p>The clinical application of traditional herbal medicines in patients with kidney disease is rarely recommended because of previous reports on potential nephrotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the present study showed the protective effects of BJ, PJ, OR, and WR on cisplatin-induced renal cell toxicity. Furthermore, some studies have shown the favourable effects of some of these polyherbal formulas in cancer: BJ restores the immune system in end-stage cancer [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and OR ameliorates nephrotic syndrome induced by the antitumor drug, Adriamycin [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Traditional herbal formulas provide enormous resources for discovering novel medicinal combinations for treating AKI. This study clearly demonstrated that the polyherbal formulas of BJ, PJ, OR, and WR protected against cisplatin-induced renal cell injury via antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and proliferative effects.
