<p>Binding affinity: The binding affinities between PROTACs and targeted proteins, PROTACs and E3 ligases, and the formation of ternary complexes were collected. The binding affinity of the formation of ternary complex can be employed to assess the capacity of PROTAC-induced complex formation with E3 ligase and targeted protein. It can be determined through some assays between E3 ligase (targeted protein) and the complex of PROTAC and targeted protein (E3 ligase) (
