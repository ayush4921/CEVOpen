<p>Mulberry (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Study showed the anthocyanins from the mulberry could inhibit the B16-F1 cell linage invasion [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The underlying molecular mechanisms is anthocyanins partly suppressed the Ras/PI3K signaling pathway. In addition, mulberry polyphenol extract (MPE) is rich in polyphenols that have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, anti-obesity and anti-tumor effects. Considering the biological effects of anthocyanins, further study performed by Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] investigated that MPE on treating vascular smooth muscle cellular migration and proliferation. Their results showed that MPE could suppress the expression of FAK, Src, PI3K, Akt, c-Raf, and inhibit the signaling axis of FAK/Src/PI3K in cell. Besides that, their study also showed that MPE decrease the expression of small Rac1 and Cdc42 to affect F-actin cytoskeleton rearrangement.
