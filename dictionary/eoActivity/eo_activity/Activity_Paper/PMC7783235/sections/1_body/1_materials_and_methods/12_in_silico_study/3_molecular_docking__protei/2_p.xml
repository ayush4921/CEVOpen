All the water and the heteroatom were removed from the proteins throughout using Discovery studio 2020. Proteins were arranged by combining non-polar hydrogens and assigning the Gasteiger charge. Besides, all the proteins were brought down to the least energy state with keeping standard residues in AMBER ff14sB and other residues in Gasteiger mode in UCSF Chimera and processed for further analyses (
