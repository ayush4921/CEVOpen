 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad et al., 2010</xref>). Group I and II received tween-80 (10 mL/kg; b.w, p.o), and acetylsalicylic acid (10 mg/kg; b.w, i.p.) and were treated as negative and positive controls respectively, whereas group III and IV received MEMP 200 and 400 (mg/kg; b.w, p.o) respectively. After the administration of test samples, acetic acid solution (0.6% v/v) was injected intraperitoneally. The writhing was counted after 5 min of the injection of acetic-acid and counted over 25 min.
