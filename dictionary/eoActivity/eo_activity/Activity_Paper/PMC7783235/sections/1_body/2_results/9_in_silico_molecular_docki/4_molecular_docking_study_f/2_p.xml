<p id="p0175">Antioxidant docking study was implemented by the docking of selected constituents with urate oxidase (PDB ID: 1R4U). The results of the docking score have been presented in 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> and docking interaction has been showing in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. From the observation, the present study enumerated that the lanceolatin – B and pongamol have the highest and lowest binding affinity to the 1R4U receptor and achieved docking score ranging from −2.96 kcal/mol to −4.03 kcal/mol by binding with the series of hydrogen and hydrophobic bond namely: cys103, trp208, arg128 and arg105. Besides, kanjone showed no binding affinity to the 1R4U enzyme.
