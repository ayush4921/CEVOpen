<p id="p0140">In the castor oil-induced diarrheal method, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>M. peguensis</italic> leaves prolonged the onset of diarrhea and reduced the number and weight of diarrhoeal feces in a dose-dependent manner. The antidiarrhoeal effect of loperamide and MEMP has been determined by comparing it with the effect of a negative control (tween – 80) presented in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. However, the data revealed that, MEMP 200 and 400 (mg/kg; b.w, p.o) delayed the diarrhoeal time till 139.33 min (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and 175.67 min (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) respectively. MEMP 400 (mg/kg) restrained the average number of wet feces (3.67; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), the average number of total feces (5.53; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), the average weight of wet feces (0.16; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the average weight of total feces (0.23; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) which is comparatively close to the standard drug loperamide.
