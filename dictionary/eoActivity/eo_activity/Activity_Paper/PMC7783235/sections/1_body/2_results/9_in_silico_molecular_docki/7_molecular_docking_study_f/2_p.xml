<p id="p0190">In this experiment, lanceolatin – B revealed upmost (−6.85 kcal/mol) and milletenone demonstrated lowermost (−5.81 kcal/mol) binding affinity to the human tissue-type plasminogen activator (PDB ID: 1A5H). Lanceolatin – B binds with the 1A5H receptor through thecys42, gln60, his57, tyr99 and gly216 residues of hydrogen and hydrophobic bond. The best binding affinity with the 1A5H receptor has been shown in the
