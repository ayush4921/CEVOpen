<p id="p0220">The necessity to explore medicinal plants emerges to discover new potential therapeutic leads against bacterial resistance and reemerging contagious diseases (
 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Nostro et al., 2000</xref>). Bacteria have a genetic ability to show drugs resistance (
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Nascimento et al., 2000</xref>) and spread this ability from progeny to progeny (
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Ert√ºrk et al., 2006</xref>). In spite of marketizing a variety of antibiotics in the last few decades by pharmaceutical industries, newer molecules are still required to combat microbes of the various spectrum (
 <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">Vital &amp; Rivera, 2009</xref>). Antibiotics can exhibit their actions in different mechanism including targeting bacterial cell wall by beta-lactam antibiotics and inhibiting protein synthesis (DNA and RNA formation) (

 <italic>M. peguensis</italic> had been reported to contain several phytochemicals along with flavonoids and bioactive phytochemicals (
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Ganapaty et al., 1998</xref>) and can be assumed that antimicrobial properties of MEMP against all selected bacterial strains (gram-positive and gram-negative) compared to standard (amoxicillin and streptomycin) can be attributed by the presence of these flavonoids (
