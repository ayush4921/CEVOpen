<p>The greater than 50% inhibition of α-amylase indicates that both oils are inhibitors of α-amylase and thus, can be used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. The inhibition of α-amylase is important in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus because its activity in the small intestine correlates to an increase in postprandial glucose levels.

 </sup> Alpha amylase inhibitors prevent the breakdown of carbohydrate and are therefore effective means of lowering postprandial hyperglycemia.

 </sup> It therefore impairs glucose metabolism without promoting insulin secretion in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.

 </sup> These oils can also be useful for other diabetic patients taking oral antidiabetic drug but need to keep their blood glucose level within a safe range.

 </sup> The non significant difference between 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> oil and acarbose in percentage alpha amylase inhibition at higher concentration suggests a similar mechanism of inhibition. This might be due to the presence of flavonoids in 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> oil.

 </sup> Flavonoids have been reported to have alpha amylase inhibitory potential and its mechanism of action is similar to acarbose.

 </sup> The α-amylase inhibitory potential of garlic oil might be due to the sulfur containing compounds reportedly present in the oil.

 </sup> These compounds have been reported to have alpha amylase inhibitory activity. The lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of these oils indicates that the oils are more potent than acarbose, the standard drug.
