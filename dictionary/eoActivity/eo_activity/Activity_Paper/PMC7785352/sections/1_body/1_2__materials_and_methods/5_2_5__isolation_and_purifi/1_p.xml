<p>The dichloromethane fraction (4.2 g) was subjected to a silica gel column (200-300 mesh) in gradient elution of mixture solvent composed of petroleum ether-acetone (from 100 : 10 to 100 : 100, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) and led to four subfractions (Fr.1-1-Fr.1-4). Compounds 
 <bold>10</bold> (22.2 mg) and 
 <bold>7</bold> (2.4 mg) were yielded through recrystallization (MeOH) from Fr.1-2, and the remaining fraction was further purified by semipreparative HPLC (MeOH-H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 45 : 55) to obtain compound 
 <bold>13</bold> (2.1 mg). Fr.1.3 was further separated repeatedly with Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to obtain two subfractions (Fr.1.3.1- Fr.1.3.2). Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> (100.1 mg) was obtained through recrystallization (MeOH) from Fr.1.3.1. Fr.1.3.2 was subjected to preparative TLC (CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>-Acetone, 10 : 8) to obtain compound 
 <bold>8</bold> (2.0 mg). Fr.1.4 was further separated repeatedly with Sephadex LH-20 (MeOH) to obtain compound 
 <bold>16</bold> (2.3 mg).
