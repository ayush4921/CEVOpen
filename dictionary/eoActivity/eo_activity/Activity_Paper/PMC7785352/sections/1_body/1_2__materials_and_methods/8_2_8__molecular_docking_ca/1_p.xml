<p>To investigate the interaction between active compounds and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, molecular simulations were generated by using AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2). The crystal structure of isomaltase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDB ID: 3A4A) was diffusely used in the molecular docking analysis [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The 3D structure of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>-
 <bold>2</bold> and acarbose was built by ChemBioDraw Ultra 14.0 and energy minimized by ChemBio3D Ultra 14.0 software. The ligands were modified for docking by incorporating nonpolar hydrogen and setting revolvable bonds. As for receptor, all the water molecules were removed and necessary hydrogen atoms were added to the protein. Compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> and acarbose were considered fully flexible. The grid for docking was formed using 
 <italic>X</italic>-, 
 <italic>Y</italic>-, and 
 <italic>Z</italic>-axes. The docking runs were performed using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA). In addition, acquiescent arguments were used unless otherwise indicated. The docked formation with the lowest energy value between 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and active compounds was obtained and visually evaluated using PyMoL 1.7.6 software (
