<p>The kinetic mechanisms of active compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold> towards 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase were determined by the graphical views of 
 <italic>Dixon and Lineweaver</italic>-
 <italic>Burk plots</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The concentration ranges for the substrates were 0.8-5.0 mM. The concentration of the enzyme was kept constant at 1.3 U/mL. Lineweaver-Burk plots were established to evaluate the type of inhibition. Dixon plots were used to calculate inhibitory constant (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub>) values of the tested compounds. Each kinetic analysis was implemented in triplicate from which mean 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> values.
