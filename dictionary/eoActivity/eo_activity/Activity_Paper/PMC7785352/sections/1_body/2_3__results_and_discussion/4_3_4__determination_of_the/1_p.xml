<p>13 isolated compounds from mango seed kernel were assayed for the antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Most of the isolated phenolic compounds showed strong antioxidant activity. The relative order of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>-
 <bold>4</bold> in DPPH radical scavenging capacity was found to be compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.93 ± 1.06 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) &gt; 2 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 22.31 ± 0.74 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) &gt; 3 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 23.68 ± 0.52 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) &gt; 4 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 52.82 ± 0.93 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) &gt; ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 116.63 ± 4.16 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), which suggested that the number of the galloyl moiety played a crucial role in the antioxidant activity, the more it was, the stronger antioxidant activity would be exhibited. Meanwhile, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> showed higher radical scavenging activity than 
 <bold>2</bold>. Hence, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> might have a better spatial configuration than 
 <bold>2</bold> to promote the DPPH radical scavenging activity. The relative order of compounds 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, and 
 <bold>10</bold> in DPPH radical scavenging capacity was found to be compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 32.26 ± 0.48 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) &gt; 6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 37.81 ± 2.52 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) &gt; 10 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 37.97 ± 1.94 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) &gt; 9 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), which suggested that the substitution of glycerin at the hydroxyl group of the carboxylic acid in gallic acid significantly reduced DPPH radical scavenging ability. Compound 
 <bold>12</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 36.91 ± 0.30 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) exhibited moderate antioxidant activity, which was nearly threefold higher than compound 
 <bold>11</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 94.99 ± 2.41 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), respectively. Therefore, the methoxy group at aromatic rings was not beneficial for the radical scavenging activity.
