<p>In this study, the 60% ethanol extract was obtained from the mango seed kernel by ultrasonic extraction, and the extract solution was concentrated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic>. The crude extract was successively partitioned with petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol. After that, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activities were evaluated (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the extract and fractions, petroleum ether and dichloromethane fractions showed moderate inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 80.10 and 83.58 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively). The ethyl acetate fraction was found to possess the best antioxidant and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory capacity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15.78 and 53.33 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively). The 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fraction showed a positive DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 44.06 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Consequently, in order to further clarify the chemical basis in active fractions, we performed additional studies.
