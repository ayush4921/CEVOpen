 <italic>α-Glucosidase</italic> inhibitors could significantly reduce postprandial blood glucose levels in patients with type II diabetes mellitus and reduce diabetic complications. The 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the extract and four fractions had been analyzed above. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, compounds 
 <bold>2</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.07 ± 0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, which was similar to that of acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.11 ± 0.01 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), followed by compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.6 ± 0.36 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), 
 <bold>3</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 243.30 ± 1.43 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), and 
 <bold>4</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). It could be concluded that compound 
 <bold>2</bold> might have a better spatial configuration than 
 <bold>1</bold> to promote the activity, and the amount of the galloyl moiety played a crucial role in 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition. Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 313.03 ± 3.71 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) showed low 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Compounds 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, and 
 <bold>10</bold> were reported no inhibitory activity. These results indicated that the substitution of methoxyl, ethyoxyl, and glyceryl at the hydroxyl group on the carboxylic acid of gallic acid could reduce the inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. Meanwhile, compound 
 <bold>6</bold> exhibited higher 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory potential than 
 <bold>7</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 425.12 ± 31.50 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). From this study, it indicated that increasing the number of hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring could enhance the inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase.
