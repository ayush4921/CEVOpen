<p>GC-MS chromatogram of the petroleum ether fraction of mango seed kernel revealed 23 components were detected during retention time 60 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>). Mass spectral fingerprint of compounds was confirmed by molecular weight and data library (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among all the identified components, eicosane, 9-hexadecenoic acid methyl ester, 9-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, and (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-3-(heptadec-10-en-1-yl) phenol had never been reported in natural products before and total compounds in the petroleum ether fraction of mango seed kernel were reported for the first time. In addition, specific GC-MS assays also showed that components S9, S12, S13, and S14 were its main ingredients, as reported for this compound making up to 10.3%, 9.31%, 39.11%, and 23.67% of this fraction. The biological activities of main components have been reported in many references. The findings of studies [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] showed that hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, (9
 <italic>Z</italic>,12
 <italic>Z</italic>)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester, octadecanoic acid methyl ester, and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-9-octadecenoic acid methyl ester both had significant antioxidant and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory functions. In addition, (9
 <italic>Z</italic>,12
 <italic>Z</italic>)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid methyl ester and (
 <italic>E</italic>)-9-octadecenoic acid methyl ester also showed superior activity against human cancer cell line [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Besides this, in the references, the biological activities of other identified components in the petroleum ether fraction of mango seed kernel have been reported. The study of Das, Vasudeva, and Sharma [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] proved that methyl tetradecanoate was a membrane stabilizer and a source of nutrients for protoplasm. Pasquer, Isidore, Zarn, and Keller [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Malamy and Klessig [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] suggested that application of 2,4-
 <italic>bis</italic>(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol induced expression of PR genes and promoted resistance to bacterial, oomycete, viral, and fungal pathogens in various monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Meanwhile, the antibacterial effect of 2, 4-
 <italic>bis</italic>(1,1-dimethylethyl)phenol appeared to correlate with the antioxidant capacity recorded to the compound, as it restrained the production of ROS in both 
 <italic>Phytophthora</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus cinnamomi</italic> [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
