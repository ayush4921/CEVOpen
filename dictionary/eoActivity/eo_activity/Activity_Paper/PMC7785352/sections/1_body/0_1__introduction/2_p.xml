<p>Mango (
 <italic>Mangifera indica</italic> L.) is one of the most popular fruit worldwide, which belongs to the Anacardiaceae and grown in many places around the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical countries. This fruit is available as a dietary supplement due to their high nutritional value, such as providing dietary fiber, fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and phenolic compounds, which are vital to human growth, development, and health [

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] indicated that the 95% ethanol extracts from two different kinds of mango seed kernel, namely, 
 <italic>Kaew</italic> and 
 <italic>Choke-Anan</italic>, both had good 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 163.19 ± 2.33 and 113.51 ± 5.85 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Emmanuel, Ganiyu, Afolabi, Aline, and Margareth [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] had demonstrated that the methanol extract of mango seed kernel could significantly inhibit the activity of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. Although it was used for centuries as a traditional folk prescription in China, there are few studies on chemical components in mango seed kernel and bioactivities of its monomeric compounds. Meanwhile, no investigations on the composition and activity of its petroleum ether fraction have been previously reported.
