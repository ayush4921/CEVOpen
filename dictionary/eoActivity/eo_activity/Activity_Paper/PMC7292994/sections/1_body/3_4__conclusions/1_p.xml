<p>The results of the study revealed that the crude extracts of fruits, seeds, and bark of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum armatum</italic> from different habitats have antibacterial properties against several infectious pathogens causing several diseases in humans. The fruits were found to be more active against the bacteria than seeds or bark, and the fruits showed highest ZOI against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Similarly, the seeds were also found to have good antibacterial properties. Bark exhibited activities against MRSA and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> only. The findings of this study support the traditional usage of the plants in herbal medicinal practices. Medicinal plants contain a variety of compounds that can be developed into several drugs for the safe usage and benefit to mankind. Since the indiscriminate use of modern antibiotics may cause severe health hazards, these plants can be safe alternatives to treat several diseases. The antibacterial properties as exhibited by the fruits, seeds, and bark of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> suggest the potential use of this plant in skin infection, urinary tract infection, dental problems, diarrhea, and dysentery. Hence, further research should be directed towards the extensive in vivo and clinical studies along with the mechanism of action of the antibacterial activities, which justifies the rational for their traditional uses and also leads to the development of novel plant-based antimicrobials for safe health care services.
