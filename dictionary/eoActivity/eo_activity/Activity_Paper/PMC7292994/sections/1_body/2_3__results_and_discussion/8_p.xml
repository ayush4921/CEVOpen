<p>Flavonoids and other phenolics exhibit a wide range of fascinating biological activities such as antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, and anticancer properties [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The antibacterial activities of fruit extracts of 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> were comparatively better than seed and bark extracts. It might be due to the higher phenolic and flavonoid contents in fruits than seeds and bark [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The antibacterial properties of the crude extracts may be attributed to the collegial effects of several phytoconstituents present in the plant. 
 <italic>Z. armatum</italic> has been reported to produce structurally diverse chemicals including terpenoids, flavonoids, coumarins, sterols, and alkaloids that show antibacterial activity. Many active components have been identified from the plant that might be developed into novel drugs. Therefore, further emphasis should be on screening, isolation, and characterization of the individual components responsible for different antibacterial activities and their underlying mechanism of action. However, additional studies are required to quantify the acute and chronic toxicity in animals before clinical trials [
