<p>Antibacterial properties of the fruits, seeds, and bark extracts against different bacterial strains and the ZOI are presented in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1</xref>
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"/>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>. The most sensitive strain was 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> for all the fruits, seeds, and bark extracts as they showed maximum ZOI for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> compared to other strains. The highest ZOI was produced by the extracts against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 20.72 mm for wild fruits and 18.10 mm for cultivated fruits, 17.83 mm for wild seeds and 16.33 mm for cultivated, and the ZOI for bark was 17.01 mm for wild and 16.44 mm for cultivated. The least activity was shown by the seed extracts against 
 <italic>Escherichia faecalis,</italic> with a minimum ZOI of 11.73 mm (wild) and 11.29 mm (cultivated).
