<p>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that prevents the visible growth of organisms as detected by lack of visible turbidity. The clarity of the solution (absence of turbidity) indicates the inhibition of microbes. However, whether the turbidity was due to the growth of the bacteria or due to the turbidity of the plant extract itself was difficult to determine. Hence, MBC was determined to find out the minimum concentration of the extract that kills the microorganisms.</p>
