<p>This study considers the concept of ecological niche, one of the central elements of ecology. In the words of 
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Begon, Townsend &amp; Harper (2006)</xref> ecological niche corresponds to “the ways in which tolerances and requirements interact to define the conditions and resources needed by an individual or species to practice their way of life”. In other words, it is the multidimensional role of a species or an individual in the functioning of a given ecosystem (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Hutchinson, 1957</xref>). In this sense, it was suggested by 
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Odum (1971)</xref> that “organisms that occupy the same ecological niches or similar ecological niches in different geographic regions…” could be called ecological equivalents. 
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Odum (1971)</xref> also points out that “species that occupy equivalent niches tend to be closely related from a taxonomic point of view, although often they are not in regions that are very separate or isolated from one another”.
