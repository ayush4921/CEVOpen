<p>The concept of utilitarian equivalence proposed here is different from the concept of ethnobotanical convergence presented by 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Garnatje, Peñulas &amp; Vallès (2017)</xref>. Although both deal with different species used for the same purposes, the first has as its central element the overlap of uses between species of different medical systems. The concept of “ethnobotanical convergence” is different from that of utilitarian equivalence, especially since it is restricted to “similar uses for plants included in the same node of a phylogeny” (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Garnatje, Peñulas &amp; Vallès, 2017</xref>). Thus, a high overlap of medicinal uses between phylogenetically distant plants, such as a fern in Africa and an angiosperm in North America, can be considered a case of utilitarian equivalence, but not of “ethnobotanical convergence”. On the other hand, if the ethnobotanical convergence is established between species of different Local Medical Systems, there is also utilitarian equivalence.
