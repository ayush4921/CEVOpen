<p>The present study transposes for ethnobotany a concept analogous to that of ecological equivalence, hereafter called utilitarian equivalence, and uses it as an analytical tool in the search for common criteria for the selection of medicinal plants by people in semi-arid and in humid regions in the Northeast of Brazil. This proposition is based on the understanding that access to equivalent medicinal species provides the ideal scenario to seek common selection criteria, in order to identify the shared characteristics among the equivalent pairs and consequently the main types of perceptions or stimuli, which led to the inclusion of such species in local pharmacopoeias.</p>
