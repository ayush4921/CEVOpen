 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Odum (1971)</xref> highlighted ecological equivalents in three trophic niches of four coastal regions and presented similar herbivorous littorina belonging to the same genus, thus reinforcing the idea that ecological equivalence may undergo taxonomic influence. Some empirical evidence on the subject can be found in 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Fišer et al. (2015)</xref>. When considering ideas similar to those of Odum, 
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Fišer et al. (2015)</xref> evaluated the overlap level of niches between cryptic species of crustaceans of the genus Niphargus and their results suggest that, on a regional scale, the species play equivalent ecological roles, which in turn may be related to a still recent speciation process (
