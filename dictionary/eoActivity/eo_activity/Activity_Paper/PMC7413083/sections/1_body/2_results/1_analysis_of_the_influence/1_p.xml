<p>The species cited by more than one local expert in each area are shown in 
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The results of the analyzes that did not consider pairs of the same species (
 <xref rid="table-3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) showed that the chances of a pair being utilitarian equivalent increased when they were species of the same genus (OR = 9.25, CI [1.68–51.02], 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The family variable was not significant, although the 
 <italic>p</italic> value was close to 0.05 (OR = 1.87, CI [0.92–3.80], 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08). However, when the analyzes also considered the pairs formed by the same botanical species mentioned in both regions (
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), the chances of pairs of the same family being equivalent increased a lot. The family variable was significant (OR = 2.7, CI [1.49–4.88], 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and the genus variable also remained significant, however with an even higher OR value (OR = 11.77, CI [4.48–30.93]; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Although this last finding does not fit the concept of utilitarian equivalence, because it is the same taxonomic entity, it supports the idea that plants used for the same ends share common traits. Following this rationale, we also chose to discuss this finding. These results confirm the hypothesis that there is influence of the taxonomic affiliation on the establishment of utilitarian equivalence (see 
 <xref rid="table-4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).
