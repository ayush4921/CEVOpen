<p>The identification of the species collected was performed by the Instituto Agron√¥mico de Pernambuco (IPA), and was based on the APG IV classification system (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Chase et al., 2016</xref>). The control material was deposited in the IPA Herbarium. One point to be highlighted is that not all the ethnospecies mentioned could be collected and/or identified, mainly due to seasonality or the rarity/absence of the species in the region. When this happened, the species (in this case, ethnospecies) was excluded from the analyzes.
