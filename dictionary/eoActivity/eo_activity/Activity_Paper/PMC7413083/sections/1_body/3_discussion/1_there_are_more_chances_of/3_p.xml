<p>The obvious patterns in terms of convergence of medicinal uses among taxonomically close plants are probably related to the sharing of secondary compounds among species of the same taxonomic group (

 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Bletter (2006)</xref> found that the genera present in both countries were used for the same medicinal purposes. Since it is difficult to disseminate knowledge among the peoples of the two regions, given the geographic distance and the absence of historical relations between the two areas, it is more likely that the different peoples have reached the same conclusions about the use of plants independently, that is, evolutionary convergence (
