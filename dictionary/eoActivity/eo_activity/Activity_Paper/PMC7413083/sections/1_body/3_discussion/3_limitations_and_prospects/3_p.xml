<p>Concerning our limited number of species, since the main objective of this study is to recognize use patterns, we believe that adding idiosyncratic knowledge to the analysis could produce “noises” in the database and, consequently, decrease our explanatory power. Since we are dealing with tendencies, individual information would not be useful to our research design. However, future studies would gain by increasing the number of communities and (consequently) interviewees and plant species, making statistical procedures even more reliable.</p>
