<p>Our findings also demonstrated that the utilitarian redundancy among botanical species may be associated with their taxonomic affiliations in terms of family. As discussed in the case of equivalence, taxonomic proximity may imply the sharing of other traits such as the presence of certain classes of chemical compounds (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">RÃ¸nsted et al., 2012</xref>) and thus utilitarian redundancy may also emerge from the similarity of the chemical repertoires of certain plants. Some studies have inferred on the chemical influence on the configuration of redundancy scenarios. In a study in the Caatinga area, 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Santoro (2014)</xref> dealt with the factors underlying the process of choosing and incorporating medicinal plants with the same therapeutic indications and found that most of the diseases considered to be more serious are not very redundant (they have few plants that can treat them). One explanation for this scenario is that more serious diseases may require more specific treatments, requiring chemical compounds restricted to certain plants, whereas less serious diseases allow treatment from a wider spectrum of chemical compounds found in several plants (
