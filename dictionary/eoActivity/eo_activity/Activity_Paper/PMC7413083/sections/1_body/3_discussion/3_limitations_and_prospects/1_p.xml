<p>One of the limitations of this study is the dynamic nature of the taxonomic classifications that guided our statistical analyzes. Considering the changes in the taxonomic groupings over the decades, which will undoubtedly still occur to some extent in the coming years, we consider that the conclusions regarding our model need to be minimally relativized. However, there are arguments in favor of using the family and genus categories in studies of this type. According to 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Evert &amp; Eichhorn (2013)</xref>, the association between molecular systematics and the study of morphological characters has brought greater reliability to the use of these taxonomic categories. The authors also state that almost all families of flowering plants currently occupy a well-supported phylogenetic position, and this is progressing well at the genus level. Besides, even the oldest studies, based on outdated classifications (based on external similarities), allowed relevant advances in terms of medicinal plant use patterns (
