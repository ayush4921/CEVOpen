  <title>Background</title>
  <p>This study sought to investigate the occurrence of taxonomic patterns between semi-arid and humid regions, verifying how the taxonomic affiliation can influence the selection of plants for medicinal purposes and act as a selection criterion.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>The relationship between the taxonomic affiliation and the selection of medicinal plants with four different communities was analyzed; two of them associated with a seasonally dry tropical forest and the other two associated with a tropical rain forest. We used the Utilitarian Equivalence Model (transposing the concept of ecological equivalence, proposed by Odum, for ethnobotany) to test the hypothesis that species that have the same taxonomic affiliation tend to have the same therapeutic applications in different environments (utilitarian equivalence). In addition, we used the Utilitarian Redundancy Model to verify whether, within the same medical system, plants of the same taxonomic affiliation tend to be redundant (treating the same diseases).</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>We found that a pair of plants of the same genus were 9.25 times more likely to be equivalent than a different genus pair (OR = 9.25, CI [1.68–51.02], 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). When we analyzed the species used by the same population, the chances of a pair having similar therapeutic uses (utilitarian redundancy) increased when they were species of the same family (OR = 1.94, CI [1.06−3.53]; 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>These findings confirm the hypothesis that there is an influence of taxonomic affiliation, in terms of genera and family, on the selection of medicinal plants in semi-arid and humid areas in Northeast Brazil. In addition, our Utilitarian Equivalence Model can be an important tool in the search for more common selection criteria, in order to identify the shared characteristics among the equivalent pairs and consequently the main types of perceptions or stimuli that led to the inclusion of such species in local pharmacopoeias.</p>
