<p id="p0015">The bioactive compounds (marmelosin, luvangetin, aurapten, psoralen, marmelide, tannin, riboflavin, aegeline, β-carotene, lupeol, eugenol) of 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> fruit show multiple biological activities like, antihelminthic, antibacterial, antiulcer, antispasmodic, artemicide, anti-diarrhea, astringent, antiproliferative, anticancer, anti-diabetic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities (

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a harmful group of components which get generated during the aerobic metabolic processes in human body cells and these radicals lead towards many types of health-related diseases like stroke, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, asthma, retinal damage, neuro degeneration, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dermatitis (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">La Vecchia et al., 1998</xref>). Bioactive compounds (mainly polyphenols) show protective effects against cell oxidation by scavenging these ROS (

In inflammatory disorder proteinases lead the protein denaturation, here we tried to evaluate the ability of fruit extract to inhibit both the proteinases and protein denaturation. While for inducing diabetic disorder, α-amylase plays a major role by raising the sugar level in the body, here we studied the inhibitory activities of the extracts to prevent α-amylase to form simple sugars from starch. Previously many authors reported the 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> activities of 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.) against these diseases (
