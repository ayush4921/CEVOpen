<p id="p0260">Minerals are mainly divided into macro-minerals (major minerals) and micro-minerals (trace minerals). For sample preparation of EDXRF, the sample needs to be dried either by freeze drying as reported by 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Allegretta et al. (2019)</xref> or, need to be dried in an oven (
 <xref rid="bib97" ref-type="bibr">Turhan et al., 2010</xref>) for reduction of the moisture to such a level that pellet formation is possible. In this study, as the moisture content of all the samples was in the vicinity of 15%, pellet formation was feasible. Here we observed the effect of different drying techniques (BM, BS, BH, and BF) on the result of EDXRF. In total seven minerals were quantified for the dried samples, four macro-minerals (K, Ca, P, and Na) and three micro-minerals (Fe, Cu, and Mn). The amounts of the individual minerals for the samples are listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>. It was observed that BS (7460.18 ± 7.43 mg/kg) consists of the highest amount of the total mineral content, while for BH (7439.07 ± 26.86 mg/kg) the amount was the lowest. Similar to 
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Uribe et al. (2019)</xref> we also observed an insignificant change for macro-minerals, which was maybe due to the existence of the same amount of solid content in every sample. In the case of Fe, Cu and Mn we found a statistically significant difference between BS, BH (p = 0.2); BH, BF (p = 0.4); and BS, BF (p = 0.3), respectively. Though the differences were statistically significant, these may not have much influence on the nutritional characteristics of bael samples. Previously, some studies (

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Baliga et al., 2011</xref>) observed the mineral content (mg/100 g) of 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.) pulp, which varied from 78-600 for K, 30–85 for Ca, 31.8 for P, 6.65–11.9 for Na, 0.6–1.93 for Fe, 0.02–0.21 for Cu, and 0.23 for Mn. We also observed similar results with a little variation that may be due to differences in cultivar, soil, harvesting time, and conditions. Though it is the first kind of approach to compare mineral profiles of differently dried food products, it is an established fact that for mineral composition and quantification purposes EDXRF produces results in line with that can be achieved by ICP-AES process (
