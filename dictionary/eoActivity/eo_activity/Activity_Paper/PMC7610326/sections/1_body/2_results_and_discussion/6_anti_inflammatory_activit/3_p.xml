<p id="p0305">Proteinases are mainly linked with arthritic reactions, which are present in the lysosomal granules of neutrophils. The proteinases from leukocytes play a major role in promoting tissue damage during inflammation and it was suggested that the extract may prevent these lysosomal elements such as bactericidal enzymes and proteinases from resisting further damage (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Chou, 1997</xref>). To inhibit these serine proteinases it is essential to have hydroxyl groups at the ortho and para position of the benzene ring attached to the benzopyrone in flavonoids. It is proposed that these hydroxyl groups may form the hydrogen bridges with the amino acid residues located near or, at the active site on the trypsin molecule (
