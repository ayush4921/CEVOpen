<p id="p0210">Vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> is one of the essential vitamins for the transition of homocysteine to methionine. Without cobalamins the transition procedure becomes incompetent and homocysteine amount increases. The higher levels of homocysteine can be harmful to the blood vessels, enhancing the possibilities of cardiovascular diseases (

 <sub>12</sub> content in samples ranged from 0.11 to 1.65 mg/100 g DW, where the maximum loss was measured for BH (

 <sup>−15</sup>) and the amount decreased by 75.12%, 86.75%, 92.94%, 88.53 % respectively for BM, BS, BH, and BF. Similar result for microwave drying was observed by

 <xref rid="bib102" ref-type="bibr">Watanabe et al. (1998)</xref> also studied the effect of microwave drying on several foods (milk, beef, pork) and reported that microwave heating causes an appreciable degradation (30–40%) of the vitamin B
 <sub>12</sub> molecules.
