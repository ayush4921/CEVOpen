<p id="p0280">Unlike above radicals, which are extraneous matter to biological systems, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that get generated during different biochemical reactions in the living organisms. These ROS are moderately reactive, but they are precursors of other highly reactive radicals which damage cells and generate more new reactive species.</p>
