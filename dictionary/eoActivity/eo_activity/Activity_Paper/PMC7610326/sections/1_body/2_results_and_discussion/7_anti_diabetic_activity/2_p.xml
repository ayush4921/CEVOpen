<p id="p0310">It is estimated that the number of diabetic patients will be around 439 million by 2030, out of which 300 million are expecting type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et al., 2010</xref>). The awareness of the issue has led to a tendency to screen natural sources for anti-diabetic activity. Starch contains amylase and amylopectin, where, á-amylase splits the á-1,4-glycosidic linkages in amylose to yield maltose and glucose (

 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) and also hydrolyses amylopectin and glycogen to produce a mixture of branched and unbranched oligosaccharides (
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Morton, 2010</xref>), which further in small intestine breaks down into monosaccharides. á-amylase inhibitors (also known as, starch blockers) prevent or reduce down the absorption of starch into the body, by reducing or, inhibiting the activities of á-amylases. Flavonols like quercetin and flavones have an experimentally substantiated effect on á-amylase inhibition activity. Both flavonols and flavones contain a C=O group at the 4
 <sup>th</sup> carbon atom in the pyrone ring. Therefore the benzopyrone and benzene rings are involved in a pi-electron conjugation system through p-orbital sharing. Hence these two sub-classes of flavonoid groups deliberately provide amended binding property along with á-amylase. Both the benzene rings possess hydroxyl groups in the ortho and meta position, which is the favourable position for a reaction with catalytic enzymes (

BM and BF showed significantly higher anti-diabetic activity than BP with 5.71% and 5.51% greater activity with respect to fresh pulp respectively, whereas the same property was significantly lower for BH and BS; 0.89% and 2.96% decrease in anti-diabetic activity pertaining to the fresh pulp, was observed for hot-air and sun drying respectively (

 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. (2012)</xref> observed higher anti-diabetic activity for freeze dried bitter melon than hot-air dried sample. This activity is positively correlated by 0.79 and 0.7 with TPC and TFC.
