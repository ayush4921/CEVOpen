<p id="p0150">In our study, 1.16 ± 0.04 g CE/100 g TFC value was observed for the BP, which is similar to the value reported by 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Charoensiddhi and Anprung (2008)</xref> studied for Thai 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.) fruit. We observed an increase in TFC values by 39.89%, 24.76%, and 56.23% for BM, BS, and BF, respectively. While depletion in the amount was observed for the BH by 16.25%; an insignificant change was observed for BM, BS (p = 0.06), while for BM, BF (p = 0.08). 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Saifullah et al. (2019)</xref>, reported the highest TFC in freeze dried lemon myrtle leaves compared to other drying (hot air, microwave, and sun). Whereas 
 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen and Le (2018)</xref> found, microwave drying yield higher TFC value than hot air drying for carrot peel.
