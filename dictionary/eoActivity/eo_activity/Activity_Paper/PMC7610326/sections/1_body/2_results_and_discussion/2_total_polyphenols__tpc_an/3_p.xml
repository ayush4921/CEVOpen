<p id="p0140">The TPC content in 
 <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> (L.) pulp varies from 1.02 g GAE/100 ml to 8.73 g GAE/100 g as reported by 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Charoensiddhi and Anprung (2008)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Panda et al. (2013)</xref>. We also found a similar value of 2.3 ± 0.03 g GAE/100 g for BP. Due to drying processes, the TPC value varied significantly, with a maximum in BM and minimum for the BS (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The amount increased only by 9.11% for BM while for BS, BH, and BF the retentions were 75.91%, 70.44%, 98.3%, respectively. However, the differences in the case of BP, BM, and BF were insignificant (p = 0.09). While an insignificant change was observed for the BS and BH also (p = 0.48).
