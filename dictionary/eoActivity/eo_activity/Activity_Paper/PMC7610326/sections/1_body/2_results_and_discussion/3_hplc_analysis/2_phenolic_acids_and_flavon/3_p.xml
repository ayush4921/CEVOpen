<p id="p0160">In total five phenolic acids, two from the hydroxycinnamate subclass (chlorogenic and 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acids) and three from the hydroxybenzoic (gallic, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic and vanillic acid) were detected in BS, BM, BH, BF; while only 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid was not detected in BP. Gallic acid (GA) is the predominant phenolic acid for all the samples (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Gallic acid was observed maximum in BP (617.17 ± 2.58 mg/100 g), while the same was decreased by 1.86%, 4.02%, 5.99%, and 3.40% for BM, BS, BH, and BF, respectively. All the drying treatments significantly (p = 3.34 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup>) affected the GA content, though the GA content varied insignificantly for BS, BH (p = 0.11) and BS, BF (p = 0.07). 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Saifullah et al. (2019)</xref> found a similar trend of lowering GA in the case of freeze, sun, and hot air drying of 
 <italic>Backhousia citriodora</italic> leaves. 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Gasecka et al., (2020)</xref> observed a higher GA content for fresh 
 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic>, than the oven dried sample. Despite being absent in pulp, the 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid came into existence after undergoing the drying processes and detected maximum in BH (35.94 ± 0.18 mg/100 g). This was may be due to the conversion of chorismic acid into DHBA with a rise in temperature (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Gibson, 1964</xref>). Chlorogenic acid (CGA) was present in the second-lowest amount in the pulp among the detected phenolic acids, it also increased significantly with all the drying procedures (p = 4.40 × 10
 <sup>−22</sup>) and measured highest in BM (56.31 ± 0.26 mg/100 g). 
 <xref rid="bib93" ref-type="bibr">Slatnar et al. (2011)</xref> also reported the enhancement in CGA content due to sun and oven-drying. The existence of CGA in bound/esterified form in the fresh pulp may be the reason behind its low detection, while the drying conditions may allow the better release (
 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Wildermuth et al., 2016</xref>). Both for 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaric acid (p-CA) and vanillic acid (VA) the amount was significantly lower in BP than the differently dried products. p-CA content increased by 44.63%, 54.76%, 31.01%, 4.08% for BM, BS, BH, and BF, respectively. In the case of VA also, the values increased by 2.1%, 46.33%, 39.33% for BM, BS, and BH, respectively. But, for BF it was decreased by 24.55%.
