<p id="p0175">It was observed that lactic acid (765.48 ± 2.66 mg/100 g) was the predominant one followed by acetic acid (728.99 ± 0.29 mg/100 g), citric acid (542.45 ± 1.45 mg/100 g), and fumaric acid (394.89 ± 1.76 mg/100 g) for BP. While oxalic acid (38.66 ± 0.06 mg/100 g) and succinic acid (8.69 ± 0.11 mg/100 g) contributed in a lesser amount in the profile. For lactic acid, the trend followed BM &gt; BP &gt; BS &gt; BH &gt; BF, and for acetic acid, it was BP &gt; BM &gt; BS &gt; BH &gt; BF. Gaseckaet. al. (2019) also observed a similar trend for lactic acid and acetic acid in the case of fresh, natural convective and oven-dried

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2015)</xref> also found higher acetic acid content in microwave dried 
 <italic>Pleurotuseryngii</italic> than the hot air-dried sample. In most of the cases, the drying procedures significantly affected the organic acid content. Both for oxalic acid (p = 0.99) and propionic acid (p = 0.13), an insignificant change was noticed between hot air and freeze dried samples.
