<p>Dandelion: Over 2,500 species of “Dandelion” 
 <italic>Taraxacum</italic> spp. have been documented globally (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). However, for the purpose of this study the “Dandelion” recorded in the SMC has been identified as 
 <italic>Taraxacum officinale</italic>, as this is the most prolific species found throughout Ireland and there is significant historical literature to support its medicinal use (

Some of the recommendations documented in the SMC included using the white sap from the stem for external use on warts, boiling the roots and or leaves to make an internal concoction for a “bad liver,” “the stomach,” “anemia” or “consumption.” There is extensive evidence of the global use of 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> throughout history, dating back to the 10th and 11th century Arabian medicine (

In the 16th century, the German physician and botanist Leonhard Fuchs documented its use for complaints such as gout, diarrhea, blister, spleen and liver complaints, and Culpeper (1,653) also recommended the roots and leaves for the liver and spleen (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Schütz et al., 2006</xref>). In recent years, The European Medicine Agency has recognized 
 <italic>T. officinale</italic> root and herb, based on “well-established use” as a treatment for digestive and urinary complaints (

Additionally, a research initiative called “The Dandelion Root Project” based in The University of Windsor, Canada has been doing extensive research on the plant root and its potential anticancer effect. As a result, it has now successfully brought the first natural extract Dandelion Root Extract with anticancer efficacy to phase one clinical trial (
