<p>The normalized number of transcripts citing each plant in each of the 26 counties of the country is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Notably, the ranking of the citations of the cited plants is almost in accordance with that of medicinal uses established by 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Shannon et al. (2018)</xref>. Ivy is the most frequently cited plant in the heatmap, followed by dandelion, nettle, dock, garlic, comfrey, and then marshmallow. The high citation of ivy can be attributed to it being mentioned widely in several different contexts such as architecture (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 6Dii</xref>). However, as the number of transcripts of ivy in medicinal uses was found to be significant during the data exclusion procedure, its status remains unchanged in this study. Unexpectedly, garlic shows a relatively low number of citations despite being a historically important plant that was used globally as a food and medicine throughout history and is the focus of significant biochemical and pharmacological research (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Corzo-Mart√≠nez et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Farag et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the normalized numbers of transcripts of comfrey and marshmallow are significantly lower than all the other plants; with the latter being the least cited plant; this can be explained by the limitations, with perhaps the incomplete transcription being the main one.
