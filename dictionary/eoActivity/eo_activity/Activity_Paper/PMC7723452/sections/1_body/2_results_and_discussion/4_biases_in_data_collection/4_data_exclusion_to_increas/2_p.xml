<p>Examples of both medicinal and non-medicinal citation of several plants are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>. Of note, the examples of medicinal uses of the plants were retrieved using the search full website functionality of Google search engine rather than the in-built “Find” function of the database, which carries several limitations; please refer to 
 <italic>Limitations</italic>. Despite indexation of the transcripts, searching full text within a topic, e.g., “folk medicine,” is not yet an available function of the digitized archive. The vast number of transcripts also prevented manual exclusion of irrelevant transcripts. The inclusion of such transcripts risks skewing the data and leads to inaccurate representation of the recorded knowledge. In order the attenuate this limitation, the plants that showed significant citations in contexts other than medicinal uses, namely tea, potato and tobacco, were removed from the dataset. As such, the heatmap was updated accordingly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).
