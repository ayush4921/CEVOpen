<p>A plausible reason for the disparity could be different transcription rates in each county; not all digitized SMC manuscripts have been transcribed and are therefore retrievable from the in-built full-text search engine. To exemplify, despite possessing the highest number of manuscripts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), the relatively low transcription rate in county Cork as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref> rendered the retrieved data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref> incomplete and hence inaccurate. However, it should be emphasized that the volume of manuscripts is not a parameter to estimate the transcripts and prevalence of the plants. Notably, low transcription rates were also observed in counties in which numbers of manuscripts and retrieved transcripts are similar, i.e., light blue shade in all maps shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref>.
