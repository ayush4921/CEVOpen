<p>To confirm the apoptotic effect of spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> in HepG2 cells, Annexin-V FTIC/PI dual staining assay was carried out at IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <bold>6a</bold> (6.9 µM). Examining the results of this flow cytometric analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>), revealed that HepG2 cells treated with spirooxindole 
 <bold>6a</bold> exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of annexin-V positive cells indicating an early (lower right quadrant) and late (upper right quadrant) apoptosis from 0.95% to 6.76%, and from 0.33% to 14.14%, respectively, which comprises about 16.3-folds total increase with respect to control (
