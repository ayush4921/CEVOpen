<p>The DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity assay is considered as one of the most common and simple methods for measuring the antioxidant ability to trap free radicals. DPPH is a commercially available stable free radical that possesses the ability to accept an electron to produce a stable molecule. Substances that have the potential to act as electron donors result in reduction of this DPPH radical to the corresponding DPPH
 <sub>2</sub> disclosing their antioxidant potential. The principle of the method relies upon measuring the absorbance of the odd electrons of DPPH at 517 nm. The absorbance decreases, in the presence of free radical scavengers, proportional to the decrease of the DPPH radical concentration
