<p>In this study, all spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a–p</bold> herein reported were evaluated for their potential FRAP. The results were expressed as µM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> equivalents and presented in 
 <xref rid="t0006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, where the higher µM Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> equivalents value means higher FRAP and subsequently higher antioxidant capacity. As in the above DPPH assay, both spirooxindoles 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6 m</bold> exhibited the best FRAP activity (11.98 and 12.13 µM, respectively) that is comparable to the activity of the reference Ascorbic acid (13.42 µM). Moreover, compounds 
 <bold>6c–6f</bold>, 
 <bold>6 h–6j</bold>, 
 <bold>6 l</bold> and 
 <bold>6n–6p</bold> possessed good reducing capacity in this assay with FRAP range: 10.12 − 11.90 µM.
