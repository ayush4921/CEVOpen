<p>The accumulation of PolyQ40 proteins in transgenic AM141 worms was used as a model for Huntigton. When AM141 worms were treated with 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL LRE, the number of PolyQ40 aggregates was reduced in a dose-dependent manner to 30.18 ± 0.41, 26.38 ± 0.28 and 14.21 ± 0.36, respectively, compared to the DMSO control (49.40 ± 0.65). Similarly, the worms treated with 50 μg/mL EGCG showed a significantly reduced PolyQ40 aggregate accumulation (
