<p>When HT22 cells were treated with 5 mM of glutamate alone, ROS concentrations increased significantly to 243.9 ± 9.22% (compared to control = 100%). Whereas, co-treatment of the cells with LRE (100 and 200 μg/mL) and 5 mM glutamate significantly reduced intracellular ROS accumulation in a dose-dependent manner compared to control to 126.6 ± 8.39%, and 116.1 ± 7.99% (
