<p>The MTT assay was used to evaluate potential cell cytotoxicity of three extracts from LR—an ethanol extract (LRE), a cold-water extract (LRC) and a hot-water extract (LRH). The results showed that 5 mM glutamate significantly reduced the cell viability of HT22 cells by 44.71 ± 3.15% (

In addition, the viability of cells, treated with LRE, LRH and LRC at concentrations up to 200 µg/mL and 0.25 mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC), did not differ from that of the control cells. Moreover, co-treatment cells with 25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/mL of LRE and 5 mM glutamate revealed significant protective effects of LRE against cell death in a dose-dependent manner compared to glutamate-treated cells. Likewise, co-treatment with 0.25 NAC and 5 mM glutamate significantly increased cell viability to 94.67 ± 1.76% compared to glutamate-treated cells (
