<p>The Chemotaxis Index (CI) increased in a dose-dependent manner when treated with 50, 100 and 200 μg/mL LRE at 0.37 ± 0.04, 0.45 ± 0.03 and 0.49 ± 0.03, respectively, compared to 0.48 ± 0.06 in the EGCG positive control. However, there was no difference detected in CI in transgenic CL2122 worms (without Aβ) when treated with LRE and 50 μg/mL EGCG (
