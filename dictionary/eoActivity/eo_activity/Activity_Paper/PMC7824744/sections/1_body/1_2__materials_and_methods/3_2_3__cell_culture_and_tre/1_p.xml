<p>Mouse hippocampal HT22 cells (a generous gift from Professor David Schubert at the Salk Institute, San Diego, CA, USA) were cultured in a DMEM medium (Hyclone), supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum, in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. For treatment, The HT22 cells were divided into 10 groups including control group; DMSO-treated group; three control extract groups (LRE-, LRC- and LRH-treated groups at the same concentration 25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/mL in all groups); 0.25 mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as a positive control; four co-treatment groups with 5 mM glutamate including three extract-treated groups (LRE-, LRC- and LRH-treated groups at the same concentration 25, 50, 100 and 200 µg/mL) and 0.25 mM NAC + 5 mM glutamate. All groups were incubated for 14 h in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a 37 °C incubator.
