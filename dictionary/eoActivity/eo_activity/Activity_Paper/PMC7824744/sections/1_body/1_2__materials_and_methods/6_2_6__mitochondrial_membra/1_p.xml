<p>The MMP was determined by using a commercial kit (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) including the cationic dye TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester perchlorate) and a mitochondrial membrane potential disruptor CCCP (carbonylcyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone) as a positive control for the test. TMRE, a cell membrane permeable fluorescent dye, was accumulated in intact mitochondria. Depolarized or inactive mitochondria exhibit decreased membrane potential, resulting in reduced TMRE accumulation. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. Next, the cells were treated with the group of treatments as mentioned before, except cells of the CCCP group, which reached a final volume of 100 µL/well and the cells were incubated in the incubator for 14 h. After incubation, CCCP was added in the positive control group to get a final concentration of 50 µM, and then cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. After that, a TMRE solution was added to each well to get a final concentration of 200 nM and the plate was placed in an incubator (37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) for 20 min. Next, the solution was removed and the cells were washed with 1X PBS and then 100 µL/well 1X PBS was added to the plate. The samples were measured with a microplate reader at an excitation of about 550 nm and emission of about 580 nm.
