<p>The synchronized transgenic AM141, expressing PolyQ40::YFP as a reporter gene, were treated the same as with the chemotaxis assay, Then, the worms were incubated at 20 °C for 72 h. After the incubation period, the worms were mounted on a glass slide with a drop of 10 mM sodium azide for paralysis and images of at least thirty worms per group were collected. Fluorescent expression was detected by BIOREVO BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope (Keyence Deutschland GmbH, Neu-Isenburg, Germany) using 10 × objective lens at constant exposure time. The number in the PolyQ40 aggregation, located in the muscle cells of the worms, was counted manually. The mean ± SEM was analyzed for three independent replications.</p>
