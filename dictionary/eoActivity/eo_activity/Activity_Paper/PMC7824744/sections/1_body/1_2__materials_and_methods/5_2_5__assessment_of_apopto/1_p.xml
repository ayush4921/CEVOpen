<p>A fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated form of Annexin V is used to detect apoptotic cells. HT22 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells) were seeded in a 12-well plate and incubated overnight at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C. Next, the cells were treated with the group of treatments as mentioned before and incubated in the incubator for 14 h more. After incubation, cells were harvested, washed and stained with annexin V/PI solution for 15 min in the dark. Live and dead cells were determined by using a BD FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany). Data were collected for groups of at least 10,000 cells and results are shown as the percentage of apoptotic cells.
