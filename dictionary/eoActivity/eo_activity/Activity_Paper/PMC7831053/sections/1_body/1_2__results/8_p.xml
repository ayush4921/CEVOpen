<p>The interaction of tiliacorine, nortiliacorinine and 13′-bromotiliacorine with PknB is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00475-f003">Figure 3</xref> and exhibited binding energies of −11.4, −10.9, and −9.8 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. These values are significantly lower than the binding energy found for the control drug, MIX (−7.7 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). The best docking positions of each of the three NPs were compared, and these showed considerable overlap (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00475-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Such commonality of interaction could be related to inhibitory function and could guide drug optimization. In particular, a key feature here revealed is the interactions of the hydrophobic core of these NPs with PnkB
