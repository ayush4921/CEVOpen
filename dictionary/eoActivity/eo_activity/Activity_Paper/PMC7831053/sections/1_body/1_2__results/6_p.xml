<p>Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was used to provide a multivariate comparison of the physicochemical parameters of the selected NPs and 14 licensed anti-TB drugs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00475-f002">Figure 2</xref>). There was a large clustering of most NPs and anti-TB drugs, suggesting a significant commonality of properties. However, six anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin and levofloxacin, large red circle in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00475-f003">Figure 3</xref>) do not cluster with the NPs mainly due to their high hydrophilicity. The three aminoglycosides—streptomycin, kanamycin and amikacin—also exhibit a high number of H-bonds donors (
 <italic>n</italic> &gt; 10), which does not conform to one of “Lipinski’s rule of five”. Some NPs (selina-3,7(11)-diene, abietane and α-curcumene), represented in a large green circle in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00475-f003">Figure 3</xref>, possessed distinctive chemical properties due to lack of any H-bond acceptors or donors. This would exclude them from being possible drug candidates without further derivatization.
