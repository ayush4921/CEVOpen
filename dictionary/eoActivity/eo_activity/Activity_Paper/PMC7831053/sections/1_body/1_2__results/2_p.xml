<p>Three targets, InhA, Pks13 and DprE1, exhibited poor binding to all of the studied NPs. Only a few alkaloids and quinones exhibited lower energies (−11.4 to −10.5 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) than the control drug isoniazid (−10.4 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) against InhA. Considering Pks13, only one neolignan displayed lower energy (−11.0 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) than the control drug I28 (ethyl 5-hydroxy-4-[(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)methyl]-2-phenyl-1-benzofuran-3-carboxylate) (−10.5 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). Similarly, only alkaloids displayed favorable binding energies (−12.7 to −10.2 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>), compared to the control, BTZ043 (bedaquiline) (−10.1 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) against DprE1. Indeed, alkaloids exhibited very low binding energies (−11.4 to −8.7 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) against PknB, when compared with the control inhibitor MIX (1, 4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis({2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl}amino)-9,10-antracenedione) (−7.7 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). In contrast, KasA and ClpP1P2 were shown to have some binding energy to a wide range of natural product classes. For KasA and ClpP1P2, binding was seen with coumarins, lignans/neolignans, polyphenols and quinones. KasA is also bound by sesquiterpenoids and ClpP1P2, by triterpenoids. Although the PanK is predicted to bind to different classes of NPs, the alkaloids and quinones had lower binding energies (−10.5 to −8.5 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>) compared with the control ZVT (2-chloro-
 <italic>N</italic>-[1-(5-{[2-(4-fluorophenoxy)ethyl] sulfanyl}-4-methyl-4
 <italic>H</italic>-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)ethyl]benzamide) (−8.3 kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>).
