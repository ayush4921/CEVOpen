<p>Predictions of molecular docking are now well-established when assessing the interactions between ligands and targets. The use of docking approaches has been facilitated by the development of suitable software such as GOLD, FlexX, FRED, DOCK and particularly, AutoDock Vina [

 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Such in silico reverse docking provides a numerical estimate of the likelihood of interaction of a compound to its target. This approach can be extended to identify the proteins which are likely in vivo binding sites, and therefore possible modes of action [
