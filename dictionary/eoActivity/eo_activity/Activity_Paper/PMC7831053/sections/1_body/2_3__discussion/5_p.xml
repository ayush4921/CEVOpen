<p>The importance of our modeling approach for drug optimization was demonstrated by considering the binding of DprE1 to tiliacorine, nortiliacorinine and 13′-bromotiliacorine. The interaction with these NPs is stabilized by several non-covalent interactions, but crucially, these were distinctive from the binding simulations with BTZ043, where H-bonding, hydrophobic and ionic interactions are responsible for the stabilization of the complex [

 <italic>N</italic>-[(1R)-1-phenylethyl]-5-(trifluoromethyl) benzamide) is not involved in the binding of any of the NPs. Overall, 13′-bromo-tiliacorinine has shown slightly better anti-mycobacterial activity (and lower cytotoxicity against MRC-5 cell lines) than tiliacorine, nortiliacorinine, despite the higher binding energies here reported. Other biochemical assays are required to understand how the different chemical properties of these NPs influence bacterial uptake, metabolism and target binding. Nonetheless, the molecular interactions that we have defined can be used to inform chemical derivatization strategies aiming to increase specificity and decrease toxicity.
