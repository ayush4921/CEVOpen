<p>TB drug discovery has been based on the use of combinatorial chemistry and high-throughput screening strategies in drug discovery, but recently, there has been an increased interest in plant-based natural products (NP) as drugs [

They are still used in traditional medicine in such nations as China and in economically developing countries. Often knowledge of medicinal plants is passed verbally from generation-to-generation without any proper documentation or scientific validation. However, medicinal plants still represent a resource that can be further explored for potential “hit” compounds with significant biological activity, i.e., drug leads [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These hit compounds are typically found in biochemically complex extracts, and their identification can be considered to be equivalent to searching for a “needle in a haystack”. This is usually approached through sequential rounds of bioassay informed purification but could be considerably accelerated if candidate chemicals could be screened against known and “druggable” drug targets. Crucially, the identification of these targets facilitates drug optimization for improved efficacy and such reduced cytotoxicity [
