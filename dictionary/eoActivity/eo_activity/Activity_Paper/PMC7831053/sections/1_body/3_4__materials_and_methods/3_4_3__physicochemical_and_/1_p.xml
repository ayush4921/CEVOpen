<p>In silico prediction of physicochemical and structural properties of the NPs was performed using PaDEL-descriptor [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] including the descriptors: nHBAcc_Lipinski (acceptor H-bonds), nHBDon_Lipinski (donor H-bonds), nRotB (number of rotation bonds), TopoPSA (topological polar surface area), MW (molecular weight) and XLogP (prediction of logP based on the atom-type method). Chemical space analyses were conducted with the NPs and 14 anti-TB drugs (ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampicin, streptomycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, amikacin, kanamycin, linezolid, bedaquiline, clofazimine and delamanid), comparing the descriptors above. Unsupervised principal component analyses (PCA) were generated using the statistical analysis tool of Metaboanalyst 4.0 [
