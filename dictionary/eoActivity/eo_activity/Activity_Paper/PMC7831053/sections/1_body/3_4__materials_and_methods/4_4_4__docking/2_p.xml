 <sc>l</sc>-leucine), BTZ043, isoniazid, TLM (thiolactomycin), ZVT, MIX, I28. Molecular docking calculations for all compounds with each of the proteins were performed using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2. Docking calculation was generated with the software free energy binding own scoring function. The binding affinity of the ligand was expressed in kcal·mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. Nine different poses were calculated for each protein with the parameters num_modes = 9 and exhaustiveness = 16. The lowest energy conformation was chosen for binding model analysis. Molecular interactions between ligand and protein were generated and analyzed by LigPlot
