<p>The extended PDB format, PDBQT, was used to coordinate files to include atomic partial charges [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. All file conversions were performed using the open-source chemical toolbox Open Babel 2.3.2 [
 <xref rid="B72-molecules-26-00475" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The ligand and protein structures were optimized using AutoDock Tools software (AutoDock 1.5.6), which involved adding all hydrogen atoms to the macromolecule, which is a step necessary for correct calculation of partial atomic charges. Gasteiger charges are calculated for each atom of the macromolecule in AutoDock 1.5.6 [
