<p>We collected fresh leaves of of 
 <italic>B. fruticosa</italic> in Guanghzou, Guangdong province (China; N 23°12′26.02″, E 113°21′5.13″ and deposited the voucher specimen (
 <italic>YAO-YGGD2019040601</italic>) in the Herbarium of South China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IBSC). Total genomic DNA of 
 <italic>B. fruticosa</italic> was extracted from its fresh leaves materials using modified CTAB method (Doyle and Doyle 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>). Genomic sequencing was performed on the Illumina HisSeq 2500 Sequencing System. Software GetOrganelle (Jin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) was employed to assemble the reads and PGA (Qu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) was used to annotate all the plastid genes. The annotated plastid genomic sequence of 
 <italic>B. fruticosa</italic> is available in the GenBank with the accession number MT863745.
