<p>The maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was constructed using RAxML –HPC on the CIPRES cluster. A combined sequence matrix was emoloyed, including all the 78 coding genes of 
 <italic>B. fruticosa</italic> and Phyllanthaceae and Euphorbiaceae from 9 plastid genomes downloaded from the website of NCBI (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.017 plugin in Geneious R11.1.5. The GTR + G model and the default number of rate categories were set. The support values of phylogenetic nodes were conducted on the basis of a rapid bootstrap (BS) analysis with 1000 replicates. The phylogenetic result (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>) showed that 
 <italic>Breynia</italic> was sister to the genus 
 <italic>Glochidion</italic> with strong support value (MLBS = 100%). The complete plastid genome of 
 <italic>B. fruticosa</italic> reported here would provide a useful genetic resource on genetic diversity and conservation of 
 <italic>Breynia</italic> species.
