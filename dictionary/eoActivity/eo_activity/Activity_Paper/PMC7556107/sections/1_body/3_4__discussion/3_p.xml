<p>Increased concentration of malondialdehyde is an indication of lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Malondialdehyde is the oxidation product of fatty acids. The malondialdehyde level in rats after the exposure to cold in frostbite is due to the generation of free radicals. Our study indicates that the increased level of malondialdehyde is controlled by the administration of 
 <italic>Cs.Cr</italic> effectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that it can scavenge free radicals and thus can reduce oxidative stress.
