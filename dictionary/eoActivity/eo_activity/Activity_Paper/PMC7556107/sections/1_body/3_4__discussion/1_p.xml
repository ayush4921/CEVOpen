<p>Frostbite is a common occurrence in colder zones of the globe experienced by the local population, sportsmen, and tourists. It usually occurs when skin temperature drops below -0.5Â°C [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. With the rise in snowstorms, avalanches, growing tourism, climate change, and increase in global sporting activities, the frostbite events are naturally on the rise. Amputation of limbs and sepsis are the major frostbite complications [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] that demand the attention of the scientific community. Our goal of the study was to search and analyze the effects of

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The metal bars were utilized for freezing dorsal tissue and observing wound-healing progression through granulation and reepithelialisation. This model allows quantification of the affected skin surface area, histology, healing rate, and skin loss [
