<p>The Cs.Cr remarkably reduced the wound area both dose- and time-dependently as shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>. The frostbite-induced group showed signs of relative wound healing at the end of the study (21
 <sup>st</sup> day), while similar results were obtained in the Cs.Cr (800â€‰mg/kg)-administered group after the 7
 <sup>th</sup> day sparing significant and permanent tissue losses (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and
