    "Frostbite is caused due to extreme vulnerability to cold, resulting in damage of deeper and superficial tissues alike. In this study, we report the anti-inflammatory and wound-healing properties of aqueous methanolic extract of <i>Cuscuta reflexa</i> (<i>Cs.Cr</i>) against contact frostbite. Thirty rats were divided into five groups including three treatment groups with increasing doses of <i>Cs.Cr</i>, a standard drug group receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and a metal bar-induced frostbite group. Frostbite injury was induced by a 3 × 3.5 cm metal bar frozen up to -79°C on shaved skin for continuous 3 minutes. Wounded area percentages were recorded to measure the healing rate in response to <i>Cs.Cr</i> administration. Haematological parameters and malondialdehyde content were also noted. On treatment with <i>Cs.Cr</i>, the healing rate is drastically increased and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Results were compared with frostbite and ASA (standard drug group). These results indicate that <i>Cs.Cr</i> possesses excellent wound-healing properties against frostbite injury and can prove to be a prospective compound in such conditions."
