 <bold>(i) High-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry.</bold> Analysis of cycleanine metabolites was performed through high-performance liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS) system that consists of an Agilent 1260 HPLC coupled with an 6530 QTOF mass spectrometer with dual Agilent Jet Stream electrospray ionization source (Agilent Technologies, CA). The mass spectra were recorded in positive auto MS/MS mode, and the parameters were set as follows: temperature of drying and sheath gas, 300°C and 350°C; skimmer, 75 V; capillary voltage, 4,000 V; fragmentor, 110 V; nozzle voltage, 1,000 V; collision energy, 50 eV; pressure of nebulizer, 35 lb/in
 <sup>2</sup>; and flow rate of the drying and sheath gas, 5 and 11 liter/min, respectively. The QTOF mass spectra were recorded in high-resolution mode. The range of mass-to-charge ratio (
 <italic>m/z</italic>) scanning was set between 100 and 1,200. Samples (5 μl) were loaded onto an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C
 <sub>18</sub> column (100 × 2.1 mm, 2.7 μm) at 35°C. The mobile phase consisted of water containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. Gradient separation was achieved by changing the proportion of the solvent B mobile phase as follows: 0 to 2 min, 10% B; 2.1 to 5 min, 18% to 20% B; 30 to 45 min, 70% to 90% B; and 45 to 50 min, 10% B. MassHunter WorkStation software (Agilent Technologies) was utilized for the system operation and data analysis.
