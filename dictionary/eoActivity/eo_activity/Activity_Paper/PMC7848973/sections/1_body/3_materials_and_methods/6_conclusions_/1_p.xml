<p>Three BBIQ alkaloids of 
 <italic>T. subcordata</italic>, cycleanine (compound 1), isochondodendrine (compound 2), and 2â€²-norcocsuline (compound 3) and two semisynthetic analogues (compounds 4 and 5) of cycleanine were demonstrated to exert significant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activities against 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content>. Cycleanine (compound 1) was further demonstrated to have safety and efficacy in the treatment of mice infected with 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content>. Cycleanine was transformed to various metabolites in rats after oral delivery. The findings from this study support the use of 
 <italic>T. subcordata</italic> as an antimalarial agent in traditional medicine. BBIQ alkaloids could be exploited in novel drug development in search of antimalarial agents/drugs that are urgently needed to challenge resistant plasmodium species that currently present a significant threat to human life.
