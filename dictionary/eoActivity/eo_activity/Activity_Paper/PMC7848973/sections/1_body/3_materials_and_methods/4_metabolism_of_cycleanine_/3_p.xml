<p>Cycleanine (compound 1) was suspended in 0.4% carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC-Na) and was formulated at 12 mg/ml for intragastric administration to Wistar rats (male, 220 ± 10 g, fasted for 12 h prior to administration) at a dose of 120 mg/kg body weight. Three rats were used for blood collection through the orbital vein using cannulation at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 h postdose after anaesthetization with isoflurane. The plasma samples were separated from blood by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm and 4°C for 10 min. Another three rats were placed in the metabolism cages, and urine samples were collected into tubes from 0 to 24 h after oral administration of cycleanine. All samples were stored in a −80°C freezer before analysis. Aliquots of 1.2 ml of plasma or urine samples were mixed with 3 times the volume of acetonitrile to precipitate proteins. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and evaporated under vacuum. The residue was reconstituted in 200 μl methanol, and 5 μl of each sample was injected for HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis.</p>
