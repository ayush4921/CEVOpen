 <bold>(iv) Determination of median lethal dose (LD
  <sub>50</sub>) of cycleanine.
 </bold> The median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of cycleanine was determined using albino mice by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Different doses of cycleanine (10 to 5,000â€‰mg/kg) were intraperitoneally administered to groups of three mice each. The mice were monitored for manifestation of physical signs of toxicity, including decrease of motor activity, writhing, decrease of body/limb tone, weakness, and death. The number of deaths in each group within 24 h was recorded. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> value was calculated as the geometrical means of the minimum dose producing 100% mortality and the maximum dose producing 0%.
