<p>To further confirm and validate the efficacy of cycleanine (compound 1) 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, its safety in healthy mice and efficacy in a murine malaria model was investigated. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> (4.5 g/kg) of cycleanine indicated that cycleanine has a good safety profile, in agreement with the LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.1 g/kg found previously in mice (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Using suppression, prophylactic, and curative murine malaria models after infection with 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. berghei</named-content> (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), cycleanine showed a similar or closer effect at an oral dose of 50 mg/kg to their positive controls (chloroquine [5 mg/kg] and pyrimethamine [1.2 mg/kg]). At least, a much higher dose of cycleanine was needed to achieve the effects of these positive controls, indicating a mild efficacy 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, its low toxicity profile could allow increase of the oral dose (e.g., 100 mg/kg/day), which is expected to improve its efficacy. In the curative model, the slower effect of cycleanine comparing to chloroquine might be due to the metabolism of cycleanine to various metabolites. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity of cycleanine was consistent with its 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial efficacy of a BBIQ alkaloid, cycleanine. Overall, three alkaloids (compounds 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> to 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) of 
 <italic>T. subcordata</italic> could contribute to the antimalarial effects of this medicinal plant used in Nigeria for the treatment of malaria. BBIQ alkaloids of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Triclisia gilletii</named-content> (De Wild) Staner were also reported to be attributed to the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antimalarial activity of its plant extract (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).
