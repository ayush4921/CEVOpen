<p>Natural products (e.g., artemisinin and quinine) have demonstrated their potential as a source of antimalarial drugs. Previously, a number of BBIQ alkaloids were demonstrated to have 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activities (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Cycleanine had antiplasmodial effects with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 70 nM (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) (or 80 nM [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]) against 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> chloroquine-sensitive clone D6 (or 3D7) and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.5 μM against a chloroquine-resistant strain (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Isochondodendrine showed a low IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.2 μM against a chloroquine-resistant strain (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). 2′-Norcocsuline also showed potent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 48 and 248 nM against chloroquine-sensitive clone D6 (3D7) and chloroquine-resistant clone W2 (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), respectively (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our results against 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> chloroquine-resistant strain Dd2 also confirmed the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antimalarial activity of these compounds but with slightly higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) compared to the corresponding values reported in literature. Isochododendrine is a structurally demethylated analogue of cycleanine, and showed a greater potency than cycleanine in the chloroquine-resistant W2 strain and the Dd2 strain in this study (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This indicated that the increase of the hydrophilicity of cycleanine could improve its antiplasmodial activity. The SI values of all three BBIQ alkaloids ranged from 14 to 133 based on the KB or HTC-116 cells and the W2 strain, which were much greater than those based on HOE cells and the Dd2 strain. The discrepancy might be due to the different methodologies (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) used to determine IC
 <sub>50</sub> or the different mammalian cancer cells or 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> clones used. The semisynthetic analogues of cycleanine (compounds 4 and 5) produced by chemical modification of cycleanine through introduction of dimethylamino and (mono)alkynylamino groups, respectively, at the C-5 position exhibited increase in antiplasmodial potency and SI relative to cycleanine. The presence of a dimethylamino group in compound 4 could also increase the water solubility of the parent compound as is often found in the modification of other natural products, such as camptothecin (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and thymoquinone (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Compound 5, with a unique aminoalkynyl group, was used as a chemical probe for exploring the mechanism of action (e.g., cellular uptake) of cycleanine in cancer cells using click chemistry (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and can also be utilized for identification of the molecular target of cycleanine in parasite-infected blood cells using a chemoproteomic approach (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). By changing the amino substitution groups, additional analogues of cycleanine with a variety of diverse structures can be synthesized for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial evaluation.
