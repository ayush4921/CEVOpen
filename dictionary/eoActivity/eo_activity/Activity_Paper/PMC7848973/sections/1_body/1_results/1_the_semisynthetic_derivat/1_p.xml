<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activities of the five BBIQ alkaloids (compounds 1 to 5), as well as that of a chloroquine control, were determined against intraerythrocytic stages of the 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> Dd2 chloroquine-resistant strain using a malaria SYBR green I fluorescence assay. These data are provided in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) as 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values (mean ± standard deviation [SD] for 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 independent biological repeats). While the data for chloroquine in Dd2 are comparable to those of the chloroquine-resistant strain W2, the activities of cycleanine, isochondodendrine, and 2′-norcocsuline are significantly lower in Dd2 than that reported in W2, and certainly lower than that in the chloroquine-sensitive strain D6. The semisynthetic products 4 and 5 are relatively more potent than compound 1 to 3 in Dd2, with the most potent, compound 4, being some 25.2-fold more potent than its natural precursor, cycleanine (compound 1).
