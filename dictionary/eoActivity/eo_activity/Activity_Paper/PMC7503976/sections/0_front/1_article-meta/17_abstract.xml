 <p>As part of an ongoing study of natural products from local medicinal plants, the methanol extract of stem bark of 
  <italic>Rauvolfia caffra</italic> Sond was investigated for biological activity. Column chromatography and preparative thin-layer chromatography were used to isolate lupeol (
  <bold>1</bold>), raucaffricine (
  <bold>2</bold>), 
  <italic>N</italic>-methylsarpagine (
  <bold>3</bold>), and spegatrine (
  <bold>4</bold>). The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were tested for anti-oxidant, antitrypanosomal and anti-proliferation activities. Two fractions displayed high DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity and reducing power with IC
  <sub>50</sub> (The half maximal inhibitory concentration) and IC
  <sub>0.5</sub> values of 0.022 ± 0.003 mg/mL and 0.036 ± 0.007 mg/mL, and 0.518 ± 0.044 mg/mL and 1.076 ± 0.136 mg/mL, respectively. Spegatrine (
  <bold>4</bold>) was identified as the main antioxidant compound in 
  <italic>R. caffra</italic> with IC
  <sub>50</sub> and IC
  <sub>0.5</sub> values of 0.119 ± 0.067 mg/mL and 0.712 ± 0 mg/mL, respectively. One fraction displayed high antitrypanosomal activity with an IC
  <sub>50</sub> value of 18.50 μg/mL. However, the major constituent of this fraction, raucaffricine (
  <bold>2</bold>), was not active. The crude extract, fractions and pure compounds did not display any cytotoxic effect at a concentration of 50 μg/mL against HeLa cells. This study shows directions for further in vitro studies on the antioxidant and antitrypanosomal activities of 
  <italic>Rauvolfia caffra</italic> Sond.
