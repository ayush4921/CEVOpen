<p>In the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity test, fraction F
 <sub>4</sub> exhibited the highest free radical scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> (50% inhibitory concentration) value of 0.022 ± 0.003 mg/mL while Fraction F
 <sub>3</sub> displayed the lowest free radical scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.143 ± 0.478 mg/mL, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-03781-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the ferric reducing power assay, fraction F
 <sub>3</sub> displayed the lowest reducing power activity with an IC
 <sub>0.5</sub> value of 2.151 ± 0.372 mg/mL while fraction F
 <sub>4</sub> exhibited the highest reducing power activity with an IC
 <sub>0.5</sub> value of 0.518 ± 0.044 mg/mL. Therefore, fraction F
 <sub>4</sub> exhibited the highest antioxidant activity in the DPPH free radical scavenging assay and reducing power assay. According to a literature survey, the biological activities of raucaffricine and 
 <italic>N</italic>-methylsarpagine, which were isolated from fractions F
 <sub>3</sub> and F
 <sub>4</sub>, respectively, have never been evaluated. In our study the antioxidant activities of raucaffricine and 
 <italic>N</italic>-methylsarpagine could not be tested due to insufficient amounts of material after chemical analysis. However, spegatrine (
 <bold>4</bold>), the main constituent of fraction F
 <sub>5</sub>, exhibited antioxidant activity; this is the first time that this activity is being reported for spegatrine. Lupeol (
 <bold>1</bold>), the main constituent of fraction F
 <sub>1</sub>, is a known anti-oxidant [
