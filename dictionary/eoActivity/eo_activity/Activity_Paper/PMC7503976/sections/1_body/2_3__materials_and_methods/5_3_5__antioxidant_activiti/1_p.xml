<p>The crude extract, fractions and pure compounds were evaluated for antioxidant activity. Initially, the crude extract and fractions were tested. Then the compounds isolated from the fractions were tested. The highest IC
 <sub>50</sub> or IC
 <sub>0.5</sub> values indicate the lowest antioxidant activity while the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> or IC
 <sub>0.5</sub> values imply the highest antioxidant activity.
