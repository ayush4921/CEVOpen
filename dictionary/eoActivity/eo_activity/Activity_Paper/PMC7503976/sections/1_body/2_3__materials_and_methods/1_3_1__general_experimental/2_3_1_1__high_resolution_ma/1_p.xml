<p>A Waters Synapt G2 Quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (MS) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) connected to a Waters Acquity ultra-performance liquid chromatograph (UPLC) (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was used for direct injection high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis. One µL of sample was injected into a stream of 60% acetonitrile and 40% dilute (0.1%) aqueous formic acid. This conveyed the sample directly to the QTOF mass spectrometer where data were acquired using both positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The following MS settings were used: cone voltage of 15 V, desolvation temperature of 275 °C, desolvation gas at 650 L/h, and the rest of the MS settings optimized for best resolution and sensitivity.</p>
