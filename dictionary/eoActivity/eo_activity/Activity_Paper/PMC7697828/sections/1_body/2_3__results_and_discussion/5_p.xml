<p>The results of our work indicate on the domination of sabinene in common oregano essential oil. This compound represents monoterpene hydrocarbons fraction. Its content was at the similar level during plant’s vegetation: 27.16% at the beginning of blooming, 27.60% at the full blooming and 26.42%—at the beginning of seed-setting. Sabinene was accompanied by other monoterpenes present in amounts not exceeding 10%, i.a.: 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, 1.8 cyneol, linalool, terpinolene, etc. Interestingly, there was also a high content of phenolic monoterpenes (carvacrol and thymol) in analyzed common oregano samples (up to 15.89 and 3.57%, respectively). Besides monoterpens, the sesquiterpenes fraction was found in considerable amounts, with β-caryophyllene and its oxide as dominants (

Sabinyl chemotypes are regarded to be the most frequent within common oregano subspecies, while the occurrence of phenolic monoterpenes is rather rare [

 <xref rid="B16-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Based on the literature data, it seems that common oregano is more polymorphic than Greek oregano, since a lot of different chemotypes have been distinguished, as following: 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene + β-caryophyllene, germacrene D + β-caryophyllene, sabinene, cis-sabinene hydrate, terpinen 4-ol, etc. [

 <xref rid="B64-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. According to European Pharmacopeia 9th, the sum of thymol and carvacrol in Greek oregano should not be lower than 60% [

Obtained results indicate that investigated Greek oregano accession doesn’t meet EP requirements. However, acyclic (e.g., rich in linalool) or sesquiterpenes (e.g., rich in β-caryophyllene) as well as sabinyl chemotypes can be valuable from practical point of view, as well. For instance, due to pleasant floral aroma of linalool, chemotypes rich in this constituent (occurring in common oregano) may be used in cosmetic and perfumery industry [
