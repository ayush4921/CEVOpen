<p id="p0075">The rationale for the selection of microorganisms was the use of bacteria responsible for food poisoning and pathological effects. The bacteria were acquired from the Microbiology Unit of the Botany Department of the University of Fort Hare, South Africa. Strains from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were used. Four Gram-positive bacteria: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 18824), 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> (ATCC 19615), 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (ATCC 6633), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> (ATCC 10702) and four Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 19582), 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (ATCC 4352), 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> (ATCC 14033), 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (ATCC 13311) were used to determine the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>T.Â trifidum</italic> extracts.
