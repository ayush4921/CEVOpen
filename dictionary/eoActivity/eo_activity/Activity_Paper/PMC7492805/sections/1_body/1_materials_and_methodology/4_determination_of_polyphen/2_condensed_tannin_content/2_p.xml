<p id="p0040">The condensed tannin content was determined following the procedure by 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Hanen et al. (2009)</xref>. Briefly, the reaction mixture contained 0.5 mL (1 mg/mL) of the extract plus 3 mL of vanillin-methanol (4 % w/v) and 1.5 mL of hydrochloric acid. The standard catechin (0.02–1 mg/mL) reaction mixture was also prepared in the same way. The reaction mixtures were then vortexed and left to stand at room temperature for 15 min. The absorbance of the reaction mixtures was then measured at 500 nm using a UV-3000 PC spectrophotometer (J.P. Selecta, Spain). Condensed tannin content was determined by the calibration curve equation: y = 0.8462x + 0.244, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.998 and expressed as milligram of catechin equivalent (mg CE/g) using the equation:
 <disp-formula id="ufd1">C = c × V/m</disp-formula>Where C = total condensed tannin constituent in mg as CE/g extract, c = catechin concentration in mg/mL derived from the calibration curve, V = volume of the extract in the reaction solution in mL, and m = weight of the extract used in the assay in g.
