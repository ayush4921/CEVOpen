<p id="p0070">The TAC of the plant extracts was determined using the phosphomolybdenum assay as described by 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Ohikhena et al. (2018)</xref>. Briefly, 0.3 mL of the extracts and standards (0.025–0.4 mg/mL) were pipetted into test tubes and combined with 3 mL of the reaction mixture (0.6 M sulphuric acid, 4 mM ammonium molybdate and 28 mM sodium phosphate). The test tubes were then capped and incubated at 95 °C in a water bath for 95 min. Then the solution mixture was left to cool and the absorbance was read at 695 nm. As a control, a mixture consisting of distilled water was used instead of the extract/standard. The percentage of inhibition was determined using the following equation:
 <disp-formula id="ufd4">% Inhibition = [(Absorbance of sample − Absorbance of control)/(Absorbance of the sample)] × 100</disp-formula>
