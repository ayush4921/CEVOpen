<p>Akhtar N et al. reported that Charantin, vicine and polypeptide-p contained in ethanolic extract of MC fresh green whole fruit acted as insulin-like protein, decrease blood glucose level, stimulated insulin secretion, tissue glucose uptake, decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis, stimulated glucose uptake and utilization, inhibited absorption of glucose in the intestine in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits by 200 mg/kg b.w dose [

 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside) showed that this compound could enhance the uptake of glucose by evaluation of insulin secretion activity [

According to Singh N et al., alcoholic extract of the whole fruit which was orally administered in adult alloxan-induced diabetic albino rats can recover β-cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas by 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg doses of the extract [

In the acetone extract of this fruit power, the ability of recovery of beta cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas was confirmed when applied to alloxan diabetic albino rats by 25 mg, 50 mg and 75 mg doses of extract in 8 to 30 days treatment [

An investigation on the antidiabetic activities of MC fruit juice in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats showed that this herb possesses the ability to enhance insulin secretion of pancreatic β-cells, elevate of serum insulin level, improve β-cell function, decrease insulin resistance, increase glucose utilization in a dose of 10 mL/kg/day for 14 days [

 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> can be able to renew or recover the partially destroyed cells and encourage the secretion of insulin.
