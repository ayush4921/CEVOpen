<p>Until now, various investigations have been carried on an insulin plant to determine anti-diabetic activity [
 <xref rid="B143-biology-09-00252" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. The in vitro study was undertaken to investigate the effects of the 
 <italic>C. pictus</italic>. The result of that investigation showed that the significant mechanism of antidiabetic activity of 
 <italic>Costus pictus</italic> is the α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. In other research, the ethanolic and methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>C. pictus</italic> which have been administrated orally to streptozotocin and alloxan-induced rats have shown a significant reduction in the blood sugar level, and also could increase insulin level [

The other study also reported that antidiabetic property on streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and in vitro pancreatic islet culture of 
 <italic>C. pictus</italic>. Inhibition of carbohydrates hydrolysing enzymes activity like α-amylase and α-glucosidase also gave good results [

 <italic>C. pistus</italic> leaf to determine antihyperglycemic activity and insulin secretion in diabetic rats. Their results suggested that insulin plant could lower glucose concentration, increase insulin secretion, and also enhance glucose utilization [

 <italic>Costus pictus</italic> extracts could stimulate insulin secretion from β-cells of islets of Langerhans [
