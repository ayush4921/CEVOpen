<p>Salivary or pancreatic alpha-amylase is an enzyme that catalyzes to hydrolyze α-bonds of large, α-linked polysaccharides, such as starch in plants and glycogen in animals and humans, to create monosaccharide as glucose. α-glucosidase is an enzyme located in the small intestine that hydrolyses terminal non-reducing (1→4)-linked α-glucose residues to release a single α-glucose molecule. α-amylase and α-glucosidase are important digestive enzymes affecting blood glucose concentration, especially with patients in diabetes mellitus. The action of these enzymes increases glucose concentration causing hyperlycemic status related to diabetes mellitus. So, the inhibition of the action of these enzymes is one of the most important keys in diabetes treatment [
