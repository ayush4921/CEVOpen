<p id="Par36">Fifth, we saw above the EMA position that GCP issues, even those that do not affect the benefit-risk balance so long as these issues raise “serious questions about the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects” should have an “impact on the final conclusions about approvability of an application” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In our study, we found that this is not (yet) the case. Unfortunately, we found no EMA document that elaborates on how ethical issues should affect application evaluation processes and no other publication to our knowledge engaged these issues, except ours. In an earlier publication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], we proposed a 4-step procedure in evaluating ERFs, with sanctions depending on the evaluation of the gravity and magnitude of the ERF. However, it still remains to be seen how ERFs that do not affect the risk–benefit balance of an application such as the ones we dealt with in this manuscript should be evaluated by assessors and how such an assessment should impact the assessment process. This is work for future research.
