<p>Until recently, chloroquine was the first-line drug for treating and preventing malaria in Ghana and many other countries. However, there is widespread of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in circulation that is resistant to chloroquine and other drugs such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and proguanil [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] has resulted in a change from chloroquine to artemisinin-based combination therapies such as Coaterm, but these are very expensive and, hence, not readily accessible to most of the rural folks. This, coupled with a lack of an efficacious malaria vaccine, has necessitated the search for novel, well-tolerated, newer, cheaper, accessible, more efficient, and safer antimalarial drugs [
