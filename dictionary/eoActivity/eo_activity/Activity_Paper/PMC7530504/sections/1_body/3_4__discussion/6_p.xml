<p>Assessment of the extracts by the comet assay to evaluate their genotoxic effects suggested that the plants act via damaging parasite DNA. This is akin to the mechanism by which chloroquine inhibits parasite growth [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although the selective indices of these plants are not as high as values reported earlier for chloroquine. This is not surprising because whereas chloroquine is a pure substance, the plant materials used are total extracts, which included phytoconstituents that may not have antiplasmodial activity. The genotoxic effects observed are in line with an earlier report that 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> is toxic in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which extends to its antimalarial or antimicrobial activity as per these and other findings [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].
