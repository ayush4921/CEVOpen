<p>The percentage growth inhibition of ring and schizont developmental stages of 3D7 strain of the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite with time is represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The percentage growth inhibition of ring developmental stage by the 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC extract increased gradually from the 6
 <sup>th</sup> (21.41%) to the 48
 <sup>th</sup> hour (63.88%) when the assay was terminated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(c)</xref>). Growth inhibition leveled off from 18 hours to 24 hours, followed by an increase to 67.47% at 36 hours. It, then, dropped sharply to 52.12% at 48 hours. There was no significant difference between the growth inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> (De Wild) and 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam extracts on the rings and schizont developmental stages of the malaria parasites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). With the chloroquine-resistant strains (Dd2), growth inhibition by 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> (De Wild), 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam, and 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC extracts increased with time (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref>). The increase in growth inhibition for the developmental stages was from the 6
 <sup>th</sup> to the 36
 <sup>th</sup> hour. Growth inhibition, then, dropped from 44.11% to 41.13% for 
 <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam extracts and from 58.71% to 45.57% for 
 <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC. There was, however, a gradual increase of growth inhibition for the 
 <italic>A. boonei</italic> (De Wild) extract from the 36
 <sup>th</sup> to the 48
 <sup>th</sup> hour when the assay was terminated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).
