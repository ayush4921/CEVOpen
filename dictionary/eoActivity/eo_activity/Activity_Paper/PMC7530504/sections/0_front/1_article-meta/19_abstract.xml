  <p> Five out of the eight plants, 
   <italic>A. boonei</italic> stem bark, 
   <italic>S; siamea</italic> Lam root, 
   <italic>M. lucida Benth</italic> leaves, 
   <italic>P. niruri,</italic> and 
   <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC whole plants, showed varying degrees of antiplasmodial activity against the asexual stage of the parasite. The most active extract against chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) and chloroquine-resistant (Dd2) 
   <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains is the 
   <italic>A. hispidum</italic> extract which yielded a mean inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) of 3.66 
   <italic>µ</italic>g/ml and 3.71 
   <italic>µ</italic>g/ml for 3D7 and Dd2, respectively. This was followed by 
   <italic>S. siamea</italic> Lam with 3.95 
   <italic>µ</italic>g/ml for 3D7 and 4.47 
   <italic>µ</italic>g/ml for Dd2. The IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of the 
   <italic>A. boonei</italic> extract against 3D7 and Dd2 
   <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites were 5.13 
   <italic>µ</italic>g/ml and 3.62 
   <italic>µ</italic>g/ml, respectively. For the 
   <italic>M. lucida Benth</italic> extract, the least IC
   <sub>50</sub> value was 6.46 
   <italic>µ</italic>g/ml. All five extracts exhibited dose-dependent antiplasmodial activity. Assessment of the genotoxic effects the 
   <italic>A. hispidum</italic> extract by the comet assay revealed substantial damage to 
   <italic>P. falciparum</italic> DNA.

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p> This study demonstrates that the crude extract of 
   <italic>A. hispidum</italic> DC, one of the plants used traditionally to treat malaria, inhibits the growth of P. falciparum 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and could be a potential source of antimalarial drug. The report has highlighted genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of the selected plant extracts on human leukocytes as well.
