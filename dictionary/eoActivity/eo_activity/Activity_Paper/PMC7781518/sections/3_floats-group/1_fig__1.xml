  <p>Summary of onset of major events associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. After contamination by SARS-CoV-2, the virus starts a race for cells that express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 of the surface receptors (ACE2) and TMPRSS2. After the virus enters the host cell, the process of viral replication and release of viral proteins begins, causing the host cell to undergo pyroptosis, releasing damage as associated molecular patterns, including ATP, nucleic acids, and ASC oligomers.</p>
