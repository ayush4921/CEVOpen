 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Galanakis, 2018</xref>). Technologies such as electro-osmotic dehydration, high hydrostatic pressure, ultrasound-assisted extraction, supercritical fluid technology, and pulsed electric field, among countless others have been applied in the extraction of polyphenols, polysaccharides and various molecules of high commercial value (
 <xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Zinoviadou et al., 2015</xref>). The technologies for extracting added value compounds are one of the most relevant steps in the process of prospecting molecules, so it is important that the reader is up to date with the new trends on this subject. As a result, the following articles are suggested for more information (
