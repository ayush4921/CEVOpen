<p id="p0230">Another edible and medicinal fungus, 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> has polysaccharides that modulate the immune response. 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Li, Gu, et al. (2020)</xref> showed the effects of the structure-bioactivity relationship of two purified and characterized fractions of 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> polysaccharides. Applying modern purification techniques and molecular characterization, the authors conclude that the GLP-1 fraction is a 
 <sc>d</sc>-galactoglucan (composed of →6)-β-
 <italic>d</italic>-Glcp-(1→, →6)-α-
 <italic>d</italic>-Galp-(1→, and →3)-β-
 <italic>d</italic>-Glcp-(1→ residues), while the GLP-2 fraction is a β-D-glucan (→6)-β-
 <italic>d</italic>-Glcp-(1→ and →3)-β-
 <italic>d</italic>-Glcp-(1→ residues). The authors showed that the GLP-1 fraction produced a better immune response, protecting the spleen and the tino, in addition to promoting the production of immunoglobulin A (IgA). 
 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr">Zheng, Gu, et al. (2020)</xref> also obtained several polysaccharide fractions from the edible mushroom 
 <italic>Leccinum crocipodium</italic> (Letellier.) and assess the immunomodulatory potential. Three fractions of different molecular weight and degree of homogeneity were obtained, purified, and characterized. Cell viability studies show that these biopolymers improve immunomodulatory activities in macrophage RAW 264.7 cells.
