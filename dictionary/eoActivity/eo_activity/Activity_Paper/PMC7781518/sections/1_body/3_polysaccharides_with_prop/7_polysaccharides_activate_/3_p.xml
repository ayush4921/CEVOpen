<p id="p0260">Inflammatory processes can start in many ways, however the endotoxin-mediated pathway (LPS) is the, but well elucidated. This is a molecule composed of two highly complex parts, one of lipid and the other of carbohydrate, a type of glucan. Endotoxin (LPS) molecules are present on the outer membrane of cells and are responsible for strong immune system responses in healthy organisms. Cells such as macrophages, B lymphocytes, monocytes and dendritic cells, when they come into contact with an LPS, either by binding to the TLR4 receptor, or other, promote an inflammatory response such as fever, vasodilation due to the production of nitric oxide and secretion of eicosanoids (prostanoids, leukotrienes and lipoxins). Defense cells like macrophages are the most active in the immune system, although we have other defense cells, macrophages are usually cells, but agile when stimulated (

Therefore, considering macrophages as a study model, we can evaluate how the cycle of stimuli and responses that induces the defense system to produce an inflammatory response. Next, we will evaluate how polysaccharides manage to modulate an immunosuppressive response, controlling the flow of pro-inflammatory substances production and regulating the ways of maintaining the oxide-reducing balance.
