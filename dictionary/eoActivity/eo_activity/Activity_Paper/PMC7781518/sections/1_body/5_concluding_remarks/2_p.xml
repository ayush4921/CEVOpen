<p id="p0310">Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus originating in China is a serious disease, with a high rate of transmissibility and mortality. In a short time, the disease spread across the world through infected people, thus increasing the spread of the disease. The disease has caused major changes in the world's routine, isolating people in their homes, destabilizing the world economy, and increasing mortality rates worldwide. Also, serious problems with the collapse of hospital networks and the economy in different countries have increased social insecurity and contributed to the reduction of people's physical and mental health. The disease, although known in several aspects about its immunopathogenesis, biology, and forms of transmission, is not yet fully understood as to the conditions under which the virus subverts the immune response.</p>
