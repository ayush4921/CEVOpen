<p id="p0125">In a recent report, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa, dos Santos Freitas, da Silva Martins &amp; de Carvalho Junior (2020)</xref> show that edible mushrooms of the genus 
 <italic>Pleurotus spp</italic>, have a diversity of polysaccharides, in particular heteropolysaccharides and glucans. These biopolymers have significant differences in monosaccharide composition, molecular weight distribution, structural conformation, and types of chemical bonds. Also, it has been shown that polysaccharides from mushrooms of the genus 
 <italic>Pleurotus spp</italic> have important biological activities such as antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiviral, antimicrobial and antidiabetic activities. Finally, it was shown that polysaccharides, due to their biological potential, are being used in the development of new technologies such as the production of selenized polysaccharides and vaccines.
