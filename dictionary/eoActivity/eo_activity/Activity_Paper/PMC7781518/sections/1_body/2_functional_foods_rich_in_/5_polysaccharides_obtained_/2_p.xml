<p id="p0160">Fruits are one of the most consumed foods in the world and can be consumed in many ways, 
 <italic>in natura</italic>, dehydrated, in jams, juices, sweets, cakes, cookies, and many others. Currently, more than 53 fruits have been characterized for the presence of polysaccharides, as shown in an updated report produced by 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Mohan et al. (2020)</xref>. In the same study, the authors updated readers on the main techniques for extracting and characterizing polysaccharides from tropic and subtropical fruits. The authors showed that fruit polysaccharides have relevant biological activities such as antioxidants, immunomodulatory, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-tumor, anti-glycation, hepatoprotective effects, anti-inflammatory effects, and anti-microbial activities.
