<p id="p0185">With the purpose of order to fill in the gaps on the use of algae for the production of polysaccharides and the relationship with the digestive tract, microbial catabolism, and prebiotic potential, 
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Zheng, Chen, and Cheong (2020)</xref>, summarize the latest findings in the literature. The authors show that seaweed contains unique polysaccharides, with totally different structural properties when compared to terrestrial plant polysaccharides. Seaweed polysaccharides are not digestible by digestive enzymes in humans. However, when these biopolymers reach the gastric and intestinal systems, they can selectively increase the activities of some populations of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal flora. Also, they stimulate the organism with a series of biological activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antidiabetic.
