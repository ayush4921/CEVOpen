<p id="p0195">Cereal grains and pseudocereals have attractive nutritional properties, mainly due to the presence of biopolymers such as starch, dietary fiber and polysaccharide complex linked with polyphenol molecules. Although cereal grains such as rice, barley and sorghum have highly branched and nutritionally relevant starch polysaccharides, these biopolymers are poorly active in improving immunity, since most of them are consumed by the body and used in energy production (

 <italic>F. tataricum</italic>) and quinoa (

 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Jimenez et al., 2019</xref>). Pseudocereals are but interesting for obtaining polysaccharides when compared to cereal grains, mainly due to the vast chains of polysaccharide complexes with biomolecules, metal ions and polyphenols. Although both types of grains are nutritionally important, we will look at the intrinsic properties of polysaccharides and their relationship to increased immunity.
