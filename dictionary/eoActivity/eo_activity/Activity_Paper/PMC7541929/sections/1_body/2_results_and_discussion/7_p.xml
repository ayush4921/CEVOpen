<p>The antifungal activities of the extracts for dry 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> seed revealed that 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> was more susceptible to the seed oil compared to non-oil extract with observed zones of inhibition ranging from 4 mm to 20 mm for seed oil extract at different concentrations while non-oil extract recorded 1 mm and 2 mm at 100 and 200 Î¼g/mL, respectively (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). However, 
 <italic>A. niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Penicillum</italic> sp. were not susceptible to seed oil at all concentrations studied. The bioactivity of the seed oil against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is important due to the disease-causing potential of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Previous studies of the authors have also shown good susceptibility of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> to some citrus fruit concentrates (Oikeh et al., 2015). Citrus fruits may hold promise as a starting material for the discovery of new anti-Candidiasis agents.
