 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the inhibitory and fungicidal concentrations of oil and non-oil extracts for dry 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> seed against some fungi. MIC values ranged from 50 to 100 μg/mL, while MFC values ranged from 100 to 200 μg/ mL for both extracts studied against the different fungal strains. The seed oil was more effective in inhibiting the growth of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> with MIC and MFC values of 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively, compared to 100 μg/mL and 200 μg/mL observed for the non-oil extract. This result suggests that 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> oil extract is a better fungicidal agent against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> compared to the non-oil extract. MIC and MFC values for the non-oil extract against 
 <italic>A. niger and Penicillum</italic> sp. were both 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively. MIC and MFC values could not be obtained for the 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> seed oil as these fungal species were not susceptible to the oil.
