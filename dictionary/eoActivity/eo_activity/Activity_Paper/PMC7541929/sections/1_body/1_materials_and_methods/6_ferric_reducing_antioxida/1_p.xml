 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">The Benzie and Strain (1996)</xref> protocol with slight modification was employed for this assay. Different concentrations (100∼500 mg/mL) of the concentrates and the standard were serially diluted with distilled water. Then 1 mL of FRAP reagent [200 mL of 300 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 3.6, 20 mL of 10.0 mM 2,4,6-tripyridyl-
 <italic>S</italic>-triazine (TPTZ) solution, 20 mL of 20.0 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>･6H
 <sub>2</sub>O solution and 24 mL of distilled water] was added to each test tube. The resulting mixture was vigorously shaken and then incubated at 37°C for 4 min. The increase in absorbance at 593 nm was measured and compared with the standard ascorbic acid.
