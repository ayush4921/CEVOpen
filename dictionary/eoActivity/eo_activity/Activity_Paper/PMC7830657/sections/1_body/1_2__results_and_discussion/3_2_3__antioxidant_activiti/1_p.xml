<p>The DPPH free radical method was used to measure the antiradical power of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts in a recent study [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00164-f002">Figure 2</xref> showed the abilities of different fractions of 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> to reduce DPPH radicals. Compared with the standard, Fraction III showed similar antioxidant effect, followed by Fractions V and IV, while Fractions I and II exhibited relatively weak antioxidant effects compared with other fractions. All fractions in this study showed antioxidant effects, although the antioxidant strength varied as different phenolics compounds have different redox properties, which make them reducing agents, hydrogen donors, and singlet oxygen quenchers. Since one major component of Fraction III was quercetin, which was also used as standard in this study, it had very similar antioxidant effect as the standard (

 <xref rid="plants-10-00164-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In addition, based on previous research, the efficiency of phenolic compounds as anti-radicals and antioxidants depends on many factors. One major factor is the number of hydroxyl groups directly bonded to the aromatic rings [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This structure is related to the stability of the hydroxyl radical formed after phenolics donate their hydrogen atoms to the radical. In this study, gallic acid was found in both Fractions IV and V. The three phenolic hydroxyl group of gallic acid made it the second strongest antioxidant among all the phenolic compounds identified in this study. As a result, Fractions IV and V also showed relatively strong antioxidant effects in this study. In contrast, all phenolic compounds found in Fractions I and II only had two or less hydroxyl groups connected to their aromatic rings, which led to the low antioxidant effects of these two fractions. However, based on previous study [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], different solvent used in plant extract would also impact the DPPH results, which is consistent with the result shown in this research. From the DPPH results, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were obtained as 12.0 μg/mL for standard, 38.2 μg/mL for Fraction I, 36.3 μg/mL for Fraction II, 13.6 μg/mL for Fraction III, 18.5 μg/mL for Fraction IV and 15.0 μg/mL for Fraction V. Further, Younsi et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 100 μg/mL for methanolic 
 <italic>A. herba-alba</italic> extracts, whereas the antioxidant effects of our extracts were higher demonstrating the superiority of the Soxhlet apparatus-based extraction method employed in our study. It must also be mentioned that DPPH inherently is a limited test on antioxidant activity, and at least one more method for measuring antioxidant efficacy is necessary.
