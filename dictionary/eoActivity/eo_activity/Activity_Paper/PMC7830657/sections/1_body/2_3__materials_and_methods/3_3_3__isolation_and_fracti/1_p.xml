<p>Column chromatography (CC) was performed for isolation and fractionation of 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> extract. Chromatography column was packaged using silica gel (300 g, Sigma Aldrich, Baghdad, Iraq) (60â€“120) as an adsorbent using wet packaging technique. Using a colourless liquid (hexane), slurry was prepared and poured into the column. After mixing them homogeneously with a small amount of silica gel over the top of the column, the extract was added. For column elution systems, different solvent mixtures were used as mobile phase including hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol. For the identification of fractions that contain 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic>, collected fractions following purification of the CC were finally examined with thin layer chromatography (TLC). Collected fractions were condensed and only ethyl acetate and ethanol fractions were subsequently identified by TLC because the hexane fraction was very hard to separate and came up as crude sample.
