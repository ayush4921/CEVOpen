<p>Firstly, 5 g of crushed plant powder/paste was processed/extracted using Soxhlet apparatus successively with different conventional organic solvents (100 mL), namely hexane, ethyl acetate and ethanol, in order of increasing polarity. The extraction process was carried out at constant temperature of 60 °C for 72 h at water bath, and was repeated thrice for each solvent. A rotary evaporator was used to evaporate the crude plant extract. Once the organic solvent evaporated, the extract was filtered with a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter to remove undesired materials. All extracts were weighed and stored in sterile dark airtight containers for further analysis, as phenolics are prone to photodegradation [
