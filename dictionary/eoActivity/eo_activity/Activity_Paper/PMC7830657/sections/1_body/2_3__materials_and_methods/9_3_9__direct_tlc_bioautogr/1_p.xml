 <italic>S. aureus</italic>,

 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Plates were dried overnight (to evaporate excess solvents) and then sterilized under UV light for 15 min under laminar flow. 100 μL standardized bacterial suspension was pipetted onto the plate surface and spread evenly with an L-shaped glass rod, followed by a careful placement of the TLC plates inside a square plastic box and incubation at 30 °C for 24 h. Next, the plates were inoculated with bacterial suspension sprayed with 5% 2,3,5-Triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) aqueous solution that stained the TLC plate background with viable bacteria cell when left for 4 h under laminar flow. The inhibition zones, detected as a white background, was represented by individual retardation factors (R
