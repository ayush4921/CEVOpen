<p>DPPH (2,2-diphenyl 1-picryl hydrazyl), a well-established organic chemical for the analysis of free radical scavenging capacity was used as previously described by Amiri et al. [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00164" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with slight modifications. The radical scavenging activity was carried out using free-radical DPPH assay using the spectrophotometric approach. The fractions are prepared in different concentrations (10, 20, 40, 80, 160) μg/mL and then dissolved in 1 mL of ethanol and 20 mg of DPPH dissolved in 100 mL ethanol was added. The mixture was shaken, and then left for 30 min at RT under dark conditions. For control, DPPH solution was taken, whereas for reference standard ascorbic acid (water-soluble vitamin) was employed. The antioxidant activity was then calculated using the UV-Visible spectrophotometer at 517 nm. Radical scavenging activity was calculated by the following relationship:
 <disp-formula>DPPH Inhibition % = [(A
  <sub>o</sub> − A
  <sub>1</sub>)/A
  <sub>o</sub>] × 100
 </disp-formula> where A
 <sub>o</sub> is the control test absorbance after 30 min and A
 <sub>1</sub> is the sample extract absorption after 30 min.
