<p>The bacterial strains were grown/cultured onto the nutrient agar (NA) favourable for their growth (Mueller-Hinton broth) at 37 Â°C for 24 h. Following incubation, they were sub-cultured before any antimicrobial test. To prepare inoculums, bacteria were suspended in a sterile saline solution (0.85% NaCl). The optical density (OD) of the suspensions were adjusted/maintained from 0.4 to 0.6 at 405 nm, which corresponds to a cell density close to that of 0.5 McFarland, matching to an inoculum estimated at 10
