<p id="p0095">Herbal drugs is viewed as the safest and innocuous therapeutic system, however, recent side effects reported from the use of herbs has significantly disrupted its safety or efficacy claims and also, most herbal plants are not well cited nor documented [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The toxicological appraisal of herbal drugs will facilitates and justifies its authenticity and safety. However, few toxicological reports on 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> applications of different parts of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> raise questions on the usage of the plant parts. However, the toxicological and immune-stimulatory effect of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> was appraised on Swiss mice by critical assessment of serum biochemistry and haematology of the test organisms. The assessment was based on discrepancy in mean corpuscular volume, packed cell volume and white blood cell whereas albumin, creatinine, total protein and serum bilirubin levels were assessed on the kidney and liver. The extracts significantly increase the lymphocyte counts (4.6 – 8.6 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/mm
 <sup>3</sup>), however, 4.3 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/mm
 <sup>3</sup> increment was observed in the control mice at P &lt; 0.05. The extracts exhibited significant reduction in protein level of 3.3–3.8 g/dl and insignificant immune-stimulatory effect was exhibited on the haematology [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Phytochemical appraisals of different parts of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> revealed the presence of important metabolites such as saponins, cardiac glycosides, phenolics, terpenoids, flavonoids, phenolics, 1, 8-cineole, linalool, and mentol. These metabolites at high levels could cause contact dermatitis, diarrhoea, cyanosis, nausea, dizziness and erythema multiforme [

 <italic>S. media</italic> are presumed to cause vertigo, weakness, headache, difficulty in breathing, cutaneous staining on fingers or lips and gestational pain [
