<p id="p0065">The scavenging potential of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> is appraised using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferrulic reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP). The scavenging activity of apigenin glycosides in aqueous extract of 
 <italic>S. media</italic> leaf is appraised on human skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts after ultra violet irradiation via DPPH assay. The extract displayed significant inhibitory activity of 62.75 g/mL against xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. The activity is linked to the decrease in the production of intracellular ROS exhibited by the flavonoid-rich extract [

 <italic>S. media</italic> is appraised in Sprague-Dawley rats (25 mg/kg/bw/day) for their potential in ameliorating spermatogenesis impairment and vital organ damage stimulated by Dichlorvos. The leaf extract significantly ameliorate epididymal (29.91%), liver (20.16%), body (10.73%) and testes (32.21%) weight which causes severe mutilation to reproductive organs and liver hepatocytes [

 <italic>S. media</italic> revealed the presence of tannins, phlobatannins and flavonoid. The crude extract exhibited strong free radical scavenging activity of 76% and 79% via DPPH and FRAP respectively [
