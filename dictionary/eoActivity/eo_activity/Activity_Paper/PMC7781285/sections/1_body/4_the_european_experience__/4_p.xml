<p>CAT decides whether a product is an ATMP and then registers it in the related category (gene therapy drug, somatic therapy, tissue engineered product or combination of categories). Furthermore, since the classification of these products often depend on technical details; CAT makes scientific recommendations as to whether the products fall within the definition of advanced therapies. However, member states do not have to abide by these recommendations at EU level, therefore, each state applies a different legal framework for similar products. Laboratories developing ATMPs often complain about these classifications, where they often have to stop applying standard therapy protocols. It is therefore clear that obtaining a license from EMA, to produce ATMPs was a prerequisite for the export of ATMPs from one member state to another and for their off-the-shelf sale.</p>
