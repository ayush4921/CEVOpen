<p>In the absence of a clear legal framework, the first attempt to exploit ATMPs was carried out by the same bodies that developed them. The research laboratories, in the context of an applied service, received cells or tissues from the patient himself or from a relative donor (at the request of the treating physician) and after processing them, were sent to the treating physician in order to be administered to the patients. These were personalized treatments, prepared for a particular patient. Then an attempt was made to systematize ATMP production from academic research centers through spin-off companies and biotech small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
