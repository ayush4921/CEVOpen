<p>The studied plant, 
 <italic>Brassica carinata</italic> (locally called “Gomenzer”), is an erect, annual herb growing from 30–200 cm tall.
 <xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It originated through hybridization between 
 <italic>Brassica nigra</italic> and 
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> in the highlands of Ethiopia.
 <xref rid="cit0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Traditionally, 
 <italic>B. carinata</italic> seeds were widely used to treat wounds in different parts of Ethiopia.
 <xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Discovery of new treatment options for wound management is highly encouraged with the aim to promote wound healing in the shortest time possible with minimal pain, discomfort, and scarring to the patient. Hence, this study evaluated the in vitro anti-oxidant and the in vivo wound healing activities of 80% methanol crude extract and solvent fractions of 
 <italic>B. carinata</italic> seeds in mice.
