<p>The breaking strength of the wound on each animal was measured by using a constant water flow method. In this method, the animals were first anesthetized in the same manner described above and positioned on a table between two metal stands. To both stands, allice forceps of equal size were suspended with strings, one of which passed on a small wheel with the stands. One of the forceps served as a support and the other forceps holed a plastic of volume 1,000 mL (plastic bottle). Then, both forceps were allowed to grip the edges of the wound 3 mm away on both sides. After this, constant water flow was allowed to enter the plastic bottle which was suspended with the string that passed on the wheel until the wound opened up (broken). The flowing water was stopped immediately as the wound breaks in each mouse. Then the volume of the water in the plastic bottle was measured by using a measuring cylinder which was taken as the wound breaking strength for the individual mouse (in grams, since the density of water=1 gm/mL). Percent tensile strength was calculated as follows.
