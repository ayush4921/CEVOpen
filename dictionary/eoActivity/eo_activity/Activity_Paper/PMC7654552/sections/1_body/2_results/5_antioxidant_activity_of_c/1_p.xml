  <p>The crude extract and solvent fractions of seeds of 
   <italic>B. carinata</italic> were tested for antioxidant activity using DPPH free radical assay. The DPPH free radical scavenging activities of the 
   <italic>B. carinata</italic> extracts were concentration dependent with an IC50 value of 3.45±0.12, 5.85±0.37, 10.54±0.57, and 15.64±0.42 mg/mL for the aqueous fraction, crude extract, ethyl acetate fraction, and the chloroform fraction, respectively. Higher free radical scavenging activity was observed in the aqueous fraction among other fractions (
