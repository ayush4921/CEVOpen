<p>On the other hand, significant wound closure of chloroform fraction was seen starting from the 8th day compared to negative control, which may account for the presence of non-polar substances such as fatty acids, as indicated in the oils of other mustard seeds. Chemical analysis of 
 <italic>Brassica juncea</italic> (L.) in the previous study demonstrated the presence of a significant amount of unsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid (18.2%), linoleic acid (16.9%), erucic acid (42.0%), eicosenoic acid (8.8%), and others, which all contribute to anti-oxidant and wound healing effects.

Hence, these chemicals may produce a combined effect of wound healing.
