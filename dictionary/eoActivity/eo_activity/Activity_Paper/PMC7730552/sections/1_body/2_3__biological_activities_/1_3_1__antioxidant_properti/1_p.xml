 <xref rid="molecules-25-05690-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> summarizes the antioxidant properties of Indian gamboge fruit extracts and garcinol that have been examined. The antioxidant activities of water, acetone, and methanol extracts and that of a chloroform fraction containing garcinol have been demonstrated using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity [

 <xref rid="B40-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] investigated the phytochemicals of Indian gamboge resin/latex and reported that it consisted of 204.27 mg/g of phenolics and 124.92 mg/g of flavonoids. The resin exhibited significant antioxidant activities, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 205.5 µg/mL with DPPH, 95.53 µg/mL with phosphomolybdate, and 308.1 µg/mL with hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays.
