<p>Xanthones are heterocyclic compounds having a dibenzo-Î³-pyrone skeleton as the basic structure. They constitute the primary compounds of lichens and have also been reported in microorganisms [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Xanthones are classified into the following five major groups: simple oxygenated xanthones, xanthone glycosides, prenylated and related xanthones, xanthonelignoids, and miscellaneous xanthones [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Xanthones have been abundantly reported in the angiosperm families, namely Gentianaceae, Clusiaceae, Moraceae, and Polygonaceae. More than 70 xanthones have been reported from 
 <italic>Garcinia</italic> species, especially from the mangosteen fruit [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The first xanthone isolated from Indian gamboge seeds was morellin (
 <bold>1</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Desoxymorellin (
 <bold>2</bold>), dihydromorellin (
 <bold>3</bold>), and isomorellin (
 <bold>7</bold>) were isolated from its seeds and resin previously [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Gambogic acid (
 <bold>5</bold>) was isolated from leaves and resin [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Later, morellinol (
 <bold>8</bold>) and moreollin (
 <bold>9</bold>) were isolated from the seeds of Indian gamboge [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, isomorellic acid (
 <bold>6</bold>) and morellic acid (
 <bold>4</bold>) were extracted from its resin [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, mangostin (
 <bold>10</bold>) was isolated from the leaves of Indian gamboge [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These compounds are detailed in
