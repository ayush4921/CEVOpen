<p>Historically, natural products were the source of virtually all medicinal preparations, such as TCMs. More recently, natural products or their derivatives have continued to enter clinical trials, accounting for 32% of new medicines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 1981 and 2014 [

Such extracts are complicated mixtures, and all the components may reach the biological target in the assay, bringing several technical problems, including (i) the concentrations of some components are too low to have measurable effects; (ii) interference or nuisance compounds may confound the signal from the assay; and (iii) the possibility of additive or synergistic effects of several compounds [
