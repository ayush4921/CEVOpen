<p>Since all ten hits showed dose-dependent inhibition to IAV replication (Figure S2), the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of each hit fraction was therefore calculated, as well as the CC
 <sub>50</sub>'s and selectivity index (SI) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All IC
 <sub>50</sub>'s of the hits ranges from 1.08 to 6.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Moreover, except ethyl acetate fraction of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhizic</italic>, of which the SI is lower (7.52), all SIs of the other nine hits exceed 10, suggesting high potency as antiviral actives.
