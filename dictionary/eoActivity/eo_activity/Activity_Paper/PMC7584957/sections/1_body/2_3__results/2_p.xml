<p>Previously, we generated a recombinant IAV expressing 
 <italic>Gaussia</italic> luciferase, based on which a phenotypic high-throughput screening approach was subsequently established, providing a powerful tool for antiviral discovery [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A phenotypic screening was therefore carried out against the prefractionated TCM library for anti-influenza actives. The practical screening procedure is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Primarily, the inhibitory potency of each TCM fraction at 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against IAV was determined. The Z′ value of each screening plate (ranges from 0.55 to 0.89) was evaluated as quality control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(a)</xref>). As a result, 47 samples showing &gt;80% inhibition were cherry-picked as primary hits and subjected to a second round of antiviral determination as well as cytotoxicity assay (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>). Among the 47 primary hits, 13 were excluded due to cytotoxicity, 24 were confirmed as inactives, and the 10 leftover hit fractions were shortlisted for dose-response analysis (
