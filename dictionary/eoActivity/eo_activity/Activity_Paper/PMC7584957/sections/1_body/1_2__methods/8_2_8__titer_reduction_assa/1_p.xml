<p>Titer reduction assay was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In brief, MDCK cells grown in 24-well plates were inoculated with the influenza PR8 virus at an MOI of 0.01. After 2-hour incubation at 37°C, inoculations were replaced by fresh Opti-MEM (1.5 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL of TPCK-trypsin) containing test extracts at 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL concentration. At 36-hour after infection (p.i.), the supernatants were removed for titration.
