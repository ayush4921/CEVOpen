  <p>The standard flowchart to extract a traditional Chinese medicinal plant. 100 dried plant materials were extracted, respectively, to obtain various solvent fractions following the method described as mentioned earlier. For each plant medicine, powdered air-dried material (200 g) was extracted with 1000 mL cyclohexane, and the leftover marc was then extracted successively with dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, 
   <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and distilled water by turning the maceration under reflux to obtain the respective fractions. 500 prefractioned extracts were obtained after evaporated in a rotary vacuum evaporator at 40°C to a constant weight of dry extract.
