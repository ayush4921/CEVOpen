<p>It is universally agreed before any novel bioactive compound considered a lead for developing an active principle of any preventive or therapeutic usefulness, it is essential to conduct exhaustive animal and pre-clinical studies. Therefore, pharmacokinetic evaluations of CH extractsâ€™ active phytochemicals should be studied in animal models including, blood samples for absorption studies, tissues such as intestine, liver, lungs, kidney and heart distribution studies and urine and excreta collection for excretion studies. After sample preparation, extraction of bioactive markers and assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters as listed below should be carried out [
