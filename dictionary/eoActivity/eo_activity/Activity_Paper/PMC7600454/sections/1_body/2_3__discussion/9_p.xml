<p>Although both CHP and CHL were similarly effective in reducing ROS accumulation, they exerted neuronal cell protection against cell cycle arrest induced by high glucose through different signaling pathways. We observed that CHP significantly decreased only cyclin D1 expression in extract-treated groups, while CHL significantly decreased both pRb and pcdc2 expression. However, taken together, our results showed that both CHP and CHL could provide neuronal cell protection against cell cycle arrest induced by high glucose.</p>
