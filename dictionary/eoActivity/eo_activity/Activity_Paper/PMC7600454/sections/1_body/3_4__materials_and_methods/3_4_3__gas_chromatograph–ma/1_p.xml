<p>The extracts were submitted to the Scientific and Technological Research Equipment Center (STREC) (Chulalongkorn University, Thailand). The GC-MS Triple Quad system was an Agilent 7890 series GC system coupled with an Agilent 7000C MS and a capillary column (HP-5MS 5% Phenyl Methyl Siloxane, length 30 m, i.d. 0.25 mm, phase thickness 0.25 µm). The GC was operated with helium as the carrier gas (1 mL/min). The inlet had a temperature of 250 °C, pressure set to 8.2317 psi and 1.5 µL injection. The GC oven was kept at 60 °C for 3 min before rising to 325 °C (with linear gradient of 5 °C/min) and kept at 325 °C for 3 min. The total run time was 14 min. The extracts (~10 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL of absolute ethanol and their obtained spectra were compared with NIST Mass Spectrometry Data Center to identify phytochemical constituents.</p>
