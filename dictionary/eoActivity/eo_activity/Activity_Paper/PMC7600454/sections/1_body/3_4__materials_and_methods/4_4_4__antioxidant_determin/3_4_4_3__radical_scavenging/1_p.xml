<p>Next, 0.2 mg/mL of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH
 <sup>•</sup>) and freshly prepared 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup>) (OD
 <sub>734</sub> = 0.7–0.8) were diluted in ethanol. The extract (1 mg/mL) was reacted with DPPH
 <sup>•</sup> or ABTS
 <sup>•+</sup> and incubated at RT for 15 and 30 min, respectively. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm and 734 nm, respectively. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) was used as the standard for both assays. The antioxidant capacity had Vitamin C equivalent antioxidant capacity (VCEAC) in mg/g of dry weight.
