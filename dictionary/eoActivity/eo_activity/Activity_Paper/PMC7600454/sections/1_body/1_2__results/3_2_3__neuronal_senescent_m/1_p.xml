<p>To create a neuronal senescent model, SH-SY5Y cells were induced into an expression of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by treating cells with 5.55 (control) to 100 mM glucose. In addition, the effect of glucose on cell viability was detected. We found that glucose could significantly increase the percentage of intracellular ROS in a dose-dependent manner after treatment for 24 h (
