<p>Cell cycle regulation is of critical importance in the senescence process. The cell cycle diagram and the cell numbers carried out in a flow cytometer showed that high glucose may cause cell senescence by interfering cell cycle progression. The extracts could affect high glucose. To confirm this, we investigated the expression of three proteins: cyclin D1 (G1 cyclin regulatory partner), pRb (G1 checkpoint) and pcdc2 (S and G2 checkpoint) using the Western blot. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00283-f008">Figure 8</xref>, shows the expression of cyclin D1 and pRb was significantly increased when cells were treated with 100 mM of glucose alone (*
