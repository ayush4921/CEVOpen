<p>To further understand the ability of both CHP and CHL on neuronal senescence, we determined the activity on cell cycle distribution. Data generated from a flow cytometer demonstrated that the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase when treated with 100 mM glucose was significantly higher than in the control group (

The percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase after treatment combined with 100 mM glucose and 1 Âµ/mL of either extract or gallic acid was significantly decreased when compared with the group treated with glucose (
