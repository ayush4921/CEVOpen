  <p>Effects of the extracts on high glucose-induced ROS accumulation in SH-SY5Y cells. Relative intracellular ROS level of SH-SY5Y cells treated with 100 mM glucose alone or combined with different concentrations for either CHP (
   <bold>a</bold>) or CHL (
   <bold>b</bold>) for 24 h. The effect of DMSO on relative intracellular ROS level of SH-SY5Y cells treated with (0.001 to 0.025% (
   <italic>v</italic>/
   <italic>v</italic>)) DMSO alone (
   <bold>c</bold>). Data are presented as the means ± SD, * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. control; ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 vs. 100 mM glucose alone. For CHP, 
   <italic>p</italic> value was 0.002 in both 100 mM glucose and 1 µg/mL groups. For CHL, 
   <italic>p</italic> value was 0.000 in both 100 mM glucose and 1 µg/mL groups.
