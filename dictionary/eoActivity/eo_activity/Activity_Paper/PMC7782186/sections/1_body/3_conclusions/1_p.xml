<p>The results of the present study clearly indicate that the vast majority of trifluoromethylated fused triazinones (
 <italic>i. e.</italic>
 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold> and 
 <bold>VI)</bold> are safe for the embryonic/larval developmental stages of 
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic>. It should be noted that the five-day exposure of zebrafish embryos/larvae to most of test molecules (i.e. 
 <bold>I–VII</bold>) at concentrations up to 10 or 5 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> had no significant effects on any of the parameters assessed. Simultaneously, the calculated maximal non-lethal as well as half maximal lethal concentrations for the compounds 
 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold> and 
 <bold>VI</bold> are higher than that of an anticancer agent – pemetrexed, making them promising drug candidates in the preclinical phase of drug development. Noteworthy is that an increase in the embryo(larva)toxicity was observed in groups treated with compounds only at higher concentrations, and this toxicity was similar to that induced by pemetrexed. Among this class of small molecules, the trifluoromethylated fused triazinone structures 
 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold> and 
 <bold>VI</bold> (i.e. bearing the 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-chlorophenyl, 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-methylphenyl, phenyl, 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-methoxyphenyl and 
 <italic>meta</italic>-chlorophenyl substitution, respectively) proved to be the most safe – and simultaneously less toxic than pemetrexed – for zebrafish embryos/larvae. Therefore, these molecules – with the most favourable substitution patterns affecting their less lipophilicity and therefore less toxicity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> – seem to be safe drug candidates based on their comparative studies with pemetrexed. Hence, they will be selected for further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies in mammals. From the point of view of medicinal chemistry, it is a significant finding in the search and development of new low-toxic drug candidates.
