<p>Moreover, the activation of caspase-6 and -8 (as inducers of programmed cell death) in tumour epithelial cell lines confirms the expected –

Considering the significance of apoptosis induction in the efficacy of anticancer therapy, the tested trifluoromethylated compounds, which proved to be caspases’ activators, seem to have the potential for future application in the treatment of human cancers of the lung, cervix and breast.
