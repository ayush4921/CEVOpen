 </xref>, further investigations were purposed at checking the effect of the most selective molecules (
 <bold>II</bold> and 
 <bold>V</bold>) on the activation of caspase-5, -6 and -8. These proteases were chosen because of their function. Caspase-8 acts as an initiator of apoptosis, while caspase-6 is included in the group of executive proteins â€“ playing a role in the final phase of apoptosis. In turn, caspase-5 reveals a pro-inflammatory function
