 </xref>– seems to be an excellent research tool to determine the embryo(larva)toxicity of anticancer active 8-substituted-3-(trifluoromethyl)-7,8-dihydroimidazo[2,1-
 <italic>c</italic>][1,2,4]triazin-4(6
 <italic>H</italic>)-ones. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated – for the first time – the effect of compounds 
 <bold>I–VIII</bold> and a standard anticancer drug – pemetrexed on the early-life stages (embryos and non-feeding larvae) of 
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic> in the concentration- and exposure time-dependent manner. To assess the developmental toxicity among embryos and larvae from the compounds-/pemetrexed-treated and control groups, the end-points such as the mortality of larvae, hatching rate of embryos and developmental abnormalities observed at every 24 h post-fertilisation until five days after the exposure to the compounds/pemetrexed were included.
