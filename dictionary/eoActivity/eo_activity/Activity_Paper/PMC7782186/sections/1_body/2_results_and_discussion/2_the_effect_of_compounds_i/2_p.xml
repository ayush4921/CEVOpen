<p>Our previous study

 <italic>c</italic>][1,2,4]triazin-4(6
 <italic>H</italic>)-ones (
 <bold>I–VIII</bold>). These original molecules showed strong antiproliferative effects against cancerous (A549, HeLa and T47D) cell lines, while having less toxicity to the non-tumoural (Vero) cell line. A lower toxicity towards normal cells was due to the presence of the trifluoromethyl moiety. It was confirmed in comparative studies with their structural analogues with comparable steric rearrangement and bearing the ethyl or isopropyl groups
