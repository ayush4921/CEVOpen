<p>It was proven that the least lipophilic molecules (i.e. 
 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold>) and 
 <bold>VI</bold> are the least toxic for zebrafish embryos/larvae, revealing the LC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 73 to 56 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>. Simultaneously, these compounds are less toxic than pemetrexed (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>). In turn, it was noticed that the toxicity of more lipophilic compounds (
 <bold>III</bold> and 
 <bold>VII</bold>) is similar to that of pemetrexed. However, it was established that only one compound with the highest experimental lipophilicity value (
 <bold>VIII</bold>) is slightly more toxic than pemetrexed. Our results are consistent with previous studies which showed that the toxicity of compounds and drug candidates to 
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic> individuals usually increases with an increasing lipophilicity

 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold> and 
 <bold>VI</bold> (bearing the 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-methoxyphenyl, 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-methylphenyl, phenyl, 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-chlorophenyl and 
 <italic>meta</italic>-chlorophenyl substitution, respectively) resulted in a lower mortality rate than the exposure to the anticancer drug – pemetrexed.
