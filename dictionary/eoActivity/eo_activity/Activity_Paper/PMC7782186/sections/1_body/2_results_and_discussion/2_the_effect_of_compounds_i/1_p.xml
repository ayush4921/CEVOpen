<p>Caspases are a class of cysteine-aspartic proteases with an important function in controlling cell death and inflammation. These enzymes play a crucial role in both initiation and execution of the programmed cell death â€“ apoptosis. As apoptosis is mediated by caspases, it is important to search for activators of these proteases as potential effective anticancer agents
