 </xref>, the appropriate end-points for lethality are coagulation of the embryo, failure of somite development, non-detached tail and lack of heartbeat. The individuals showing at least one of these characteristics are considered dead. In our study, the indicator of mortality was the lack of heartbeat, and all the developing zebrafish identified as dead showed no heartbeat. We confirmed the death of embryos/larvae when their heartbeat was not observed under the microscope for at least one minute. The zebrafish mortality at the end of a five-day exposure to the trifluoromethylated fused triazinone (
 <bold>Iâ€“VIII</bold>) and pemetrexed at different concentrations was dose-dependent as shown in
