<p>To investigate whether cell death proceeds through an apoptotic mechanism, the most selective trifluoromethylated compounds (bearing the 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-methylphenyl (
 <bold>II)</bold> and 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-chlorophenyl (
 <bold>V</bold>) at 
 <italic>N</italic>8) were tested for their ability to activate some caspases in tumour cells of the lung (A549), cervix (HeLa), breast (T47D) as well as in normal (Vero) cells. The levels of caspase-8 (an initiator caspase) and -6 (an executioner caspase) – as apoptotic caspases – as well as caspase-5 (an inflammatory caspase) were measured.
