<p>Developmental defects of zebrafish embryos and larvae are another very important indicators of a potential drug toxicity. Therefore, in testing the safety of drug candidates, the embryonic/larval developmental stages of zebrafish are carefully observed for potential deformities, such as the pericardial oedema, yolk sac oedema, uninflated swim bladder, crooked body, abnormal pigmentation, head and tail defects
