These 
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic> individuals had normal embryonic development during the five-day exposure to the compounds/pemetrexed. In turn, the investigated trifluoromethylated fused triazinones and a standard anticancer drug at higher concentrations caused weak to severe deformities which were the exposure time- and chemical structure-dependent. The most severe malformation types were the accumulation of pellucid fluid in yolk sac as well as pericardium and failure of swim bladder inflation, which indicate that these organs (yolk sac, heart and swim bladder) may be sensitive to test compounds. However, it should be noted that these abnormalities were observed only in the developing zebrafish exposed to the highest compounds/pemetrexed concentrations. In turn, deformities such as the shortened body axis, tail defect and spinal curvature (suggesting gastrulation defects) were the most frequently observed in treated 
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic> larvae. It is worth noting that the exposure of zebrafish embryos/larvae to the compounds 
 <bold>I</bold>, 
 <bold>II</bold>, 
 <bold>IV</bold>, 
 <bold>V</bold> and 
 <bold>VI</bold> at each concentration tested (i.e. 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup>) resulted in less frequent and less severe developmental abnormalities than an exposure to the clinically useful pemetrexed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, the compounds 
 <bold>III</bold>, 
 <bold>VII</bold> and 
 <bold>VIII</bold> showed a higher level of toxicity, as they induced intensified and more serious phenotypic defects in the developing 
 <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, although these morphological changes were comparable to those caused by pemetrexed (Figure S7 in
