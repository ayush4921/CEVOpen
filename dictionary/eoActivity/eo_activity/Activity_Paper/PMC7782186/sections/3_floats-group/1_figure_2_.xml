  <p>The mortality of zebrafish embryos/larvae at the end of five-day exposure to test compounds 
   <bold>I–VIII</bold> and pemetrexed at concentrations of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 25 and 50 mg L
   <sup>−1</sup>. The mortality in groups exposed to the compounds/pemetrexed at the concentration of 100 mg L
   <sup>−1</sup> was 100%. The mortality rates were calculated taking the equation: (number of individuals that did not survive/n) × 100%. n – number of individuals exposed to a single dose of compound/pemetrexed in each experiment (n = 20). Data represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments with similar experimental conditions. *Statistically significantly different from the control group (
