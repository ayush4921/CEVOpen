<p>The key residues of the active site are histidine 41 and cysteine 145. The active site‐specific docking revealed the binding of thearubigin, a compound present in Tea. The binding energy of the molecule was found to be −8.53 kcal/mol. It displayed direct interaction with the cysteine 145 of the active site. Another molecule, quercetin‐3‐O‐rutinoside present in Tea, shown to form extensive hydrogen bonding with the residues of the active site pocket. The amino acid residues involved in the bi‐molecular interactions include leucine 141, asparagine 142, glycine 143, and glutamine 166. The docking energy for this interaction was found to be −7.73 kcal/mol. Within the range of 4 Å, the hesperidin displayed hydrophobic interaction with methionine 165 and glutamine 189 and hydrogen bonding with asparagine 142 and glycine 146. The binding for this interaction was −7.46 kcal/mol.</p>
