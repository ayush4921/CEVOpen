<p>The COVID‐19 disease has garnered immediate attention from scientists and medical experts worldwide. The hunt for an effective therapy and potential intervention against SARS‐CoV‐2 has become a primary goal. In this context, we report medicinal plant extracts from Tea (Green Tea and Black Tea) and Haritaki as potential therapeutic options for the management of infection. The Ab‐Initio drug discovery programs require huge capital investment and some undesirous events like immunogenicity, toxicity, and efficacy remain a matter of concern in the clinical trials (Corsello et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). We harnessed principle of medicinal plants to tackle the challenge of COVID‐19. The present study screened 51 plants having anti‐viral potential against the main protease of SARS‐CoV‐ 2. The study reveals the inhibitory potential of Tea and Haritaki against 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>; a crucial enzymatic protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 (Anand et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). The halt in this enzymatic activity can potentially block the replication of the virus inside the cells and may confer a protective effect in COVID‐19. The infection of the SARS‐CoV‐2 produces a wave of inflammatory mediators and manifests severe oxidative damage (Varga et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). The inflammatory and oxidative damage to the cells conferred by the virus can be countered by the anti‐inflammatory and anti‐oxidative properties of these plants (Cabrera et al.,

 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Karamese et al.,

 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Also, as these plants are routinely used for treatment in different kinds of diseases and disorders, the risks of cytotoxic effects are also relatively low (Cheng et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Karamese et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). The anti‐viral properties of Tea have been demonstrated against the influenza virus, zika virus, hepatitis‐B virus, and SARS virus (Carneiro et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>; Mahmood et al.,
