<p>The pharmacoactive molecules like catechins, present in Green Tea, have been shown to possess multiple health‐boosting activities like hypoglycemic, hypotensive, anti‐tumor, anti‐oxidative, hypolipidemic, anti‐bacterial, and anti‐viral effects (Cabrera, Artacho, &amp; Giménez, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Cooper, Morré, &amp; Morré, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2005a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2005b</xref>; Mahmood et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The (−)‐Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) present in Green Tea has a virucidal effect on the Zika virus (Carneiro, Batista, Braga, Nogueira, &amp; Rahal, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Similarly, the Prodelphinidin B‐2 3′‐
 <italic>O</italic>‐Gallate molecule has shown an anti‐viral effect against the Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 (HSV‐2; Cheng, Lin, &amp; Lin, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Further, the Green Tea extract has also been demonstrated as a safe personal hygiene option against viral infections like human influenza A/H1N1 virus (Lee, Jang, Kim, Kim, &amp; Seong, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Interestingly, Theaflavin‐3, 3′‐digallate (TF3) which is produced from polymerization and oxidization of the epicatechin gallate and EGCG during fermentation of fresh Tea leaves, displayed 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibition (Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). Similarly, Haritaki is also believed to possess anti‐bacterial and anti‐viral activities (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Furthermore, it has been reported beneficial against viruses like HSV‐2 (Kesharwani et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>) and Influenza A virus (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Epigallocathechin‐3‐gallate present in the 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> inhibited the replication of hepatitis‐B virus (Karamese, Aydogdu, Karamese, Altoparlak, &amp; Gundogdu, 
 <xref rid="ptr6802-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). We assessed the proteolytic activity of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> protein and found that the extracts of Tea (Green Tea and Black Tea) and Haritaki displayed a significant reduction in proteolytic activity.
