<p id="p0185">Autophagy is a process responsible for degradation of lysosomes by cytosolic components of cytoplasmic organelles. Cellular stress causing events like nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, ROS, protein aggregates, DNA damage, intracellular pathogens, or damaged organelles may stimulate this pathway. Microtubule-associated protein light chains 3 (LC3) which is a mammalian autophagy protein acts as a marker of autophagosomes. Among the four LC3 isoforms, LC3B is the most widely used marker. In this current study, lead exposure was responsible for a significant increase in expression level of LC3B in renal tissues when compared to control group. EA treatment caused reduction in LC3B level and demonstrated an anti-autophagic effect [
