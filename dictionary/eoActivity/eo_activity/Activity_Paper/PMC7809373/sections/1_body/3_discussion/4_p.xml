<p id="p0140">SOD, catalase and glutathione peroxidases (GPx) are important antioxidant enzymes. These enzymes provide protection against ROS. SOD decomposes superoxide radicals (O
 <sub>2</sub>-) to produce H
 <sub>2</sub>O. Therefore, these enzyme activities are used to determine extent of free radical generation and assess oxidative stress in cells. It has been observed that lead has a high affinity for SH groups in several enzymes such as SOD, responsible for inactivation of tissue antioxidants. In this present study CAT, SOD &amp; GSH activities were significantly decreased in renal tissue of lead-treated group as compared to the negative control group. This suggested that lead acetate exposure induces oxidative stress by inhibiting activity of antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, co-treatment of lead-acetate with EA leads to considerably improved function of CAT and SOD in kidneys to a level similar to that of negative control group. A significant and dose-dependent recovery of kidney GSH content was also noticed in EA50, EA25 treated groups in comparison with positive control group. These changes signify ability of EA to reduce accumulation of free radicals and protection it provides from cellular damage [
