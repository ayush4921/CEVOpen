<p id="p0010">Acute and chronic exposure to lead is often associated with a deficit of tubular transport mechanisms and corresponding appearance of degenerative perturbation in tubular epithelium responsible for debilitating pathological changes. Persistent inflammation has been reported to be an important characteristic of chronic renal disease and it plays an important role in pathophysiology of renal disorders. This toxic pathway is responsible for a significant percentage of all-cause mortality [

Lead exposure causes initiation and development of inflammatory pathways in the body, acting as modulator on multiple levels of expression from genomic to proteomic profile. It affects, among others, expression and activity of enzymes involved in inflammation (such as COX-2) and expression of cytokines (IL8, TNF, IFNÎ³). Lead induced toxicity is associated with impairment of cellular constituents of the human immune system. Altered cellular and humoral immune response as a consequence of lead exposure is mediated by reduction of immunoglobulin production, which predisposes affected population to enhanced inflammatory disorders [
