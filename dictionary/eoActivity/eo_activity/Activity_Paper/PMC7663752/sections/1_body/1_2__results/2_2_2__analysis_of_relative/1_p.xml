<p>The volatile components and their relative contents in the stem of

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05046">Supplementary Materials (Table S1)</xref>. The substances with the largest proportion of volatile components were alkanes and their derivatives, which were 52.64%, 56.74%, 49.86%, 58.17%, 50.32% and 72.40% respectively in ZB1, ZB2, FB1, FB2, YA1 and JA2 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05046">Table S1</xref>). Hexacosane shows the highest relative content of all volatile component, the highest content being 34.41% in YA1 and the lowest 23.41% in JA1 (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05046">Table S1</xref>). In addition to hexacosane, there were five kinds of volatile substances with a relative content of more than 2%, which were triacontane (highest level 27.42% in YA1, and the lowest 17.29 in FB1), tetratriacontane (highest 8.42% in YA1, and lowest 2.55% in FB2), phosphoric acid, dibutyl 1,1-dimethyl-2,2,3,3-tetrafluoro propyl ester (the highest level was 5.02% in YA1, and the lowest was 2.87% in ZB1), 9-octadecynoic acid (the highest content 7.32% in ZB1, and the lowest was 4.06% in YA1), palmitic acid (the highest in FB1 (6.09%), and the lowest in ZB1 (3.21)). Interestingly, 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> from different regions has 5â€“10 unique substances, accounting for no more than 5.5% of the total, that revealed that the categories and relative contents of volatile components from different regions vary greatly.
