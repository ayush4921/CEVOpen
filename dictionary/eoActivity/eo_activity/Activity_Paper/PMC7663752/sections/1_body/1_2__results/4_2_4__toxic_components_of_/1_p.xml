<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05046-f003">Figure 3</xref>, the categories and relative contents of toxic rational components of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> in different regions were different. A total of two components in ZB1 are considered to be toxic, with a total relative content of 0.43%. The relative content of diisooctyl phthalate was the highest (0.26%) and that of metconazole was the lowest (0.17%), which was significantly higher than that of FB1, JA1 and YA1 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). A total of three toxic components were detected in FB1, with a total relative content of 0.71%, which was the highest among the four groups. Among them, the relative contents of diisooctyl phthalate and hexadecanoic acid ethyl ester were the highest, both 0.26%. The relative content of phthalic acid butyl tetradecyl ester with the lowest relative content was only 0.19%, which was significantly higher than that of ZB1 and JA1 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). A total of two components in YA1 were considered to be toxic, with a total relative content of 0.40%. The relative content of diisooctyl phthalate was the highest (0.22%) and that of phthalic acid butyl tetradecyl ester was the lowest, which was not significantly different from that of FB1, but significantly higher than that of ZB1 and JA1 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, no toxic components were detected in JA1.
