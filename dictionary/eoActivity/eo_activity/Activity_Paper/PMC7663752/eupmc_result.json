    "<i>Dendrobium officinale</i> Kimura et Migo, a rare and traditional medicinal plant, contains many nutrients such as polysaccharides, alkaloids, amino acids and so on. Different growth environment and intraspecific hybridization of different germplasm resources lead to large differences in the yield, quality and medicinal value of <i>D. officinale</i>. Here, the volatile compounds of <i>D. officinale</i> from four producing regions (Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan and Jiangxi) were analyzed to provide a certain reference value for the selection of a specific medicinal component in <i>D. officinale</i> breeding. Fresh stems of <i>D. officinale</i> germplasm resources were collected, and the chemical constituents were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 101 volatile compounds were identified, of which esters and alcohols accounted for 23 and 22. Hexacosane is the highest relative content of all volatile components. The highest content of hexacosane was observed in YA1 from Yunnan was 34.41%, and the lowest (23.41%) in JA1 from Jiangxi. Moreover, 5-10 unique substances were determined in different regions. A total of 17 medicinal components were detected, and three unique medicinal components were detected only in YA1, revealing that YA1 can provide raw materials for the application of specific medicinal substances extraction. A total of four toxic components were detected, but no toxic components were detected in JA1 from Jiangxi, suggested that the germplasm resources from Jiangxi could be exploited efficiently for breeding superior <i>D. officinale</i> specimens. The results provide a theoretical basis for the collection, protection and utilization of <i>D. officinale</i> germplasm resources in different regions."
