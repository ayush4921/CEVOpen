<p>Noncompetitive inhibitors of the NADH ubiquinone reductase (complex 1), such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl pyridinium (MPP
 <sup>+</sup>), are used as a model compound in dopaminergic neuronal degeneration to study Parkinson’s disease (PD). THCA reduced the degenerative effect of MPP
 <sup>+</sup> in dopaminergic neurons and increased cell survival at the highest tested dose of 10 µM in mice mesencephalic cultures [

Another model compound 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) is used in the research of huntingtin disease (HD) which acts as a complex II inhibitor of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in progressive loss of locomotor and striatal degeneration. THCA mitigated degenerative effects of 3-NPA, through a PPARγ-dependent pathway in N2a cell [
