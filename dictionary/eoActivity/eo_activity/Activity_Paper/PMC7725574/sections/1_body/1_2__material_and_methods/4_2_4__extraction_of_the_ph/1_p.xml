<p>Twenty grams of the powdered 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> sample were extracted successively by Soxhlet extractor, according to the method adopted by Abdel-Aal et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], utilizing different organic solvents with analytical reagent quality. These solvents were petroleum ether (40-60°C), methylene chloride (39.6°C), chloroform (61.15°C), acetone (56°C), and finally, methanol (64.7°C). To ensure the complete extraction process, exhaustive extraction was applied with each solvent for 10 h. Extracts of different organic solvents were collected separately into dry clean beakers. Further, they were recovered from the solvents by evaporation in a rotary evaporator at 40°C. The samples were then dried in desiccators for 1 h, the obtained extracts were weighed, and the percentage of each extract was determined.
