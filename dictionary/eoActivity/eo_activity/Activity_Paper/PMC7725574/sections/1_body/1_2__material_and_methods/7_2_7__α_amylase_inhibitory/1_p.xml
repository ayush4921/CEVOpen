<p>Each extract of 
 <italic>N. obtusifolia</italic> plant, a working solution (1 mg/ml), was produced by dissolving 25 mg of each extract in a little amount of 10% DMSO; then, a buffer solution was added up to 25 ml. The solution was then diluted by the buffer to obtain different dilutions (0.01, 0.05, 0.07, 0.1, and 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Later on, an 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylases enzyme working solution (2 units/ml) was prepared by dissolving 12.5 mg of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylases enzyme powder in a minimum amount of 10% DMSO, and buffer solution was added up to 100 ml. Corn starch solution was prepared by dissolving 1 g of starch in 100 ml distilled water. A 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l from each plant extract stock solution was mixed with of 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylases stock solution and incubated for 10 min at 30°C in a water bath. After that, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of corn starch solution was added and incubated for 3 min at 30°C. Moreover, 3, 5-dinitro salicylic acid was added and boiled in a water bath at 85–90°C for 10 min, and after the solution is cooled, was added 5 ml of distilled water. The blank solution was prepared by replacing the plant extract with 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of the buffer. Acarbose was used as a positive control. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory potential was calculated using the following formula:
