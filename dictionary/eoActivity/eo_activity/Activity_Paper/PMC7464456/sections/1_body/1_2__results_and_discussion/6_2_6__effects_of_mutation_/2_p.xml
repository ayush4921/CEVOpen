<p>NO is a non-specific effector molecule synthesized by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and it plays a key role in inhibiting the growth of various pathogenic microorganisms and in the regulation of tumor cell apoptosis [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f004">Figure 4</xref>b, SH1-20 and A130-20 significantly stimulated the NO release of murine macrophage. NO content increased markedly in the presence of A130-20 ranging from 50 to 500 Î¼g/mL, which was higher than that of SH1-20. This indicated ARTP mutation promoted the macrophage activation activities by producing new macromolecule polysaccharides. A130-50 and SH1-50 also have certain effects on improving NO production, and A130-50 showed better in vitro macrophage activation activities than SH1-50. The macrophage activation activities reduced with the molecular weight of polysaccharides decreased. The results revealed that the large-molecular-weight polysaccharides were the main components contributing to immune activity in vitro [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03693" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The immunity actives of polysaccharides isolated from A130 improved might related to the production of new macromolecular polysaccharide by ARTP mutagenesis and the change of chain conformation and molecular weight distribution.
