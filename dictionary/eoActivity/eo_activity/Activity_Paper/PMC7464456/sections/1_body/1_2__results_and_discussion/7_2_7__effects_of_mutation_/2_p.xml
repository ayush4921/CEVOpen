 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f005">Figure 5</xref>a, compared with A130-70 and SH1-70 groups, A130-20, SH1-20, and A130-50, SH1-50 significantly increased the cytokine release of IL-6 at 500 µg/mL. The A130-20 (50 µg/mL and 200 µg/mL) groups stimulated IL-6 production much higher than that of SH1-20 groups. Meanwhile, A130-20 and SH1-20 groups significantly increased TNF-α production better than A130-50, SH1-50 and A130-70, SH1-70 groups at concentrations of 50, 200, and 500 µg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). These indicated that macromolecular polysaccharides (20% ethanol-precipitated fractions) showed better stimulating activities on IL-6 and TNF-α production, and polysaccharide fractions extracted from mutagenic strain A130 mycelia showed higher stimulating activities on IL-6 and TNF-α production compared with original strain SH1. Moreover, A130-20 clearly increased IL-1 β production higher than the A130-50 and A130-70 groups at concentrations of 50, 200, and 500 µg/mL, respectively, and similar as SH1 group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f005">Figure 5</xref>c). A130-20 had better stimulating activity on IL-1 β release at 50 µ g/mL than SH1-20, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03693-f005">Figure 5</xref>c. The results showed the enhanced immunological activity in vitro was correlated with the cytokine expression of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1 β. They also indicated that macromolecular polysaccharide fractions from mycelia of
