<p>Based on the data above, we can find the weight-average molecular weight of polysaccharide fractions decreased with the increasing of alcohol precipitation concentration. The molecular weight of 20% ethanol-precipitated fraction greatly increased after ARTP mutation, but little change was found in 50 and 70% ethanol-precipitated fractions, which well coincided with the monosaccharide composition analysis. The polysaccharide (A130-20, peak1) is a totally new macromolecular polysaccharide found in mutant strain, from which we could infer ARTP mutation stress promoting the aggregation of macromolecular polysaccharides of 
 <italic>S. sanghuang</italic> and making the changes of polysaccharide biosynthesis. As the proportion of glucose in A130-20 is double of that in SH1-20, the new polysaccharide fraction in A130 (peak1) could possibly be a kind of glucan.
