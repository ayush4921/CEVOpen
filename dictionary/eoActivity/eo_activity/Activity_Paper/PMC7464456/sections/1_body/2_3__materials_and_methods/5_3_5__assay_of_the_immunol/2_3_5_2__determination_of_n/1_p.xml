 <sup>5</sup> cells/well RAW 264.7 macrophage cells were cultured in a 96-well plate; six polysaccharide fractions with various final concentrations (50, 200, and 500 µg/mL) were added to the cells for 48 h. Nitrite contents were determined through the Griess reaction. 1 µg/mL PBS and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) served as negative and positive controls, respectively.
