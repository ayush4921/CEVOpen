<p>The study also showed that ARTP was a novel, powerful, and environmentally friendly mutagenesis tool for generating high-polysaccharide-yield

However, much more extensive research, as well as technological development, has to be carried out in future work. The mechanism of high polysaccharide production by ATRP mutation, and the key enzymes and genes in polysaccharide synthetic metabolic pathways need to be discovered. In addition, a basic understanding of both the primary and secondary structures of polysaccharides produced by ARTP need to be further studied to better elucidate the structure-activity relationship.
