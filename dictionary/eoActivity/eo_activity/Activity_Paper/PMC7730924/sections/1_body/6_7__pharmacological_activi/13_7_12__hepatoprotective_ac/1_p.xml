 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species do possess hepatoprotective potential. In a study, the EtOH root-extract of 
 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> was evaluated for its hepatoprotective activity in CCl
 <sub>4</sub> treated (toxicant) albino rats. The estimation of hepatoprotective activity was confirmed by measuring the decline in the elevated levels of serum marker-enzymes such as SGPT, SGOT, ALP, and total bilirubin levels [

 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> leaf extract (dose of 500 mg/kg) fully restored the carbon tetrachloride (potent hepatotoxicant)-induced variations in carbon tetrachloride intoxicated rats [

 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> dry extract has also been reported to exhibit hepatoprotective property in rats intoxicated with 4-pentenoic acid, thus confirming its hepatoprotective potential [
