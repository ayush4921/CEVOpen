<p>Undoubtedly,

 <italic>ciliata</italic> MeOH leaf extract has been reported to be a potent free-radical scavenger (EC

 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> also possess considerable antioxidant activity, as confirmed by DPPH assay (IC

 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> is due to the presence of two compounds, (+)-catechin-3,5-di-
 <italic>O</italic>-gallate (

 <italic>O</italic>-gallate (
 <bold>83</bold>). They were isolated from its aqueous EtOH leaf extract and exhibited strong antioxidant properties, as determined by DPPH assay, with SC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.04 and 1.33 g/mL, respectively [
