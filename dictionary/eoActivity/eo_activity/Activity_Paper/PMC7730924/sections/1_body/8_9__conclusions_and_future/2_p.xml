<p>The studies done so far on Bergenias have focused on investigation and assessment of germplasm resources, functional credentials of extracts and isolation of bioactive components, but the reports on cytological and molecular researches and standardization of plant-extracted drugs for product-development are still fragmentary. 
 <italic>B. hissarica</italic> and 
 <italic>B. tianquanensis</italic> are extremely rare species with very few reports on their biological activities. Therefore, the conservation of the 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species is of immense concern from a biodiversity, ethnobotanical, and pharmacological perspective. Although the research is progressing on 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species, their robust tissue culture protocols are yet to be discovered, as the publications [

 <italic>Bergenia</italic> in the field of floriculture, health foods, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and many other industrial and economic ventures. To conclude, 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species have huge potential to act as a panacea to numerous health-related maladies, and therefore their conservation is necessary.
