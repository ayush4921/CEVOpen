<p>The extant literature (abstracts, blogs, full-text articles, PhD theses, and books) on the 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species was reviewed systematically to generate concise and resourceful information regarding their distribution, phytochemistry, traditional medicinal uses, and pharmacological activities. For this purpose, different bibliographic search engines and online databases (Google Scholar, WoS, PubMed, CAB abstracts, INMEDPLAN, Scopus, NATTS, EMBASE, SciFinder, MEDLINE) and websites (
 <uri xlink:href="www.sciencedirect.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.sciencedirect.com</uri>; 
 <uri>eflora.org</uri>; 
 <uri>jstor.org</uri>; 
 <uri>pfaf.org</uri>) were referred, to select 174 references for detailed analysis. Each botanical name has been validated through 
 <uri xlink:href="www.theplantlist.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.theplantlist.org</uri> and 
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.catalogueoflife.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.catalogueoflife.org/</uri> online repositories. ChemDraw software (version 12.0) was used to draw the structures of the chemical compounds.
