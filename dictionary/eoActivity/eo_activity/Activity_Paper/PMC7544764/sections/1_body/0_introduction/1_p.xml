<p id="Par5">Rangelands are critical areas for biodiversity conservation in terms of genetic materials (Kideghesho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>) and are sources of livelihoods to many communities living in arid and semi-arid regions; providing feed for both livestock and wildlife, medicinal plants and other diverse ecosystems services (Abule et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>). Tanzania rangelands cover more than 74% of total land of 88.6 million hectares (Mwilawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>) comprising about 74% of plants species found in East Africa (Goldman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>; Kideghesho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). Because of their ecological value and socio-economic importance, these rangelands are home to most spectacular wildlife population attracting substantial tourism revenues in the country (Homewood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Kidegesho 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>). On the other hands, most pastoral communities in Tanzania derive their livelihoods from rangeland resources. Currently, Tanzania is a second country in Africa after Ethiopia with largest livestock population harbouring about 30.5 million cattle, 18.8 million goats and 5.5 million sheep (URT 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2017</xref>). Most of these livestock (99%) are managed under traditional pastoralism/or agro-pastoralism in rangelands (Mwilawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>) sharing forage and water resources with wildlife in competitive and facilitative manner (Nelson
