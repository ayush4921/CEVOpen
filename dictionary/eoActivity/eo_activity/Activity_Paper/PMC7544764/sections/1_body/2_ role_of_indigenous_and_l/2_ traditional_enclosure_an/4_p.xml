<p id="Par16">The Gogo people in the central part of Tanzania have similar practices of conserving forage resources for dry season feeds. Like Alalili in Maasai, 
 <italic>Milanga</italic> is a common indigenous practice in central region of the country. According to Njau et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2013</xref>), Gogo people are among the leading pastoralists with high livestock population in the country and thus are facing with challenge of poor availability and quality of forage. Therefore, tradition reserved pastures (
 <italic>Milanga</italic>) used by Gogo tribes is a cheap source of dry season feeds for cattle, goats and sheep (Mwilawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>). Similar ILK was noted from the Barbaig tribe, where the council of elders manages pasture reserves known as 
 <italic>Radanenda</italic> for their livestock as drought coping mechanism (Kilongozi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>).
