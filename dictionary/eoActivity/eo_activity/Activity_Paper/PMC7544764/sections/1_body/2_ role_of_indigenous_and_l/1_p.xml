<p id="Par11">Sustainable rangeland management required weaving of Indigenous and Local Knowledge (ILK), traditional practices and strategies (Tengö et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2017</xref>). Solomon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2007</xref>) maintained that, any attempt toward improvement of rangeland resources require through understanding of ILK and perceptions of local communities. According to Godana (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>) and Hill et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>), the ILK are skills, practices and technologies that are integral part of production system in particular culture. In the context of range management, these are specific skills and practices used by specific society for rangeland and natural resources management. Saruni (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2016</xref>) hold that, indigenous traditional land contained about 80% of global biodiversity of which local people are practicing their Indigenous and Local Knowledge for conserving natural resources and environmental management at large. In Tanzania context, there are more than 100 distinct customary institutions (ethnic groups and tribes, traditional religious groups, women’s groups and social groups) each with specific inherited Indigenous and Local Knowledge potential for natural resources management (Lwoga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2017</xref>). These local organizations are responsible for management and empowering of the indigenous people for better-informed decision with regard to use of ILK. This article cited few key indigenous pastoral communities as representative cases in Tanzania regarding the potential available indigenous skills and practices.
