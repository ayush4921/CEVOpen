<p>Erection function in rodents can be evaluated by measuring ICP [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The magnitude of erectile activity was quantified as the ratio of ICP to MAP, which is the common functional index to determine erectile function. Following electrical stimulation of cavernous nerve at 1-10 V, it was found that electrical stimulation increased ICP in a voltage-dependent manner. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"> Figure 2(a)</xref> illustrates the quantitative measurement of ICP and MAP during electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve at the voltage of 5 V for 60 s. The DM control group revealed a significant decrease in ICP and ICP/MAP ratio compared with the normal control rats (

Additionally, a marked increase in ICP/MAP ratio was observed in diabetic rats that received sildenafil. It is important to note that sildenafil was given one time before mating behaviour test. Our results are in support with previously published report, which revealed that the magnitude of the increase in ICP after cavernosal nerve stimulation was significantly lower in the STZ-diabetic rats, and a significant increase in peak ICP at the 5 and 7.5 V settings was observed in STZ-diabetic rats administered sildenafil [
