<p>The testicular histology of normal control rat showed a normal testicular structure, normal outline of the seminiferous tubules, and all levels of spermatogenic cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). In agreement with the results of previous studies, our study showed abnormal histology of seminiferous epithelium and the size of seminiferous tubules in the DM control group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>). Additionally, the cellular levels of spermatocytes and spermatids were reduced, and the connections between cells were disappeared in these rats. It was evident that the degree of spermatogenetic impairments in diabetic rats correlated with the reduction in testis weight (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and the testosterone levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, CCM-treated diabetic rats showed less severe of morphologic alterations (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(e)</xref>). This result is in agreement with the study of Sohn [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] who reported the positive effect of cordycepin in spermatogenesis-related parameters in middle-aged rats. Beneficial effects of cordycepin were also reported in age-associated alterations in testicular function [
