 <bold>29</bold> was C-glycosides, which the disaccharide substitution continuously loses 60, 90, and 120 Da fragment ions. Compound 
 <bold>29</bold> showed a [M–H]
 <sup>–</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 563.1414, C-6 substituted hexose broke up in 
 <sup>0,4</sup>X
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <sup>0,3</sup>X
 <sub>0</sub>, and 
 <sup>0,2</sup>X
 <sub>0</sub> to obtain 503.1196, 473.1092, and 443.0980 fragment ions, respectively, after that C-8 site pentose fractured at 
 <sup>0,3</sup>X1 and 
 <sup>0,2</sup>X
 <sub>1</sub> to get 383.0781 and 353.0676, because the C-6 substituent glycosyl groups were superior to the C-8 replacement fracture. According to the characteristics of the fragment ions, compound 
 <bold>29</bold> was easily confirmed as schaftoside. However, compound 
 <bold>33</bold> was O-glycosides, which typically lost the entire sugar neutral molecule with significant loss of 132, 146, 162, and 192 Da fragments. Compound 
 <bold>33</bold> [M−H]
 <sup>−609.1490</sup> was rutin, which could be detected aglycone ion [Y

 <sup>−301.0363</sup> and radical aglycone ion [Y

 <sup>−300.0284</sup> after losing carbohydrate continuously in the negative ion mode, and the possible fragmentation mechanism was depicted in Figure
