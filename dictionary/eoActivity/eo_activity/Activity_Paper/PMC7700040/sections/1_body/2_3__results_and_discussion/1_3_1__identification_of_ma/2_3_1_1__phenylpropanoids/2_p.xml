 <bold>36</bold>, 
 <bold>38</bold>, 
 <bold>42</bold>, 
 <bold>50</bold>, and 
 <bold>54</bold> were simple phenylpropanoids, while compounds 
 <bold>27</bold> and 
 <bold>36</bold> were phenylpropanol and phenylpropene, respectively. Moreover, compounds 
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>18</bold>, 
 <bold>21</bold>, 
 <bold>26</bold>, 
 <bold>38</bold>, 
 <bold>42</bold>, 
 <bold>50</bold>, and 
 <bold>54</bold> were caffeic acid derivatives, including 4 caffeoylquinic acid derivatives (
 <bold>18</bold>, 2
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>42</bold>, 
 <bold>50</bold>). They combine by the quinic acid and caffeic acid with esteratic linkage and have similar cleavage pathways. The typical neutral losses of caffeoyl, quinine, H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and CO
 <sub>2</sub> were the major cleavage pathway of such compounds. Taking compound 
 <bold>18</bold> as an example, it gave the same MS
 <sup>2</sup> base peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 191.0571 due to the loss of caffeic acid and a relatively intense secondary ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 179.0356, while the ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 161.0254 was produced by continuous loss of H
 <sub>2</sub>O, allowing the assignment of chlorogenic acid as reported by the reference data. The possible fragmentation mechanism was depicted in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S1</xref>. Besides, compound 
 <bold>42</bold> also has the same fragmentation pathways.
