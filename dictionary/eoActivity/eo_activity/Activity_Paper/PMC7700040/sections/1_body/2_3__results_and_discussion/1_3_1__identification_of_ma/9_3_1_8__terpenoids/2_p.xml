<p>Compound 
 <bold>15</bold> had [M–H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 375.1307, and its fragments were at

 <sup>–</sup>. Its fragmentation process was the same as the literature. Therefore, compound 
 <bold>15</bold> was identified as mussaenosidic acid. Compound 
 <bold>20</bold> exhibited a pseudomolecular ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 389.1098 [M–H]
 <sup>−</sup> and fragment ions at

 <sup>−</sup> corresponding to the cleavage of elenolic acid moieties. Meanwhile, fragment ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 69.0405 was corresponding to the propiolic acid. Compound 
 <bold>20</bold> was tentatively identified as oleoside. Compound 
 <bold>60</bold> showed [M–H]
 <sup>−</sup> ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 821.3970 and the fragment ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 351.0564 were corresponding to [2GluA–H
