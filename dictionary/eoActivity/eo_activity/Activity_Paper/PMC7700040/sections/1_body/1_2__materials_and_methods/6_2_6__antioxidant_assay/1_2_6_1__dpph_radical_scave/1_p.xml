<p>The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the sample was provided in our previously published articles [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Briefly, 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DPPH solution (dissolved 0.2 mM in methanol) was mixed with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the sample at different concentrations. The mixture was stirred and incubated in the dark at 30°C for 30 min, and the absorbance was determined at 517 nm (A
 <sub>sample</sub>). The absorbance of a blank (A
 <sub>blank</sub>) and negative control (A
 <sub>control</sub>) composed of only the sample and DPPH solutions was also determined, respectively. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the sample was calculated by the following equation: DPPHscavengingactivity = [1 − (A
 <sub>sample</sub>–A
 <sub>blank</sub>)/A
 <sub>control</sub>] × 100%. Vc was used as a positive control in this experiment.
