<p>Acne is an inflammatory disease where several cytokines play key roles in mediating acute inflammatory responses, such as IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, which are extremely potent inflammatory molecules. 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>acnes</italic> were found to stimulate monocytes to secrete proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, and IL-8 [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These cytokines originate from white blood cells, keratinocytes, and sebocytes in and around the damaged follicle, as the host cross-talks with skin defense and immune cells to fight and protect against the infection [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The inhibition of the overproduction of such cytokines, especially proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6) and nitric oxide, may prevent or suppress inflammation in acne patients. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated from the hypercolonization of 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although ROS perform a useful function in the skin barrier against acne microbes, excess formation affects skin condition by activating neutrophil infiltration. ROS including singlet oxygen, superoxide anion, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxide, and nitric oxide (NO) play an important role in inflammatory acne as well as in tissue injury. ROS stimulate the formation of nuclear factor 
 <italic>κ</italic>B (NF‐
 <italic>κ</italic>B), promote TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> formation, and consequently activate T lymphocytes and keratinocytes. The cytokines IL-6, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and IFN, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), transforming growth factor (TGF), and prostaglandin (PG) are then produced and released [
