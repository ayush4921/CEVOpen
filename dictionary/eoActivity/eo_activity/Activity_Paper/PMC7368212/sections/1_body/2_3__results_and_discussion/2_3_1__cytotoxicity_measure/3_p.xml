<p>Plasma membrane integrity can be evaluated by measuring the extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity. Lactate dehydrogenase, an enzyme located in the cytoplasm, catalyzes the conversion of lactate and pyruvate. When lactate dehydrogenase is found within the media on the cells, there are two possible causes: the first is cellular death and the second is a “leak” in a cell membrane [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. When cells are disrupted, the lactate dehydrogenase activity is elevated. The results obtained indicate no significant changes of the LDH levels in the culture medium after exposure to plant extracts at a concentration up to 125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. A slight, but not significant, increase was observed after treatment with concentrations of 250 and 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (data not shown). Based on the MTT and LDH results, concentrations below 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml were used in the following experiments.
