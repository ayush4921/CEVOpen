<p>The cell viability of the cells was determined with the MTT assay as described [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In brief, HaCaT cells were seeded at 2 × 103 cells/100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l culture media/well of 96-microtiter plates. Twenty-four hours after cell seeding, cells were incubated with 0–500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of plant extract/ml of culture media for an additional 24 hours at 37°C. Following the removal of the culture media, cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline. The cells were then incubated in serum-free culture media to which 0.5 mg MTT/ml (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added to each well (100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l) and incubated for a further four hours. Then, the medium was removed and the cells were incubated with 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l of acidic isopropanol (0.08 N HCl) for 15 minutes to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance of the MTT formazan was determined at 570 nm in an ELISA reader. Viability was defined as the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of absorbance of treated cells to untreated cells.
