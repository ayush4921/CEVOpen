<p>The disk diffusion experiments were carried out as described in [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cutibacterium acnes</italic> (formerly, 
 <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>) (from The American Type Culture Collection, ATCC 6921) were incubated in liquid reinforced clostridium medium (RCM) for 48 h under anaerobic conditions and adjusted to yield approximately 1.0 × 108 CFU/ml. A 1.0 × 108 CFU inoculum was spread on blood agar (with sheep blood 5 to 7%) (BASB) medium plates. Discs of 6 mm diameter were prepared from Whatman no.1 filter paper, placed in a glass Petri dishes, and autoclaved for 15 min. Extract and chloramphenicol (positive control) were added to each sterile disc (25 
 <italic>μ</italic>l/disc), and the discs were dried under a laminar flow sterile bench. The final content of each disc was 5 mg of plant extracts. A sterile paper disc impregnated with test material was placed on the agar. Plates were then incubated at 37°C for 72 h under anaerobic conditions (in Gas Pak jars). 0.1 ml of the prepared bacterial broth culture was luted with 9.9 ml sterile saline.
