<p>Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was measured in both the cell culture media and cell lysate fractions using CytoTox 96 (cytotoxicity assay kit, Promega), in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a 96-well microtiter plate reader (Anthos, Biochrom, Cambridge, UK) [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In brief, 2 × 103 HaCaT cells were seeded per well of 96-microtiter plates. Twenty-four hours after cell seeding, cells were treated with 0–500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of plant extracts. After 24 h of treatment, the culture media were collected from each well. Cell monolayers were then lysed with a cell lysis solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. LDH activity was measured in both the supernatants and cell lysate fractions. The absorbance was determined at 490 nm with a 96-well plate ELISA reader.
