<p>THP-1 cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cell/ml. THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages with PMA (100 ng/ml) and vitamin D3 (0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). Twenty-four hours after cell differentiation, cells were exposed to increasing concentrations (0–250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) of IH and SO extract in a fresh serum-free medium in both the absence and presence of LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) were used to quantify the secretion of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6. The absorbance at 450 nm was read by a microplate reader (model 680; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada) with the wavelength correction set at 550 nm. To calculate the concentration of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6, a standard curve was constructed using serial dilutions of cytokine standards provided with the kit.
