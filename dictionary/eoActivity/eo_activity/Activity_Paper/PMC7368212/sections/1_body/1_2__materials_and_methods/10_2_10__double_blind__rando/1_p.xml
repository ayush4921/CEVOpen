<p>Efficacy of AHC was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, and controlled efficacy study with 41 facial acne vulgaris patients, ages 18–24, who were asked to apply AHC (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27) or placebo (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14) on the affected area, two to three times daily for a period of six weeks. The baseline assessment included personal data, description of symptoms, and details of past medical history. All patients underwent a clinical examination, and a thorough skin examination was done for the presence of black and white heads, inflamed papules and pustules, or nodules. All patients were followed up for a period of six weeks, and at each weekly follow-up visit, the improvement in the acne lesions was evaluated using the following acne severity index (ASI) in which noninflammatory count (NIC) (comedone) and inflammatory count (IC) (papule, pustule, and nodule) were determined in intervals of two, five, and six weeks. ASI values were calculated as follows:
