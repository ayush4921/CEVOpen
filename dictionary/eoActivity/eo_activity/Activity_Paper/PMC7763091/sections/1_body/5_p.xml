<p>Paraphaeosphaerides are recently isolated natural products which exhibit inhibitory activity against experimental breast cancer cells including cisplatin resistant cells. They are, therefore, considered potential lead compounds for anticancer drug discovery. The communication by Kobayashi et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] describes the synthesis of the proposed structure of paraphaeosphaeride C following a synthesis route similar to the earlier synthesis of a related congener by the same group. The synthesis described in this paper featured a Knochel-Hauser base (TMPMgClÂ·LiCl)-mediated intramolecular vinyl anion aldol reaction and subsequent appropriate functional group transformations, including regioselective methylenation and stereoselective reduction to establish a critical stereocenter. Careful extensive NMR studies showed that the data for the synthetic compound did not match those of the natural product. Additionally, the optical rotation of the synthetic material was opposite in sign and substantially different in magnitude to that of the natural product. This work thus implies that the structure of natural paraphaeosphaeride C has been incorrectly assigned.
