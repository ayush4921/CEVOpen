<p>Cornexistin and hydroxycornexistin are structurally unique fungal natural products containing a nine-membered carbocycle fused to a maleic anhydride. The compounds were isolated in the late 1980s and early 1990s from a culture of 
 <italic>Paecilomyces variotii</italic> Bainier, and their potent and selective herbicidal activities attracted the attention of the agrochemical industry. The maleic anhydride substructure makes the compounds prone to rapid degradation on exposure to light, acid, or base. Stephen Clark’s research group has developed a short convergent approach to the synthesis of the core framework of these fascinating compounds employing an intramolecular Nozaki–Hiyama–Kishi reaction as the key reaction [
