<p>Food and feedstock can be contaminated with fungi that secrete toxic secondary metabolites known as mycotoxins. Those produced by 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> fungi are frequently found in agricultural crops as well as soil, wallpapers, and textures, and have been implicated in several animal and human health ailments. The paper by Sebald et al. [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05841" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] describes the synthesis of (−)-altenuene in trideuterated form to be used as an internal standard in stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) LC/MS-MS method for mycotoxins. The synthesis is based on an earlier reported synthesis of the natural product, and through successful optimization of the synthesis route the deuterium labeled natural product was obtained with an overall yield of 17% after nine steps from inexpensive commercially available 
 <sc>d</sc>-(−)-quinic acid. Its applicability as an internal standard for SIDA was also demonstrated.
