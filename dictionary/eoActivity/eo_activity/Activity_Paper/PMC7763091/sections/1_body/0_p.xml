<p>Natural products have intrigued humans throughout history. Plants with physiological activities, fermentation products, extracts with aroma, scent, or other properties have catalyzed the development of physical methods of separation of compounds and eventually the chemical synthesis of compounds. It is no coincidence that the first synthesis of an organic compound was that of a natural product. Since Wöhler’s synthesis of urea (no stereocenters) nearly two centuries ago, the synthesis of natural products has evolved through Komppa’s synthesis of camphor (one independent stereocenter) a century ago to a stage where compounds of enormous complexity can be attained through chemical synthesis (e.g., palytoxin with 64 stereocenters by Kishi in 1994). This development continues undauntedly, and it stimulates the invention of new synthetic reactions, new technological inventions, and new strategic thinking. The synthesis of natural products also stimulates the minds of medicinal chemists to develop ever better pharmaceutical products inspired by nature.</p>
