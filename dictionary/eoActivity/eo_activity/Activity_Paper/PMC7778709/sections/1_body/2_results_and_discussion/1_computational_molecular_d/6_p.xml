<p id="Par14">The results of the inhibitory binding affinities of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp (RTP site) are relatively the best among all the COVID-19 targets, thus the next goal was to extensively investigate the specific interactions with the amino acids of the active site(s) of this crucial polymerase in deeper details (using the data files obtained from the same web server). These deep investigations revealed the high degree of similarity of the expected anti-RdRp mode of action of the two ligands 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> as compared to that of remdesivir and its active metabolite (some of the interacting residues of the active pockets are the same and some others are very close) as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a–c. It was also found that 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> molecule has an apparent superiority over 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> and remdesivir (in its active metabolic form) molecules (together with the other two reference molecules) in the strength of inhibitory binding forces with RdRp (e.g., 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> has at least sixteen hydrogen bonds, more than four hydrophobic interactions, and at least one π-cation interaction; 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> has at least nine hydrogen bonds, five hydrophobic interactions, and two halogen interactions; while on the other hand, remdesivir active metabolite (the most active drug among the three references) has only less than nine hydrogen bonds, no considerable hydrophobic interactions, and only one π-cation interaction), supporting its expected promising comprehensive anti-SAR-CoV-2 activities. Exceptionally, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> is the only inhibitor among all the investigated compounds that strongly interacts with the RdRp complex structure (especially chain A) with that large number of hydrogen bonds (of all types) which exceeds sixteen bonds. According to the previous literature, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> can be considered the only compound that strongly binds with the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 in this extensively effective inhibitory mode, making it an optimal potent SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inhibitor candidate. Furthermore, this potential unique property gives 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> an extra advantage of having potent blocking nature in its action on the active site of the polymerase. On the other hand, 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> is the only inhibitor among all the investigated compounds that interacts with both chains A (nsp12) and C (nsp7) of the RdRp complex structure, since it, additionally, creates interaction forces of the hydrogen-bond/hydrophobic types with the polymerase cofactor chain C (mainly with the residues VAL12, SER15, GLN18, GLN19, and MET90). To the best of my knowledge, 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> can be predictably considered one of the rarest ligands that interacts with and inhibits more than one protein chain of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex (i.e., acts through a dual mode of action). 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> is also characterized by its unique interaction forces created between its chlorine atom and the residues LYS417 and ASP418 of chain A. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes all the main active amino acid residues involved in the inhibitory interactions of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold>, 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>, and remdesivir molecules, respectively.
