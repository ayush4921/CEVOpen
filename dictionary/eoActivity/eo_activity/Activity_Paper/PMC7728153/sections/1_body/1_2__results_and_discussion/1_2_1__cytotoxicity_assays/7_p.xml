<p>The contradictory results were observed for tansy and yarrow leaves. The metabolic activity increased while the adherence was lost. This effect could be caused by the higher amount of polyphenolic substances. In their investigation, Pagliacci et al. claimed that the polyphenolic flavonoid caused a decreased number of cells and cell cycle arrest of human breast cells while mitochondrial activity values were increased [

This observation may lead to underestimation of toxicity, thus more cytotoxicity assays are needed. For our experiment we decided to employ xCELLigence system for monitoring of cell response in real time. It is not a cytotoxic assay, but it provides important information about changes in cell proliferation and loss of adherence that may lead to death in adherent cells. Antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of tested extracts are attributed to sesquiterpene lactones, volatile oils, flavonoids and phenolic acids. Such effects have also been reported by many other authors [
