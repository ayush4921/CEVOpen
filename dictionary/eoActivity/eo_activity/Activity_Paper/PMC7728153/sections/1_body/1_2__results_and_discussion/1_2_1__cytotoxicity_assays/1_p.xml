<p>In vitro cytotoxicity assays, which utilise cell lines, are widely used for evaluation of cytotoxicity of natural substances and chemicals, as well as for drug screening. They are rapid, inexpensive and do not require the use of animals. Moreover, they are able to test a large number of samples. In our experiment, Real-Time Cell Analyser xCELLigence system (RTCA; ACEA Bioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) was employed. This instrument has broad application prospects in various fields, such as drug screening, and development, toxicology analysis, pathology analysis, and herbal medicine. It plays an important role in the area of modern pharmaceutical evaluation and analysis [

 <sup>Â®</sup>) which contain gold biosensors capable of monitoring the status of cells continuously and non-invasively in real time. The system gives information about behaviour of cells, their adherence, proliferation and change in morphology, and expresses them in a dimensionless unit: cell index (CI). The greater the CI, the greater the adhesion of cells [

Introducing the effector to cell culture induces the response of the target adherent cells and the corresponding activity (loss of adherence), which can be detected with great sensitivity and precision. Loss of adherence of adherent cells may lead to their death. The changes of CI were reported by generated real-time curves. The results are presented in
