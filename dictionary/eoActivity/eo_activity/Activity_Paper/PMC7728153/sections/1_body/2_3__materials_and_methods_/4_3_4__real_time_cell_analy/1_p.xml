<p>For monitoring of cell response after addition of tested substances, xCELLigence system (Real-Time Cell Analyser—RTCA; Acea Biosciences Inc., San Diego, USA) was used. This system utilises a series of microelectrodes embedded on the bottom of microtiter plate wells to measure the number of cells attached, cell viability and the size and morphology of cells. Measurement is based on impedance changes caused by cell interaction with microelectrodes. Changes are expressed by a dimensionless unit cell index (CI) and recorded in curves. This method was described in various studies [

Firstly, 100 µl of cell medium DMEM was added into 16-well plates covered with gold microelectrodes (E-plates, Roche, Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) for background measurements. Then, IPEC-1 cells (5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well in 50 µL of medium) were seeded into plates and inserted into plate station in an incubator kept inside a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and a humidified atmosphere. After 20 h, when cells were still within a log phase, the stock solutions of tested extracts were added to the cells (with cell medium at ratio 1:9) and the final concentrations were 125–1000 μg/mL. CI was recorded automatically by the RTCA system once per hour until the end of the experiment. Cells without the addition of extracts served as a control.
