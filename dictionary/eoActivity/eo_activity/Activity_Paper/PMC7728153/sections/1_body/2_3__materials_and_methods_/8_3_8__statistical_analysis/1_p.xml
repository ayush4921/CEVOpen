 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between the analysed herbal extracts based on the antioxidant activity and total phenolic compounds content were determined using one-way analysis (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. Statistically significant influence of extracts on metabolic activity of the IPEC-1 cells was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s test. The correlation between studied parameters was calculated using Pearson’s correlation test. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 13.1 software (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).
