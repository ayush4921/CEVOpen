<p>The dry plant material was grounded in a laboratory mill (A11 IKA, Germany) to obtain a homogenous drug powder. Drug material (2 g) was extracted for 30 min with 20 mL of 50% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) ethanol (Stanlab, Lublin, Poland) solution using an ultrasound-assisted method (U-504 Ultron, Moorpark, CA, USA). Subsequently, the extract was filtered through a paper filter. Ethanol was removed under vacuum using a rotary evaporator (Heidolph G3, Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) at 40 °C. The extracts were prepared in triplicates. Obtained ethanol-free water extract was frozen at −80 °C and lyophilised for 24 h using FreeZone 2.5 lyophilizer (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA). Lyophilised extracts were diluted in sterile water, shortly before the experiment, to the final concentrations of 125, 250, 500 and 1000 µg/mL.
