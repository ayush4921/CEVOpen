<p>Total phenolic content (TPC) was also measured using procedure described by Dżugan et al. [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In summary, 0.2 mL of plant extract was mixed with 1 mL Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (diluted 10x) and 0.8 mL of 7.5% 
 <italic>w/v</italic> sodium carbonate. After incubation at room temperature for 120 min, the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically (Biomate 3, Thermo, Madison, WI, USA) at 760 nm against blank. TPC was calculated based on calibration curve at the range 25–250 μg/mL. Results were expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents (GAE) per 1 g of dry weight of the extract.
