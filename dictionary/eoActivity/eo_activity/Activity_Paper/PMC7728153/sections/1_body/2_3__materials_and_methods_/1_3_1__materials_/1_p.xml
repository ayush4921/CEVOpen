<p>Plants: tansy (
 <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> L.), yarrow (
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> L.) and goldenrod (
 <italic>Solidago gigantea</italic> Ait.) were collected from a natural habitat (Rzeszów, Poland, 50°00′ N 22°01′ E) in September 2018 (minimum of ten plants per species). After botanical identification by authors based on morphological features of plants, the plant material was dried at room temperature, without exposure to sunlight. The voucher specimens were deposited in the Department archive (2018/09/TV1, 2018/09/AM1, 2018/09/SG1). Leaves of all species were analysed, and for goldenrod (which was collected at the flowering stage), flowers were also used. Chemicals used in TPC, DPPH and FRAP assays as well as analytical standards for chromatography were purchased form Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
