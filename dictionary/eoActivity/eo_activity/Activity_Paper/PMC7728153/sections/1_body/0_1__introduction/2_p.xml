Beekeepers, when producing enriched honey and herbal honeys, often use herbal additives based only on their own sense and experience, without taking into account the possible negative effects that could be caused by excessive consumption. A particularly controversial plant is tansy (not admitted by the EU as a food additive due to their use in no alimentary fields [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05517" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) and yarrow (containing bioactive component thujone, similar to tansy). Overdosing on these herbs may result in adverse effects, such as allergic reactions and dermatitis (yarrow) and abortifacient action (tansy) [
