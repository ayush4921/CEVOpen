<p>According to the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], around 5% of the population has anxiety and depression disorders. Plant medicine has shown wonders in the treatment of diseases, and traditional plant formulations have been well documented by many researchers [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Pharmacological reports using these traditional medicines are promising; the research on medicinal plants and neurological disorders are progressing worldwide [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. With an extensive research on the biological and clinical aspects of depression and anxiety and existing side effects of synthetic drugs, it has become possible to offer new treatment strategies using herbal medicine. The clinical importance of a plant can be related to its biologically active compounds present in them. These compounds are produced in plants as primary and secondary metabolites for the defense mechanism against pathogens, abiotic stress, and other similar adverse conditions [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Some of them such as polyphenols, flavonoids, terpenoids, catechins, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and beta-carotene may act as an effective nutraceutical supplement. Though their mechanism of actions is yet to be studied completely, their role in preventing the progression of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Alzheimer's disease are well evaluated [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These phytochemicals may exert their therapeutic effects as a single active compound or synergistically. Furthermore, additive action of crude extracts eliminates side effects associated with the predominance of a single xenobiotic compound, giving them a broad spectrum activity and reducing chances of developing resistance by pathogens [
