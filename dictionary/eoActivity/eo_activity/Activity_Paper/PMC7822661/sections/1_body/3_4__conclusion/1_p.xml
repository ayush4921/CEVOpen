<p>In the present study, an attempt was done to collect the commonly used traditional herbo-mineral formulations and their purification/detoxification or incineration techniques. The review illustrated different types of purification/detoxification or incineration techniques of minerals used in herbo-mineral preparations. In addition, there is an urgent need for comprehensive survey or evaluation to check whether purification/detoxification or incineration techniques of minerals are practiced properly in the country.</p>
