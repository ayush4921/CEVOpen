<p>Most of raw materials (metals/minerals) are collected from earth and there is a chance for mixing of impurities, toxins, and heterogeneous and unwanted substances to a large extent. Hence, these are subjected to various methods of purification and detoxification techniques (Shodhana) and incineration (
