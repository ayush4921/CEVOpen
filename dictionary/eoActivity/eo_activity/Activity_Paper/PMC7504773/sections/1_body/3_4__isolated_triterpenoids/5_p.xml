<p>Among the triterpenoids isolated from 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species, over 10 different skeletal structures have been identified. Tirucallane and euphane triterpenoids are most common and are specific to the genus, while cycloartane, lanostane, and other pentacyclic triterpenoids are not specific to the genus as they have been isolated in other plant families. In higher plants, triterpenes are believed to be biosynthesized via the mevalonate pathway in the presence of squalene synthase enzyme [
