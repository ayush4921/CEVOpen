<p>As a common feature, the biosynthesis of these triterpenoids follows a typical path of C-C ring formation followed by rearrangement or methyl shift reactions. These reactions result in the generation of diverse scaffolds with many stereocenters. Friedelin triterpenoids are examples of the highly rearranged triterpenoids in the genus. Others form alcohols via the incorporation of a hydroxyl group on the C-3 (3Î²-OH) and the formation of a double bond. Oleanane, ursane, and taraxanes are common examples of triterpenoids bearing a hydroxyl group at the C-3 and a double bond in the ring. In contrast, other plant species synthesize different types of unusual triterpenes scaffolds through uncommon reactions like the introduction of a ketone, formation of an oxide bridge, and ring cleavage. Ebracpenes A and B triterpenoids isolated from 
 <italic>E. ebracteolata</italic> are good examples of nor-triterpenoids, which have undergone ring cleavage, resulting into the formation of a rare C-seco ring. Others are oleanane type triterpenoids; euphorimaoid A and euphorimaoid B from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>E. pulcherrima</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These triterpenoids possess an epoxy, acetyl, and a hydroxyl side chain on the C-3, which are thought to enhance their biological activities.
