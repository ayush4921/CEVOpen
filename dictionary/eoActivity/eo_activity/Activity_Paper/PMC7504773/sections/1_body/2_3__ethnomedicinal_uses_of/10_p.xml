<p>However, despite most of the 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species considered as toxic, some species have been used as food. Documented reports describe the use of leaves, stems, roots, and in some cases, the whole plant being eaten as food for humans and animals. For instance, in Spain, the fresh latex of native 
 <italic>E. serrata</italic> is used to hasten the process of coagulating milk, while in Turkey, the latex of 
 <italic>E. stricta</italic> and 
 <italic>E. amygdaloides</italic> is used to clean water for domestic uses [

 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species. It is also believed that the toxic properties of honey could be enhanced by the addition of some 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species [
