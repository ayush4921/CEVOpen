<p>Therefore, triterpenoids can provide potential leads that can be developed into pharmaceutical compounds for a wide range of medicinal applications. However, there is scattered scientific reports about the anticancer activities of these constituents. Furthermore, there is lack of consolidation of the latest information and discoveries pertaining the anticancer properties of the isolated triterpenoids. Harnessing such information can provide a database of bioactive pharmacopeia or targeted scaffolds that can be advanced into more accessible and economical drugs with fewer side effects on normal cells.</p>
