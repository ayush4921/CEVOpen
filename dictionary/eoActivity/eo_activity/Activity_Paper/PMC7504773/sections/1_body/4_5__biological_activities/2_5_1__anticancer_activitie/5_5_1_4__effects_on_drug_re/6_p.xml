<p>In 2011, Sidambaram et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-04019" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] studied the anti-proliferative activities of the methanol extract of leaves of 
 <italic>E. hirta</italic> against HepG2 cells from the human epithelioma of the larynx. The results revealed that the dose of 625 Î¼g/mL of methanol extract showed anti-proliferative activity. The free radical, superoxide anion, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity using 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and cytotoxic activity against the human hepatoma cell line (SMMC-7721), human cervix epitheloid carcinoma cell line HeLa, and the human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901) of acetone root extracts of 
 <italic>E. hylonoma</italic> was also investigated. The results showed high antioxidant activities for acetone extract and a fraction of ethyl acetate.
