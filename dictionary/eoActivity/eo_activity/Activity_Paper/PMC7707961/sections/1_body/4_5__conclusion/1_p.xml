<p>The current investigation explored the chemical ingredients of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> VO, which revealed the presence of twenty phytochemicals, of which 1,6-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane 
 <bold>1</bold>, caryophyllene oxide 
 <bold>2</bold>, and 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-caryophyllene 
 <bold>3</bold> were the major compounds. The 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> VO displayed potent antimicrobial as compared with ciprofloxacin, Ampicillin, and fluconazole. Moreover, it showed potential cyclooxygenase inhibitory activity compared with celecoxib and has potential neuroprotective activity effect. However, further studies in vivo and clinical trial investigations are required to approve these findings and to establish suitable pharmaceutical formulations to be used as formal drugs or food supplements based on the 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> VO.
