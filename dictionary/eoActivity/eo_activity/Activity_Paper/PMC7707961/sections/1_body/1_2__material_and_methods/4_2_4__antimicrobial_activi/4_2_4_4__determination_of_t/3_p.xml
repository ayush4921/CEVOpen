 <italic>(2) Broth Microdilution</italic>. The first well consisted of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of RPMI, 1640 broth media, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO homogenously mixed while the second well only contained 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of RPMI and 1640 broth media. From the first well, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L was extracted and supplemented to the second well. This process was replicated for the 10 following wells yet leaving the last well as a positive control with only RPMI1640 broth. The 
 <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO at concentrations of 0.065 to 55 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was dispensed in the microwells to assess its antifungal properties.
