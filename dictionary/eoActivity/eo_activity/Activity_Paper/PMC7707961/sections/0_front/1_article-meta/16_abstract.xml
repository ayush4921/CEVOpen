 <p>The rise of the emergence of microbial resistance of antibiotics, the dangerous side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and noncompetent medications of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases prompt scientists to search for phytochemicals that could be utilized in the remedy of lethal diseases. 
  <italic>Glechoma curviflora</italic> (Boiss.) Kuntze (
  <italic>Nepeta curviflora</italic>) is a medicinal herb growing in the eastern parts of the Mediterranean Sea Basin and is widely consumed as a tea. The leaves of this plant have been traditionally used for the treatment of various infectious diseases. The current research was designed to identify the chemical composition of 
  <italic>Glechoma curviflora</italic> (Boiss.) essential oil (EO) and to assess its antibacterial, antifungal, and cyclooxygenase inhibitory activities and the biophysical gating effect on AMPA receptors. Twenty phytochemicals were identified from 
  <italic>G. curviflora</italic> leaves and flowers EO amounting to almost 100% of the total constituents using GC-MS technique, of which 1,6-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane (27.51%) 
  <bold>1</bold>, caryophyllene oxide (20.08%) 
  <bold>2</bold>, and 
  <italic>β</italic>-caryophyllene (18.28%) 
  <bold>3</bold> were the main constituents. The biophysical properties' effect from the plant extract on various AMPA-type receptors expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells was assessed by exploiting the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Microdilution assay was adopted for assessing the antimicrobial property against eight virulent microbial strains whilst the cyclooxygenase inhibition effect was accomplished utilizing COX inhibitory screening colorimetric assay 
  <italic>G. curviflora</italic> EO displayed potent activity against 
  <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MIC = 1.25 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), 
  <italic>S. sonnei</italic> (MIC = 3.12 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), and 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> (MIC = 1.25 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), compared with ciprofloxacin (positive control) and potent antibacterial activity against 
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>, MRSA, 
  <italic>S. sonnei</italic>, 
  <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
  <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> compared to Ampicillin (2nd positive control). It also showed anti-
  <italic>Candida</italic> (MIC = 6.25 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and antimold (MIC = 3.125 
  <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) activities compared with fluconazole (antifungal positive control). Likewise, our results showed an inhibition and biophysical impact of 
  <italic>G</italic>. curviflora on all AMPARs subunits.
