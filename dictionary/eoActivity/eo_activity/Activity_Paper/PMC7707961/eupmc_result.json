    "The rise of the emergence of microbial resistance of antibiotics, the dangerous side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and noncompetent medications of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases prompt scientists to search for phytochemicals that could be utilized in the remedy of lethal diseases. <i>Glechoma curviflora</i> (Boiss.) Kuntze (<i>Nepeta curviflora</i>) is a medicinal herb growing in the eastern parts of the Mediterranean Sea Basin and is widely consumed as a tea. The leaves of this plant have been traditionally used for the treatment of various infectious diseases. The current research was designed to identify the chemical composition of <i>Glechoma curviflora</i> (Boiss.) essential oil (EO) and to assess its antibacterial, antifungal, and cyclooxygenase inhibitory activities and the biophysical gating effect on AMPA receptors. Twenty phytochemicals were identified from <i>G. curviflora</i> leaves and flowers EO amounting to almost 100% of the total constituents using GC-MS technique, of which 1,6-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane (27.51%) <b>1</b>, caryophyllene oxide (20.08%) <b>2</b>, and <i>β</i>-caryophyllene (18.28%) <b>3</b> were the main constituents. The biophysical properties' effect from the plant extract on various AMPA-type receptors expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells was assessed by exploiting the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Microdilution assay was adopted for assessing the antimicrobial property against eight virulent microbial strains whilst the cyclooxygenase inhibition effect was accomplished utilizing COX inhibitory screening colorimetric assay <i>G. curviflora</i> EO displayed potent activity against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (MIC = 1.25 <i>μ</i>g/mL), <i>S. sonnei</i> (MIC = 3.12 <i>μ</i>g/mL), and <i>E. coli</i> (MIC = 1.25 <i>μ</i>g/mL), compared with ciprofloxacin (positive control) and potent antibacterial activity against <i>S. aureus</i>, MRSA, <i>S. sonnei</i>, <i>E. coli</i>, and <i>P. aeruginosa</i> compared to Ampicillin (2nd positive control). It also showed anti-<i>Candida</i> (MIC = 6.25 <i>μ</i>g/mL) and antimold (MIC = 3.125 <i>μ</i>g/mL) activities compared with fluconazole (antifungal positive control). Likewise, our results showed an inhibition and biophysical impact of <i>G</i>. curviflora on all AMPARs subunits."
