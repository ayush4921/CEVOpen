 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-03994" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, six isoflavones were detected, of which phlorizin and afzelechin were found in all samples. Genistein, prunetin, malonyglygenistin, and ononin were present at different levels in the samples. Malonyglygenistin was more abundant in GP petals than other samples, while genistein and prunetin were mainly enriched in GP petals and ononin was only found in the petals of RB and ZP.
