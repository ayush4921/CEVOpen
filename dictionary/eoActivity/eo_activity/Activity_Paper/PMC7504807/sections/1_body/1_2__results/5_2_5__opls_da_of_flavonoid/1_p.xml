<p>Orthogonal signal correction and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) is a multivariate statistical method used to screen out orthogonal metabolite variables that are irrelevant to categorical variables. As an important parameter for evaluating the models in OPLS-DA, Q
 <sup>2</sup> (predictability) values greater than 0.9 indicate a model with high explanatory power [

 <sup>2</sup> values of each pair exceeded 0.9, indicating that the OPLS-DA models were a good fit and could be used for further screening of differential flavonoid metabolites.
