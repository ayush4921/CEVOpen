<p>Total flavonoid content in the petals of the four 
 <italic>Chaenomeles</italic> species were measured and found that total flavonoid content of GP was significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) than others, reaching 481 ± 8 milligrams of rutin equivalents per 100 g fresh weight (mg RE/100 g FW) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03994-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This amount was nearly 3-fold higher than ZP and 5 fold higher than RB. Total flavonoid content of MY was the second highest at 444 ± 5 mg RE/100 g FW. RB had the lowest total flavonoid content, with 104 ± 10 mg RE/100 g FW.
