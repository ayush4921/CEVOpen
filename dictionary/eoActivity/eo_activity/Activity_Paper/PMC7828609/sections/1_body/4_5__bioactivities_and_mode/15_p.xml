<p>Ingestible polysaccharides are the main components of mushrooms that play a prebiotic role by modulating the composition of gut microbiota [

 <xref rid="B110-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] showed that polysaccharides from 
 <italic>Hymenopellis radicata</italic> (as 
 <italic>Oudemansiella radicata</italic>) were utilized by gut microbes to produce short-chain fatty acids during anaerobic fermentation of indigestible polysaccharides, therefore regulating the composition of gut microbiota. Hence the polysaccharides found in this mushroom cold be developed into a functional food that promotes intestinal health and prevents diseases.
