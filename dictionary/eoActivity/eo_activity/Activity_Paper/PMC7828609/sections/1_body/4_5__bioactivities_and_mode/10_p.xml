<p>The most commonly administrated drugs to reduce inflammation in the body are presently nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The negative effects of long-term use of these drugs, especially their significant side effects on the gastrointestinal tract, are well-known [

 <xref rid="B121-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Therefore, much effort has been devoted to the search for novel compounds as alternative anti-inflammatory agents that would be natural and safe, without the harmful side effects of NSAIDs [

 <xref rid="B2-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Compounds with highly diversified chemical structures and anti-inflammatory activities have been isolated and purified from different types of mushrooms. Mushrooms, such as those from the oudemansielloid genera, are rich in anti-inflammatory components, such as polysaccharides, phenolic and indolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B123-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of extracts is mostly coupled with anti-inflammatory effects. The enzymatic-mycelia polysaccharides and acid-hydrolysed mycelia polysaccharides from 
 <italic>Hymenopellis radicata</italic>, for example, have anti-inflammatory effect aside from the antioxidative and pulmonary protective activities of the mycelial selenium-enriched polysaccharides and mycelial polysaccharides from other studies [

 <xref rid="B118-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory and reno-protective effects of selenized mycelial polysaccharides from the same species have also been reported [
 <xref rid="B124-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Further studies should be conducted to identify and elucidate the bioactive compounds from OX genera responsible for its anti-inflammatory properties.
