<p>The best medium for liquid culture fermentation was glucose 20.0 g + sorghum powder 4.0 g + K
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub> 3.0 g + MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> 1.0 g + vitamin B1 2 tablets + distilled water 1000.0 mL, pH 6.5. The 12% of inoculum was grown in 2 L liquid having an optimum temperature of 25 Â°C, stirring speed 90 r/min, culture time 100 h, tank pressure 0.3 MPa and ventilation volume 0.9 m
 <sup>3</sup>/h. By using optimum conditions, the mycelium of the 
 <italic>O. raphanipes</italic> cultivated in the liquid medium had a fast growth rate, filling the bag in 29 days, with an average yield of 360.0 g per bag. The biological conversion rate reached 78%.
