<p>The artificial cultivation method of 
 <italic>Xerula pudens</italic> (CN104396561A) was patented by Houjiang et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] The culture medium was prepared by degumming, degreasing and curing of saw-dusts from pine and rubber trees. The medium comprised 85 to 92 parts of any sawdust or sawdust mixtures. Additives such as 5 to 10 parts of broad bean husks and 3 to 5 parts of bean pulp were incorporated into the medium. The water content was about 50â€“70%. The culture medium was placed in plastic bags and sterilized. After cooling, they were inoculated with the mycelial culture under aseptic conditions. The bags were covered with vermiculite for fructification. This method is low cost with high yield of fruiting bodies which could be extensively applied to large-scale cultivation and production of
