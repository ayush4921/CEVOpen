<p>So far the most thorough revision of the OX complex was provided by Petersen and Hughes [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and it is still widely accepted today [
 <xref rid="B11-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Based on taxonomic and phylogenetic analyses, 68 new taxa/or new combinations were proposed. The new arrangement included introduction of new genera (
 <italic>Hymenopellis, Paraxerula, Ponticulomyces</italic> and 
 <italic>Protoxerula</italic>) and reconfiguration of 
 <italic>Dactylosporina, Mucidula, Oudemansiella</italic> and 
 <italic>Xerula</italic>. For instance, 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic> and 
 <italic>Mucidula</italic> grow directly on wood without developing pseudo-rrhizae. Macroscopically, the basidiomata of 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic> differ from those of 
 <italic>Mucidula</italic> by lacking a persistent annulus on the stipe and the former genus can only be found in tropical areas. There are 142 records of names in Index Fungorum [
 <xref rid="B41-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], with 39 currently accepted species for 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic>. 
 <italic>Mucidula,</italic> on the other-hand, was introduced by Patouillard [
 <xref rid="B42-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and 14 records of the genus are presently listed, of which only 
 <italic>Mucidula brunneomarginata</italic> and 
 <italic>Mucidula mucida</italic> are currently accepted [
 <xref rid="B10-jof-07-00051" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="jof-07-00051-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows some specimens of 
 <italic>Oudemansiella</italic> collected from Thailand.
