<p>The present study concludes that hot aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> was sufficiently safe for human consumption at the cellular level. Hot aqueous extract had shown acute anticancer effects at a concentration of 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Cold aqueous extract of the fungus had anticancer potential as shown by its significant cytotoxic effect against A549 cells. The study shows that MRC5 cells had excellent survival performance when treated with hot and cold aqueous extracts. Further investigation through 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> cytotoxicity studies, which will validate the edibility and toxicity of this mushroom before being used for human consumption, is particularly crucial. The exploration effort at further unveiling the capability of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> is strongly recommended. The anticancer capabilities of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> need to be further investigated in various cancer types and stages, exploiting the mushrooms' full potential as a new alternative in pharmacological and medicinal applications.
