<p>A549 cell line showed lethal effects for all extracts' types of varying concentrations with variations in survival rates. The present study observed that proliferation rate of A549 cell line decreased in a time-dependent manner such that as time duration increased, inhibition rate increased. Cells treated with hot aqueous extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> were observed to have slower changes in proliferation rate as concentrations were increased. Significant toxicity effect was observed in time-dependent manner, the highest being at the highest concentration (1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) of hot aqueous extract, suggesting that growth of cancer cells could be inhibited by more than 30% as time was extended using hot aqueous mycelium extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml concentration. However, the survival rate of A549 cell line was significantly affected by cold aqueous compared to hot aqueous extract. The proliferation rate of A549 significantly decreased at higher concentrations (500 and 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) in a time-dependent manner as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The lethal effect of tamoxifen can be seen clearly on how the cells reacted towards different dosages of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen killed the cells directly and effectively compared to 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> extracts. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of tamoxifen was lower than both extracts of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic>. Cell survival rate decreased as concentration increased across all extracts applications.
