<p>Under an inverted microscope, changes in the morphological phase were observed for different treatments after 72 hr of exposure. Normal cells of MRC5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were observed as fibroblast cells flat, elongated, and spindle-shaped (aligned in parallel cluster). The application of hot extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> did not trigger any morphological changes on the cells. The proliferation rate of cells as well as untreated MRC5 cell growth was satisfactory. For cold extract of 
 <italic>D. mellea</italic> treatment, as the gradient concentrations changed (except at 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml concentration), the cells became thickened and round in shape, but adherent ability remained. Tamoxifen application caused significant variations in cell morphology in a dose-dependent manner where higher doses caused cell lysis and dead cells floating in the medium.
