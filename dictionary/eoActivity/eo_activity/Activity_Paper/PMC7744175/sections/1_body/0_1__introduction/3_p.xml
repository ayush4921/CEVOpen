<p>Natural products from biological organisms have served as favorable and affordable sources for new drug entities. These natural products have led to the development of numerous vaccines and other medicinal products [

However, some organisms, including mushrooms, are known to be poisonous to humans and animals, by virtue of the organisms' natural survival and defense system to sustain in the environment. Against this background, cytotoxicity study is important as a primary step in determining the potentials of biologically active compounds isolated from these organisms [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries, cytotoxicity study is considered a standard of procedure to establish toxicity level of any new drugs or products. Successful development of new discovery is dependent on these toxicity results, either minimal or nontoxic. In this regard, studies in cellular toxicity play a crucial role as a way of introducing new variety of edible organisms which are safe for human consumption and have the potential of exploiting their therapeutic components.
