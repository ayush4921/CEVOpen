<p>Cell culture and assay protocols were conducted in a biosafety cabinet Class 2. Two types of cell lines were used: MRC5 (normal human lung fibroblast) and carcinoma human lung epithelial (A549) previously obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Rosewell Park Memorial Institute) medium supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% of pen-strep (penicillin streptomycin), and 0.5% of fungizone. Both cells types were cultured in an incubator set at 37Â°C and humidified with 5% of CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. All cells were cultured in 2-day intervals. Growth responses were observed on a daily basis under an inverted microscope. Only cells at their exponential growth were used throughout the experiments.
