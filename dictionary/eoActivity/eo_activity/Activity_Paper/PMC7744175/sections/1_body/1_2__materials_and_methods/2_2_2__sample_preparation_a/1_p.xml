<p>Polypore mushroom specimens were collected from forested areas in Kepong, Selangor, Malaysia in April 2018 during a dry season. The sample was isolated for pure culture and deposited at the Agro-Biotechnology Institute (ABI) collection deposit centre with a voucher code ABI002. The mushroom species, 
 <italic>Donkioporiella mellea</italic>, was identified by mycologist (ABI) through morphological and molecular methods. The sequences obtained from the specimens were submitted to a GenBank database, an open access, annotated collection of all publicly available nucleotide sequences and their protein translations. The accession number was MT229067. Ten plugs of mycelia from agar culture were transferred into flasks containing 100 ml of mushroom complete medium (MCM) with some modifications. The flasks were placed on a rotary shaker and run at 150 rpm at 28°C for 14 days. Subsequently, the mycelia and culture broth were harvested and kept in a −80°C freezer overnight and dried by freeze-drying (Labconco freeze-dry machine) for 3 days. Mycelium biomass were mashed into fine powder for further extraction process.
