<p>Baicalin is a major component in SBR and exhibits various pharmacological activities, including antioxidative, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects [

 <xref rid="B28-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, SBR also exhibited potent antioxidant effects, as determined in the DPPH assay and lipid peroxidation assay. It is thought that the antioxidant effects of SBR are mediated by Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes. It is well-known that Nrf2 is a key regulator of oxidative stress and baicalin ameliorates oxidative stress and apoptosis during endothelial impairment, liver injury, and brain injury by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidative pathway [

 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In particular, their anti-inflammatory effects are mediated via the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B13-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, we confirmed that the expression of key NF-κB signaling pathway intermediaries, i.e., COX2, IL6, and TNF-α was decreased in this study. Interestingly, GenoTX-407 exhibited the most potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Apparently, the synergic effect of GenoTX-407 is the result of Nrf2 upregulation by SBR extract and inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway by MOB extract. It has been reported that the activation of Nrf2 attenuates the NF-κB-induced inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B35-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, GenoTX-407 exhibited lower cytotoxicity than SBR and MOB, likely due to a relatively low dose.
