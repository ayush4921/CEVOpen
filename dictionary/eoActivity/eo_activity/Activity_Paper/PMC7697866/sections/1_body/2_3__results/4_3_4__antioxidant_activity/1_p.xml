<p>The antioxidant activities of SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407 were examined using lipid peroxidation and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-01111-f003">Figure 3</xref>, an increase (74%) in TBARS levels was observed after exposure to FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (50 µM). However, treatment with various concentrations (0–500 μg/mL) of SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-406 significantly reduced lipid peroxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. Similarly, in the DPPH assay, the treatments significantly increased radical scavenging activity in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, the results showed that GenoTX-407 had a higher capacity to reduce lipid peroxidation and DPPH (EC
 <sub>50</sub>, 7.7 µg/mL and 26.4 µg/mL) than SBR (107.7 µg/mL and 38.3 µg/mL), and MOB (62.4 µg/mL and 72.5 µg/mL). However, in the DPPH assay, all the treatments were less potent than the treatment agent used in positive control, ascorbic acid (14.4 µg/mL). In the western blot analysis, the expression of the antioxidative enzymes SOD1 and CAT, as well as Nrf2 and HO-1, was markedly upregulated in response to treatments with SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407. Notably, GenoTX-407 treatment (100 µg/mL) resulted in higher upregulation of these enzymes compared to SBR (100 µg/mL) and MOB (20 µg/mL).
