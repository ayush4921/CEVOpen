<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined for the microbial strains that were sensitive to the extracts in the agar disk diffusion assay. Test microbial strains were incubated using broth media. The absorbances of the cultured suspensions were measured at 660 nm using a spectrophotometer and diluted to attain viable cell counts of 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL for bacteria and 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL for yeast and fungi. The extracts were dissolved in DMSO, then diluted to the highest stock concentration (100 mg/mL), followed by serial two-fold dilutions to obtain stocks with concentrations ranging from 0.0031 to 50 mg/mL in 10 mL sterile test tubes containing DMSO. The MIC values of the extracts against bacterial strains or yeasts were determined using a previously described microwell dilution method with some modifications [
