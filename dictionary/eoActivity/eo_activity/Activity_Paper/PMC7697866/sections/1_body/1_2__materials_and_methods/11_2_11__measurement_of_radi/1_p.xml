<p>The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) radical scavenging activity of pyrogallol was measured as described previously [
 <xref rid="B21-antioxidants-09-01111" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Specifically, various concentrations of SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407 (0–1000 µg/mL) were dissolved in distilled water, and 10 µL from the resulting solutions was dispensed into separate wells in a 96-well plate, then 190 µL of 200 mM DPPH in methanol was added to the wells. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and the absorbances of the reaction mixtures were measured at 517 nm with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). DPPH radical scavenging activity was expressed using the following formula: % scavenging activity = (control absorbance—sample absorbance)/control absorbance × 100. Ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a reference control. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
