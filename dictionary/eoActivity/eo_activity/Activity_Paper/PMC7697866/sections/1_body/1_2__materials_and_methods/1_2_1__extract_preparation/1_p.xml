<p>Dried SBR and MOB were purchased from Phytoway Inc. (Hunan, China). The dried roots and barks were then separately ground using a laboratory rotor mill pulviresette (Laval Lab Inc., Laval, QC, Canada), and the pulverized products were sterilized by spraying them with 70% ethanol, followed by drying at 80 °C for 24 h and storage at 4 °C. All extract preparation steps were performed separately for SBR and MOB.</p>
