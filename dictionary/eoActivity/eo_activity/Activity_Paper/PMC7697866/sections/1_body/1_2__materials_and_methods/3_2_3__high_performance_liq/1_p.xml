<p>Each sample was weighed in a volumetric flask and 50 mL of 10% methanol was added. The solution was then sonicated for 60 min. After cooling, the solution was filtered using a 0.2 μm syringe filter (PVDF, Whatman plc, Maidstone, UK) and injected into the ACQUITY ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system (Waters Co., Milford, MA, USA), which was equipped with a binary solvent delivery pump, an autosampler, and a photodiode array detector. The output signal was monitored at a wavelength of 276 nm and processed using Empower 2 software (Waters Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA). Chromatographic separation was performed using a Supelco Discovery C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm; Supleco, Taiwan, ROC). The column and autosampler tray temperatures were maintained at 25 °C. For SBR extract and GenoTX-407, the mobile phases A and B were 1% H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> (

 <italic>v</italic>) and CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN, respectively. Gradient elution was performed as follows: 0–10 min with 5–50% solvent B, 10–20 min with 50–70% solvent B, 20–50 min with 70–100% solvent B. For MOB extract and GenoTX-407, the mobile phases A and B were Water and Methanol, respectively. Gradient elution was performed as follows: 0–10 min with 5–50% solvent B, 10–20 min with 50–70% solvent B, 20–50 min with 70–100% solvent B.
