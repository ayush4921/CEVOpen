<p>In 96-well plates, 185 µL of broth and 5 µL of the inocula were dispended into each well. Then, 10 µL of extract dissolved in DMSO (0.0031–100 mg/mL) was added into each well. The final volume in each well was 200 µL and the final concentrations of the extracts ranged from 0.153–5000 µg/mL. The contents of each well were thoroughly mixed using a multichannel pipette and the microplates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h for bacterial strains and at 30 °C for 2 to 5 days for yeast and fungi. Microbial cell viability and MIC values were determined by observing the turbidity of the suspension post-incubation. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of the extracts were determined by taking a loopful of inoculum from each well of the microtiter plates with clear contents and streaking it onto the specific agar plates for bacterial and yeast species. The bacteria and yeast-streaked plates were incubated under the same respective incubation conditions as described previously. Then, the lowest concentrations of the extracts that inhibited growth of bacteria or yeast were considered as the MBCs.</p>
