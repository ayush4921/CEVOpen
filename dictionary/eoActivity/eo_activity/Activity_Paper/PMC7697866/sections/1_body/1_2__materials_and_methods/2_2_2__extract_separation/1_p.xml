<p>To optimize the extraction of baicalin from SBR and magnolol and honokiol from MOB, different ethanol concentrations and time periods were tested (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-antioxidants-09-01111">Tables S1 and S2</xref>). In addition, SBR extraction with different concentrations of phosphoric acid for different time periods was tested. MOB was fractionated with different solvents (butanol, chloroform, acetone, and hexane) for different time periods. Extracts were then obtained using the optimal conditions, as described below.
