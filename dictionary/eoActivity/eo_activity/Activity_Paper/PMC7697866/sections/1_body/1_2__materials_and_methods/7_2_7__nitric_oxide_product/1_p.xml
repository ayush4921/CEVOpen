<p>RAW264.7 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL) were seeded in a 24-well tissue culture plate and pre-incubated at 37 °C for 12 h to achieve stable attachment. Next, the wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), refreshed with media containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 µg/mL), SBR (25, 50, and 100 µg/mL), MOB (5, 10, and 20 µg/mL), and GenoTX-407 (20 and 100 µg/mL), and incubated for 24 h. Nitric oxide (NO) production was then monitored by measuring nitrite levels in the culture media using the Griess Reagent System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).
