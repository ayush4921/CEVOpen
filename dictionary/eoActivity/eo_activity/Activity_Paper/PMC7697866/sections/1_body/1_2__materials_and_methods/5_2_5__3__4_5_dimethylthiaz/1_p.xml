<p>The cytotoxicity of SBR, MOB, and GenoTX-407 was determined via the MTT assay. Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL) were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate. After 24 h incubation at 37 °C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>/95% air atmosphere, the cells were treated with various concentrations (0–1000 µg/mL) of SRB and MOB extracts and GenoTX-407, then further incubated for 24 h. The cells were then washed twice with a fresh medium, followed by the addition of 10 μL of MTT (5 mg/mL in DMEM) and incubation for an additional 2 h. The medium was discarded, and the formazan formed in the living cells was dissolved in 50 μL DMSO. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm within 30 min using a microplate reader. The experiments were performed in triplicate and mean and standard deviation values were calculated.
