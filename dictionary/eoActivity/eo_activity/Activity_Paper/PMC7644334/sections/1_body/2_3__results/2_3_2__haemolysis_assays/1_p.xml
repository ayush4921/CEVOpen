<p>Haemolytic activity of 
 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> leaf extracts was assessed against sheep erythrocytes to determine the effect of the plant on erythrocyte membrane integrity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The activity of the plant extracts was expressed in percentage haemolysis and reported as mean ± standard deviation of three replicates. Plant extracts are considered toxic to red blood cells if the percentage haemolysis is above 30% [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All extracts exhibited low haemolytic activity as activity in all extracts was less than 10% (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The saponin-enriched fraction had the highest percentage haemolysis of 12.2% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). All extracts showed a dose-dependent increase in haemolytic activity.
