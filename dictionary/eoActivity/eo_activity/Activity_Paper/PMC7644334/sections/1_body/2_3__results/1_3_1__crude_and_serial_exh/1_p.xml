<p>Serial exhaustive extraction had a higher percentage yield than crude extraction. Crude extraction had a percentage yield of 5.51%, and serial exhaustive extraction had a total percentage yield of 18.81%. The methanol extract had the highest percentage yield, with the hexane extract having the least yield. Three fractions of phytochemicals were isolated from crude ethanolic extract of
