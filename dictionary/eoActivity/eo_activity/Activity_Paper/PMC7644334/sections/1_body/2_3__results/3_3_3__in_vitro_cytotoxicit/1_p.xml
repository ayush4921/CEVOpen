<p>The extracts and phytochemical-enriched fractions obtained from 
 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> leaves were tested for cytotoxic activity against immune cells obtained from mice peritoneal cavity. This assessment measures cell death, inhibition of cell growth, or cell proliferation. Reduction of cell viability by more than 30% is considered a cytotoxic effect [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A typical MTT assay plate is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. All 
 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> extracts had no significant cytotoxic activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) when compared to results for cells only. Of note, was the water extract which exhibited significant proliferative activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of the murine immune cells at all extract concentrations (
