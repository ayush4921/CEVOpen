<p>Male BALB/c mice of 8 weeks old were obtained from the Animal House at the University of Zimbabwe (Harare, Zimbabwe). The intraperitoneal route was used to inject 6 mice with a volume of 1 ml of 20% starch solution. The mice were left for 24 h to increase the number of cells in the peritoneal cavity. Each mouse was euthanised by cervical dislocation. The mouse was sprayed with 70% ethanol and mounted on a styrofoam board on its back. The outer skin was cut to expose the inner skin in the peritoneal cavity. A volume of 5 ml of cold PBS containing 3% FBS was injected into the peritoneal cavity taking care not to puncture any organs. Cells were withdrawn using a 10 ml syringe, and collected cells were put into tubes and kept on ice. The collected cell suspension was centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in RPMI. Cells containing blood were thrown away as they had been contaminated. Cells of a volume of 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l were mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue staining dye and counted manually using a haemocytometer counting chamber under a Celestron digital light microscope (Celestron, Los Angeles, USA) to determine the number of viable cells. The cells were incubated for overnight at 37°C and at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a Shel Lab incubator (Sheldon Manufacturing, Inc., Cornelius, USA).
