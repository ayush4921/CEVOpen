<p>The alkaloids, flavonoids, and saponins were isolated from 
 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> leaves according to the methods by Aslantürk [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. From the crude ethanolic extract powder, an equal mass of the extract was put into three different labelled tubes. In tube 1, the powder was mixed with ammonia solution and extracted with 80% methanol for 10 minutes in a water bath at 40°C, to extract alkaloids. The powder in tube 2 was heated with 80% methanol on a water bath at 40°C for 10 min to isolate flavonoids. The extracts were filtered through Whatman No. 1 (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, Steinheim, Germany) and the filtrates were concentrated by air-drying under a fan and stored at 4°C. For saponins isolation, the plant sample was mixed with 20% aqueous ethanol and heated in a water bath for 90 min at 55°C. The mixture was filtered first with cotton wool followed by the use of Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, Steinheim, Germany), and the residue was re-extracted with 20% ethanol. Filtrates were mixed. An equal volume of diethyl acetate was added, and re-extraction was carried out by partitioning until the aqueous layer became clear. Saponins were extracted using 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol and washed using 5% aqueous sodium chloride. The resulting saponins sample was fan-dried, physically analysed, and stored at 4°C.
