<p>Lectins, a group of phytochemicals extracted with water, also stimulate the proliferation of T cells and B cells. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins that are found in plants. Lectins such as Con-A, originally isolated from jack bean (

The water extract, with a cocktail of immunostimulatory phytochemicals, can potentially be used to develop phytochemicals that may be used in cancer therapy or as adjuncts to therapy.
