<p id="Par19">Germ tube formation and biofilm integrity in 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> are important virulence factors that allow the transition from a superficial mycosis to a systemic infection. Overall, our results show that 
 <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil presents antivirulent potential against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> since it was able to inhibit both of these features. The possibility of targeting virulence factors at non-growth inhibitory concentrations is a promising therapeutic strategy, particularly because it may reduce the toxicity of antifungal therapy simultaneously reducing not only the selective pressure for the emergence of resistance among pathogenic fungi but also the impact on the hostâ€™s natural microbiota
