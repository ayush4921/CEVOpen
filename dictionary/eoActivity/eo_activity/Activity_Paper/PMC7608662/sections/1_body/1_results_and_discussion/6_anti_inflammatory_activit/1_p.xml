<p id="Par20">LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) were used as an in vitro model of acute inflammation. Briefly, LPS, a 
 <italic>Toll-like</italic> receptor 4 agonist and a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, acts upstream of the NF-κB signaling pathway inducing the phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitory protein κB (IκB). Once released from inhibition, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus activating the transcription of genes coding for the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), two pro-inflammatory enzymes, among others. iNOS catalyzes the synthesis of NO through oxidation of L-arginine and COX-2 the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
