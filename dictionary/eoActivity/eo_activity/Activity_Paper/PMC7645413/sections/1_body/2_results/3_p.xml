<p id="par0065">The biopotency of 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> extracts were determined by alpha glucosidase, heat induced haemolysis and brine shrimp biolethality bioassay. The extracts of 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> demonstrated dose dependent toxicity (brine shrimp lethality bioassay), anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities (

 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The anti-inflammatory activity of the 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> were as follows methanol (t = 0.02) &gt; chloroform (t = 0.001) &gt; acetone (t = 0.001) &gt; petroleum ether (t = 0.001) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). 100 μg/mL of standard indomethacin was dispalyed 71.43 % inhibition. A strong correlation (r = 0.998) between chloroform and petroleum ether extracts of 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> and anti-inflammatory activities was attained. Next to that r = 0.996 correlation coeeficient was obtained between acetone and anti-inflammatory activities. Correlation coeeficient of r = 0.967 was obtained between methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> and anti-inflammatory activities. The correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). The anti-diabetic properties of the 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> were as follows methanol (t = 0.000) &gt; acetone (t = 0.003) &gt; chloroform (t = 0.000) &gt; petroleum ether (t = 0.004) (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). 78 % of activity was observed in the standard acarbose at 500 μg/mL. A strong positive correlation (r = 0.973) was obtained between methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> and anti-diabetic activities, r = 0.987 for chloroform, r = 0.963 for acetone and r = 0.958 for petroleum ether. The cytotoxicity of the 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> were as follows chloroform (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 25.52 μg/mL; t = 0.003) &gt; petroleum ether (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 36.99 μg/mL; t = 0.009) &gt; methanol (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 44.26 μg/mL; t = 0.008) &gt; acetone (LC
 <sub>50</sub> = 55.9 μg/mL; t = 0.003) (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The standard plumbagin showed 100 % mortality of brine shrimp nauplii at 0.046 mg/mL. A strong positive correlation (r = 0.985) was observed between concentrations of methanolic extracts and cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic>, r = 0.946 for chlorofom, r = 0.986 for acetone and r = 0.993 for petroleum ether. The studied extracts of 
 <italic>T. paradoxa</italic> showed significant lethality against brine shrimp (Table 2;
