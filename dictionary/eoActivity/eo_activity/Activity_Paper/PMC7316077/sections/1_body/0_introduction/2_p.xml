<p>There are many plants-derived bioactive constituents of medicinal importance for human and animal health, for instance; traditionally, a mixture of powdered roots of 
 <italic>Cassia occidentalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Derris brevipes</italic> is used to control female fertility. Preliminary phytochemical studies indicated the presence of steroids, terpenoids, flavonoids and glycosides in the ethanolic extracts of these two plants. These compounds are known to exhibit anti-fertility activity (

 <italic>Dendrophthoe falcata</italic> for example contains cardiac glycosides, flavonoids and pentacyclic triterpenes. 
 <italic>D.Â falcata</italic> has been utilized as an anti-fertility agent for women. The aerial part is also used to induced abortion (
