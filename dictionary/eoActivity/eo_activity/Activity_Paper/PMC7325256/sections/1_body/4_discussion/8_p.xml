<p id="Par67">The combined effect of antidiarrhoeal agents was generally investigated by calculating ADI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. As presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, ADI values showed the dose-dependent nature of each parameter. The highest dose of the crude extract showed highest ADI as compared with corresponding doses and also better than the standard drug. This might be due to its better potential in prolongation of onset of diarrhoea, decrement of peristaltic movement and halting of purging frequency in the GI system as compared with the standard drug and respective doses.
