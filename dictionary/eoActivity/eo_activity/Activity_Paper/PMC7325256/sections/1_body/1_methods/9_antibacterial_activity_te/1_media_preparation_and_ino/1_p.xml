<p id="Par38">The standard bacterial medium was prepared and used according to the manufacturers’ guidelines. According to the Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI), the bacterial turbidity of each species was prepared and standardized. The turbidity of the inoculum tube was adjusted visually by the naked eye against a 0.5 McFarland turbidity equivalence with white background and contrasting black lines in the presence of adequate light by either adding colonies or sterile normal saline solution. It is assumed to contain a bacterial concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL. Then, the standardized suspension was used within 15 min of its preparation [
