<p id="par0225">Histological study shows the cytoarchitecture of three regions of the brain. There are marked alterations in morphological characteristics in the cerebrum, midbrain and cerebellum of the group of rats administered with nitrobenzene only. The control group and group treated with 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> and vitamin E showed no changes or alterations in their morphological characteristics. The mid brain and cerebellum of the toxicant group showed observable gradual loss of cytoplasmic contents and degenerative changes like clustered pyknotic (irreversible condensation of the chromatin) pyramidal neurons was seen at the cerebral cortex. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is characterized by pyknosis. Therefore, the feature exhibited in the cerebral cortex can be explained as altered rate of apoptosis, this can lead to excessive presence and accumulation of dead neuronal cells. This histological finding corroborates the biochemical results.
