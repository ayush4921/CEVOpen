<p id="par0180">The upsurge in the prevalence of neurotoxicity induced by exposure to harmful chemicals is a major global health challenge [

Several characteristic factors such as dopamine depletion, increase in oxidative stress, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, genetic mutations, aggregation of toxic misfolded proteins, proteosomal dysfunction, decrease in acetylcholine (ACh), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain are involved in aetiology of NDs [

 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Preclinical trials on drug candidates have revealed several mechanisms underlying the observed neuroprotective effects of medicinal plants and their extracts, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and specific neurotrophic mechanisms [
