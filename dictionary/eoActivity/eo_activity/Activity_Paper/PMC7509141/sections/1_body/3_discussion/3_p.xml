<p id="par0185">This present study demonstrated that methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> has remarkable protective effects in the treatment of biochemical and neurobehavioural deficits in rats exposed to neuro-toxicants. Results from this study revealed that there was a drastic reduction in brain weight of rats administered with nitrobenzene alone with concomitant decrease in the total body weight gained. Several experimental reports have demonstrated chemical toxicities lead to significant brain and body weight loss in rats if left untreated over time [

 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The observed reduction in the brain and body weight can be caused by depletion of nutrients, alteration of metabolic activities or pathways and inhibition in protein synthesis [

 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> or vitamin E significantly increase both the brain and body weight of the rat to normal. This suggested the ability of the extract to improve metabolic activities and enhance protein synthesis in the brain.
