<p id="par0035">The occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) is progressively increasing around the globe with more than 46.8 million people suffering from different kinds of the diseases. It is estimated that more than 10 million individuals with NDs will be domiciled in the top 10 most populous nation in the world including Nigeria by 2030 [

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is of two types: sporadic PD which is more than 90 % cases and familial PD. More than 20 genes have been implicated in parkinsonism [

Mutation in UCHL1 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 1), Parkin, DJ-1 or PINK1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) has been reported to cause autosomal recessive while autosomal dominant is caused by genetic mutation in α-syn or LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) [

 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In both sporadic and familial types of the PD, α-Syn is considered a fundamental protein that participates in the molecular pathogenesis of the disease [
