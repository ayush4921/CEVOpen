<p id="par0075">Phytochemical analysis was carried out on methanol leaf extract of 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina</italic> using standard procedures as described by Harborne [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Procedure of Van Buren and Robinson [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] was followed for the quantification of tannin content. The total phenol content was determined according to Singleton et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] while total terpenoids in the extract was determined by method of Ferguson [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Alkaloids were quantified by following the procedure of Harborne [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Saponins were quantified following the methodology of Obadoni and Ochuko [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and total flavonoid content was determined according to protocol described by Meda et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].
