<p>Recent studies have shown that there is no single method of assessment of antioxidant activity as each antioxidant activity is quantitatively and accurately distinguished by its mechanism of action. The results obtained showed significant antioxidant activities of different parts of

 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) Maire with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 0.03 to 1.19 mg/mL compared to butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), ascorbic acid, and Trolox (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.009, 0.019, and 0.003 mg/mL, respectively) (

 <sub>50</sub> of 0.033 ± 0.001 mg/mL and that the Rm sample with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.18 ± 0.005 mg/mL was the least active when compared to the other samples. These results were concordant with those of the ABTS test. The reducing power of the samples studied depends on the dose; the results showed that the Gf sample was the most reducing, whereas Rm had the lowest activity (1.19 ± 0.005 mg/mL). The Rm sample had the highest total antioxidant activity with a content of 708.74 ± 11.63 mg AAE/g, while the Cf sample had the lowest activity value (160.33 ± 10.23 AAE/g). These findings were in accordance with those reported in a work by Cherrat et al. investigating chemical content in the genera Anacyclus [
