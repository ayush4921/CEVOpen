<p>The extracts of different parts (roots, seeds, leaves, and capitula) of 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> (L.) and 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) Maire were analyzed by GC-MS after silylation. As shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00149-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00149-f001">Figure 1</xref>, GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of twenty-two compounds in the extracts studied. The results of the chemical analysis show that the two varieties share the same compounds except for the 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-2,4-heptadiene-6-monoynamide and cinnamic acid compounds, which were detected in 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> only. The detection of thiadiazolo [5,4-d] pyrimidin-7-amine and 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-2,4-undecadiene-8,10-diynamide compounds were limited to 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) only. Indeed, the chemical analysis of 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> extracts revealed the presence of 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-dodeca-2,4,8,10-tetraenamide; 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-2,4-octadiene-6-monoynamide; levulinic acid; malonic acid; palmitic acid; morphinan-6-one; 4,5Î±-epoxy-3-hydroxy-17-methyl; 2,4-undecadiene-8,10-diyne-
 <italic>N</italic>-tyramide; dodeca-2E,4E; nE-trienoic acid; and 4-hydroxyphenylethylamide compounds in all parts studied (roots, seeds, leaves, and capitula), whereas the variety 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> was distinguished by the presence of 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-dodeca-2,4,8,10-tetraenamide; levulinic acid; palmitic acid; and 2,4-undecadiene-8,10-diyne-
 <italic>N</italic>-tyramide compounds. Chromatographic analysis of the studied extracts affirmed the presence of several components in the capitula, leaves, and seeds of 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> (L.) and 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) that may be involved in antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
