<p>The yield (appearance and color) of each extract is represented in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00149-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The results showed that the hydro-ethanol extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> (L.) varieties have two aspects: pasty and powdery with two different colors (green and brown). The maximum yield was obtained from 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> root extracts (16%), followed by the leaves and capitula extracts (14%), while the seeds presented the lowest yield (10%). In contrast, the extraction from 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) Maire presented the lowest yield (capitula: 6%; roots: 13%).
