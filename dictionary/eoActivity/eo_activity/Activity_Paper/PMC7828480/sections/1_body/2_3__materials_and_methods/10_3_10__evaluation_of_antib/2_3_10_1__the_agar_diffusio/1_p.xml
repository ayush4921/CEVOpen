<p>The antimicrobial activity of extracts was determined by the agar diffusion method as described by Imtara et al. with some modifications [
 <xref rid="B67-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In short, sterile discs with a diameter of 6 mm were aseptically impregnated with extracts (200 mg/mL) and then placed on Petri dishes inoculated with 100 μL pre-prepared bacterial culture before being incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Amoxicillin and streptomycin were used as positive controls, and the sterile distilled water was used as a negative control. The tests were triplicated, and the results were given by measuring the inhibition zone (mm) of bacterial growth around the discs.
