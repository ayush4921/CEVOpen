<p>Of course, plants traditionally used as anthelmintics by local healers do not necessarily show anthelmintic activity in

 <italic>C. elegans</italic> does not correlate perfectly with activity against parasitic nematodes, it remains a useful preliminary test. Some plant extracts that do not exhibit direct anthelmintic activity may act as an irritant of the gastrointestinal tract and expel worms from the intestines that way.
