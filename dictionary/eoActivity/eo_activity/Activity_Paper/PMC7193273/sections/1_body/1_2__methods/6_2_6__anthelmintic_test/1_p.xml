<p>The anthelmintic assay was carried out in a 96-well microplate with flat-bottom wells in a WMicrotracker (Phylumtech, Argentina) apparatus, as described in our previous study [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The movement of worms in each well was measured every 30 minutes for 16 h at 20°C and recorded by the WMicrotracker. The percentage of the average movement within 16 hours of worms exposed to samples, compared to a DMSO control, was used to calculate the relative anthelmintic activity. Levamisole (50
