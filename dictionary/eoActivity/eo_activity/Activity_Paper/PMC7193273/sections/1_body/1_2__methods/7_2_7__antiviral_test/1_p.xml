<p>Antiviral activity was tested as described earlier [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The final, maximal DMSO concentration in the assay wells with the highest sample input (1%) was well tolerated by the cells. Rupintrivir was used as a positive control. All data were expressed as EC
 <sub>50</sub>, CC
 <sub>50</sub>, and SI. For cytotoxicity assays, plant extracts (only those that showed antiviral activity) were evaluated by the MTS method. In brief, the same experimental setup was used as for the antiviral assay; except for cytotoxicity determination, uninfected cultures were incubated with a serial dilution of plant extract for three days at 37°C. “The cytotoxic concentration was calculated as CC
 <sub>50</sub> or the concentration of plant extracts required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the solvent-treated controls. The formula used to calculate cytotoxic activity was % CPE = [OD
 <sub>cc</sub> − OD plant extract]/OD
 <sub>cc</sub>, where OD
 <sub>cc</sub> corresponds to the optical density of the uninfected and untreated cell cultures, and OD plant extract corresponds to the OD of uninfected cultures, treated with the extract. In addition, the selectivity index (SI) was calculated as the ratio of CC
 <sub>50</sub> for cell growth to EC
 <sub>50</sub> (CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>)” [
