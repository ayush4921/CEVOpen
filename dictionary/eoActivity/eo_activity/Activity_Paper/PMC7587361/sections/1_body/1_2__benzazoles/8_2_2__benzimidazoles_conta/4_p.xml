<p>Notably, a new series of benzimidazole analogues was designed by Reddy et al. by combining benzimidazole with other heterocycles such as pyrazole in what is called hybrid molecules wherby this hybridization is believed to improve the biological activity of molecules. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated against three human tumor cell lines: lung (A549), breast (MCF-7), cervical (HeLa) and against normal keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) growth inhibition assay. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies of these hybrids concluded that the compounds with mono-substituted halogen (fluorine, chlorine, and bromine) on benzimidazole e.g., compound 
 <bold>30</bold> with a fluorine appendage showed potent cytotoxicity against tested cancer cell lines [

 <sub>3</sub>) substitution at position-6 of benzimidazole resulted in moderate to lower cytotoxic activity.
