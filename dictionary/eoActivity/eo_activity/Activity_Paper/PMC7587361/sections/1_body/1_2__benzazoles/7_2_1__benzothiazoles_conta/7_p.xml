<p>Spadaro et al. synthesized a series of benzothiazole derivatives targeting inhibition of 17β-HSD1 which is a novel target for estrogen-dependent diseases [
 <xref rid="B134-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. As they introduced different substituents with different electronic, lipophilic, steric, and H-bonding properties, they came out with two new lead compounds. The one in the amide series 
 <bold>19</bold> shows that the difluoro-derivative in the benzoyl moiety increases the inhibitory activity of the compound to reach (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 5 nM). This can be explained due to many factors; first, the favorable electronic effects applied by the fluorine on the H-bonding property of the OH, second, to the increased lipophilicity, or to the change in π-interacting properties of the aromatic ring.
