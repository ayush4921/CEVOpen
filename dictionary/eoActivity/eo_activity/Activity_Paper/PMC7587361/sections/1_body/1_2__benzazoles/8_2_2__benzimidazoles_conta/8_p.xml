<p>The cytotoxicity of the targeted bis-benzimidazoles were investigated against human tumor cell lines, which are cervix carcinoma cell line (HeLa), breast carcinoma cell line (MCF7) and brain glioma cell line (U87) in comparison to Hoechst and Camptothecin as a reference compound. The study showed remarkable cytotoxicity to human cancer cell lines, IC50 values of 5.5 μM against MCF7 and (IC50; 1.5 μM) in HeLa. Upon investigation of the inhibitory activity against purified human topoisomerase I, the bis-benzimidazoles exhibited effective enzyme inhibition even at low concentration of 25 μM.</p>
