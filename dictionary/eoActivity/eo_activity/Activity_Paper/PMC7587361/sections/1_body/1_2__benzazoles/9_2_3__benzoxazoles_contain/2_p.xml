<p>Aiello et al. prepared a new class of fluorinated 2-ayl benzoxazoles, benzothiazoles and chromen-4-ones and evaluated their activity against MCF-7 and MDA 468 breast cancer cell lines and compared its activity to the known antitumor benzothiazole 
 <bold>38</bold> [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Compound 
 <bold>38</bold> is well known as a potent (GI
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 0.1 nM) and selective in vitro antitumor agent in human cancer cell lines. The SAR study of these compounds shows that the presence of fluorine moiety is essential for the growth-inhibitory activity since the elimination of it or replacement of it with other halogens diminishes the inhibition ability. Although some benzoxazole derivatives 
 <bold>39, 40</bold> showed excellent potency, theirs is lower than the antitumor potency of 
 <bold>38</bold>.
