<p>The benzazole scaffold is widely distributed in nature, e.g., benzothiazole (

 <bold>10</bold>), and benzoxazole (
 <bold>11</bold>) are considered essential core structures of many biomolecules such as in firefly luciferin (
 <bold>12</bold>), a benzothiazolyl derivative exhibiting bioluminescence [
