<p>Jauhari et al. introduced a new class of 2-[(arylidene)cyanomethyl]-5-halobenzoxazoles as part of their ongoing work in preparing antitumor, antiviral, and antimicrobial candidates. The anticancer activity was done against four sets of human cell lines (HEPG-2, HeLa, WiDr, MCF-7) [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. Interestingly, compound 
 <bold>41</bold> with fluorine at position-5 exhibited a significant activity against all four tested cell lines and an exceptional antifungal activity against both 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. niger</italic>. In antibacterial evaluation against 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, this new class showed a remarkable activity compared to other analogues.
