<p>Fluorine stands out as a distinguishable moiety in medicinal chemistry and it has been incorporated in many heterocycles, e.g., benzothiazole to improve, enhance or get new biological activity. Benzothiazole containing fluorine draws a remarkable attention in drug design since benzothiazole is considered a privileged structure and its synthesis has been discussed in many literatures. Herein are several selected examples of benzothiazole analogues (
