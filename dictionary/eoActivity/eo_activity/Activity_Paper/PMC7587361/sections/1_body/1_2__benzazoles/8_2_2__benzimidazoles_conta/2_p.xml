<p>To start with, Tonelli et al. prepared a set of benzimidazole derivatives as part of their continuous work in the chemistry and biological properties of benzimidazoles. In this study, a variety of moieties have been substituted at position-1 and 2 of benzimidazole; unsubstituted, basic, non-basic, aromatic, non-aromatic substitutions were synthetically introduced [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In order to highlight the importance of the presence of fluorine moiety, the derivative of benzimidazole with trifluoromethyl at position-2, compound 
 <bold>27</bold> exhibited higher potency against CVB-5, RSV and YFV, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 11, 22, and 33 μM respectively compared to its analogue 
 <bold>28</bold> having a 2-methyl moiety with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 47, &gt;100, and 33 μM respectively. The importance of trifluoromethyl has been proven by the narrower spectrum of activity and lower potency compared to the 2-methyl benzimidazole analogue 
 <bold>28</bold>.
