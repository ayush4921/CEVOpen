<p>Fluorine is a very important moiety in bioactive molecules whereby a single modification can lead to a tremendous increase in biological activities. Therefore, there is an escalating interest in introducing fluorine in designing and developing bioactive molecules. This review highlighted the influence of introducing fluorine in some benzazole scaffolds on the pharmacological and biological profiles of these systems. On the basis of various literature surveys, fluorine-containing benzazoles show improved biological activities. In most of the cases discussed in this review, the enhancement in biological activity and lowering of toxicity have been correlated to the introduction of the fluorine substituent on benzazoles.</p>
