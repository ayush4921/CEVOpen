<p>Lou′s research team [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] prepared the lead compound 
 <bold>2</bold> which exhibits a selective Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibition with reasonable biological activity with human whole blood (HWB) IC50 of 100 nM and poor aqueous solubility (0.6/2/3 μg/mL in water). They aimed to improve the aqueous solubility, which in turn increases the biological activity which is expected to lower the effective dose. They utilized the approach that replacement of C-H bond with a C-F bond is believed to increase the metabolic stability and improve membrane permeability of a particular compound. In addition, the incorporation of fluorine in small molecules imparts higher binding affinity. In another study [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04677" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], Lou et al. demonstrated that a rational fluorine scan can be utilized to measure the potency of a series of selective BTK inhibitors. The placement of fluorine at the optimal position can lead to favorable interactions with protein side chains. Several analogues a, b and c, fluorinated and non-fluorinated at different sites in compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04677-f002">Figure 2</xref>); were used to investigate the fluorine moiety that could result in favorable interactions with the BTK protein. A single modification in compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> increases the potency up to 40- and 20-fold when compared with non-fluorinated analogues. They concluded from their investigation that the favorable interactions and impact are attributed uniquely to the fluorine moiety.
