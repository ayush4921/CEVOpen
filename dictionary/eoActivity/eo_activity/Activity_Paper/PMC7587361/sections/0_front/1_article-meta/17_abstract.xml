 <p>Fluorine-containing heterocycles continue to receive considerable attention due to their unique properties. In medicinal chemistry, the incorporation of fluorine in small molecules imparts a significant enhancement their biological activities compared to non-fluorinated molecules. In this short review, we will highlight the importance of incorporating fluorine as a basic appendage in benzothiazole and benzimidazole skeletons. The chemistry and pharmacological activities of heterocycles containing fluorine during the past years are compiled and discussed. </p>
