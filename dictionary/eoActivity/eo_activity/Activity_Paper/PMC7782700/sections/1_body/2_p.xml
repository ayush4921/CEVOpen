<p>The complete plastid genome of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> is a typical square circular molecule with a length of 163,151 bp, consisting of a large single copy (LSC) region of 91,515 bp and a small single copy (SSC) region of 19,250 bp, separated by two reversed repeating regions (IR) of 26,193 bp. The circular genome contains 130 genes, including 85 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes and 8 rRNA genes. Most gene species appear as single copies, while 15 gene species appear as double copies. The total GC content of chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> was 35.6%, while the corresponding values of LSC, SSC, and IR regions were 32.8%, 29.2% and 42.5%, respectively.
