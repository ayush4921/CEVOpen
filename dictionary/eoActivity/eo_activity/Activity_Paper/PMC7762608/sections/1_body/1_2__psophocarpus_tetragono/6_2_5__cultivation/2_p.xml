 <italic>Psophocarpus tetragonolobus</italic> grows slowly, and after 10â€“12 weeks of planting, the fruit can be harvested. With respect to pods and seeds, it produces the highest yield in the first year of plantation, so it is planted annually. However, this plant is long living, and it was shown that the tuber yield is much better in the second-year plantation 369 to 392 g for each plant compared to 80 to 230 g in the first year [
