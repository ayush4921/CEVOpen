<p>The anti-microbial activity of the winged bean was manifested as both antibacterial and anti-fungal effects. A methanol extract from the leaves or from the roots was shown to kill and inhibit the growth of both 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (a bacterium species) and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (a species of fungus), respectively. This was proved using the disk diffusion and the broth dilution assays. In the case of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 2.6 mg/mL, whereas in the case of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, the MIC was 3.1 mg/mL. In both cases, after 36 h of incubation, there was a morphological change of the microbe as examined by a scanning electron microscope. The extract was tested in vivo on rats to study toxicity, in the dose of 2 g/kg, and no rats were killed. Different fractions of extracts from tubers, leaves, stems and pods were studied by disk diffusion assay for their anti-microbial activity. The fractions used were chloroform fraction, ethyl acetate fraction and ethanol fraction. All were effective against all the tested microbes (11 bacteria, four molds and four yeasts), with the pod having the highest activity and the leaves having the lowest. All the fractions were effective with the ethanol fraction having the highest activity, whereas chloroform fraction had the lowest activity [
