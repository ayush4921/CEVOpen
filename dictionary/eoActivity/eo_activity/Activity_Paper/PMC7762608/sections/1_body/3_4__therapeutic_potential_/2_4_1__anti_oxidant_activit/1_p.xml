<p>Winged bean is a source of many known antioxidants like vitamin C, and it is also rich in polyphenols and flavonoids. Phenolic compounds are very important as antioxidants. Their antioxidant effects anticarcinogenic, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumoral, antimicrobial, antimutagenic, anti-aggregate, anti-ischaemic and anti-allergic. Phenolics also alleviate cardiovascular diseases [

In the seeds, the phenolic content ranged between 0.8 and 0.9 mg gallic acid equivalent/g and the total flavonoids ranged between 0.7 and 1.2 mg quercetin equivalent/g, and the total antioxidant capacity was between 1.3 and 1.8 mg AAE/g. Thus, they can serve as sources of health-promoting nutrients and phytochemicals for human and animals. Different studies examined various extracts and fractions of winged bean for their antioxidant activities, using different techniques [
