 <italic>trans</italic> fatty acids are found. Winged bean oil contains 30 to 40% saturated fatty acids which represent more than the content observed in soybean [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Oleic and linoleic acids represent nearly 50% of unsaturated fatty acids. Unsaponifiable lipids are mainly represented by Î²-sitosterol (66.4%) and stigmasterol (25.1%) [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, winged bean oil was found to be better than soybean oil, because of its high oxidative and high thermal stabilities [
