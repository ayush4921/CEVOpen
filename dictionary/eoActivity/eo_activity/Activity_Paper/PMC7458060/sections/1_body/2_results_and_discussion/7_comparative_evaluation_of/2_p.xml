 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). It is not accidental that we detected quercetin and chlorogenic acid as the most common active gradients in our screening records, because these compounds are found to be the most effective compounds used in the treatment of influenza. Supporting these findings, 
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al. (2003)</xref> stated in a study of mice that quercetin (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A) may be useful as a drug to reduce oxidative stress caused by influenza virus infection in the lungs, and to protect them from the toxic effects of free radicals. In another study, 
 <xref rid="bib167" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2016)</xref> stated that quercetin, which shows inhibitory activity in the early stage of influenza infection, offers a future therapeutic option for developing effective, safe and affordable natural products for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza virus infections. Moreover, 
 <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Nile et al. (2020)</xref>, in an investigation of the antiviral and cytotoxic effects of quercetin 3-glucoside (Q3G) from 
 <italic>Dianthus superbus</italic>, Q3G (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B) found that this substance showed strong antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses. Therefore, they emphasized that it could be developed and used as a natural anti-influenza drug.
