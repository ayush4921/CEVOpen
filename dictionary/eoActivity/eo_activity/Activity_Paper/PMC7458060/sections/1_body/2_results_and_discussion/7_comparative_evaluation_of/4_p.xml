<p id="p0170">Among the researches, the taxa containing the most active compounds in terms of anti-influenza activity were 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> (11 chemicals with 31.4% out of the 35), 
 <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic> (7; 20.0%), 
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> (5; 14.3%) 
 <italic>and Punica granatum</italic> (4; 11.4%) (

 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> (licorice) is among the oldest and most popular traditional herbal medicines worldwide (

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Baytop, 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">ErtuÄŸ, 2004</xref>). Hence, the roots may have appeared to have the greatest number of active ingredients in the screening. This result overlaps with the findings of 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Grienke et al. (2014)</xref> because they had emphasized that the accumulation of the plant components exhibits 3D similarities to known flu Neuraminidase inhibitors (which are key enzymes in viral replication and the first-line drug target to fight influenza) according to their basis of a shape-focused virtual screening. Therefore, this finding may be pointing out that this plant is more effective and specific than other taxa in terms of anti-influenza activity.
