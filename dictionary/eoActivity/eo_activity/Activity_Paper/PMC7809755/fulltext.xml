PHC nurses in Poland perform work associated more with carrying out physicians&#x02019; orders and less with what they were prepared to do. Engaging nursing students in interprofessional education, dissemination of nursing research, and advocacy of nursing professional organizations on behalf of the profession may be an effective strategy to overcome the current barriers for PHC nurses to work the top of their license.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Nurses</kwd><kwd>Primary health care</kwd><kwd>Surveys</kwd><kwd>Poland</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005297</institution-id><institution>Uniwersytet Medyczny w Bialymstoku</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SUB/3/DN/19/001/3329.</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcinowicz</surname><given-names>Ludmila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2021</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par8">The need for strengthening primary health care (PHC) world-wide is at the heart of the World Health Organization&#x02019;s (WHO) mission to improve population health. Over a decade ago, the WHO report entitled <italic>Primary Health Care Now More than Ever</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] articulated the need for a generation of new knowledge about this level of care. A more recent WHO publication is concerned specifically with the role of nurses in PHC and describes how the unique contributions of registered nurses (RNs) strengthens healthcare systems in 14 European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Josi, Bianchi, and Brandt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] provided evidence regarding positive contributions of RNs to overall team functioning, interprofessioanl communication, and patient centered care in primary care settings in Switzerland. Dal Molin and team found that PHC nurses significantly improved nursing-sensitive patient care outcomes, patient satisfaction, and organizational outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Smolowitz et al. used an exploratory descriptive design to investigate the work of PHC nurses in 16 exemplary primary care practices over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. They reported that RNs across the care settings performed nine general functions including telephone triage, assessment and documentation of patient health status, chronic illness case management, hospital to community transition management, health coaching, medication reconciliation, ancillary staff supervision, and quality improvement leadership. These nursing functions significantly improved quality and efficiency of care, satisfaction of providers and other members of the healthcare team, and decreased cost of care, a finding consistent with prior reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and expert opinions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">There is substantial evidence that PCH nurses have a positive impact on chronic disease management. For example, Cruz-Cobo and Santi-Cano [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] in a systematic review of the literature provide evidence regarding the unique role of primary care nurses in improving diabetes management among insulin dependent patients. Two recently published descriptive cross-sectional investigations, one conducted in India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the other in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] demonstrate positive impact of PHC nursing education during the antenatal period on childbirth experiences and childbirth outcomes in these countries. Likewise, a recent experimental study conducted in Iraq shows positive effects of breastfeeding education provided by PHC nurses during the antenatal period on women&#x02019;s breastfeeding self-efficacy during the postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">The role of PHC nurses has been analysed in various health care systems and perspectives, including consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], nursing students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, despite the consistent evidence demonstrating positive effect on patient outcomes of RN services in primary care settings, discussion regarding the optimal model of staff mix in PHC centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Aston [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] asserts that nurse generalists with specialty certification in primary care are uniquely suited to provide expanded care services to improve patient care and prevent burnout of primary care physicians and other providers in these settings, a finding consistent with prior research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In summary, recent research, systematic reviews of the literature, and expert opinions, collectively lend support for broader utilization of nurses in PHC and ongoing research to better understand the work and impact of PHC nurses on patient care outcomes, work satisfaction of the PHC teams, and the cost of care.</p><p id="Par12">In Poland, the PHC is the first contact for most patients within the healthcare system. The PHC system in Poland is financed by the National Health Fund. Its aim is to ensure effective and efficient care for the patient and their family, to coordinate the care, evaluate and determine care priorities, identify, eliminate, or reduce physical and mental health problems, and ensure health promotion, disease prevention, and health education activities. The patient care responsibilities are shared by the PHC team made up of a physician (the manager of care), a nurse, and a midwife. Typically, the PHC physician and nurse care-team provides care for a panel of approx. 2500 patients annually.</p><p id="Par13">To offer some context to the meaning of PHC teamwork in Poland, it is important to acknowledge the cultural context in which medical and nursing professionals have practiced in recent decades. Today, nursing in Poland is an autonomous profession. Two decades ago, however, nurses were considered &#x0201c;auxiliary&#x0201d; medical personnel. The <italic>Act on Professional Self-governance of Nurses and Midwives</italic> passed in 1991 established a single independent professional organization to regulate nursing and midwifery care. The structure of nursing self-governance consists of the Central Council of Nurses and Midwives at the national level and Regional Chambers of Nurses and Midwives at the provincial level. The <italic>Act on the Occupations of Nurses and Midwives</italic> from 1996 helped to further establish the professional autonomy of nurses and midwives in Poland. Today, Polish nurses are educated consistent with the European Union (EU) requirements. Polish nurses and midwives have access to three levels of educational preparation: Bachelor of Nursing, Master of Nursing, and a PhD in Nursing Science. Additionally, postgraduate education prepares nurses for work in various specialized sectors of the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, some nurses in Poland hold specialty certifications, including PHC nurses. These nurses have completed a postgraduate qualifying course in family nursing or another field relevant to primary health care, such as pediatric nursing, community nursing, or care for chronically ill or disabled patients. A typical PHC nurse is prepared to plan and carry out a comprehensive nursing care plan within the scope of nursing practice with consideration of the point of care, patient health status, gender, level of patient abilities, and age (except for newborns and infants under 2 months of age who receive primary care exclusively from physicians). In sum, PHC nurses are well prepared to provide health education, nursing assessments and care, and coordinate diagnostic, therapeutic, and rehabilitation services.</p><p id="Par14">Since January 1, 2016, when a pharmacological specialist course became available, PHC nurses are able to prescribe certain medications and dietary supplements upon completion of the course. The RNs may also issue orders for certain medical devices following physical examination of the patient. To date, no published studies have examined whether the actual use of skills and knowledge of Polish nurses in PHC is consistent with their recent expansion of educational preparation or the current scope of practice. Nurses are a large workforce in PHC and due to their scope of practice they should be considered in primary health care system staffing models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Scientific evidence about nursing activities in PHC will allow the optimization and development of the practices of nurses.</p><p id="Par15">This study was conducted to shed a light on the actual roles of Polish nurses in PHC and to identify potential areas for improvement. The aim of this study is to assess the scope of practice of a PHC nurses and their actual work activities.</p><p id="Par16">The specific aims were to answer the following research questions:

Two hundred and twenty-five surveys were sent to 45 Regional Chambers of Nurses and Midwives with a request to distribute the surveys to five selected PHC nurses in each region, according to the Regional Chambers&#x02019; officials&#x02019; preferences.

The study also investigated the perceived frequency of performing the key tasks. As far as the authors of this report are aware, this is the first study exploring the PHC nurses&#x02019; scope of work in Poland. Although the most frequent activity reported by PHC nurses participating in the study was &#x0201c;carrying out doctor&#x02019;s orders&#x0201d;, the other work activities included autonomous nursing activities, such as the using of nursing process to engage in patient education or health promotion activities. Study participants performed such activities as: identifying patients&#x02019; health problems and care needs, providing nursing care, conducting environmental interviews, applying dressings to wounds, bedsores and burns, and collection of material for diagnostic tests.</p><p id="Par31">Observational research on nurses&#x02019; activities during home healthcare visits shows that the majority of activities were with patients with long-term illnesses and most often included: medication administration, blood samples, wound care or measurement of blood pressure; patient education was offered only in 3.5% of home visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">In some countries, nurses have a long tradition of prescribing medications (I would give an example, as nurses in the US have to be advanced practice to prescribe). Research has shown that prescribing treatments or medications by nurses increases their job satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In this study, however, PHC nurses, although qualified, rarely prescribed medications. An interesting finding of our study is the fact that younger nurses prescribed more frequently than more experienced nurses, who in turn were more likely to engage in basic nursing care. Bartosiewicz and Januszewicz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], who investigated Polish PHC and clinical nurse specialists&#x02019; roles in the ambulatory care settings found a relationship between the level of burnout among the nurses and their readiness to take on new competencies such as the prescribing. Findings from their study suggest that the higher level of burnout the lower was the readiness of nurses to prescribe. In another study Zarzeka and team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] found that while Polish nurses&#x02019; attitude toward prescribing of medications is generally positive, their perception of the right to prescribe is not, suggesting that nurses may still be in transition of taking on the new competencies.</p><p id="Par33">A concerning finding of our study is the fact that PHC nurses in Poland rarely engage in organizing the support groups for patients, an activity at the heart of PHC nursing curriculum. The omission of this service may be related to many issues. It must be stressed that the number of activities performed by the PHC nurses at the point of care is very broad and ranges from arranging specialty tests to consultations and preparation for surgery, to ordering equipment for patients, administering vaccines and IV medications, to providing wound care. On the other hand, one must be mindful that PHC settings in Poland are typically managed by general practice physicians who employ nurses, and therefore, control their nursing scope of practice regardless of the nurses&#x02019; educational preparation. This may have contributed, at least in part, to the fact that a few nurses reported prescribing medications or facilitating patient support groups. Expanding these activities by PHC nurses in the future could enhance patient outcomes and satisfaction and possibly job satisfaction as nurses are encouraged to practice at the top of their license [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Qualitative research on primary care nursing activities with patients affected by physical chronic disease and common mental disorders, shows that there is a gap between the types of activities that are expected of primary care nurses and what they actually do. The authors of the study conclude that the potential of PHC nurses is not always fully exploited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">In contrast to other developed countries, such as the United States, where nursing&#x02019;s scope of practice has long been established and regulated by the nursing profession [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], findings from our study can be viewed as a starting point in understanding the patterns of Polish nurses&#x02019; work in PHC. The qualitative research among Polish patients shows that although the traditional model of nursing care and the hierarchical relationship with the dominant position of the doctor are emphasized in the statements of patients, the perception of the nurse as a source of information, both for the doctor and the patient, is also emphasized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The importance of PHC nurses in providing community care, from interpersonal to inter-organizational and system level, is confirmed by the scoping review of the current literature from various countries. The authors of the review emphasize that the awareness of the scope of nurses&#x02019; practice by the government and health authorities as well as primary health care allows nurses to practice to the full extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Primary care services are constantly evolving in response to the needs, available resources, health policies, as well as the expectations and needs of consumers in a given country. The results of our research provide new scientific evidence on the professional activity of primary care nurses in the context of national specificity. They can be used in the ongoing discussion and debate on the role and scope of nurses&#x02019; services in the primary health care system and set directions for the professional development of this group of service providers. Moreover, they can be used in updating the nursing education system, especially postgraduate education.</p><p id="Par38">Other researchers, through their research, have the chance to identify problems in their own country and demonstrate international differences through the exchange of experiences.</p><p id="Par39">This study has several limitations: first, the Regional Chambers of Nurses and Midwives were free to choose which PHC nurses would receive the questionnaire, which could have led to selection bias. Because we used a convenience sampling, the sample may not represent the population. Second, the proportion of participating nurses with a few years of nursing experience was significantly lower than nurses with many years of experience, which limits the generalizability of findings. More study participants with fewer years of professional experience might have produced different findings. When interpreting the results of our research, we should also take into account the lack of men in our sample (only one man). Moreover, the survey instrument may not have included all nurse activities in PHC. Qualitative research shows that nurses also perform tasks not related to nursing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par40">While nurses in general are most likely to carry out tasks on the orders of a physician, junior nurses tend to be active in working on professional autonomy and new challenges.</p><p id="Par41">PHC nurses in Poland perform work associated more with carrying out physicians&#x02019; orders than the nursing work for which they were prepared. Engaging nursing and medical students in interprofessional education, attendance at conferences and dissemination of nursing research through conference presentation and publication, and advocacy of nursing professional organizations on behalf of the profession may be an effective strategy to overcome the current barriers to practicing PHC nursing at the top of the license. The findings of our study may also be used to update the content of qualification and specialist courses for PHC nurses. Research is needed to identify potential differences in how PHC nurses with fewer years of professional experience carry out their work activities. Moreover, repeating the study in a few years with a larger and more diverse sample to identify any generational differences and potential changes in Polish PHC nurses&#x02019; work to better align with that of PHC nurses in other developed countries is needed.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>PHC</term><def><p id="Par5">Primary Health Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par6">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RN</term><def><p id="Par7">Registered Nurse</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Central Council of Nurses and Midwives (at the national level), Regional Chambers of Nurses and Midwives and all the participating nurses for their kind cooperation.
