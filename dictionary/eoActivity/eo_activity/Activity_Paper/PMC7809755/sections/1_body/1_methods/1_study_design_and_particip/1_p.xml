<p id="Par19">A cross-sectional study design using an investigator-developed survey was conducted in Poland, in 2018. Convenience sampling was used, based on the availability of respondents (a real one that can be reached). The survey was sent to professionally active PHC nurses in Poland through the Regional Chambers of Nurses and Midwives who had control over identifying nurses and sending out the survey to potential respondents. Two hundred and twenty-five surveys were sent to 45 Regional Chambers of Nurses and Midwives with a request to distribute the surveys to five selected PHC nurses in each region, according to the Regional Chambers’ officials’ preferences. Of the 225 questionnaires distributed, 202 (89.8%) questionnaires were returned to the investigators.</p>
