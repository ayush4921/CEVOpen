<p id="Par29">Out of 44 work activities analysed, a significant correlation was found between the length of work experience and the following three tasks: performing nursing services, issuing referrals for specific diagnostic tests, and ordering of specific medications or dietary supplements that are within the nursing scope of practice. The longer the work experience, the more often the nurses performed nursing care (
 <italic>r</italic> = 015; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.035) but less often issued referrals for diagnostic tests (
 <italic>r</italic> = − 0.24; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) or ordered specific medical products (Table
