<p>In China, the quality standards of ethnic medicines and their patent medicines are based on the national standards included in the 
 <italic>Chinese Pharmacopoeia</italic>, which has covered ethnomedicines since 1977. Previous research on EPMs in the 
 <italic>Chinese Pharmacopoeia</italic> (2015 edition) found that some traditional medicines did not establish national quality standards, and that 71 traditional medicines, which include 39 EPMs, are not listed in the 
 <italic>Chinese Pharmacopoeia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This practice (called “upside-down standards,”) that involves quality standards for Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) but no standard for the composition of CPMs affects the safety of CPMs and the healthy development of the Chinese pharmaceutical industry.
