  <p>Tables S1 and S2: in this article, all the ethnic patent medicines (EPMs) produced in Yunnan Province were collected. The information of these EPMs is obtained from the National Medical Products Administration of China, and all EPMs listed in the article have been checked according to open drug instructions. Table S1 and Table S2 provide the following information including the drug name, Chinese name, approval number, clinical indications, dosage form, and prescription status of Yi patent medicines (YPMs) and Dai patent medicines (DPMs). Some of these data supported the results of “clinical indications of Yi and Dai medicines” and Figure 1 in this article. Tables S3 and S4: in this article, the investigation focused on the composition of each EPM, the types of medicinal resources and medicinal parts, and quality standards for medicinal materials used in EPMs, including botanical, animal, and mineral resources. All these data are listed as two tables, showing separately the composition information and quality standards in DPMs (Table S3) and YPMs (Table S4). The information includes the drug name and pinyin name, Chinese name, scientific name, and medicinal parts of medicinal materials used in EPMs, and also contains the quality standard information of medicinal materials which can be regarded as the most important key supporting data for this article.</p>
