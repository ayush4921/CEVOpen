<p>We also investigated the effects of HDE on autophagy induction activity to relieve atherosclerosis. When ECs function normally, autophagy in this cell type is involved in vascular lipid homeostasis (
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) that can protect blood vessels against atherosclerotic lesion formation. However, endothelial dysfunction contributes to atherosclerosis (
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and mouse models of atherosclerosis reveal that deficiencies in endothelial autophagy stimulate plaque formation (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Thus, autophagy induction in ECs is a critical point in vascular-related disease. We found that HDE treatment (30 Âµg/ml) inhibited cell proliferation and induced autophagy in HUVECs, without toxic effects (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A-E</xref>). However, because danshen is known to induce apoptosis in cancer cells (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), HDE may trigger apoptosis at high concentrations. In addition, HDE reduced DiI-oxLDL contents, suggesting that HDE exhibited lipid degradation via autophagy induction (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F, G</xref>). Cryptotashinone (MW 296.4), one of the active principles of danshen, has autophagic and anti-atherosclerotic activities (
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Therefore, we assumed that cryptotashinone could be responsible for biological activities of HDE.
