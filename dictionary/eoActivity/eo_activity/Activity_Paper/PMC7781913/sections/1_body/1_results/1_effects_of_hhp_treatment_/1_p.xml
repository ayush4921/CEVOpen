<p>Populations of aerobic bacteria, yeasts, and molds were measured to investigate the effects of HHP treatment (550 MPa for 5 min) on microorganisms in raw danshen (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>). The numbers of total aerobes in raw danshen (control) were approximately 119 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> (colony forming units) CFU/g. Pressurization inactivated it to nearly 1.14 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU/g. Likewise, initial yeast and mold counts for control danshen were about 510 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU/g, then decreased to nearly 0.18 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> CFU/g after HHP treatment. These results indicated that HHP treatment effectively eliminated microorganisms on raw danshen in a short time, without color and flavor changes.
