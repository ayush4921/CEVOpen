<p>To assess the potential of HDE for treatment of cardiovascular disease, we first examined effects of HDE in ECs. The effect of HDE on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation was investigated using MTT assay. HDE treatment at 0-100 µg/ml suppressed cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (

 <sub>50</sub> value of HDE was 34.6 µg/ml and no cytotoxicity was observed.
