 <sup>−/−</sup> mice were fed a high cholesterol diet (HCD). Mice were randomly divided into three groups and each was injected via the intraperitoneal route with vehicle or rapamycin (10 mg/kg) or HDE (50 mg/kg) every 2 d for 8 weeks. There were no differences in body weight among groups. This result indicated the non-toxic effects of HDE on mouse viability (
