<p>Mice were euthanized with CO
 <sub>2</sub> gas, perfused with PBS through the left ventricle, and hearts and aortas were isolated. Aortas were cut from the proximal ascending region to the bifurcation of the iliac artery. Adventitial fat was removed, and each aorta was dissected longitudinally and pinned onto black silicone plates. After fixation with 10% neutral buffered formalin, the tissue samples were stained with Oil Red O overnight and washed with PBS. The base of the heart containing the aortic root was embedded in OCT medium, frozen at −80°C, and serial sections were collected. Atherosclerotic lesions were stained using Oil Red O stain and quantified using Image J software. For fluorescence immunohistochemistry, the sections were blocked with 10% BSA for 30 min, then stained with primary anti-LC3 antibody (ab48394) overnight at 4°C. After washing three times with PBS, the sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The sections were then stained with Hoechst 33432 for 5 min and washed with PBS. The coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with fluorescent mounting medium and the results were analyzed.
