<p>Chloroplast (cp) is a semi-autonomous organelle in plant cells, which has relatively independent genetic material. Due to its simple structure and highly conserved, cp genome has been widely used in the research of molecular markers, genetic diversity and population variation (Daniell et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In recent years, cp genomes of many medicinal plants have been reported, which will helpful to develop DNA barcode and improve the understanding of genetic structure (Qian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Shen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). However, the cp genome of 
 <italic>M. chinensis</italic> is still unclear.
