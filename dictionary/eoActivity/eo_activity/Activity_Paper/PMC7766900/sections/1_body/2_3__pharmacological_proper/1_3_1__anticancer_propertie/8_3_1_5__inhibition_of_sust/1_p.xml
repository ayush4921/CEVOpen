<p>For tumor progression, angiogenesis or neovascularization is a crucial step as it provides essential nutrient supply to the transformed cells. Equilibrium between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic proteins act as a barrier for tumor growth and progression. Angiogenic proteins include VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, IL8, and TGF-β [
