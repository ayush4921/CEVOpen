<p>As per a WHO report, about 35 million people are suffering from chronic kidney diseases (CKD) in developing and developed countries. Inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress play a pivotal role in the progression of renal damage. The specific targets for renal injury are the mesangial cells, glomerular endothelial cells, podocytes, and tubular epithelial cells [

Activation of these receptors leads to kidney damage by increasing microvascular pressure, podocyte autophagy, promoting oxidative stress and NFκB-p65 activation; which in turn trigger the release of inflammatory mediators like IFNγ, IL-6, and prostaglandins [

The Western blotting technique of protein analysis in rats suffering from daunorubicin-induced kidney damage has revealed upregulation of PPARγ and attenuation of AT1R, ETAR, p-NFκB p65, and p-ERK1/2 signaling pathways, thereby reducing oxidative stress and inflammation following naringenin treatment. Histopathological analysis of the kidney has also shown improvement in fibrotic lesions in a naringenin-administered group [
