<p>Anti-proliferative action of flavonoids has been demonstrated in numerous in vitro studies using various kinds of cancer cells [

 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Naringenin inhibits xanthine oxidase [

 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and hampers the proliferation of tumor cells. In experimentally induced colon cancer, naringenin has been reported to inhibit hyperproliferation. Inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, in several tissues, by naringenin has also been reported. ODC is involved in the biosynthesis of polyamine, and thus inhibited ODC activity results in the consequent decrease in polyamine and reduced DNA/protein synthesis [

N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDEA)-induced hepatocarcinogenic rats after pre- and post-treatment with naringenin have revealed a decline in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is one of the important markers of hyperproliferation [

 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Naringenin has been found to suppress the rate of PCNA expression in leukemia cell line HL-60, thereby indicating its anti-proliferative activity [
