<p>Diabetic neuropathic pain is one of the chief complications associated with diabetes mellitus [
 <xref rid="B83-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Afflicted individuals often have complaints of “shock-like ambiances” with amplified sensations to external stimuli. This can have harmful and disabling effects [

 <xref rid="B88-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Several studies have revealed that naringenin exhibits agonistic activity at the PPARγ receptor and therefore ameliorates the pain in different nerve injuries and neuropathies [

 <xref rid="B89-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] and a neurotransmitter for nociception [
