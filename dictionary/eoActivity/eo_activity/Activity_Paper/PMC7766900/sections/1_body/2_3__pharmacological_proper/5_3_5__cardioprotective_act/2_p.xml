<p>Naringenin exhibited its cardioprotective effect by reducing myocardial infarct area, decreasing LDH in coronary effluent to increase regenerative capacity, and improving the retrieval of left ventricular function. Naringenin-treated myocardium has also exhibited an increase in SOD and a decrease in levels of MDA [

Naringenin restricts the build-up of calcium in the cardiac mitochondrial matrix. An amendment of functional parameters post-ischemia with a lowering of the lengthening interval of myocardial injury has also been observed. The inner mitochondrial membrane depolarization depends on the concentration of thallium, and the transmembrane drift of thallium (potassium-mimetic cation) has been reported in isolated rat cardiac mitochondria upon interaction with naringenin [
