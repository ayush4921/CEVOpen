<p>Naringenin has a simple 15-carbon-atom flavonoid skeleton, which comprises three rings. Among them, two benzene rings are linked to a three-carbon chain [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01784" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The chemical nomenclature of naringenin is 2,3-dihydro-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one or 4â€²,5,7-trihydroxyflavanone, with a molar mass of 272.3 [

The major mechanism by which naringenin exhibits its diverse bioactivities is through the suppression of oxidative stress, which is caused by various free radical species produced in the organisms as byproducts of aerobic metabolism. The existence of the 2, 3-double bond linked to the 4-oxo group of naringenin has been demonstrated to be a critical functional active group responsible for its antioxidant potential [
