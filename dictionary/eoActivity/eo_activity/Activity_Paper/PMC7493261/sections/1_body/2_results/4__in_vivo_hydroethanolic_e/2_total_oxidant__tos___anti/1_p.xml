<p>It was noted that induction of CCl

Moreover, SOD (Superoxide dismutase) and CAT (Catalase) as enzymatic antioxidant and decreased in both enzymes activities was also noted on intoxication with CCl4 while in plants extract and positive drugs treated rats, both SOD and CAT significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improves in dose dependent manner (
