<p>According to infrared spectroscopy in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1559325820959563">Figure 3</xref>, there were absorption peaks at 3,500-4,000/cm, 2,918/cm, 2,360/cm, 2,341/cm, 1,726/cm, 1,586/cm, 1,494/cm, 1,462/cm, 1,426/cm, 1,428/cm, 1,296/cm, 1,259/cm, 1,179/cm, 1,120/cm, 1,023/cm, 836/cm, 726/cm, 694/cm, 563/cm and 439/cm. The absorption peaks at range 3,500 to 4,000/cm was associated with the stretching vibration of O-H, which meant that there were hydrogen bonds in intramolecules and intermolecules. The absorption peak at 2,918/cm was attributed to the asymmetrically stretching vibration of C-H. The peak at 2,360/cm and 2,341/cm might be related to stretching vibration of C-H. The absorption peak at 1,726/cm was attributed to the symmetrically stretching vibration of C=O. The absorption peaks at 1,586/cm might be related to the stretching vibration of C=N and C=C. The peaks at 1400 to 1500/cm (1,494/cm, 1,462/cm, 1,426/cm and 1,428/cm) might be attributed with strong to medium vibration of C=C and N=O functional groups. The absorption peaks at 1,296/cm and 1,259 was due to the stretching vibration of C-O. The peaks at 1,179/cm and 1,120/cm were attributed to the asymmetrically stretching vibration of C-O-C. The absorbance peak at 563/cm might be represented of aliphatic C-I stretching while the peak at 439/cm might be related to S-S stretching vibration.
