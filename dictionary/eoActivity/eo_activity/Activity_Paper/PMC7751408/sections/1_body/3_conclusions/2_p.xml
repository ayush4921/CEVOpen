<p>A novel and multifunctional lipase, SCNL was purified from a newly isolated 
 <italic>S. caprae</italic> NCU S6. The molecular weight of the lipase was determined to be approximately 87â€‰kDa through gel electrophoresis analysis. The lipase exhibited high temperature resistance and great pH stability. Furthermore, SCNL was highly active in the presence of a variety of industrial organic solvents and metal ions. The lipase also exhibited strong tolerance to widely used enzyme inhibitors and commercial detergents. Our results suggested that SCNL could be an excellent enzyme candidate for biotransformation in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Further studies would be focussed on its region-specificity and structural analysis, and its potential applications in biodiesel production and detergent industries.
