<p>The lipase hydrolysis activity towards 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl palmitate (NPP) was measured according to the colorimetric method
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>11</sup>
 </xref>, with some modifications. Briefly, a reaction mixture contained 100 μL 
 <italic>p</italic>-NPP (7.5 mM, methanol solution) and 2.1 ml buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). After heating of the samples in a water bath for 10 min at 40 °C, 100 μL appropriately diluted enzyme was added. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 40 °C for 20 min with a control group using thermally inactivated lipase to consider any spontaneous hydrolysis of 
 <italic>p</italic>-NPP. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μL ZnSO
 <sub>4</sub> (100 mM, sterile water) on ice bath. Reaction solution was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 5 min to remove the insoluble substances, and the supernatant was used to determine the amount of liberated 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol (NP) by its absorbance at 410 nm. The lipolytic activities were expressed as international units. One unit of enzyme activity corresponded to one micromole of 
 <italic>p</italic>-NP released from 
 <italic>p</italic>-NPP per minute, and the specific activities were expressed as U/mg of protein.
