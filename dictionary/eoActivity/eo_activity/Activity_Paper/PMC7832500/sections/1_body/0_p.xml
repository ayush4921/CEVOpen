 <italic>Polygonatum cirrhifolium</italic> (Wall.) Royle is a perennial herb with high medicinal value. The rhizome of this species possesses a series of pharmacologically important secondary metabolites and hence holds vast range of pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, demulcent, cardiotonic, energizer, hypoglycemic, antifungal and antibacterial (Saboon et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Beside its medicinal value, 
 <italic>P. cirrhifolium</italic> contains major food constituents (protein, carbohydrates, and fat) and is used for functional food (Sharma et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Because of the great market potential, 
 <italic>P. cirrhifolium</italic> is being overexploited from its wild habitats, making it become a highly endangered species (Lohani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A comprehensive genomic resource would help the development of conservation strategies for threatened plants (Hou et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). To promote the conservation of 
 <italic>P. cirrhifolium</italic>, we assembled its complete chloroplast genome in this research.
