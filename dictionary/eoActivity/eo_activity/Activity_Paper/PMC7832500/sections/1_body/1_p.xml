<p>Fresh leaves of 
 <italic>P. cirrhifolium</italic> were sampled from Nanjing Botanical Garden (Nanjing, China 118°49′41.32″E, 32°3′22.74″N), and stored at −80 °C until subsequent use. The voucher specimen was stored at Herbarium of Institute of Botany, Jiangsu Province and Chinese Academic of Sciences (voucher: Liao20200708-1). Genomic DNA extracting was done by using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A paired end library with an insert size around 350 bp was constructed and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq system (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Following sequencing, a total of 5.82 Gb of raw data (38.80 M reads) were generated (NCBI Sequence Read Archive accession number SRR12778006). Raw reads were quality filtered through Trimmomatic v0.32 (Bolger et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). After filtering the raw reads, clean reads were mapped to the reference genome by NOVOPlasty (Dierckxsens et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Initial gene annotation was done by Geneious R11 v11.0.5 (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand) based on the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>P. kingianum</italic> (MN934979; Jin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Genes that could not detected were further identified by Blastn (
