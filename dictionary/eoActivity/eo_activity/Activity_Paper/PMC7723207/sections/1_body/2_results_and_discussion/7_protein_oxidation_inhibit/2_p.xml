<p>ODEO, TAEO, TKEO, and ZMEO reduced protein oxidation induced by malondialdehyde at 140 to 170 µg/ml similar to positive control (Table

Diabetes is accompanied by hyperglycemia and superoxide and hydroperoxide production which can oxidize proteins, peptides, and amino acids like cysteine, methionine, tyrosine, histidine, and tryptophan. Protein oxidation and protein hydroperoxide is the covalent modification of amino acid side chains by superoxide and hydroperoxide. Oxidation of amino acids results in protein cross‐linkage and protein fragmentation (Davies,

Oxidative modification of proteins might change protein properties, such as conformation, folding, stability, activity, and resistance to proteolysis that could be associated with various pathological consequences such as age‐related disease (Khyade,

 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Polyphenols present in phytochemicals inhibit protein aggregation and also breakdown the protein aggregates due to their antioxidant capacities (Debnath et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31935-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). The plants used in this study, had a high level of phenolic compounds and high antioxidant capacity and their capacities in protein oxidation inhibition may be related to their monoterpenoid contents.
