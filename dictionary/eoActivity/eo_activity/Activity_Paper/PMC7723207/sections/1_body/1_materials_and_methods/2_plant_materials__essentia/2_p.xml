 <italic>T. kotschyanus</italic> (herbarium number: 65,110) were collected from mountainous areas of Fars Province, Iran. The identification of collected plants was thankfully done by Professor Ahmad Reza Khosravi, plant taxonomist at Biology Department, Shiraz University, Iran. The plant materials were dried in the shade for 3–4 days. The air‐dried plant samples were hydro‐distilled for 3 hr using Clevenger apparatus to collect the essential oils. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) was carried out using Agilent gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B GC 7955AMSD) coupled with a single quadrupole mass spectrometer and silica HP5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). The temperatures of the ion source and that of interface were 210°C and 270°C, respectively. The programmed temperatures of the oven were as follows: four min at 60°C, rising to 140°C at 20°C/min. Then, increased to 220°C at 10°C/min and finally fixed for 10 min at 220°C. Mass spectra were obtained at 80 eV with mass ranges of 50–400 m/z. The essential oil compositions were determined by comparing the fragmentation patterns of the peaks with libraries mass spectra (Wiley 7n and NISTO5A) (Oladimeji et al.,
