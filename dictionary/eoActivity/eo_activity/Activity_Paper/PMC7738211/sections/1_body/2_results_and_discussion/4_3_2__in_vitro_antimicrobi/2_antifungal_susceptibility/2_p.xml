<p>The susceptibility of uridine esters 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> against three pathogenic fungi are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The results, as presented in percentage inhibitions of mycelial growth, indicated that these compounds were more prone against tested fungal pathogens compared to bacterial organisms. Among the tested fungi, 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> were more susceptible against 
 <italic>M. phaseolina</italic>. Aliphatic chain containing compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (C2, 57.8%, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>), 
 <bold>8</bold> (C6, 58.1%) and 
 <bold>10</bold> (C12, 69.2%) exhibited very good percentage of inhibition against this fungus. To our surprise, chlorobenzoyl ester 
 <bold>14</bold> (*72%) and 
 <bold>15</bold> (*73.1%) showed excellent inhibition against 
 <italic>M. phaseolina</italic> and the results were comparable to nystatin (*71.8%) in contrast to their antibacterial and PASS results.
