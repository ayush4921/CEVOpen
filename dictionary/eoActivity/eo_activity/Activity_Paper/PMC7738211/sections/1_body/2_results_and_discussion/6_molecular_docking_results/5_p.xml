<p>Considering the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus (Ghosh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Lakshmi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) we have extended our studies by docking with COVID-19 main protease (7BQY). As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0007" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>, most of the uridine esters showed higher binding affinity with 7BQY than HCQ (–6.1 Kcal/mol). It is worth to mention that saturated fatty acyl esters with 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>–
 <bold>8</bold> smaller chain length exhibited better binding affinity than the higher chain length 
 <bold>9</bold>–
 <bold>12</bold>, sulphonyl ester 
 <bold>6</bold> and chlorobenzoyl esters 
 <bold>13</bold>–
 <bold>15</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0008">Figure 8</xref>). The docking score of 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>8</bold> (–7.9 to –8.0 kcal/mol) were found to better than the previously published other compounds (Ghosh et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Thus, uridine aliphatic esters could be better choice than HCQ in treating COVID-19 infection.
