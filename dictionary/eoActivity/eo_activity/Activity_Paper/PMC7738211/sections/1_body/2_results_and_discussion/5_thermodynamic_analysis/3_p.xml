<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, some of the uridine esters have improved dipole moment. Improved dipole moment enhances the polar nature of a molecule, and promotes the binding affinity, hydrogen bonding and nonbonding interaction with the receptor protein (Lien et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>). The dipole moment of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was 7.588 Debye and for compound 
 <bold>15</bold> was 7.619 Debye which were slightly higher than the uridine (7.339 Debye) resulting their better binding affinity and interactions with the amino acid residues of receptor protein.
