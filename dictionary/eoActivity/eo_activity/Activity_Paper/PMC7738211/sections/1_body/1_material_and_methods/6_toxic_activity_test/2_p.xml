<p>For the determination of toxicity of the uridine derivatives we employed brine shrimp lethality assay technique as described by McLaughlin (
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). The tested compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and prepared 20, 40, 80 and 160 μL by adding NaCl solution to each vial up to 1 mL volume which were designated as type- A, B, C and D, respectively. Three sets of experiment were done for each concentration and 10 brine shrimps nauplii were placed in each vial. A control experiment was performed in a vial containing 10 nauplii in 1 mL seawater. After 24 h and 48 h of incubation at room temperature, the vials were observed using a magnifying glass and the number of survivors in each vial was counted and noted. From the data, the average percentage of mortality of nauplii was calculated for each concentration. No deaths were found for controls.
