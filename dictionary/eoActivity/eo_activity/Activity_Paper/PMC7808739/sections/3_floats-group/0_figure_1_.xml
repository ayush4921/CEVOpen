  <p>Flowchart of identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in a library of 774 FDA-approved drugs. An initial screening was performed to evaluate the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity by FDA-approved drugs at 20 µM. Subsequently, IC
   <sub>50</sub> characterisation was performed to pinpoint the more effective drugs. Twenty potential hit compounds were found, of which seven had a more pronounced effect in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.
