 </xref>. Briefly, a consensus cleavage sequence recognised by SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was synthesised by Genomics, Taiwan, with Dabcyl at the N-terminus and Edans at the C-terminus, Dabcyl-TSAVLQ↓SGFRKME-Edans. In protease activity assays, 0.25 µM protease was incubated with 1.25 µM peptide substrate for three hours. Assays were conducted in triplicate in Eppendorf® black 96-well microplates (MA, USA) using an assay buffer containing 12 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), in a final volume of 100 µL. The fluorescence signal at 538 nm, at a bandwidth of 15 nm, emitted from the cleaved IQF peptide substrate after excitation at 355 nm, at a bandwidth of 10 nm, was recorded by a SPARK® multimode microplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland). The relative fluorescence units (RFU) at a gain of 131 were calculated using Spark® Control Magellan™ v2.2 software.
