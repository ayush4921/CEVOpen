<p>A compound library of FDA-approved drugs was screened for SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitory activity using an IQF peptide substrate. A flowchart of the screening procedure is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>. To identify compounds as potential SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, 774 FDA-approved drugs were screened at 20 µM in the high-throughput, initial screening. Among these 774 FDA-approved drugs, twenty potentially active compounds were found, including seven drugs with superior inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The twenty most active SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors are listed in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, with their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Briefly, ethacrynic acid, naproxen, allopurinol, butenafine hydrochloride, raloxifene hydrochloride, tranylcypromine hydrochloride, and saquinavir mesylate led to 50% inhibition on SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro activity at concentrations below 10 µM. In addition, triptorelin acetate, goserelin acetate, rocuronium bromide, bisacodyl, armodafinil, and clobetasol propionate had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 10–20 µM, followed sequentially by seven moderate SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors: sirolimus (rapamycin), colistin sulphate, cetirizine, bexarotene, cefpodoxime proxetil, clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride and oxaliplatin.
