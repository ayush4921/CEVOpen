<p id="p0065">Bacterial culture (100 μL) was inoculated into test tubes with molten Müller-Hinton agar at 45 °C. Afterward, the inoculation was placed into the plates according to the previously described arrangement. Six-diameter disks of sterilized Whatman filter paper were impregnated with 25 μL of the aqueous or methanol extracts (which corresponds to 20 and 145 equivalent mg of Gallic acid, for each extract, respectively), dried, and then, gently pressed on the inoculated agar plates. Subsequently, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The experiment was replicated three times. The inhibition halo was calculated by measuring the inhibition diameter and using the following formula of percent inhibition for each bacteria for each treatment: 
 <italic>%inhibition = [(Y-Z)/Y]∗100</italic> where 
 <italic>Y</italic> represents the growth of the bacteria without extract, 
 <italic>Z</italic> represents the growth of bacteria with extract.
