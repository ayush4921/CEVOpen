 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Singleton and Rossi, 1965</xref>), modified for use in 96-well microplate, was used for total phenolic content determination of flower extracts. The total phenolic content was expressed as mg Gallic Acid Equivalents (GAE)/g flower Dry Weight (DW). Condensed tannins were quantified at 492 nm (MULTISKAN GO, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Finland) and expressed in mg (+) Catechin Equivalents (CE)/g DW as described by
