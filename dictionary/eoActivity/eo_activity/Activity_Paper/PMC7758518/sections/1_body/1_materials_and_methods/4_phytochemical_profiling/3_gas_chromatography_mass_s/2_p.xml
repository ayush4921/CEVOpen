<p id="p0040">A GC–MS system (Agilent GC Series 7890A and Agilent single quadrupole MS detector model 5975C), with electron impact model (70 eV), a mass range of 50–700 m/z, HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. x 0.25 μm), and splitless injection (at 250 °C) to 2.5 min/splitless time, was used for metabolite identification. The GC–MS control and data processing was performed by comparing their mass spectra using the Chem-Station (Agilent Technologies) software. Metabolite identification was analyzed through the spectral matching (MS) with commercialized libraries (NIST) based on the retention time, m/z, percentage of spectral similarity, and the internal standard.</p>
