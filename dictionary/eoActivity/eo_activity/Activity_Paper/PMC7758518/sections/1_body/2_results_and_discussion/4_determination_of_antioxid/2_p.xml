<p id="p0115">The antioxidant activity in the methanol and aqueous extracts was evaluated with the most used methods to analyze antioxidant activity 
 <italic>in vitro, ABTS and DPPH</italic> (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The methanol extract of 
 <italic>J. mimosifolia</italic> flower showed a higher inhibition percentage on the ABTS radicals compared to the DPPH method with no significant difference between both extracts. These results are consistent with those reported by 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Rana et al. (2013)</xref> for aqueous extracts of flowers of the same species. The 
 <italic>Jacaranda</italic> flower extracts presented a greater antioxidant effect, compared to other extracts of plants used within gastronomy and traditional medicine such as chia (
 <italic>Salvia hispanica</italic>) (2.4%–66.3% inhibition of ABTS and 4.7%–47.6% inhibition of DPPH) (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Poungoué-Kaatou, 2006</xref>), saffron (15.7% inhibition of DPPH) (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Gallo, 2010</xref>), and chamomile flower (14.5% inhibition of DPPH), taking into consideration that the difference in the inhibition percentage is also attributed to the used concentrations, type of extraction, environmental conditions and type of evaluated species (
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Salazar, 2009</xref>). A high concentration of polyphenols in the sample, mainly of the flavonoid type, contributes to greater efficiency in the elimination of free radicals. 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Mikolajczak et al. (2020)</xref> demonstrated a positive correlation (r = 0.75) between flavonoid content and antioxidant activity in various edible flowers. Thus, natural antioxidants can act as free radical scavengers, chain breakers, pro-oxidant metal ion complexes, and singlet-oxygen formation inhibitors (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Tosun et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, recent studies have reported a greater amount of phenolic compounds, and therefore a greater antioxidant activity, in some flowers than other fruits and vegetables (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">De Morais et al., 2020</xref>). Phenolic compounds, in addition to their antioxidant capacity, have been proven a beneficial role as antimicrobial components and gene expression regulators involved in inflammation processes (
