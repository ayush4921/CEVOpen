<p id="p0135">The results of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>J. mimosifolia</italic> flower are relevant since the percentage of inhibition on 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptoccus mutans</italic> (86.4% in both cases) qualifies it as an alternative of natural antimicrobial to prevalent health problems worldwide. Several studies on the antibacterial activity of plant extracts and plant parts on 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> have been performed; this pathogen is responsible for listeriosis, a disease with a high mortality rate (20%) in risk populations and considered a major food safety problem worldwide (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Pouillot et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ceruso et al., 2020</xref>). Some of these investigations attribute the inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to the presence of phytochemical compounds, such as alkaloids, polyphenolic compounds, gallic acid, glycosides, tannic acid, flavonoids and sterols (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Batool et al., 2018</xref>). Following this line, in the present work, 86.4% of inhibition for 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> was found with the methanol extract of the 
 <italic>Jacaranda</italic> flower. This information is significant since 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> is present in the multifactorial process that originates dental caries, and this might be the first assay of 
 <italic>J. mimosifolia</italic> extracts on this microorganism as no previous reports were found. The high concentration of flavonoid-type compounds reported in this work could be responsible for the inhibitory effect on these types of microorganisms. 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gutiérrez-Venegas et al. (2019)</xref> tested various polyhydroflavones against a group of microorganisms related to the dental caries process where bacteria and fungi were included by measuring the inhibition diameter; in all cases, a bacteriostatic effect was observed on the evaluated bacteria and fungi. In recent years, research related to the formation of anti-cariogenic biofilms has been carried out using polyphenolic compounds, mainly flavonoids, observing an inhibitory effect on the adhesion of hydroapatite pellets treated with proanthocyanidins exposed to 
 <italic>Streptococcus,</italic> resulting in a decrease of hydrophobicity in bacteria depending on the concentration of various flavonoids, increase of membrane permeability of bacteria, as well as decrease of acids produced by 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> in biofilms with the flavonoid apigenin (
