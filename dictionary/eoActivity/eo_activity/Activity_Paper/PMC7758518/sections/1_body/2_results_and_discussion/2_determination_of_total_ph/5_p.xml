<p id="p0090">The concentration of flavonoids is higher than the concentration of the other evaluated polyphenols (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The presence of flavonoids has been described in several investigations with extracts of flowers of the same species. 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Rana et al. (2013)</xref> reported 8.90 mg/g in the aqueous fraction of extracts with organic solvents, whereas 
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Medini et al. (2014)</xref> reported 5.55 ± 2.95 and 2.15 ± 0.16 mg Ruthin/g DW for methanol and aqueous extracts 
 <italic>of L. delicatulum</italic> flowers, respectively. Furthermore, it is observed that the amount of flavonoids is greatly influenced by the type of solvent medium used for the extraction. Flavonoids, the major group of phenolic compounds, contain a C6–C3–C6 skeleton and are by far the most diverse and common secondary metabolites in plants. Diverse modifications to the C3, such as hydroxylation, methylation, prenylation, and glycosylation, can occur to the baseline flavonoid molecules, producing a large number of flavonoids with diverse structures and different properties (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Zha et al., 2019</xref>). Epidemiological studies indicate that flavonoids have health benefits (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Gutiérrez-Venegas et al., 2019</xref>). The affection of cell membrane synthesis, nucleic acid inhibition, and metabolism of various bacterial strains provides flavonoids with bactericidal and bacteriostatic characteristics (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Muhammad et al., 2019</xref>). However, the best-known property of flavonoids is the antioxidant effects, which are often much higher than those of vitamin E and vitamin C (
