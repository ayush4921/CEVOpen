<p id="par0150">The Kidney’s function is evaluated by its capacity to effectively remove toxic waste products from the blood, and to regulate plasma electrolytes. Estimated urea and creatinine levels are a reliable acute kidney marker and may assist in diagnosis of kidney impairment [
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Urea is a product of protein and purine metabolism; it is regarded as toxic when it exceeds allowable limits. Creatinine is an endogenously synthesized compound from creatine and phosphocreatine in skeletal muscles; its excretion from the blood is entirely dependent on the kidney’s filtration capacity and, thus, significant elevations in creatinine levels of serum or plasma may indicate glomerular dysfunction.
