<p id="par0145">The residual circulating amount of conjugated bilirubin in the plasma of a healthy individual is very minimal and, as such, an increase in plasma conjugated bilirubin in an adult suggests impaired hepatocellular function; whereas, this is not the case with unconjugated bilirubin [
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. However, increase in unconjugated bilirubin (â‰¥ 90 %) is indicative of acute haemolysis of red blood cells or Gilbert syndrome [
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]; and perhaps, an increased degradation of haem. Hepatotoxicity characterized by significant elevation in plasma unconjugated bilirubin has been reportedly linked to some pharmacological and phyto-therapeutic principles present in plants, such as alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, among others; particularly, if administered at high doses [
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In the present study, the plasma total bilirubin was obviously not significantly different (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), indicating that AESG did not demonstrate a significant hepatotoxic effect. However, plasma conjugated bilirubin was significantly elevated (
 <italic>P &lt; 0.05</italic>) in test rats administered AESG 500 mg/kg. Although the liver histopathology reports of test animals presented in plates II-IV show portal congestion, however, the significant elevation in plasma conjugated bilirubin observed in the group of rats administered AESG 500 mg/kg might have resulted from the severely impaired hepatobiliary flow caused by portal congestion (
 <xref rid="fig0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>) [
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], and supported by elevated plasma ALP levels. The significant reduction in plasma conjugated bilirubin observed in rats given higher doses of AESG 1000 and 2000 mg/kg, respectively, further supports the aforementioned claim that the liver function was not significantly compromised. The significantly elevated plasma unconjugated bilirubin observed in test rats administered AESG 1000 and 2000 mg/kg, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), suggests plasma bilirubin overload, complicated by poor liver bilirubin conjugation capacity. Therefore, it is also likely that the significant elevation in plasma indirect bilirubin recorded in test rats administered AESG 1000 and 2000 mg/kg, respectively, might have been elicited by certain phyto-therapeutic compounds in medicinal plants, as earlier reported [
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. A previous study shows that 
 <italic>S. glauca</italic> contains a significant number of alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, amongst others [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]; which gives credence to the claim earlier reported by Hoffman and Manning [
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and Evans [
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].
