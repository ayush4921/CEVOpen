<p id="par0170">The AESG orally administered to experimental rats was relatively safe with 
 <italic>LD
  <sub>50</sub>
 </italic> above 5000 mg/kg. AESG appeared to have elicited alterations in plasma ALP and bilirubin levels. Nonetheless, it did not result to elevations in specific liver enzymes and non-enzyme indicators; no hepatocellular, glomerular or myocardial damages were prominent, suggesting that AESG was neither significantly toxic nor resulted in injury to vital organs; may be safely administered at lower doses.
