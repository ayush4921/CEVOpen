<p>Two compounds ( 
 <bold>I</bold> and 
 <bold>II</bold> ), of which 
 <bold>II</bold> , at high concentration (4.80%, Table 1), in the EO of the stem bark of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> , were not identified. The mass spectra of the 2 compounds were similar, but their GC retention times (RTs), as well as their RIs, were different. From their mass spectra, the base peak m/z 82 of 
 <bold>I</bold> and m/z 83 of 
 <bold>II</bold> may have been due to the base peaks of the angelates or tiglates. However, due to the lack of RTs, RIs, and mass (m/z) spectra in the literature, the 2 compounds were not identified. Surprisingly, the constituents of both oils (especially their dominant compounds) differed from that of the EO isolated from the leaf and inflorescence of the same plant [10]. The dominant components of this oil were chrysanthenone (57.5%), isochrysanthenone (6.8%), filifolone (5.2%), and (Z)-isogeranic acid (4.5%), which were not identified as major compounds from 
 <italic>L. pterodonta</italic> , 
 <italic>L. alata</italic> , 
 <italic>L. crispata</italic> , 
 <italic>L. decurrens</italic> , 
 <italic>L. aurita</italic> , 
 <italic>L. gracilis</italic> , and 
 <italic>L. oloptera</italic> . These great variations in the compositions of the EOs of the leaf and inflorescence, as well as the roots and stem bark of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> and their contents, may have been due to environmental conditions, agronomic management, postharvest technology, storage conditions, genetic factors, and analysis conditions [2]. However, the chemical class of this oil and those of the stem bark and roots was similar, as the oil was rich in oxygenated monoterpenes (78%) [10]. When compared with the EO profiles of the other investigated 
 <italic>Laggera</italic> species mentioned above, the oxygenated monoterpene, 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene, detected as the dominant compound in the present study was most abundant, as well as the most dominant chemical compound of many of these oils [2]. For example, it was the predominant compound of the EOs of the herb (44.2%) [19] and leaves (29.17%) [20] of 
 <italic>L. alata</italic> in Nigeria; the leaves (34.1%) of 
 <italic>L. alata</italic> var. 
 <italic>montana</italic> growing in Cameroon [21]; the whole 
 <italic>L. alata</italic> plant (24.4%) in Kenya [5]; the fresh leaves (28.2%) and winged stems (50.5%) of 
 <italic>L. pterodonta</italic> in Cameroon [22]; the leaves (36.75%) of 
 <italic>L. pterodonta</italic> in China [23]; the leaves (43.3%) of 
 <italic>L. pterodonta</italic> in Côte d’Ivoire [24]; the leaves (27.7%) of 
 <italic>L. aurita</italic> in Burkina-Faso [25]; the leaves (33.4%) of 
 <italic>L. gracilis</italic> , and the roots (67.8%) and stems (36.5%) of 
 <italic>L. oloptera</italic> in Cameroon [21]; and the aerial parts (43.2%) [26] and (32.2%) [27], leaves (22.28%), flowers at bud stage (48.99%), flowers at full bloom/shattering stage (64.01%), stems (62.81%), and roots (75.55%) [28] of 
 <italic>L. crispata</italic> in India. However, the EOs of the studied 
 <italic>Laggera</italic> species showed different chemical classes of compounds [2]. These variations may have been due to the factors mentioned earlier.
