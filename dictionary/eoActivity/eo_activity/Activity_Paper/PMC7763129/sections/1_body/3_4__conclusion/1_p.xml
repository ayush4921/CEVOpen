<p>The compositions of the EOs of endemic Ethiopian 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> stem bark and roots were analyzed and their antioxidant and bactericidal activities were investigated for the first time herein. The oxygenated monoterpenes, 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene, as well as thymol methyl ether, were identified as the dominant compounds of both oils, which differed from the previously reported chemical profile of the EOs obtained from the leaves and inflorescence of the same plant. Furthermore, the 2 oils demonstrated strong DPPH and H2O2 scavenging activities and bactericidal activity against the gram+ ( 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> ) bacteria, which might have been due to their high oxygenated monoterpene content. Thus, these activities suggest that the oils may be a promising prospect for pharmaceutical, food, and other industrial applications.
