<p>The H2O2 scavenging activity of the EOs was investigated 3 times using the method clearly described by Gülçin [15]. The concentrations, from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/mL, of each of the oils and AA in deionized water were dissolved in 3.4 mL of 0.10 M phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.4 and mixed with H2O2 (40 mM, 0.60 mL) solution. After few minutes, the absorbance of the mixture was determined at 230 nm using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. The negative control was prepared by replacing the test samples with distilled water. The antioxidant activity of all of test samples was expressed as the percentage of inhibition of the H2O2 and as the IC50 (mg/mL).</p>
