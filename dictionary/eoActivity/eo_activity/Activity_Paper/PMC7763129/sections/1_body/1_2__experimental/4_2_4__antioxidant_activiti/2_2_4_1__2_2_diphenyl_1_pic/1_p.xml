<p>The method described by Lesjak et al. [14], with some modifications, was used to test antioxidant activity of the EOs by DPPH. Three milliliters of standard solution of each of the concentrations, from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/mL, was mixed with 1.0 mL of 90 µM of DPPH solution in methanol (MeOH) to make the test solutions. AA was prepared in same way as the test samples. A mixture of 3 mL of MeOH and 1 mL of DPPH solution was used as the negative control. Each assay was performed 3 times and the prepared samples were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for about 30 min. Next, the absorbance for each was determined at a wavelength of 515 nm using a spectrophotometer. The antioxidant activity of all of the oils was expressed as the percentage of DPPH radical scavenging and the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) (mg/mL).</p>
