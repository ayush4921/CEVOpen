 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Andrade et al., 2018</xref>). It is well-known that harsh conditions are considered as positive factors for plants to produce numerous secondary metabolites that help them to adapt to these conditions. Most plants in Saudi Arabia grows under extreme temperatures and water scarcity which perhaps make them medicinally promising (
