<p>The antibacterial activities of three solvent extracts from 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> and 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> against each bacterium are tabulated in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The inhibition zones shown by all extracts of both the plants against each bacterial species were significantly lesser (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) than the positive control [
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. From 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> test groups, the chloroform extract demonstrated a greater inhibition zone against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (21.67 mm) and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (19.67 mm). For the acetone extract, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> was the most susceptible strain with a growth inhibition of 19 mm followed by 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (18 mm). There were no significant differences between the inhibition sizes by chloroform and acetone extracts. Overall, the methanol extract of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> exhibited a significantly lower inhibitory effect than acetone against 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001) and than chloroform against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002), 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.014) and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (
 <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001).
