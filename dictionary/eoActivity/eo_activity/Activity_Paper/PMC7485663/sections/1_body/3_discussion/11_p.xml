<p>Although the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> finding of this study suggests that the extracts from 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> and 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> are effective against the selected bacterial species, this may not necessarily be the same in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, as seen in previous studies.[

 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Therefore, more detailed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, including determination of minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration, and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> investigation of these medicinal plants should be carried out.
