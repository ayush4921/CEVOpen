<p>Standard bacterial strains of two Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 49619 and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923) and one Gram-negative bacterium (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922) were obtained from Ethiopian Public Health Institute and used in this study. They were preserved at −20°C until the preparation of inoculums. Each bacterial strain was activated by streaking on culture media aseptically. For 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, nutrient agar was used, and for 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 49619, 5% sheep blood agar was used. The culture media inoculated with 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was enclosed in a candle jar to supply 5%–10% of carbon dioxide. All the inoculated strains were incubated for 24 h at 37°C in an incubator. Then, the inoculum of each bacterium was prepared by taking 3–5 colonies and transferring them to tubes containing 5 ml of normal saline. The immersed colonies of bacteria were mixed gently to form a homogeneous suspension until the turbidity of the suspension became attuned to 0.5 McFarland standards (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL).[
