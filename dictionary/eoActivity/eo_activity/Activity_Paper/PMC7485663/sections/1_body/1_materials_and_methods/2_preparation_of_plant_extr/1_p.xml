<p>Fresh leaves of the plants were thoroughly washed by tap water and cleaned with gauze to remove dirt and soil. These samples were then air-dried under the shade and crushed into coarse powder using sterile pestle and mortar. Subsequently, 231 g powder of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> and 210 g powder of 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> were divided into three portions and extracted by cold maceration technique with 80% methanol (800 mL), acetone (1000 mL) and chloroform (1000 mL) solution in an Erlenmeyer flask for 3 consecutive days at room temperature to get the crude hydroalcoholic, acetone and chloroform extract, respectively. The same volume of solvent was used for the successive extraction of the residues. The extraction process was facilitated using a mechanical shaker (Bibby Scientific Limited, Stone Staffordshire, UK) at 120 revolutions per minute. The resulting crude extracts were separated from the marc with gauze and then filtered by Whatman filter paper Grade-1 using suction twice by the addition of fresh solvent to acquire the maximum yield. The filtrates were combined and concentrated by Rotary evaporator (Buchi Rotavapor R-200, Flawil, Switzerland) under reduced pressure. All extracts were then dried and further concentrated using a dry oven (Leaders Engineering, Hastings, UK). Finally, the extracts were transferred into an amber glass bottle and kept at −20°C until use. The respective percentage yield of 80% methanol, acetone and chloroform of 
 <italic>R. albersii</italic> was 15.9%, 16.3% and 14.8% and of 
 <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> was 16%, 14.9% and 14.6%, respectively. All the extracts were reconstituted with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain 100 mg/mL concentrations.
