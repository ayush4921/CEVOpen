  <title>Background:</title>
  <p>The increase in antimicrobial resistance worldwide has necessitated the search for alternative therapeutic agents. The leaf extracts of 
   <italic>Ritchiea albersii</italic> and 
   <italic>Cynoglossum amplifolium</italic> have been used as traditional medicine for the management of eye, ear and wound infections in Ethiopia.

  <title>Objective:</title>
  <p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of 
   <italic>R. albersii</italic> and 
   <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> against three common bacteria.

  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p>In this experimental study, the antimicrobial properties of 80% methanol, chloroform and acetone extracts of 
   <italic>R. albersii</italic> and 
   <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> were evaluated against two Gram-positive bacteria (
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and 
   <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 49619) and one Gram-negative bacterium (
   <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922) using the agar-well diffusion method. Ciprofloxacin 0.05 mg/disc was used as a positive control. Furthermore, a preliminary phytochemical study was carried out.

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>The zones of inhibition shown by all extracts of the two plants against the tested bacteria were significantly lesser (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than the standard drug. 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic> were the most susceptible strains for most extracts studied. The acetone extract of 
   <italic>R. albersii</italic> exhibited a higher inhibitory effect (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) against 
   <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (16 mm) and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> (19 mm) compared with its methanol extract. The chloroform extract of 
   <italic>R. albersii</italic> was more effective than its methanol extract (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) against all tested bacteria. The acetone extract of 
   <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> displayed a higher inhibitory effect (20 mm) against 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> than its methanol and chloroform extracts.

  <title>Conclusions:</title>
  <p>The leaf extracts of 
   <italic>R. albersii</italic> and 
   <italic>C. amplifolium</italic> exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, highlighting their potential as phytotherapeutic drugs in preventing and treating infections caused by 
   <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
   <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
   <italic>E. coli</italic>. Further investigations for isolating specific compounds and elucidating mechanisms are required to address the need for novel antibacterial drugs.
