    "<h4>Background</h4>The increase in antimicrobial resistance worldwide has necessitated the search for alternative therapeutic agents. The leaf extracts of <i>Ritchiea albersii</i> and <i>Cynoglossum amplifolium</i> have been used as traditional medicine for the management of eye, ear and wound infections in Ethiopia.<h4>Objective</h4>The objective of the study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of <i>R. albersii</i> and <i>C. amplifolium</i> against three common bacteria.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>In this experimental study, the antimicrobial properties of 80% methanol, chloroform and acetone extracts of <i>R. albersii</i> and <i>C. amplifolium</i> were evaluated against two Gram-positive bacteria (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> ATCC 25923 and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> ATCC 49619) and one Gram-negative bacterium (<i>Escherichia coli</i> ATCC 25922) using the agar-well diffusion method. Ciprofloxacin 0.05 mg/disc was used as a positive control. Furthermore, a preliminary phytochemical study was carried out.<h4>Results</h4>The zones of inhibition shown by all extracts of the two plants against the tested bacteria were significantly lesser (<i>P</i> < 0.05) than the standard drug. <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> were the most susceptible strains for most extracts studied. The acetone extract of <i>R. albersii</i> exhibited a higher inhibitory effect (<i>P</i> < 0.05) against <i>S. pneumoniae</i> (16 mm) and <i>E. coli</i> (19 mm) compared with its methanol extract. The chloroform extract of <i>R. albersii</i> was more effective than its methanol extract (<i>P</i> < 0.05) against all tested bacteria. The acetone extract of <i>C. amplifolium</i> displayed a higher inhibitory effect (20 mm) against <i>E. coli</i> than its methanol and chloroform extracts.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The leaf extracts of <i>R. albersii</i> and <i>C. amplifolium</i> exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, highlighting their potential as phytotherapeutic drugs in preventing and treating infections caused by <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>S. pneumoniae</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. Further investigations for isolating specific compounds and elucidating mechanisms are required to address the need for novel antibacterial drugs."
