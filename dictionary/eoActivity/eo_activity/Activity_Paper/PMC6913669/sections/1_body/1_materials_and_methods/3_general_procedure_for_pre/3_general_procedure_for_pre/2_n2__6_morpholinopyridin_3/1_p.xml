<p>Compound 
 <bold>9</bold> was prepared by dissolving compound 
 <bold>8</bold> (1 mmol) in methanol (50 ml) followed by addition of 10% Pd/C (0.1 mmol) and the reaction was stirred overnight under a hydrogen atmosphere. The mixture was filtered through Celite and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness to obtain 
 <bold>9</bold> that was used without further purification. Brownish white solid, yield 99.0%, MP: &gt;250 °C.
