<p>Compound 
 <bold>9</bold> (0.1 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous DCM (5 ml) and cooled to −78 °C. To this solution was added a solution of the appropriate acid chloride (1.1 eq) in anhydrous DCM (2 ml) dropwise at −78 °C and the mixture was allowed to stir for 30 min at this temperature. The mixture was then allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred overnight. After complete consumption of the amine as indicated by TLC, the solvent was evaporated, and the residue was purified with flash column chromatography using 20–50% ethyl acetate in hexane as the mobile phase to obtain 
 <bold>6g–h</bold> as solids.
