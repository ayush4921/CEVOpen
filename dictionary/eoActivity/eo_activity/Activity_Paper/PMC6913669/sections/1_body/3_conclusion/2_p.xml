<p>Heterogeneity and insensitivity of cancers, resistance evolvement, and adverse reactions of anticancer agents create a continuous need to look for new anticancer drugs to meet such unmet clinical needs. In light of this, herein we start from previously identified weak anticancer pyrimidine derivative to design new anticancer agents through hybridisation with 2,4-diarylpyrimidines. The designed series combined the structural features of the starting hit compound and 2-anilino-4-phenoxypyrimidines. The literature reported few compounds belonging to the proposed structures as potential antitauopathies. Provided the additional supportive background, the fact that CSF1R and DAPK1 were found to correlate with cancer diseases promoted these compounds as potential antiproliferative molecules. Synthesis and initial testing of these compounds against leukemic M-NFS-60 mouse cells, which is known to overexpress CSF1R, supported these predictions and suggested the presence of other molecular targets for these compounds in addition to CSF1R and DAPK1. In an attempt to identify molecular targets that cooperate with CSF1R and DAPK1 inhibition to trigger the observed antiproliferative activity, the kinase inhibitory activity of compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> against 14 kinases was assessed. The results showed that 
 <bold>6e</bold> did not disclose the potential inhibition of these kinases. Accordingly, other kinases or non-kinase molecular targets might be involved in mediating the anticancer activity of these compounds. Encouraged by their activity over M-NFS-60 cell line, the synthesised compounds were profiled for their antiproliferative activities against diverse human cancer diseases from nine origins; blood, lung, colon, brain, skin, ovary, renal, prostate and breast. The results showed that compound 
 <bold>6e</bold> (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) was the most promising among the tested compounds showing high and broad-spectrum activity against the tested cancer diseases. Compound 
 <bold>6g</bold> possessing 4-trifluoromethylphenoxy moiety showed broad-spectrum yet lower activity. In addition, a high selective inhibition of some cell lines was found as in the case of compound 
 <bold>6h</bold> which inhibited the growth of SF-539 and SR cell lines by 153.1% and 80.7%, respectively.
