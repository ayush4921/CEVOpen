<p id="Par16">Eight wavelengths (six monochromatic and three mixed-light sources) and three intensities (9, 45, and 90 µmol·m
 <sup>2</sup>/s photons) were used to explore the effects of light quality and intensity on melatonin concentration in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> L. leaves under 18-h light:6-h dark conditions using LED lights (NBL-MEL-24; Nano Bio Light, Taiwan). Of these, treatment with 9B (monochromatic blue light, 450 nm) at level 5 (45 µmol·m
 <sup>2</sup>/s photons) induced the highest melatonin concentration (approximately 131 μg/g FW; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), whereas the lowest concentration (&lt; 20 μg/g FW) was found for treatment with 9R (monochromatic red light, 660 nm) at level F (90 µmol photons·m
 <sup>2</sup>/s; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). The 8R1B treatment (R:G:B:IR ratio = 91:0:9:0) at level F induced the second highest concentration (approximately 126 μg/g FW) of melatonin in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> L. leaves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a).
