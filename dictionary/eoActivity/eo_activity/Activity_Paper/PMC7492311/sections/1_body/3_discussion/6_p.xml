<p id="Par23">As a signaling and entraining agent, melatonin is sensitive to environmental changes, particularly to the strong Zeitgeber, light. The human circadian melatonin rhythm is sensitive and can be reset by short-wavelength monochromatic light (460 nm), which demonstrates twice as much melatonin suppression as does 555-nm monochromatic light. The effects depend on exposure duration in addition to spectral quality (Lockley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2003</xref>). Photoperiodic green light (522 nm) can accelerate chick embryo development and alter hatch-related hormones, resulting in earlier hatching, probably because of changes in melatonin rhythm (Tong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2018</xref>). Melatonin was found in the roots of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>, which varied in concentration in response to the spectral quality of light including red and blue light as well as white light (control) and UV-B radiation, with highest melatonin concentration noted in the plants exposed to red light (Afreen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>). In the present study, treatment with 9B (450 nm) at level 5 (45 µmol·m
 <sup>2</sup>/s photons) maximized the melatonin concentration in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> leaves, whereas treatment with 9R (660 nm) at level F (90 µmol·m
 <sup>2</sup>/s photons) minimized it.
