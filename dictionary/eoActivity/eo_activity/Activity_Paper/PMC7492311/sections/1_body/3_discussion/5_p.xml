<p id="Par22">Garner and Allard (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1920</xref>) examined the effects of maximum daily light exposure on growth and sexual reproduction (flowering) in crops (e.g., soybeans and tobacco) and introduced the term “photoperiodism” to indicate the response of organisms to the relative length of day and night (i.e., photoperiod) (Garner and Allard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1920</xref>). The photoperiodic mechanism was initially proposed for plants but was later identified in insects on the basis of the circadian system (Bünning 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1936</xref>). More modern models have combined external and internal coincidence hypotheses to suggest that photoperiodic induction is a function of the circadian system (Pittendrigh

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1993</xref>; Sauders 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2016</xref>). Our current results clearly demonstrate that the melatonin concentration in 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> followed a photoperiodic response: Under long-day conditions (18-h light:6-h dark), it reached a maximum concentration of approximately 120 μg/g FW—nearly six times higher than that in a short-day photoperiod (10-h light:14-h dark). The photoperiodic induction of melatonin might also reflect the original natural habitat of 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> (a long-day plant) and the regulatory function of the circadian system.
