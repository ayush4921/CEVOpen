<p>Salinity stress promotes the accumulation and synthesis of effective components in LJF, especially chlorogenic acid, and other phenolic components, but the precise mechanisms of the action need further attention [

Nevertheless, controlling or evaluating the quality of herbal medicine using bioactive compounds is biased, as the complexity and incomplete knowledge of the bioactive compounds. Hence, it is necessary to systemically investigate bioactive compounds and their synthesis in LJF under salt stress to select the optimal growth environment for medicinal quality improvement. The metabolomic approach has been widely applied to comprehensively analyze metabolites and discover biomarkers of salt stress in medicinal plants [

LC-MS is regarded as one of the most common methods in metabolomics, which has been widely used to investigate the metabolic profiles of plant materials. Recently, several LC-MS methods are established for qualitative and quantitative analysis of bioactive compounds in traditional Chinese medicine in our laboratory [
