<p>The growth, development, and production of medicinal plant are usually affected by various environmental conditions including salinity [

 <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Soil salinity is the most common stress that can stimulate the accumulation of compatible osmolytes and antioxidants [

 <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As an autotrophic organism, plant can accumulate and synthesize specialized metabolites, such as phenolic, flavonoid, terpenoid, and other secondary metabolites to acquire a competitive advantage under environmental stresses. However, the accumulated and synthesized of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants under salt stress are still poorly known. Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites that possess the high antioxidant capacity to protect plants from oxidative damage under abiotic stress [
 <xref rid="pone.0243111.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Up to now, the functions of phenolic compounds on the adaptation of plants to the environment are still elusive. Understanding the alterations of plant metabolome under salt stress could provide potential clues to improve salt tolerance and quality in plants.
