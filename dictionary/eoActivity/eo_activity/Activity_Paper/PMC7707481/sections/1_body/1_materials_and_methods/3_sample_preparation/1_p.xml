<p>The fresh samples (control and salt-treated) were harvested after 35 days of salt stress and then dried in natural conditions. The dried samples of 4 groups were smashed into homogeneous size powder, which was filtered with a 50-mesh screen. Then 1.0 g of the powder was accurately weighed, and extracted using ultra-sonication in 40 mL 70% methanol for 45 min, and then cooled to room temperature; the volatile solution was compensated with 70% methanol and mixed well. The solution was centrifuged at 8050 g for 10 min and filtered through 0.22 nm membrane filters (Jinteng laboratory equipment Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) before being subjected to HPLC-Triple TOF-MS/MS analysis. Then, the supernatants were stored in a sample bottle at 4Â°C, and the rest of the freeze-dried powder was stored for other analytical tests.</p>
