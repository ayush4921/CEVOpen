 <italic>L</italic>. japonica was planted in December 2018 at Medicinal Botanical Garden of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (north latitude 118°57′1′′, east longitude 32°6′5′′), Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China. The two-year-old main roots of 
 <italic>L</italic>. japonica were transplanted from Henan province, China, which was identified by Professor Xunhong Liu (Department for Authentication of Chinese Medicines, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine). Then they were planted in plastic plots (50 cm height, 34 cm of top diameter, and 26 cm of bottom diameter). The experiment conditions were similar to the opened-air environment, except a shed blocking off rainwater was installed when the salinity stress began. Four concentrations of salt treatment (0, 100, 200, 300 mM/L NaCl) were conducted since April 24, 2019 and last for 35 days. Design treatments for each concentration in 5 replicates. In order to avoid the osmotic shock, the concentration was increased gradually until meet the set salt concentration. The stress treatment was executed at a rate of 2 L per pot every three days. Then the flower buds were collected from 5 randomly selected plants in May 2019 (
