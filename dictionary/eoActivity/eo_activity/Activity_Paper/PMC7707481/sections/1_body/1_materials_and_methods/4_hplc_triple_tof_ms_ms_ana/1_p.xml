<p>The separation was performed using the Agilent ZORBAX SB C18 column (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The mobile phase was composed of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (B) at the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. 1 μL injection volume and column temperature 35°C. The gradient elution in the following separation program: 0–4 min (2% B); 4–5 min (2–10% B); 5–25 min (10–18% B); 25–29 min (18–25% B); 29–30 min (25–44% B); 30–33 min (44–48% B); 33–38 min (48–72% B); 38–45 min (72–95% B).</p>
