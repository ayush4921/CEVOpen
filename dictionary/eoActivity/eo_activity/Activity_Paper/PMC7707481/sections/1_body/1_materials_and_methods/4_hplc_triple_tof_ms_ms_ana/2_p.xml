<p>The Triple-TOF-MS was operated on AB SCIEX Triple TOF TM 5600 System-MS/MS (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with an electronic spray ionization (ESI) source in positive and negative ion mode. The full scan mass range was set to m/z 100–2000 to acquire TOF-MS data, the scanning range of m/z 50 to 1500 to acquire TOF-MS/MS. The dynamic range enhancement was used throughout the MS experiment to ensure accurate mass measurements. The optimized MS analysis conditions were set as follows: nebulizer gas (GS 1), 55 psi; heater gas (GS 2), 55 psi; curtain gas (CUR), 40 psi; ion spray voltage floating (ISVF), 4500 V; turbo spray temperature (TEM), 550°C; declustering potential, -100 V; collision energy, -40 V.</p>
