<p>The relative contents of caffeoylquinic acid derivatives including chlorogenic acid, neochlorogenic acid, 1,3-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, 1,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, isochlorogenic acid A showed a significant accumulation under control group and low salt-treated group. In more detail, the relative contents of quinic acid (1.15-fold), 1,3-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (2.1-fold), 1,4-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (2.21-fold), chlorogenic acid (1.3-fold), and neochlorogenic acid (1.0-fold) were increased in LJF under low salt-treated samples. And the relative contents of flavonoid changes in LJF were also obviously different. Such as luteoloside, quercetin, luteolin-5-O-Î²-D-glucopyranoside, lonicerin, flavoyadorinin-B went up 1.28, 1.78, 0.95, 1.07, 1.15-folds under low salt-treated samples. In addition to phenolics and flavonoids, iridoids are also the bioactive components in LJF. It is noted that loganin (1.81-fold), swertiamarine (1.04-fold), vogeloside (3.87-fold), and secologanin (1.05-fold) also showed an increasing trend at low salt-treated samples. Our study showed that low salt dose increased the level of metabolites, derived from the shikimate-phenylpropanoid pathway were higher in LJF under 100 mM than 0, 200, 300 mM; such as quinic acid, 1,3-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid, chlorogenic acid, luteoloside, quercetin, etc. Follow up studies would validate the role of the described metabolites as markers of the stress response. The OPLS-DA analysis of the control group and low salt-treated group showed that the control group could be completely separated from the salt stress group in positive and negative mode, respectively (
