<p>The crystal structures of the two enzymes were downloaded from the protein data bank PDB ID: 4NCR for DprE1 and 2B35 for InhA. Despite, the importance of docking in providing a predicated binding mode and an account for a ligand strength, it remains a theoretical technique that needs proper validation by comparison with an experimental reference. Therefore, both co-crystallised ligands were re-docked into their corresponding enzymes. The calculated RMSD values between the co-crystallised and docked pose were 0.52 and 0.71 for DprE1 and InhA, orderly which indicates a valid and reliable docking protocol. Compound 
 <bold>5h</bold> has achieved −10.1 and −7.9 kcal/mole energy score for DprE1 and InhA, respectively, whereas, compound 
 <bold>5g</bold> has achieved −9.7 and −7.3 kcal/mole for DprE1 and InhA, respectively. Interestingly, both compounds 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> achieved a higher energy score than the co-crystalized ligand (−9.3 kcal/mole) in DprE1. These findings suggested that DprE1 may be a plausible target for the herein reported compounds.
