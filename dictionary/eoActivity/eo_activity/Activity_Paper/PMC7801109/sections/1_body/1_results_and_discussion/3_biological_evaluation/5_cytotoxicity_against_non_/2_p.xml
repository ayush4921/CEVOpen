<p>In order to assess the cytotoxic impact of hybrids 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> on normal human cells, an MTT cytotoxicity assay was carried out against non-tumorigenic WI-38 cells. The obtained results ascribed to hybrids 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> non-significant cytotoxic action with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value = 60.95 and 54.01, respectively (
