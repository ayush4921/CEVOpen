<p>Concerning the structure–activity relationship, it was observed that the anti-tubercular activity of compounds 
 <bold>5a–5i</bold> was affected by two main factors; 
 <italic>N</italic>-substitution and incorporation of halogen at position 5 of the oxindole ring. Regarding 
 <italic>N</italic>-substitution it was shown that, compounds bearing isobutyl group: 
 <bold>5b</bold>, 
 <bold>5f</bold>, and 
 <bold>5h</bold> exhibited remarkable activity with MIC values = 1.95, 0.48, and 0.24 µg/mL, respectively. Similarly, compound 
 <bold>5d</bold> with 
 <italic>N</italic>-benzyl moiety revealed a potent activity with MIC = 0.24 µg/mL. In contrast, compounds 
 <bold>5c</bold> and 
 <bold>5i</bold> carrying the 
 <italic>N</italic>-ethylcarboxylate group were found to be the least active derivatives (MIC = 7.81 µg/mL). Moreover, the contribution of substitution at position 5 of oxindole ring on the activity was quite important. Incorporating 5-Br group in compounds 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> (MIC = 0.24 µg/mL) showed better activity than 5-Cl substituted compounds 
 <bold>5e</bold> and 
 <bold>5f</bold> (MIC = 0.48 and 3.9 µg/mL, respectively) and the unsubstituted congeners 
 <bold>5a–5c</bold> (MIC range = 3.9–7.81 µg/mL).
