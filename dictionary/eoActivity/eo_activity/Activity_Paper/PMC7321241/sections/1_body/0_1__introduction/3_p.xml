The discovery of beneficial phytochemical constituents in medicinal plants and their use in the management of MetS reduce the financial burden of relying on expensive synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. According to the WHO, most rural and urban-based populations in Africa still rely on traditional medicines for their primary healthcare, even in the presence of pharmaceutical drugs [

Another driving factor in the use of medicinal plants is the perception that they are devoid of adverse side effects and acute toxicity when compared to some of the pharmaceutical agents that are currently being used in the management of metabolic disorders [
