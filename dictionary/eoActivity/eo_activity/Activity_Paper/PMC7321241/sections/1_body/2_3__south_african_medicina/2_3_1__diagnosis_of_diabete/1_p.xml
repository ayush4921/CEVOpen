<p>Although they have no access to laboratory-based diagnostic methods, traditional health practitioners claim they diagnose diabetes mellitus in patients using symptomatic presentations, e.g., weight loss, fatigue, excessive urination, low sex drive, and glucosuria [

The efficacy of a treatment of the condition is similarly monitored based on the reduction in symptoms, e.g., disappearance of sugar in urine, reduction in fatigue. From these reports, it is however difficult to determine if traditional diagnostic methods can distinguish between Type 1 diabetes, which is insulin-dependent, and Type 2 diabetes (not insulin-dependent) and if treatment methods are distinctive for these two. One of the challenges with an exclusively symptom-driven diagnosis is that it may be more effective for diagnosing Type 1 diabetes mellitus, in which symptoms appear early, than Type 2 diabetes mellitus, where symptoms may be less marked and delayed in their presentation, manifesting when complications have already developed.
