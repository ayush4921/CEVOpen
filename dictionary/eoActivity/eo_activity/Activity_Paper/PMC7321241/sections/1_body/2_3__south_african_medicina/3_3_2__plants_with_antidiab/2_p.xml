<p>The modes of action of medicinal plants used in South Africa are not well reported. A few of them have been subjected to rigorous in vivo physiological, pharmacological, and biochemical testing to determine how they work in treating diabetes mellitus. 
 <italic>Hypoxis argentae, Tarchonanthus camphoratus, Euclea undulata, Strychnos henningsii, Cissampelo campensis, Elaeodendron transvaalense</italic>, and 
 <italic>Schkuria pinnata</italic> have been reported to increase the uptake of glucose in cultured muscle cells, hepatic cells, or preadipocytes and may therefore exhibit hypoglycemic effects through increasing the peripheral uptake of glucose [

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Plants containing α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitors may help reduce post-prandial hyperglycemia, e.g., 
 <italic>Senna alexandri, Cymbopogon citrutus, Nuxia floribunda</italic>, and 
 <italic>Curcubita pepo</italic> [

 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> and 
 <italic>H. argentae</italic>, may also act by preserving and increasing the regeneration of pancreatic β-cells, hence increasing insulin release [

 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-02669" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Some plants, e.g., 
 <italic>Vernonia amygdalina, Hypoxis hemerocallidea, Mimusops zeyheri, Catharanthus roseus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Sutherlandia frutescens</italic>, are very popular for the treatment of diabetes across South Africa. However, although some plants are frequently cited by traditional practitioners for their beneficial properties in the treatment of diabetes, e.g., 
 <italic>M. zeyheri</italic>, there are still very few pharmacological data to validate their efficacy. Similarly, effective doses, toxicity levels, and interactions of some of these commonly used plants with modern antidiabetic pharmacological drugs remain unknown.
