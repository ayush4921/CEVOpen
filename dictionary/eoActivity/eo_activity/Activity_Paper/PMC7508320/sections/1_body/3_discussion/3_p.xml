<p> Nowadays, the alarming occurrence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a medical significance and necessitates brand new and effective therapeutic agents that can strongly fight microbial agents (Agrawal et al., 1996; Parekh et al., 2005). In our present work, antimicrobial properties of methanolic extract of MC were investigated by determining the zone of inhibition. The concentration of 1000 Î¼g/ml was found to resistant on Gram positive (+ve) 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> but produced significant antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (+ve) 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and Gram negative 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (zone of inhibition was 15 and 13 mm, respectively).
