<p>In the current study, seeds of MC were collected from the local market of Chittagong city, Bangladesh. An expert of Bangladesh National Herbarium located in Mirpur, Dhaka, Bangladesh, ascertained the seeds with accession number- DACB: 93486. After drying, seeds were ground into a rough powder using an appropriate grinder. Then, 550 g of grinded-powdered material was taken in exceedingly clean, flat-bottomed glass instrumentation and soaked in 2500 ml of 98% pure methanol. The container was sealed perfectly with its content and kept for 15 days with occasional shaking and stirring. The whole mixture then underwent through a two-step filtration process; firstly with the help of fresh cotton materials and then by a Whatman filter paper (460 mm x 570 mm) (Bibby RE200, Sterilin Ltd., UK) (Hira et al., 2013).</p>
