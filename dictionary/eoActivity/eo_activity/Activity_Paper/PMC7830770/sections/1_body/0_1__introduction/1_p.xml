<p>Diabetes mellitus, characterized by hyperglycemia (abnormally elevated fasting and postprandial glucose level in the blood), represents a heterogeneous group of disorders of multiple etiologies and a major health problem worldwide. While great effort has been made in the management of diabetes, its prevalence continues to grow together with a serious increase of morbidity and mortality related to the development of diabetic complications [

While chemical and biochemical hypoglycemic agents, e.g., insulin, tolbutamide, phenformin, troglitazone, rosigitazone, and repaglinide, are the mainstay of treatment of diabetes and are effective in controlling hyperglycemia, they have harmful side-effects and fail to significantly alter the course of diabetic complications [

Mushrooms, traditionally used as remedies for diabetes healing, represent an exciting field for developing new types of therapeutics to control diabetes and its complications. Some mushrooms have demonstrated clinical and/or experimental control of blood glucose and modification of the course of diabetic complications without side-effects [

To date, more and more bioactive components including polysaccharides and their protein complexes, dietary fibers, terpenoids, and other compounds extracted from fruiting bodies, cultured mycelium, or cultured broth of medicinal mushrooms have been reported to have anti-hyperglycemic activity. These compounds exhibit their antidiabetic activity via different mechanisms. However, there is insufficient scientific or clinical evidence to draw definitive conclusions about the efficacy and safety of individual medicinal mushrooms or their isolated bioactive compounds to be used as official drugs for treatment of diabetes. Therefore, well-designed randomized controlled trials with long-term consumption are needed to guarantee the bioactivity and safety of mushroom products for diabetic patients. This review covers contemporary drug therapy for diabetic patients and underlines recent studies that demonstrated the hypoglycemic effect of mushroom major bioactive components as well as the importance of their use in the treatment of diabetes. In addition, known mushroom bioactive component-induced mechanisms and pathways involved in lowering blood glucose concentration are elaborated.
