<p>Lanostane-type triterpenoids isolated from the submerged culture of chaga mushroom, 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic>, were tested for the presence of inhibitory effect on α-glycosidase activity. Inotolactones A and B, examples of lanostane-type triterpenoids bearing α,β-dimethyl, α,β-unsaturated δ-lactone side chains, exhibited more potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activities than the positive control, acarbose. This finding might be related to the anti-hyperglycemic properties of the fungus and to its popular role in the treatment of diabetes [
