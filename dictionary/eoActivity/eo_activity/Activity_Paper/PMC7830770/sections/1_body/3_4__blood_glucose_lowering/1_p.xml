<p>Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrates, composed of the monosaccharide unit and linked by glycosidic bonds. Based on the monosaccharide composition, they are divided into homopolysaccharides and heteropolysaccharides. In both types of polysaccharides, monosaccharides can link in a linear fashion or they can branch out into complex formation. Earlier studies showed that biologically active polysaccharides are widespread among higher basidiomycetous mushrooms, and most of them belong to the group of beta-D-glucans. β-glucan, a type of dietary fiber present in sources like cereal grains, yeast, mushrooms, and prebiotic bacteria, is helpful in the prevention and control of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer [

Besides the fact that β-glucan improves hyperglycemia, it has been shown that β-glucan administration under diabetic conditions promotes a systemic improvement which can increase the organism’s resistance to the onset of diabetic complications [

Mushroom β-glucans are non-starch polysaccharides with a glucose polymer-chain core with beta-(1–3) linkages in the main chain of glucan and additional beta-(1–6) branch points. The core chain lengths of β-glucan differ, as do the types and complexity of side chain branching. It has been proposed that high molecular weight glucans with a higher degree of structural complexity appear to be more effective than those of low molecular weight. Mushrooms also contain different types of heteropolysaccharides β-D-glucans with chains of xylose, mannose, galactose, and uronic acid and glycoproteins β-D-glucan-protein complexes [
