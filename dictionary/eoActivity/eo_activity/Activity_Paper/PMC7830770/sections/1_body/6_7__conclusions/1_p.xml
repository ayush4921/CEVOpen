<p>Diabetes represents a serious health issue worldwide with a significant rise in morbidity and mortality every year. While the commercial hypoglycemic agents are effective in controlling hyperglycemia, they have harmful side-effects, high cost, and may cause serious complications, such as hypoglycemia, development of insulin resistance, severe cardiovascular risks, and cancer-associated risks. Therefore, the search for active antidiabetic agents from natural sources represents an exciting opportunity for the development of new types of therapeutics. Traditional medicine, together with various experimental studies, clearly indicates a great therapeutic potential of edible and medicinal mushrooms for treatment of diabetes. Nowadays, it is becoming increasingly important to isolate and identify specific bioactive compounds with antidiabetic properties and to clarify the mechanisms of their hypoglicemic action. A large number of polysaccharides and triterpens have been extracted from a wide variety of mushroom species and their structural features and mechanisms of hypoglycemic activities have been elucidated. The bioactivity mechanisms, biosynthetic pathways, and productivities of the polysaccharides and triterpenes are also highly variable in different mushroom species and different cultivation conditions. Bearing in mind that there is a clear relationship between the structure and bioactivity of these secondary metabolites, continued investigation along this line will help to identify the most effective structures, and improve regulation strategies in a controllable biosynthesis of polysaccharides and triterpenes with enhanced bioactivities. Furthermore, well-designed randomized controlled trials with long-term consumption are needed to guarantee the bioactivity and safety of mushroom products for diabetic patients.</p>
