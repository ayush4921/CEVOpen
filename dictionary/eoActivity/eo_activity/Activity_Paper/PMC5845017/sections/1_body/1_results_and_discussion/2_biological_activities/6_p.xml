<p id="Par15">Several techniques have been used to determine antioxidant capacity. One of the methods we used is based on scavenging activity, in which we measured the ability of polygonumins A to donate electrons to a free radical to scavenge potential damage. The antioxidant activity determined by the DPPH free radical-scavenging method (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) was not consistent with our expectations. The measured IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 812 µg/ml indicated that polygonumins A is far less potent than gallic acid and ascorbic acid. It has been reported that ethanolic, methanolic, and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>minus</italic> exhibit antioxidant activity as remarkable as that of gallic acid and ascorbic acid
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>
 </sup>. This activity is due to the phenylpropane group of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>minus</italic>. The four units of the phenylpropanoid group in the structure have been show to produce lower scavenging activity
 <sup>

 </sup>. However, the high antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>minus</italic> extracts has been attributed to high contents of polyphenolic compounds
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, we measured the total phenolic content of polygonumins A by the Folin-Ciocalteu method. Phenols consist of hydroxyl groups that are able to destroy free radicals to form stable phenoxyl radicals
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>
 </sup>. Although the results of the DPPH assay showed a weak scavenging ability, the total phenolic content of this compound is relatively high at 124.0625 ± 0.88 mg GAE/g when compared with that of crude extract. In our previous studies, we found that the total phenolic content in crude 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>minus</italic> ethanolic extract produced the highest scavenging activity, ranging from 100 to 140 mg GAE/g
 <sup>16</sup>. Perhaps the antioxidant activity of this compound is not due to DPPH scavenging activity alone. Because antioxidant activity can be realized by multiple mechanisms or a single mechanism, we analysed the reducing power capacity of polygonumins A. This assay determines a substance’s ability to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>. The presence of antioxidants in the extracts result in the reduction of the ferric cyanide complex (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) to the ferrous cyanide form (Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>). We found that polygonumins A may act as an electron donor (a hydrogen electron donor), supporting its antioxidant activity, as the compound showed a comparatively high reducing capacity, with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 89.3 µg/ml, near the value of its reference compound gallic acid (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The reducing power of this compound increased rapidly with its concentration. Based on this antioxidant activity, the compound’s high total phenolic content was correlated with its reducing power. Hence, It can be inferred that polygonumins A could act as a strong antioxidant agent.
