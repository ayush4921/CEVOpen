<p id="Par17">Polygonumins A appeared to possess high binding affinity towards HIV protease (pdb ID: 3OXC), as indicated by low binding free energy range of −10.5 to −11.3 kcal/mol (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) recorded in 3 independent runs. The low binding free energies are comparable to those of vanicoside A (−10.5 to −11.7 kcal/mol) docked to the same protein, as illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Moreover, pepstatin (positive control) exhibited low binding free energies of −8.9 to −9.5 kcal/mol in 3 independent runs. Pepstatin has been used as positive control drug that exhibits anti-HIV properties through enzymatic assay

 </sup>, and thus, pepstatin was included as a reference in a comparative analysis of molecular docking to determine the compound’s activity as an anti-HIV protease based on its potential binding affinity. The structures possessing the lowest binding free energy were visualized, and hydrogen bond analysis was conducted using the surface/binding analysis tool in UCSF Chimera version 1.11. The residues involved in hydrogen bond interactions are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. Moreover, superimposition of the structures showed that polygonumins A, vanicoside A and pepstatin were docked in a similar binding domain (Fig.
