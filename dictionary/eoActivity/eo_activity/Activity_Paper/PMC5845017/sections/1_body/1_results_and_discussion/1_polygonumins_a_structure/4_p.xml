 </sup>. The structural differences between vanicoside A and polygonumins A are located at C-3″″′. Carbon C-3″″′ of vanicoside A binds a methoxyl unit with δ
 <sub>C</sub> and δ
 <sub>H</sub> chemical shifts of 55.25 ppm and 3.85 ppm, respectively. Carbon C-3″″′ of polygonumins A binds a proton unit with a chemical shift δ
 <sub>H</sub> of 6.94 (
 <italic>d</italic>, 8.4, 1 H). Furthermore, structural differences between vanicoside A and polygonumins A are observed for the substituents at C-4, C-2′ and C-4′. In vanicoside A, the substituents at C-4, C-2′ and C-4′ are hydroxyl, ethanoyl and hydroxyl units, respectively. However, the substituents at C-4, C-2′ and C-4′ in polygonumins A are ethanoyl, hydroxyl, and ethanoyl units, respectively. In the HMBC spectrum of polygonumins A in particular, the first ethanoyl unit shows long-range
