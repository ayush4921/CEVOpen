<p id="Par12">In addition to its sensitivity towards the leukaemia cell line, polygonumins A exhibited cytotoxic activities against human breast cancer and colorectal cancer cells. This finding could well explain why polygonumins A has been widely used to treat digestive disorders. It is believed that the sugar moiety, a sucrose unit, in its structure plays an important role in determining its pharmacological and biological activities. Structure and activity relationship (SAR) analysis of several related compounds containing sugar moieties, such as CCL-34 and its natural analogues, revealed that the sugar moiety was essential to their anticancer activity

 </sup>. In particular, the sugar moiety was recognized to be critical to the topoisomerase inhibition activity of anthracyclines as antitumour drugs. It has also been suggested that the sugar structure in daunorubicin plays a critical role in determining its anticancer activity
