<p id="Par21">The structure of the purified compound was determined based on spectral data recorded on a Frontier Perkin-Elmer FTIR/NIR (Perkin-Elmer Inc., Norwalk, CT, USA) spectrophotometer and a Bruker NMR 600 MHz Cryo-Probe instrument that could perform 1-D and 2-D NMR measurements (Bruker, Germany). ESIMSs were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics micrOTOF-Q 86 (direct infuse + ve.m). Isolation was carried out by radial chromatography using round glass plates on a Merck Kieselgel 60 PF
 <sub>254</sub> (art. no. 7749), and the profile was analysed using aluminium sheets measuring 20 × 20 cm on a Merck TLC silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> with a thickness of 0.25 mm (art. no. 5554) with UV light detection (254 nm) or CeSO
 <sub>4</sub> spraying followed by heating.
