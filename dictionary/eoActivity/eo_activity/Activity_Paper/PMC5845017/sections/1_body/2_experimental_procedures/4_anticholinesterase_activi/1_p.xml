 </sup> with slight modifications. Electric eel AchE (electric eel acetyl-cholinesterase, type-VI-S, EC 3.1.1.7, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and acetylthiocholine iodide (Sigma–Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) were used as the enzyme and substrate, respectively. Briefly, 125 μl of DTNB (Sigma–Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.02 M MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>.6H
 <sub>2</sub>O), 25 μl of AChE (0.2 U/ml), 25 μl of test compound solution in DMSO, and 50 μl of buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1% BSA) were mixed and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. DMSO or buffer (25 μl) was added instead of the test compound solution in control experiments. The reaction was then initiated by the addition of 25 μl of acetylthiocholine iodide (0.25 mmol/l), which brought the final volume to 250 μl. The formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoate anion from the enzymatic hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine iodide was monitored based on the absorbance at 412 nm on a 96-well microplate reader (Model 680, Biorad Inc., and Hercules, CA, USA). The reaction rates were calculated from data collected at specific time points over the first 180 s in 20 s increments. Percent inhibition of AChE was determined by the ratio of the reaction rate with the test sample to that with the blank control (DMSO in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0) using the formula (
 <italic>E</italic> − 
 <italic>S</italic>)/
 <italic>E</italic> × 100, where 
 <italic>E</italic> is the activity of enzyme with DMSO and 
 <italic>S</italic> is the activity of enzyme with the test sample. The experiments were carried out in triplicate. Tacrine was used as a reference compound.
