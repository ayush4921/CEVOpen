<p id="Par25">For cell migration analysis, the wound healing assay was performed. HT29 cells (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and allowed to reach to 80% confluence. Wounds were performed by making a scratch across the cell monolayer to create an open gap, mimicking a wound. Cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove floating debris. Each well was subsequently filled with fresh media containing the samples under study, in a concentration of 100 μg/mL and allowed to grow for 48 h. The invaded area after 48 h was calculated in each treatment and compared to the initial area at 0 h, to determine the area covered by migrating cells into the denuded zone at the beginning of treatment. This comparison allowed us to assess the inhibitory effect (if any) exerted by each protein fraction on the HT29 cell migrating capacity.
