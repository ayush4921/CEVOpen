<p id="Par13">Nonetheless, antagonist results arise frequently: whilst many papers described its anticancer properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], others surprisingly claim 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> is indeed carcinogenic over a specific dose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or alert that specific compounds present in 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> may be highly toxic if not taken under caution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One reason for this could be the overall misidentification of the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> genus species, since current research supports that there are 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species that have more potent bioactivities than 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].
