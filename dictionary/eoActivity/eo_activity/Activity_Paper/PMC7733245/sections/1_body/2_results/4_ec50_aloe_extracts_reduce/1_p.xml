<p id="Par38">Concerning the wound healing assay, we set out to characterize the migratory response of HT29 cells when exposed to the 50% (v/v) methanolic extractions of 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> and 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>. Since the EC50 concentration was around 25 μg/mL, this concentration was selected for the wound healing assays and the results are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The percentage of wound closure of cells exposed to the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts was compared to a positive control (deoxycycline at a concentration of 40 μg/mL), which presented a gap above 50% after 48 h.
