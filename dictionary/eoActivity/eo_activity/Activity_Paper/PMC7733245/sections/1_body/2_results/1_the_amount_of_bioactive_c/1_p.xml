<p id="Par30">The amounts of the different classes of bioactive compounds in both 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species are present in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. When comparing 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> and 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> we can easily identify differences between species regarding both the extraction methods for each component and the amount of each component per amount of fresh weight. Results presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (a) corroborate the low amount of proteins present in both species, which were overall less than 0.1% (w/v) of fresh weight. Nonetheless, protein amounts and distribution varied significantly between both species.
