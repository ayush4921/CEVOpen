<p id="Par35">Since distinct extraction procedures seem to provide different quantities of various compounds and differ between 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species, we aimed to select the best extraction method for the HT29 cell assays, using buffer-soluble and methanolic extractions. The results expressed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> indicate that buffer-soluble extractions did not show any significant reduction in cell migration when compared to controls (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), in contrast to the methanolic extractions where an overall reduction in cell migration was obtained by both species extracts. Concerning 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>, both methanolic extractions led a significant reduction (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) of about 80% in cell migration. In the case of 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> the best results were obtained for 50% (v/v) methanolic extracts when compared to the 100% (v/v) methanolic extract (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). As there was no difference for 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> and as it provided the best results for 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>, the 50% (v/v) methanolic extractions were selected for the remaining cancer cell assays.
