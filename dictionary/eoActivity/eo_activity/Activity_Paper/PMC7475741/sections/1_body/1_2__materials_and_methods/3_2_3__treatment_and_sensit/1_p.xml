<p>Adult rabbits (weighing 800–1200 g (gram)) of either sex were treated according to the law of animal welfare of the Republic of Kosova as well as according to good experimental practices. The protocol and procedures employed in this study were ethically reviewed and approved by the responsible bodies of Uni. Prishtina. All experiments were carried out in compliance with relevant national and international standards for animal experiments [

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], especially in compliance with the Directive 2010/63/EU. Rabbits were purchased from domestic suppliers, housed in standard conditions, 19°C–23°C and 12 h light/dark cycle, with food and water administered

The trachea was cut into small segments (2–3 mm) with 2 cartilage rings, each mounted between two stainless steel hooks within thermostatically controlled (37°C) organ baths. The lower hook was tied at the bottom of the organ bath, while the upper tissue hook was tied with an isometric force transducer (DMT 750, Danish Myo Technology, Denmark) connected to an ink-writing recorder. The mounted trachea segment was kept in an organ bath filled with a 10 mL volume of KHS (pH 7.4, 37°C) in the composition as follows (mM): NaCl (118), KCl (4.7), CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (2.52), MgSO
 <sub>4</sub> (1.64), KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub> (1.18), NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (7), and glucose (5.5) and continuously bubbled with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% O
