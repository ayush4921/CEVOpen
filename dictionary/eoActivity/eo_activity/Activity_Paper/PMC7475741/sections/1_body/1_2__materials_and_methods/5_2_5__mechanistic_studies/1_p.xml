<p>The first step toward understanding how the

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], mediated mechanisms regulating tracheorelaxant activities induced by carbachol. The signaling mechanism by which NO induces tracheorelaxation is as follows: NO is produced in the endothelial cells and then diffuses into the adjacent smooth muscle cells, where it activates soluble guanylate cyclase leading to the production of the second messenger cGMP. This in turn stimulates muscle relaxation [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. cGMP, in a process catalysed by PDE-5, is hydrolysed to inactive metabolite 5â€²GMP, thus ending the relaxation. Additional cellular signaling pathway involved in muscle relaxation is COX-1-PGE2 [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The synthesis of PGE2 from arachidonic acid is catalysed by COX.
