 <sup>G</sup>-nitro-ʟ-arginine methyl ester, an inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthases (NOS)), bradykinin (stimulator of NOS), indomethacin (cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor), and ODQ (1H-[1, 2, 4] oxadiazolo[4, 3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, a selective inhibitor of nitric oxide-sensitive guanylyl cyclase) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. All other chemicals and reagents used for making specific physiological solutions and other analyses used in this study were of analytical grade. Bradykinin was dissolved in 0.1 M acetic acid concentration and ODQ in DMSO whereas indomethacin in ethanol (50 mg/mL). All other drugs were dissolved in distilled water unless otherwise stated. Worthy to mention, all the drugs were freshly made up and used on the day of the experiments.
