<p>Isometric tension was continuously measured with a force transducer (DMT 750, Danish Myo Technology, Denmark). The trachea segments were manually stretched initially to 1 g initial tension, which was found to be optimal for measuring the changes in tension [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This passive tension was applied throughout the experiment, and subsequent changes in tension were recorded continuously using the PowerLab system with LabChart software (ADI Instruments, Denmark). Tracheal rings were allowed to equilibrate for 45–60 min before applying any test substance, during which the trachea ring segments were regularly washed out with KHS every 15 min, and resting tension 1 g was readjusted. After the equilibrium period, in an independent series of experiments, the trachea ring segments were preincubated (app. 5 min) without or with respective concentrations of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract (0.5 or 1 or 2 mg/mL) and without (basal tonus (untreated)) or with ACh (0.3 nM–1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) to induce tracheal smooth muscle contractions. In addition, in another set of experiments, other spasmogens, such as CCh (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) or KCl (80 mM), were applied on isolated trachea segments to induce smooth muscle constrictions, and when the plateau was achieved, the increased concentrations of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract (0.3–2 mg/mL) were tested by their addition in a cumulative manner to the organ bath and left to achieve a new plateau for each indicated concentration. The control tracheal rings were measured in parallel with the experimental tissues.
