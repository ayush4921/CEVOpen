<p>Similarly, 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract also showed its relaxant effect against high K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced contractions (80 mM) in rabbit tracheal preparations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). The 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract caused inhibitory effects in a cumulative dose-dependent manner (0.3–2 mg/mL). As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>, pretreatment of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract at the doses of 0.75 and 1 mg/mL significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5-6) relaxed the muscle, whereas the effect was more potentiated at 1.5 and 2 mg/mL (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) as compared with high K
 <sup>+</sup> alone; therefore, 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract clearly exerted its relaxant effects in CCh as well as high K
 <sup>+</sup>-induced trachea muscle contraction. However, the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract-mediated tracheorelaxant effect was more pronounced in CCh-induced airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction than in high K
 <sup>+</sup>.
