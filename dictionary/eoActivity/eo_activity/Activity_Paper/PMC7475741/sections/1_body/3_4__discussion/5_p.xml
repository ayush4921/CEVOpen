<p>Nonetheless, an additional pathway (i.e., COX-1-PGE2-mediated relaxation [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) appears to participate in SRE-induced smooth muscle relaxation in rabbit tracheal rings. SRE significantly declined, whereas COX inhibitor indomethacin enhanced the tracheal smooth muscle constructive effect precontracted with CCh. In this line, pretreatment with indomethacin declined the relaxant effect of the SRE in tracheal rings precontracted with CCh. However, the prostaglandin E2 pathway seems to be involved in the action of the SRE, although to a lesser extent compared to the NO/cGMP pathway.
