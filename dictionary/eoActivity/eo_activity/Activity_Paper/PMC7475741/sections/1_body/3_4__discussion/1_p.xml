<p>This study demonstrates that the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract has relaxant effects following smooth muscle-induced contractions by distinct spasmogens, including ACh, CCh, and high K
 <sup>+</sup> stimuli. Thus, suggesting 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract has anticholinergic activity, involving Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> entry blockade. Furthermore, the SRE-dependent relaxant effect was decreased by the exposure to the NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, by the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, ODQ, and by the COX inhibitor, indomethacin, whereas it was increased by the NOS stimulator, bradykinin. This shows that both pathways, NO/cGMP and PGE2, contribute to the SRE-sensitive tracheal relaxations.
