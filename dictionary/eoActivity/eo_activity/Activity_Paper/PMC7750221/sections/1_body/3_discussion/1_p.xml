<p>Wound healing depends on the intricate and complex collaborative activity of several cell types, including keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, white fat cells, and tissue-specific stem cells. Reticular fibroblasts move from deeper layers of the skin to initiate reepithelialization, thereby producing thick well-organized collagen fibers, whereas papillary fibroblasts stimulate new hair follicles by inhibiting Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling and consequent fibrosis [

In addition, dermal white adipose tissue and adipogenesis can help recruit fibroblasts to the wound site, favoring wound closure, and the regeneration of hair follicles. Finally, myofibroblasts, contractile collagen-secreting cells, are activated during the wound healing process, and their precursor cells comprise fibroblasts, endothelial, and epithelial cells. Excessive stimulation can result in fibrosis, while insufficient stimulation can delay wound healing [
