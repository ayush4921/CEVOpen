<p>Finally, the composition analysis of the latex and its fractions revealed flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenes in whole latex, while terpenes and alkaloids were detected in the aqueous fraction, which exhibited the best wound healing activity. Conversely, only terpenes were found in the chloroform fraction, which had poorer wound healing activity. According to this broad analysis, it is likely that alkaloids were the phytochemical compounds responsible for wound healing activity because they were not detected in the chloroform fraction. Although the composition of latex is similar among 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> species, some phytochemicals are present at lower concentrations or completely absent depending on the specific 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> species [

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The differences in latex phytochemical composition detected among different published papers may suggest that composition is dependent on the species of 
 <italic>Jatropha</italic> species and the sensitivity of the analytical techniques used.
