<p>Wound healing efficacy was assessed by mechanically measuring the tensile strength of the wound and expressing it as a percentage of that of healthy skin. We observed that the wound healing efficacy in mice treated with the aqueous latex fraction was 97%, similar to that of healthy skin; these data agree with the histologic and macroscopic observations. However, in mice treated with the A-Derma
 <sup>Â®</sup> positive control, the wound healing efficacy was 79%. Both the aqueous latex fraction and positive control groups appeared to have identical macroscopic features, but on further analysis, the aqueous latex fraction yielded better results. The mice treated with whole latex and ethyl acetate latex extract experienced the worst results: 59% and 72% wound healing efficacy, respectively. These data parallel the histological analysis and progress of reepithelialization.
