<p>It should be noted that Masson’s trichrome is limited in its ability to reveal the complexity of regeneration of injured skin at the cellular and molecular levels; however, hypertrophic or keloid scars were not observed in any treated group. Nonetheless, it is necessary to use other tools, such as histochemistry and molecular techniques, to elucidate the mechanism of action of the latex’s wound healing effects. Although there are few reports on the mechanism of action of latex, two papers have recently described the infiltration and mobilization of CD68+ and CD34+ cells in skin tissues treated with
