<p>The inhibitory effects of the candidate plant extracts on pancreatic lipase activity were evaluated at concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00056-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Based on the results, the candidate plants were divided into three groups according to their pancreatic lipase-inhibitory activity (low, moderate, and high). The group with low inhibitory activity, consisting of plants that inhibited lipase activity by no more than 70% at the highest tested concentration, consisted of 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> (31% ± 7.4%), 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> (61% ± 2.3%), and 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> (70% ± 2.7%). The plants with moderate inhibitory activity, which inhibited lipase activity by more than 70% at the highest concentration but not at lower concentration, included 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> (90% ± 20.6% at 1.0 mg/mL) and 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> (91% ± 1.5% at 1.0 mg/mL). The group with high inhibitory activity, which inhibited lipase activity by more than 70% at all concentrations, consisted of 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic>.
