<p>The abilities of the candidate plant extracts to reduce lipid accumulation were evaluated at concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00056-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The candidate plants were divided into two groups based on their potential to reduce lipid accumulation in adipocytes (yes or no). 
 <italic>M. alba</italic>, 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> exhibited no ability to reduce lipid accumulation, whereas the remaining plants displayed the potential to reduce lipid accumulation. Among them, 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> exhibited constant activity at all tested concentrations, whereas the effects of 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic>, 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic>, and 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> increased with the increasing concentration.
