<p>The present study is the first ethnobotanical investigation in Valmalenco (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04144-f001">Figure 1</xref>). It is part of the European Interreg Italy-Switzerland B-ICE project, aimed at creating a management model for the ongoing climate change and searching for new opportunities of territory valorization as attractions for tourists. Specifically, our work focused on Caspoggio, a village of about 1,400 inhabitants, located at 1098 m above sea level, enclosed by the Bernina Alps. Situated at the border with Valtellina, in the province of Sondrio (Lombardy–Italy), Valmalenco was an important link between Italy and Switzerland due to a millenary thoroughfare that used to cross the entire valley: the ‘cavallera del Muretto’ road. Between the 19th and 20th centuries, alternative passes were created and that ancient road was closed, resulting in the impoverishment of the local society, economy, and territory.
