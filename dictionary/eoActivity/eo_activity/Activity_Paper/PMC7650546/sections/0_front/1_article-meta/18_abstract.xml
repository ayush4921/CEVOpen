 <p>Background—Medicinal plants are traditionally used as infusions or decoctions for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic and anti-diabetic properties. Purpose—The aim of the study was to define the polyphenol composition and to assess the antioxidant capacity of eight medicinal plants from Reunion Island referred to in the French Pharmacopeia, namely 
  <italic>Aphloia theiformis</italic>, 
  <italic>Ayapana triplinervis</italic>, 
  <italic>Dodonaea viscosa</italic>, 
  <italic>Hubertia ambavilla</italic>, 
  <italic>Hypericum lanceolatum</italic>, 
  <italic>Pelargonium x graveolens</italic>, 
  <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic> and 
  <italic>Syzygium cumini</italic>. Methods—Polyphenol content was assessed by biochemical assay and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by measuring DPPH reduction and studying the protective effects of herbal preparation on red blood cells or preadipocytes exposed to oxidative stress. Results—Polyphenol content ranged from 25 to 143 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L for infusions and 35 to 205 mg GAE/L for decoctions. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis showed the presence of major bioactive polyphenols, such as quercetin, chlorogenic acid, procyanidin and mangiferin. Antioxidant capacity assessed by different tests, including DPPH and Human red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis of herbal preparations, demonstrated a dose-dependent effect whatever the extraction procedure. Our data suggest that decoction slightly improved polyphenol extraction as well as antioxidant capacity relative to the infusion mode of extraction (DPPH test). However, infusions displayed a better protective effect against oxidative stress-induced RBC hemolysis. Conclusion—Traditional preparations of medicinal plant aqueous extracts (infusions and decoctions) display antioxidant properties that limit oxidative stress in preadipocytes and red blood cells, supporting their use in the context of metabolic disease prevention and treatment.
