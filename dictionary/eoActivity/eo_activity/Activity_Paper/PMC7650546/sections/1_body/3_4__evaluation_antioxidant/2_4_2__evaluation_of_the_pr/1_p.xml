<p>The capacity of the plant polyphenol-rich extracts (PRE), infusions and decoctions to inhibit free radical-induced hemolysis was measured as described [
 <xref rid="B26-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Red blood cells were obtained from five healthy subjects (O + group) at the “French Blood Agency”. Cells were suspended in NaCl (0.15 M) at pH 7; different concentrations of PRE (1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 µM GAE) were added and hemolysis was triggered by addition of AAPH (50 mM). Red blood cell hemolysis was followed at 450 nm for 18.5 h at 37 °C using a FLUOstar Optima spectrophotometer (Bmg Labtech). Half time hemolysis (HT50) was determined with the x-axis value corresponding to ((OD t
 <sub>0</sub> + OD endpoint)/2) value of ordinate axis.
