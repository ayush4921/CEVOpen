<p>Evaluation of the different sample radical scavenging activity on DPPH was performed according to the method described by Yang et al. with slight modifications [
 <xref rid="B30-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, 0.25 mM of DPPH (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) was diluted in methanol and added to a 96-well microplate containing plant PRE, infusion or decoction samples. An antioxidant standard of 100 µM vitamin C (Sigma-Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) was used as a positive control. After 25 min of incubation at 25°C, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm (Fluostar Omega, Bmg Labtech, Cambridge, UK). The percentage of free radical scavenging activity was determined based on the optical density (OD) measured at 517 nm with a spectrophotometer, according to the following formula: 
 <disp-formula>Antioxidant capacity (%) = [(OD negative control − OD sample)/(OD negative control)] × 100</disp-formula>
