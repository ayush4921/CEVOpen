<p>The results illustrate a dose-dependent antioxidant activity. This antioxidant effect is the result of the radical scavenging by polyphenol reducing extremities (hydroxyl groups). As described by Villaño et al., polyphenols can exert antioxidant activity by direct abstraction of phenol H-atom with the nitrogen of the DPPH or by undergoing an electron transfer to the free radical. The number of -OH groups available is also an important factor that impacts the antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B46-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Infusions and decoctions demonstrated higher antioxidant activity than observed for vitamin C (100 µM, used as positive control). Interestingly, at a final concentration of 25 µM GAE, 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> infusions, decoctions and PRE exerted the best free radical-scavenging activity reaching, respectively, 60.5 ± 4.1%, 55 ± 2.7% and 58.3 ± 0.2% (

Overall, the antioxidant capacity of the different medicinal plant infusions and decoctions, respectively, vary from 27.22 to 60.5% and from 28.5 to 55%, for a final concentration of GAE fixed at 25 µM. Our results underline that the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> and 
 <italic>P. mauritianum</italic> infusions are close to that observed for tropical fruits cultivated in Reunion Island that exerted radical-scavenging activities showed to reduce by 45 to 58% DPPH oxidation [

 <italic>A. theiformis</italic> and 
 <italic>H. lanceolatum</italic> at 10 µM GAE and for 
 <italic>P. x graveolens</italic> and 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> at 50 µM GAE (
