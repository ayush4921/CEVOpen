<p>Oxidative stress induces biomolecule damage and alters redox intracellular signaling. Several studies highlighted the protective effects of polyphenols against oxidative stress. On the one hand, protective effects of the polyphenols rely on their ability to improve cellular antioxidant response by promoting the Nrf2 pathway or by stimulating antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase or superoxide dismutase (SOD) [
