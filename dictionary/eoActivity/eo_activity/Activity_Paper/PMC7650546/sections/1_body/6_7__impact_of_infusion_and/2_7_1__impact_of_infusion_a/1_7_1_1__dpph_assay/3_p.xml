 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-09-00959-f003">Figure 3</xref>, results are presented after normalization to the initial 1g/L concentration of dry plant powder diluted in water for infusion and decoction, reflecting the herbal tea that a customer would ingest. Significant differences between antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>H. ambavilla</italic>, 
 <italic>A. triplinervis</italic>, 
 <italic>D. viscosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. x graveolens</italic> infusions vs. decoctions were observed when evaluated without normalization to polyphenol levels. This result can be linked to the differences of final polyphenol concentrations between infusions and decoctions. Other plant herbal extracts reached their maximal radical-scavenging activity.
