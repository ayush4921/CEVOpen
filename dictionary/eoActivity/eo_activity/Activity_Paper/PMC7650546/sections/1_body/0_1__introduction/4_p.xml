<p>Oxidative stress is the consequence of an imbalance between the production of free radicals and antioxidant defense [
 <xref rid="B2-antioxidants-09-00959" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. An excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as 
 <sup>•</sup>OH or O
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•</sup>
 <sup>−</sup>) can induce major damage on the main cell constituents including lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and nucleic acids. Oxidative stress is known to be a trigger for several signaling pathways, leading to chronic, low-grade inflammation (production of cytokines, activation of different cell types by increasing the expression of adhesion molecules for leukocytes, etc.) and thus participating in the etiology of several human diseases such as diabetes mellitus and obesity [

In the context of metabolic diseases, oxidative stress and inflammation are the first signs of cellular dysfunction prior to the onset of symptoms. For example, in case of intestinal dysbiosis and unbalanced diet, preadipocytes and adipocytes are subjected to a high metabolic activity. In fact, the excess of energy provided by the diet leads to an increased stimulation of the energetic metabolism (mitochondrial activity and respiratory chain) causing overwhelming production of free radicals resulting in a marked oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can impair preadipocyte differentiation and promotes insulin resistance [
