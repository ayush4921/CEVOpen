  <p>Total polyphenol content of the 8 medicinal plants depending on the preparation mode. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Medicinal plant polyphenol-rich extracts (PRE); (
   <bold>B</bold>) Infusions and decoctions. Polyphenol content was determined by Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric assay and expressed as g gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g plant. Infusions and decoctions were obtained with a ratio of 1 g plant/L of water, therefore g GAE/g plant = g GAE/L. Data shown are means ± SEM of three independent experiments. ***
