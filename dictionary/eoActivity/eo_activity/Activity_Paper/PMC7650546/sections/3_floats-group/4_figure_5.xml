  <p>Impact of medicinal plant preparations on 3T3-L1 preadipocytes necrosis. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were incubated for 24h with polyphenol-rich extracts (PRE) (
   <bold>A</bold>), infusions (
   <bold>B</bold>) and decoctions (
   <bold>C</bold>). LDH release (%) was measured in the supernatant. Triton X100 (1%) was used to induce cell necrosis (considered as 100% necrosis). Absorbance was read at 450 nm. The data shown are means Â± SEM of three independent experiments *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005 as compared to control. LDH: lactate dehydrogenase (an intracellular enzyme whose release into the extracellular medium reflects cell necrosis).
