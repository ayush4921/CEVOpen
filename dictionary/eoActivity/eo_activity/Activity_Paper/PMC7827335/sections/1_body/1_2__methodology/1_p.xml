<p>Information of the ethnobotanical use of plants from genus 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> was retrieved from electronic databases which were ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and PubMed, using search terms of “
 <italic>Parkia</italic> AND ethnobotanical”, 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> AND pharmacological”, “
 <italic>Parkia</italic> AND pharmaceutical”, “
 <italic>Parkia</italic> AND toxicological studies”, “
 <italic>Parkia</italic> AND bioactivity”, “
 <italic>Parkia</italic> AND phytochemistry”, “
 <italic>Parkia</italic> AND ethnomedicinal”, and “
 <italic>Parkia</italic> AND morphological”. A total of 543 abstracts of research articles books, and conference papers published from 1961 to 2020 were obtained. Duplicates (
 <italic>n</italic> = 231) were removed. From the remaining 312 records, one hundred and two titles were excluded due to unavailability of full text or not published in English. Only articles and abstracts published in English were included. Two hundred and ten research articles and book chapters containing relevant and useful information were included in this review (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-22-00618-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Information gathered on the traditional uses, pharmacology and bioactive compounds identified from 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> genus were summarized in the form of two tables and four figures. Chemical structures of bioactive compounds reported were drawn using ChemDraw software 16.0 (PerkinElmer Informatics, Waltham, MA, USA).
