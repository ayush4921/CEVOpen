<p>The antidiarrheal effect of 
 <italic>Parkia</italic> plants has been investigated using many models such as castor oil- and magnesium-induced diarrhea. The aqueous extract of 
 <italic>P. filicoidea</italic> stem barks reduces the frequency of stooling in rats with castor oil-induced diarrhea, comparable with loperamide [

 <italic>P. biglobosa</italic> leaves and stem barks also exhibit similar antidiarrheal activity to loperamide, seen as a reduction in stooling frequency and intestinal volume [

 <xref rid="B193-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. These effects could be attributable to its inhibitory capacity on the propulsive movement of gastrointestinal tract smooth muscles [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Medicinal plants are believed to exert antidiarrheal activity by enhancing the opening of intestinal potassium channel and stimulating Na

 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity, as well as decreasing intracellular calcium concentration, which then promotes gastrointestinal smooth muscle relaxation, leading to diminished diarrhea [

 <xref rid="B195-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>,
 <xref rid="B196-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>]. The potential of these plants as agents to reduce diarrhea can be explored further in irritable bowel syndrome or chemotherapy-induced diarrhea. Their effects on intestinal mucosal barrier, tight junction proteins and inflammatory cytokines among others can be examined.
