 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> empty pod extract has been reported to prevent the development of hypertension in rats given L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, possibly due to its ability to prevent nitric oxide loss [
 <xref rid="B122-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>], which is dependent on the availability of endothelial nitric oxide synthase [
 <xref rid="B188-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>], as well as to inhibit ACE and oxidative stress and inflammation [
 <xref rid="B112-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Both oxidative stress and inflammation are known to play important roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension (Siti et al. 2015). Active peptide obtained from hydrolyzed 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> seeds displays ACE-inhibitory effect, ranging from 50.6% to 80.2%, which effect is not observed in the non-hydrolyzed seeds, possibly due its long and bulky structure [
 <xref rid="B189-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>,
 <xref rid="B190-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. However, the study of Khalid and Babji (2018) has demonstrated that the aqueous extract of the seeds also possesses ACE inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="B191-ijms-22-00618" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>]. These studies suggest that the blood pressure-lowering effect of the 
 <italic>P. speciosa</italic> is most likely due to its ACE inhibitory property and nitric oxide regulation, attributable to its rich contents of polyphenols and the presence of peptide. Future studies should involve isolation of the active compounds which have a potential to be developed as a specific inhibitor of ACE. Other possible mechanisms—specific receptor antagonism, such as adrenoceptors and calcium channels, or modification of signaling pathways—of blood pressure-lowering effects of the plant extract or compounds should be explored further.
