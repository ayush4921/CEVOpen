 </italic> proteins were expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ABLE C cells, grown at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 50 mg/l kanamycin and 100 mg/l ampicillin. The protein expression was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-thio-β-D-galactoside (IPTG) at an absorbance value of 0.5–0.6 A
 <sub>600</sub> nm. After overnight growth, cells were collected and resuspended 1:3 (w/v) in purification buffer (50 mM phosphate, 300 mM NaCl; pH 8.0) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and stored overnight at −20 °C. Subsequently, the biomass was treated in ice with lysozyme and DNAse for 60 min and then sonicated as described (Perugino et al., 2012). After centrifugation of 30 min at 60,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, the cell extract was recovered and applied to a Protino Ni–NTA Column 1 ml (Macherey–Nagel) for His
 <sub>6</sub>-tag affinity chromatography. The eluted fractions containing the protein were collected and dialysed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS 1×, 20 mM phosphate buffer, NaCl 150 mM, pH 7.3). Pooled fractions were concentrated and protein purification was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Aliquots were finally stored at −20 °C.
