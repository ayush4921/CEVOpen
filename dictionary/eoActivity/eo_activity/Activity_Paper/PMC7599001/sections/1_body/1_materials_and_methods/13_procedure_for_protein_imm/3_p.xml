<p>During the afore-described procedure, proteins were labelled with 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold>. Finally, the immobilisation step for each sample via Huisgen reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 80 min, followed by a Washing step (20 min), in order to remove all the unbound molecules. This procedure was the same in the presence of the 
 <italic>Ec</italic>CFE. All measurements were performed in triplicates.
