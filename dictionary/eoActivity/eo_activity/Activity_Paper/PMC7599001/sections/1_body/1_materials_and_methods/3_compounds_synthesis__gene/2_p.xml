 <sup>1</sup>H (400 MHz) and 
 <sup>13</sup>C (100 MHz) NMR spectra were measured on Bruker Advance Neo 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual solvent signal (CDCl

 <sub>C</sub> = 39.5). Low-resolution ESI-MS were obtained on an LTQ OrbitrapXL (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer. IR spectra were registered on Shimadzu DR 8001 spectrophotometer. Silica gel 60 (70–230 mesh) used for gravity column chromatography (CC) was purchased from Macherey–Nagel. Reactions were monitored by TLC on Merck 60 F254 (0.25 mm) plates, visualised by staining with 5% H
