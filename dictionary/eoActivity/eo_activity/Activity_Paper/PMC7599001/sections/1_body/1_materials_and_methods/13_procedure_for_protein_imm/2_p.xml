Samples and reaction buffers were located in black 96-well plates (OptiPlate-96 Black, Black Opaque 96-well Microplate, PerkinElmer, Billerica, MA) in a maximum reaction volume of 300 µl per well with 800 rpm shaking for each step. For the immobilisation procedure, AR2G sensors were first wetted in 200 µl of pure water for at least 15 min, followed by an equilibration step (3 min) in acetate buffer 0.1 M, pH 5.0. Afterwards, they were activated with 20 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-amino-propyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/20 mM N-hydroxy-sulfo-succinimide (sulfo-NHS) mixture in acetate buffer (60 min) and covered with 2 mM

  <sub>3</sub>-amine
 </bold> bifunctional linker (BroadPharm, San Diego, CA) in Loading step (20 min). To avoid the presence of any free amine groups on the biosensors, a Blocking step with Ethanolamine 1 M (30 min) was performed. Subsequently, a Washing step (15 min) with water and an Equilibration step in click-reaction buffer (15 min) are followed.
