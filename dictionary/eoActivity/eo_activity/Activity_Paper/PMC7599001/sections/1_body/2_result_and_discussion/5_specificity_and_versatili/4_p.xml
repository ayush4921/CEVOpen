<p>Concerning the specificity, we added a crude protein extract from 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ABLE C (
 <italic>Ec</italic>CFE), without any AGT activity at the 
 <italic>gel-imaging</italic> analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>, lane 5). In this context, the only presence of the free 
 <italic>protein-tag</italic> and the DBCO-fluorophore also did not result in any fluorescent signal (lanes 6), whereas the previously purified 
 <italic>clickable</italic>-SNAP (lane 7), as well as its free form in the presence of 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> (lane 8), was specifically able to complete the chemo-enzymatic reaction, giving an evident fluorescent signal. The high specificity of our approach was also confirmed by using the 
 <italic>H
  <sup>5</sup>
 </italic> enzyme, which displays a better labelling reaction than the mesophilic SNAP-
 <italic>tag</italic>

 <italic>tag</italic>
 <sup>®</sup> activity. These results clearly demonstrated the high efficiency of our 
 <italic>chemo-enzymatic approach</italic> for the labelling of both the 
 <italic>protein-tags</italic> used.
