<p>On the contrary, using 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> as substrate, the labelling of both the enzymes was comparable to the classical reaction with 
 <bold>SVG</bold> without any denaturing agent, likely the longer spacer of 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold> could sufficiently move away from the azide group from the protein surface for the Huisgen reaction (

From now on, experiments were only performed by using the longer BG-azide. We first calculated the rate of the enzymatic reaction, demonstrating that both
