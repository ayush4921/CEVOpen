<p>Upon the reaction with 
 <bold>BGSN3</bold>, all cycloaddition reactions with three different DBCO-based fluorophores were complete in ca. 30–45 min in PBS 1× buffer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>, lanes 2–4), with a protein-labelling as efficient as the enzymatic reaction using the sole 
 <bold>SVG</bold> (lane 1). We quantitatively evaluated the rate (
 <italic>k</italic>) of the click reaction by using the 
 <bold>DBCO-PEG4-Fluor 545</bold> fluorophore: as expected, both the 
 <italic>clickable-tags</italic> were labelled with the same efficiency (1.83 ± 0.41 × 10
