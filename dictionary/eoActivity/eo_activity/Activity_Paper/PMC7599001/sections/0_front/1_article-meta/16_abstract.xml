  <sup>®</sup> is a powerful technology for the labelling of protein/enzymes by using benzyl-guanine (BG) derivatives as substrates. Although commercially available or ad hoc produced, their synthesis and purification are necessary, increasing time and costs. To address this limitation, here we suggest a revision of this methodology, by performing a 
  <italic>chemo-enzymatic approach</italic>, by using a BG-substrate containing an azide group appropriately distanced by a spacer from the benzyl ring. The SNAP-
  <italic>tag</italic>
  <sup>®</sup> and its relative thermostable version (
  <italic>Ss</italic>OGT-
  <italic>H
   <sup>5</sup>
  </italic>) proved to be very active on this substrate. The stability of these 
  <italic>tags</italic> upon enzymatic reaction makes possible the exposition to the solvent of the azide-moiety linked to the catalytic cysteine, compatible for the subsequent conjugation with DBCO-derivatives by azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. Our studies propose a strengthening and an improvement in terms of biotechnological applications for this self-labelling 
  <italic>protein-tag</italic>.
