<p>Since 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> was shown to be an HCV entry inhibitor, we investigated the relevant mechanisms for HCV entry inhibition and found that 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> inhibits HCV envelope proteins (data not shown). Accordingly, the HCV envelope glycoproteins were selected as a target protein for docking studies and we performed a molecular docking analysis on the crystal structures of the HCV E2 glycoprotein

 </xref> to predict whether 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> would interact with E1/E2 viral glycoproteins. Out of the four potential binding sites of the E2 monomer, 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> fit snugly into the binding site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A)</xref>). This site is located in the loop region and is also a surface on the β sandwich of the E2 glycoprotein (

 </xref>. The interactions of 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> with the residues of the E2 monomer indicated strong binding of 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> within the E2 monomer. There were four hydrogen (H) bonds: 1) two H bonds formed with both nitrogens in the urea group and Val515; 2) one bond was made between the oxygen of the urea group and His421; and 3) another H bond formed with the nitrogen in piperidine and Thr425. The trifluoro group was docked around the threonines and valines in the β5 region of the β sandwich. The van der Waals interactions of the trimethyl group were observed with Thr510, Asn548, and Trp549 of the β sandwich (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(C)</xref>). The docking energy was −4.437 kcal/mol, which was the lowest among all docked poses. The docking score (GlideScore) was −4.437 kcal/mol, which was the lowest among all docked poses. The minimisation energy difference between the unbound protein structure (−28224.178 kJ/mol) and the 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> docked structure (−28598.234) was −374.056 kJ/mol.
