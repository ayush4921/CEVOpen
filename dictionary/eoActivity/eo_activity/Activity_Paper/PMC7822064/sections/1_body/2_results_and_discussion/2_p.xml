<p>Thiophen urea derivatives were synthesised in three steps as follows: a reaction of 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate, urea synthesis by amine substitution, and final deprotection (

In each step all products were easily obtained as a pure solid by a simple work-up method (precipitation or filtration) without further purification. Two starting materials that have a thiophen ring with various substituents were utilised to achieve structural diversity. Several compounds including 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold>, 
 <bold>HCV-2602</bold>, and 
 <bold>HCV-2694</bold> were prepared as an acid salt to enhance aqueous solubility using an additional method. For example, J2H-1701 was prepared as a HCl salt by treatment of HCl solution in 1,4-dioxane. Almost all the test compounds showed good chemical stability and crystallinity. 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold>, a representative compound as a HCl salt, has a long-term stability (purity &gt;98% for 3 months) at room temperature, and so do the other compounds. This stability is supposed to come from its crystallinity that would be intrinsic property of thiophen urea structure, based on their high melting point and differential scanning calorimetry data (data not shown). When the drug-like properties of TU derivatives were assessed by Lipinski’s rule of five

 </xref>, most of the compounds were shown to be applicable for orally available drugs; for example, J2H-1701, it has 3 hydrogen bond donors, 6 hydrogen bond acceptors, logP (experimental) of 4.21, and molecular weight of 515.62 and the number of violation is 1. Therefore, J2H-1701 is considered as an orally available drug.
