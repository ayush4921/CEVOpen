 </xref>. Of the two enveloped glycoprotein E2 chains that are involved, chain D was selected for docking as its secondary structure was well-defined compared to chain C. The residues of T542RPPLG547 were not missing from this chain. The selected D chain of glycoprotein E2 was prepared for docking using the Protein Preparation tool. Molecular docking was carried out with Glide

 </xref>. All possible binding pockets were analysed according to the binding cavities of the protein as well as the biologically meaningful regions. Four grids were generated for each assigned binding site, and the prepared three-dimensional ligand conformation of 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> was docked at each site. The best docked pose was determined based on the highest docking score and also any favourable interactions with the targeted residues. The selected docked complex was energy minimised with MacroModel using OPLS_2005 force field in a water environment (until converging at a termination gradient of 0.0001 kJ/mol Å) referring to the report by Di Maio et al.
