<p>To evaluate cross-genotypic antiviral activity against various HCV genotypes, 
 <bold>J2H-1701</bold> were tested using chimeric HCVcc as described above. HCV chimaeras expressing the structural proteins of HCV genotypes 1a (H77), 1 b (J4), 2a (E2P7), 2 b (J8), 3a (S52), 4a (ED43), 5a (SA13), 6a (HK6a), or 7a (QC69), followed by HCV genotype 2a (JFH-1)-derived non-structural proteins responsible for viral RNA replication and the Renilla luciferase reporter gene were used to monitor viral replication.
