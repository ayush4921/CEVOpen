  <italic>Litsea molis</italic> Hemsl. is a precious wild aromatic oil tree species and important medicinal plant. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the chloroplast genome of 
  <italic>L. molis</italic> for the first time. Its complete chloroplast genome is 152,311 bp in length, containing a large single copy region of 93,258 bp and a small single copy region of 18,917 bp separated by a pair of inverted repeat regions of 20,068 bp. The chloroplast genome contains 130 unique genes, including 85 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA and 8 rRNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on chloroplast genome sequences of 36 plants from the family Lauraceae showed that 
  <italic>L. molis</italic> is more closely related to species of 
  <italic>Lindera</italic> genus than other genera in Lauraceae.
