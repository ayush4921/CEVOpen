<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, the pH of SPE and SPW yogurt decreased significantly during fermentation (p&lt;0.05). In contrast, the TA level in SPE and SPW yogurt was significantly increased during fermentation as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> (p&lt;0.05). The pH and TA of all yogurt samples were similar during the initial and final stages of fermentation. These results are consistent with those of previous studies, that is, the pH decreased but the TA level increased due to acid production in red ginseng extract- and ginseng extract-supplemented yogurt (
