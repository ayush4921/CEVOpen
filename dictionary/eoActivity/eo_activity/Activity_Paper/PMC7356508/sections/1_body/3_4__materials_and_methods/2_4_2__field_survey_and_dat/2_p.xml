<p>For the choice of the typology and number of informants we have followed the “purposive sampling” approach according to Tongco [
 <xref rid="B79-plants-09-00759" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], a nonrandom method, where the informants are selected by virtue of knowledge and experience. In our case, such key informants are the persons recognized by the community as depository of traditional knowledge about medicinal plants. This approach allows to collect a high amount of reliable data with a low number of interviews.
