<p>This area is about 100 km far from Kathmandu and its villages are mainly occupied by the Tamang community. Although this rural area is not too far from the city centers, people living here are very deprived of basic infrastructures and facilities. Many people are illiterate and therefore the major portion of population is involved in agriculture, which is mostly subsistence farming. Some people are engaged in tourism industry as porters and guides, like drivers or other occupation. Since educational facilities for children are lacking and parents often consider education a trivial factor in life, children are not encouraged to get an education.</p>
