 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp., family 
 <italic>Combretaceae</italic>, is distributed worldwide, with around 250 species, especially in South Asia, Australia, and South Africa. Among them, more than 50 species are used as food (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2015</xref>). A list of some of the important plant species under 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> genus with medicinal potential is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">
  <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>
 </xref>, and a few of the species are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">
  <bold>Figure 1</bold>
 </xref>. These are some of the most widely used medicinal plants in the global ethnopharmacology such as traditional Chinese, Tibetan, and Indian Ayurvedic medicine system. For instance, fruits of 
 <italic>Terminalia ferdinandiana</italic> Exell, are rich in (1) vitamin C and thereby being consumed as food in Australia (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Konczak et al., 2014</xref>). Several 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> species exhibit nutraceutical value with numerous health benefits, including the treatment of some diseases (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Cock, 2015</xref>). For example, fruits of 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. and 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. usually form Triphala, the well-known polyherbal formulation in Ayurvedic and Thai folk medicine, due to its pharmacological applications as a laxative, detoxifying, and rejuvenating effects (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Intharuksa et al., 2016</xref>). Phytochemical studies in 39 species led to the identification of 368 compounds, including terpenoids, tannins, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, simple phenolics, among others (
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Some of these compounds demonstrated different bioactivities that were explored through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> or 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. Of note, among these properties, antidiabetic and antiobesity, anticancer, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, antimalarial, antioxidant, antitumor have been reported in several plant species. It has been documented that 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. is traditionally used for cardioprotective and hepatoprotective purposes in India and Sri Lanka (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Kapoor et al., 2014</xref>); 
 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb., is widely used on treating diarrhea (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">Pandey et al., 2017</xref>); 
 <italic>Terminalia brownii</italic> Fresen., has been used to treat brown-erythematous excoriated papules and plaques (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Kibar Ozturk et al., 2018</xref>); 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. is widely used to treat dementia, constipation, and diabetes in traditional Indian and Iranian medicine (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Jokar et al., 2016</xref>), etc. Therefore, the active compounds existing in 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. have great potential applications in various diseases. This review presents the much-needed update on the folk medicinal uses, phytochemistry, chemical composition, and pharmacological applications of numerous plants of genus 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic>, along with information on the pre-clinical and clinical trials of their compounds. We aim to improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the medical use of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp., stimulating the use of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. in modern drug discovery.
