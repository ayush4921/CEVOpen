 <italic>T. bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. dried fruits were used to obtain direct and sequential dichloromethane, methanol, and water extracts, and to evaluate their antibacterial activity against 16 strains of methicillin-resistant

The minimum inhibitory concentration values showed that all aqueous and methanol extracts have antibacterial activity with values ranging from 0.25 to 4 mg/mL against all strains tested, which indicates that further studies are needed to test the antimicrobial potential of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts before designing broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs based of
