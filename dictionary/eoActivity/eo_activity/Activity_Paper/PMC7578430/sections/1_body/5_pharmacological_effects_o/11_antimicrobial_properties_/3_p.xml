 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> Exell has also been studied for their potential antibacterial properties to evaluate their inhibitory capacity against odor-forming bacteria like 
 <italic>Corynebacterium jeikeium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, and 
 <italic>Brevibacterium linens</italic> (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Mcmanus et al., 2017</xref>). Methanolic extracts from leaves of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> Exell showed the lowest minimum inhibitory capacity values against 
 <italic>C. jeikeium</italic> (233 µg/mL), 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> (220 µg/mL), 
 <italic>P. acnes</italic> (625 µg/mL), and B linens (523 µg/mL). Moreover, 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Mcmanus et al. (2017)</xref> determined that leaf extracts of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> Exell were non-toxic by the 
 <italic>Artemia franciscana</italic> bioassay, interestingly; chloroform and hexane fruit and leaves extracts showed no toxicity activity. LC-MS analysis showed that methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> Exell contained some tannins and other compounds, the most abundant were (117) ellagic acid dihydrate, (76) chebulic acid, (4) ellagic acid, (44) castalagin, (5) corilagin, (91) punicalin, (48) luteolin, (9) chebulinic acid, (119) exifone, (53) chebulagic acid, and (120) trimethyl ellagic acid (
