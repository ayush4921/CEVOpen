 <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> Retz. fruit extracts were tested for their antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties on acetic acid-induced colitis in inbred Charles-Foster strain albino rats and mice by 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Gautam et al. (2013)</xref>. This report states that 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts reversed the decreased levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase caused by acetic acid-induced colitis, 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. treatment also decreased the levels of lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide to normal levels, from 11 to 6.22, and 10 to 4.25 nmol/mg protein, respectively. A preliminary phytochemical screening test showed that the main constituents in 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz. extracts are tannins, phenolic compounds, and triterpenoids; however, further characterization is needed (
