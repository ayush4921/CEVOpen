 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Dawe et al. (2017)</xref>, identified and isolated 11 triterpenes from ethyl acetate extracts of the root bark of 
 <italic>Terminalia glaucescens</italic> Planch. ex Benth.; the compounds were identified as (99) termiglaucescin; (100) β-D-glucopyranosyl 2α, 3β, 6β-trihydroxy-23-gallylean-12-en-28-oate; (101) arjunglucoside I; (102) sericoside; (103) arjungenin; (104) sericic acid; (105) arjunetin; (106) chebuloside II; (107) 3,3’4-tri-O-methylelagic acid; (108) 3,3’-di-O-methylelagic acid; (37) β-sitosterol; and (10) stigmasterol. Moreover, these compounds also showed anti-inflammatory activity by inhibition of albumin denaturation and hemolysis (

 <italic>Terminalia muelleri</italic> Benth. polyphenol-rich extracts were determined by 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Fahmy et al. (2017)</xref>, using carrageenan-induced paw edema model in mice by measuring the thickness of the injected paws after treatment with 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extract at a concentration of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Pretreatment with 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts exhibited a dose-dependent significant anti-inflammatory activity showed in the reduction in the carrageenan-induced paw edema by 48, 53, and 62% at 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, pretreatment with 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. extracts also decreased in a dose-dependent manner, the pro-inflammatory cytokines PGE2, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6. The authors suggested that this effect might be attributed to the presence of (109) luteolin-6-C-glucoside, (110) vitexin, (4) ellagic acid, and (9) chebulinic acid in the extracts (
