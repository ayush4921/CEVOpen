<p>In a study, 
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">Yeh et al. (2014)</xref> have demonstrated that the 
 <italic>Terminalia catappa</italic> L. leaf extract exhibited an inhibitory effect on several vital steps of metastasis, that includes invasion and migration of cell, by regulating the actions and protein level of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its natural inhibitor. They also showed that the plant extract could be able to effectively inhibit the phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathways by the downregulation of the transcription factors SP-1 and NF-κB DNA binding activities, that leads to the suppression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and inhibition of metastasis (

 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">Pinheiro Silva et al. (2015)</xref>, showed that the aqueous fraction from the leaves of 
 <italic>Terminalia catappa</italic> L. possesses anti 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> activity and excellent preventive and curative activity on the acute and chronically induced gastric ulcers. The detailed mechanism of action associated in the gastro-protection are connected to the nitric oxide pathway, an increase in the mucus level and the endogenous prostaglandins, and this fraction was able to cure the ulcers through the inhibition of the matrix metallo proteinase activities (MMP-2 and MMP-9) (
