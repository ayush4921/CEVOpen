 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb., has been used for long times in the traditional system of medicine for the treatment and prevention of ailments that worry the aging population, and its preclinical studies have confirmed most of its ethnomedicinal claims which are mediated by the myriad biochemical mechanisms (

 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">Saleem et al. (2002)</xref> have investigated the cytotoxicity potential of fruit extracts of 
 <italic>T. chebula</italic> Retz., which according to him can decrease the number of cells in immortalized and cancer cell lines by preventing the proliferation rate of the cell and by inducing the cell death. His group stated that at lower concentration, the extract was able to induce the cellular pathways that resulted in the apoptosis process, whereas at the higher concentrations, the extract showed direct toxic effects, resulting in the rapid necrotic cell death (

 <italic>Terminalia muelleri</italic> Benth. was reported to show inhibitory potential against the

 <italic>T. paniculata</italic> Roth extracts have been reported to alter the levels of biomarkers of hepatotoxicity

 <italic>T. paniculata</italic> Roth have been reported to exhibit antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities by altering the levels of biomarkers of hepatotoxicity under
