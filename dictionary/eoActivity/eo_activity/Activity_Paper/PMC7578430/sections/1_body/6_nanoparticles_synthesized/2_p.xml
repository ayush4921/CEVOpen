 <italic>Terminalia bellirica</italic> (Gaertn.) Roxb. fruit pericarp, exhibited anticancer activity. Nanoparticles at 120 μg/mL have been reported to kill 69.1% of colon cancer cells and 65.2% breast cancer cells. Interestingly, AgNPs did not cause cytotoxic effects against normal cardiac and skeletal muscle cells (
