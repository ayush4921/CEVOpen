<p>Three studies evaluated the effect of

 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Maulik et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Priya et al., 2019</xref>). The report of 
 <xref rid="B162" ref-type="bibr">Priya et al. (2019)</xref>, found that systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased after 1 month of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. therapy, which consisted of the oral administration of 3 g of a mixture of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. mixed in 250 mL of boiled milk twice daily. The bioactive effect was attributed to the presence of adrenergic β2 receptor agonistic action. This may be partially related to the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn., possibly related to the protection of myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury. 
 <italic>Terminalia arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. treatment also decreased total cholesterol levels (235.02 to 210.80 mg/dL) and serum LDL levels (134.40 to 121.5 mg/dL). The second study was conducted as a double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo-controlled add-on clinical trial by 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">Maulik et al. (2016)</xref> to assess the safety of a standardized water extract of stem bark of 
 <italic>T. arjuna</italic> (Roxb. ex DC.) Wight &amp; Arn. in chronic heart failure patients.
