 <italic>Terminalia sericea</italic> Burch. ex DC. is a medicinal plant used mainly to treat diarrhea, sexually transmitted infections, skin rashes, tuberculosis, and other infections. Its biological activities are due to valuable phytochemicals, including triterpenes, alkaloids, and flavonoids (
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">Mongalo et al., 2016</xref>). Tannins and polyphenols are two major active components of the plant, which contribute to the bioactivity of 
 <italic>Terminalia</italic> sp. (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Tannins are a kind of polyphenolic compounds that can be classified into three groups based on their structures: hydrolyzable, condensed, and complex tannins (

 <italic>Terminalia catappa</italic> L. that has antiHIV features was analyzed for phytochemicals by direct binding assay with mass spectrometry (MS) techniques (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Dwevedi et al., 2016</xref>). These authors described the presence of tannins, gallotannins, ellagitannins, cyanidin, and flavonoids. More recently, chemical analysis of 
 <italic>Terminalia catappa L.</italic> bark, and leaves performed by Tercas et al. (
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">Terças et al., 2017</xref>), reported hydrolyzable tannins (6) punicallin, (7) punicalagin, (3) gallic acid, and flavonoid C-glycosides. These authors have used techniques like gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with electron impact (GC/MS/EI), high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry “electrospray” ionization in positive mode (HPLC/MS/MS/ESI+) and hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (1HNMR). In addition, leaf extract fractions showed antifungal properties against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> sp.
