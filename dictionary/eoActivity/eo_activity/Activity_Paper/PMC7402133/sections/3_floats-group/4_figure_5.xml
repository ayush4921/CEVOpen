  <p>Effect of polyphenols on the production of inflammatory markers on cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition. The cells were exposed to normoglycemic condition (NG) or hyperglycemic condition (HG) in the presence or not of each polyphenol-rich plant extract (10 µM GAE) or standard polyphenol (10 μM). The expression of NFκB gene was measured by RT-qPCR and normalized to GAPDH gene expression (
   <bold>A</bold>). The secretion of IL-6 was measured by ELISA kit (
   <bold>B</bold>). Data are means ± SEM of three independent experiments. *:
