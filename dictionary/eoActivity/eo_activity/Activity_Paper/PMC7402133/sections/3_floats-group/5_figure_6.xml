  <p>Evaluation of polyphenols on the production of vasoactive markers on cerebral endothelial cells in hyperglycemic condition. Cells were exposed to normoglycemic condition (NG) or hyperglycemic condition (HG) in the presence or not of each polyphenol-rich plant extract (10 µM GAE) or standard polyphenol (10 μM). The expression of genes coding for endothelin-1 (ET-1) (
   <bold>A</bold>) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (
   <bold>B</bold>) was measured by RT-qPCR and normalized to GAPDH gene expression. Intracellular nitric oxide (NO) levels were measured by 4-amino-5-methylamino-2’,7’-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM) assay (
   <bold>C</bold>). The statistical correlation between intracellular ROS and NO levels was established (
   <bold>D</bold>). Data are means ± SEM of three independent experiments. **: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and ***: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005 as compared to normoglycemic condition NG. ##: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and ###: 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005 as compared to HG.
