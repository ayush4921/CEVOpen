  <p>Effect of polyphenol related circulating metabolites on the viability and mitochondrial metabolic activity of cerebral endothelial cells. Cells were exposed to normoglycemic condition in presence or not of each compound (10 μM) for 24 h. The cellular viability was measured by counting cells through the Trypan blue exclusion method (
   <bold>A</bold>). The mitochondrial metabolic activity of cells was determined by the MTT assay (
   <bold>B</bold>). Data are means ± SEM of three independent experiments.
