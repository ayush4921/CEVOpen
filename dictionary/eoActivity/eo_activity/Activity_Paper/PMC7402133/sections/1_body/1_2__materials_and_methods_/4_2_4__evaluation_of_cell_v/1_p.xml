<p>The cells were seeded in a 24-well plate (7.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) during 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed and cells treated with each plant extract (10 µM GAE), or with a pure polyphenol (quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic, or gallic acids, 10 µM), or with a related circulating metabolite (ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxybenzoic, or hippuric acids, 10 µM, Sigma–Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) during 24 h. Each polyphenolic extract or pure compound was diluted in complete DMEM to maintain cells in the culture medium recommended by ATCC. Next, cell culture medium was eliminated, phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was used to wash cells once, and trypsin-EDTA (Pan Biotech, Dutscher, Brumath, France) was added to detach cells. After centrifugation (500× 
 <italic>g</italic>, 4 min., 25 °C), cell staining was performed with Trypan blue solution (Sigma–Aldrich, St-Louis, MO, USA) and cell counting achieved in a Malassez chamber.
