<p>Murine bEnd3-Blue cells expressing NFκB/SEAP reporter gene were cultured in a 96-well black plate (1.8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) in DMEM containing 5.5 mM of glucose (normoglycemic condition) for 24 h. The day after, the medium was removed and cells were treated for 3 h with a polyphenol related circulating metabolite (ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxybenzoic or hippuric acids, 10 µM) in hyperglycemic condition (33 mM glucose) or in normoglycemic condition (5.5 mM glucose). NFκB/SEAP activity was evaluated with Quanti-Blue assay (Invivogen, Toulouse, France) and absorbance was measured at 620–655 nm (FLUOstar Omega, Bmg Labtech, Cambridge, UK).
