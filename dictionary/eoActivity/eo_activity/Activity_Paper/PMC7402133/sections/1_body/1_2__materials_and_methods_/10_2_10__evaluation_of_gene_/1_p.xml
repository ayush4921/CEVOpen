<p>The cells were seeded in a six-well plate (3.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ well) in DMEM containing 5.5 mM of glucose (normoglycemic condition) during 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed and cells treated with each plant extract (10 µM GAE) or a pure polyphenol, namely caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid or quercetin (10 μM) in hyperglycemic condition (33 mM glucose), or in normoglycemic condition (5.5 mM glucose) for 6 h. Next, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol™ (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, Dardilly, France). Next, 4 µg of RNA were reverse-transcribed (RT) using Random hexamer primers (Eurogentec, Liège, Belgium) with Superscript
 <sup>TM</sup> II (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, Dardilly, France). The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was achieved by using fast SYBR green
 <sup>TM</sup> master Mix (Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher Scientific, Dardilly, France). The relative expression of genes coding for redox factors (catalase, Cu/ZnSOD, GPx, HO-1, MnSOD, Nox4, and Nrf2), the pro-inflammatory mediator NFκB and vasoactive markers (eNOS, ET-1) was normalized to the expression rate of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene.
