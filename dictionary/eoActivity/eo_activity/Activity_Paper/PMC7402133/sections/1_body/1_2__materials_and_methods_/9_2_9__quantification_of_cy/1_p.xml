<p>The cells were seeded in a six-well plate (3.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) in DMEM containing 5.5 mM glucose (normoglycemic condition) for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was removed and cells treated with each plant extract (10 µM GAE), or with a pure polyphenol (quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic or gallic acids, 10 µM), or with a related circulating metabolite (ferulic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionic, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic, 3-hydroxybenzoic or hippuric acids, 10 µM) in hyperglycemic condition (33 mM glucose), or in normoglycemic condition (5.5 mM glucose) for 8 h. Next, cell culture media were collected and analyzed using Mouse IL-6 ELISA kit (eBioscience, ThermoFisher Scientific, Dardilly, France). For cellular protein extraction, 700 μL of PBS were added to each well. After scrapping, cells were collected and centrifuged at 500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 4 min. at 25 °C. Supernatants were removed and 200 μL of lysis buffer were added (Tris 25mM pH 8.3, KCl 10 mM, DTT 1 mM, EDTA 1 mM, Triton X-100 1%, protease inhibitors 1 X). After resuspension of cell pellet in lysis buffer, a centrifugation at 500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 4 min. at 25 °C was performed and supernatants containing proteins were collected. Total cellular protein contents were determined by BCA assay and absolute values of IL-6 were normalized to these contents.
