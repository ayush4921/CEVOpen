<p>In order to determine the possible effect of polyphenols on the cellular viability, bEnd3 cerebral endothelial cells were exposed to each polyphenol-rich plant extract or standard caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, gallic acid, or quercetin. Cell counting data show that neither polyphenol-rich plant extracts nor standard polyphenols modulated the cellular viability (
