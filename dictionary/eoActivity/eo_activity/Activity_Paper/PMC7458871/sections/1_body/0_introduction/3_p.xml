<p>The Acute Cystitis Symptom Score (ACSS) questionnaire has proven to be useful for clinically diagnosing AC in women [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The ACSS is now available, translated, and validated in several languages (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The ACSS has now been used in a larger prospective phase III trial comparing the outcome of an antibacterial agent (a single oral dose of fosfomycin trometamol [FT]) with that of a herbal treatment (Canephron®N [BNO 1045]; 2 dragées three times daily for 7 days) in women with AC [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. BNO 1045 has been used for the treatment of AC for over 30 years. The preclinical

 <italic>in vivo</italic> data suggest that BNO 1045 has the potential for effective treatment of AC-related inflammation and pain [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The clinical efficacy of BNO 1045 has been proven in several studies [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], additional assessment of the ACSS as a patient-reported outcome measure can be performed and compared with results obtained by the earlier noninterventional studies [
