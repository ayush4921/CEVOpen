<p>The ACSS questionnaire used in this study consists of two parts that were used in this clinical trial: Part A on day 1 for baseline assessment and Part B for all subsequent visits on days 4, 8, and 38. Part A included 18 questions organized into typical symptoms (n=6) of lower uUTIs (ACSS-typical domain), symptoms (n=4) for differential diagnosis (ACSS-differential domain), questions (n=3) on quality of life (ACSS-QoL domain), and any additional conditions (n=5) that may affect therapy (ACSS-additional domain). These questions were all assessed on a 4-point Likert scale, where 0=no symptoms, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe symptoms, apart from the ACSS-additional domain, which used yes/no questions.</p>
