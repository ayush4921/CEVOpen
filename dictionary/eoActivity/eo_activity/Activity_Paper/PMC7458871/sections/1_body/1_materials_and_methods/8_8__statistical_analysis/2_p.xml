<p>The following different thresholds to define clinical cure were tested using the typical domain and the QoL domain of the ACSS, which were then compared with the dynamics domain of the ACSS (“very much better” plus “much better” and the overall assessments of the patients and the investigators (“very good” plus “good” , representing overall clinical success. Using the guidelines of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and draft guidelines from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], in which the four typical symptoms (FDA) of frequency, urgency, dysuria, and suprapubic pain or the three typical symptoms (EMA) of frequency, urgency, and dysuria were mentioned for inclusion criteria were also evaluated by the ACSS scoring system, the following eight thresholds defining “clinical cure” were analyzed: A) typical domain of ACSS ≤5; B) typical domain of ACSS ≤4; C) typical domain of ACSS ≤5, no item &gt;1; D) typical domain of ACSS ≤4, no item &gt;1; E) typical domain of ACSS ≤4, no item &gt;1, and no item of QoL &gt;1; F) typical domain of ACSS ≤4, no item &gt;1, and no item of QoL &gt;1; G) four symptoms (adapted FDA) ≤4, no item &gt;1; H) three symptoms (adapted EMA) ≤3, no item &gt;1.
