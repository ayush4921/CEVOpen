<p>To separate the different chemical components in active fraction no. 7, we next re-fractionated fraction no. 7 using silica gel column chromatography. Eight sub-fractions (no. 7.1–7.8) were obtained and their cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells was assessed using MTT assay (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00464">Figure S4</xref>). Sub-fraction no. 7.7 strongly reduced the viability of MDA-MB-231 cells compared to the other sub-fractions. Thus, we attempted to tentatively identify the bioactive compounds from sub-fraction no 7.7 using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. This sub-fraction was injected into an Agilent 1260 Infinity series HPLC system and the constituents were collected in a 96-well plate with 30 s per well until 33 min. In total, ten candidate compounds (C1–C10) were identified. All collected samples were screened for cytotoxicity using the MTT assay and the acquisition times represented active compounds between of 10.414 (C1), 12.286 (C2), 17.586 (C3), 20.198 (C4), 21.015 (C5), 22.476 (C6), 26.473 (C7), 30.557 (C8), 32.057 (C9), and 32.606 (C10) min (
