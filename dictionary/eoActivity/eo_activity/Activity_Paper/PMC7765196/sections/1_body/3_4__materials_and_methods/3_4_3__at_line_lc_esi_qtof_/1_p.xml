<p>The active subfraction of MOL extract (20 mg/mL) was prepared and injected into an Agilent 1260 Infinity Series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies Inc., Waldbronn, Germany) coupled to an Agilent 6540 QTOF-MS spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Singapore) with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. For HPLC separation, a mobile phase of 0.1% formic acid in water (

 <italic>v</italic>) (B) was used with gradient elution from 20% B to 90% B in 30 min, hold on 3 min and post-run for 5 min. The sample separation was performed on a Luna C18 (2) 100°A, 4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm column (serial no. 728946-40; Phenomenex, CA, USA) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, with the column temperature set at 35 °C. The eluent was split into two flows using a 9:1 ratio. The major part was collected in a 96-well plate with 30 s per well, while the minor part flowed to an ESI-QTOF-MS system. The operating parameters for MS detection were as follows: drying gas (N
 <sub>2</sub>) flow rate 10.0 L/min; drying gas temperature 350 °C; nebulizer pressure 30 psig; capillary 3500 V; skimmer 65 V; octapole RFV 750 V; and fragmentor voltage 100 V in positive mode. The mass range was set at m/z 100–1200 amu with a 250 ms/spectrum. The mass fragmentation was operated on auto ms/ms mode with three collision energies of 10, 20, and 40 eV, respectively. All acquisition and analysis of data were controlled by Agilent MassHunter Data Acquisition Software B.05.01 and Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis Software B.06.0, respectively. The micro-fractions in a 96-well plate were dried using a sample concentrator (Techne, Staffordshire, UK) and kept at −20 °C before being tested.
