<p>MO is a widely consumed traditional plant in many Asian and South East Asian countries. MO possesses many bioactive compounds with potential health benefits including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties [

Although much research supports the anticancer effect of MOL, the actual bioactive compounds responsible have not been well characterized. In this study, we explored the anticancer effect, conducted bioassay-guided fractionation, and identified bioactive compounds from MOL extract against the MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line. We demonstrated that MOL crude EtOAc extract showed the greatest anticancer activity but was non-toxic to primary human macrophage cells (

Fraction no. 7 was subjected for re-fractionation and finally, the 10 candidate compounds were tentatively identified from the active sub-fraction no. 7.7 using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Moreover, we explored the biological activity of three compounds, including 7-octenoic acid, 1-phenyl-2-pentanol, and oleamide against MDA-MB-231, SCC-15, and K562 cell lines.
