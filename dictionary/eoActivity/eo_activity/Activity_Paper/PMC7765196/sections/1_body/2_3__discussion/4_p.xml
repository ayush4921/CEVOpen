<p>Previously, MOL has been described as containing many phenolic compounds that exert anticancer effects including quercetin, kaempferol, isothiocyanate, and gallic acid [

 <xref rid="B51-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Moreover, long-chain fatty acids and their derivatives are also considered as anticancer compounds. In this study, based on bioassay-guided fractionation and LC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis, we identified 10 candidate anticancer compounds (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00464-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), including two aromatic compounds (C1 and C3), five fatty acids (C2, C5-C8), two fatty amides (C9 and C10) and a lactone compound (C4). Octadecadienoic acid and oleamide have been previously described in MOL extracts [

 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] as seen here. Based on commercially available compounds, we selected three candidate compounds (oleamide, 7-octenoic acid, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol) to explore cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells. Oleamide, also known as oleyl amide or 9-octadecenamide, belongs to the class of fatty amides. These are carboxylic acid amide derivatives of fatty acids, that are formed from a fatty acid and an amine. Oleamide was discovered in the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep-deprived cats [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It has been observed that oleamide possesses several biological activities especially sleep induction [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and immunological suppression [
 <xref rid="B57-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, oleamide has been reported to inhibit gap junction communication on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells [
 <xref rid="B58-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It has been reported that 9-octadecenoic acid found about 20.89% in MOL [
 <xref rid="B60-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. 7-octenoic acid is a long-chain fatty acid and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol is used as a flavoring agent. There biological activity has not been reported before. In the present study, we demonstrate the anticancer activity of these compounds against breast cancer cells; we found that oleamide exhibits the strongest anticancer activity when compared to the other two compounds. However, of 1-phenyl-2-pentanol and 7-octadecenoic acid may act in combination or synergistically with other compounds to enhance their activity. We present preliminary results of the synergistic effect of identified compounds (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00464">Figure S8</xref>) after incubation for 24 h. This requires further investigation. Our research provides ten candidate bioactive compounds that might be useful for investigating for anti-cancer activity and future development of treatments for TNBC and other type of cancer. Although we identified the potential compounds by studying their mechanisms of actions, their interaction or combination effect remains unclear. Several previous studies demonstrated that combination therapy can improve the efficacy of the drug in TNBC cell lines [

 <xref rid="B62-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. For example, combination treatment of selumetinib (MEK1/2 inhibitor) with buparlisib (PI3K inhibitor) is synergistic in MDA-MB-231 cells [
 <xref rid="B61-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, the future investigation of anticancer drugs and active natural product combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other treatments is important. Additionally, the limitation of this study is performed only MDA-MB-231, TNBC model. It is unclear whether these compounds still show the same efficacy as other TNBC cell lines. Thus, further study should be performed in other TNBC cell lines such as MDA-MB-175, MDA-MB-435, and MDA-MB-436 [
 <xref rid="B64-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, this study demonstrated that the anticancer efficacy of oleamide with other cancer cell lines, including human myelogenous leukemia cell K562 and human squamous cell carcinoma lines SCC-15, which revealed that oleamide has potential anticancer activity for other cancer types. Recently, patient-derived cancer models have been proposed to gradually replace the cancer cell lines for translational research [

 <xref rid="B67-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. For example, lung cancer patients derived samples were studied the effective drug combination responds [

 <xref rid="B67-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In the present study, we demonstrate the bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of the potential anticancer compounds from MOL extract against TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231. There are 10 compounds were tentatively identified by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis. Moreover, also demonstrates the anticancer properties of compounds no. 2 (7-octenoic acid), no. 3 (1-phenyl-2-pentanol), and no. 9 (oleamide) against MDA-MB-231 cell and other cancer lines including SCC-15 and K562. Therefore, further investigation of MOL extract and bioactive compounds on TNBC patient derived samples and patient-derived xenograft models are powerful tool for combination effects and to overcome the resistance mechanisms.
