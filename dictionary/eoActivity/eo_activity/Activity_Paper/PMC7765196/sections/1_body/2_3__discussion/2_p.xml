<p>Previous studies indicated that the tumor suppressor 
 <italic>p53</italic> gene plays an important role in response to DNA damage and other genomic instability. Activation of p53 is crucial in inducing a p53-dependent pathway leading to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The up-regulation in 
 <italic>p53</italic> gene expression following MOL fraction no. 7 treatment may explain the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis caused by this fraction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00464-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Caspase-3 is a protein that is cleaved and thus activated upon the initiation of apoptosis. Cleaved caspase-3 propagates the apoptotic signal by cleaving downstream executioner caspases at their intersubunit linker [

 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, we measured the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, and we found that fraction no. 7 treatment resulted in increased expression of Bax and decreased expression of Bcl-2. Collectively, our results reveal that MOL fraction no. 7 up-regulates pro-apoptotic p53, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax, while down-regulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein levels.
