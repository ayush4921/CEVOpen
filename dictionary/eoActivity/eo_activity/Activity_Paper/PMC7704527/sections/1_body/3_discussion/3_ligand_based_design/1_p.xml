<p id="Par56">Eighteen (18) new 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazole-5-ones derivative compounds were designed, their predicted activities were higher than that of the chosen template (compounds 4 with pIC
 <sub>50−</sub>5.0620 and compound 2 with pIC
 <sub>50</sub>–4.9846) as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref>. From the mean effect of the descriptors, SpMax4_Bhs had a greater positive impact followed by GATS5e and MATS4e while RDF150u had the least negative impact on the model. According to MATS4e (Moran autocorrelation - lag 4 / weighted by Sanderson electronegativities) and GATS5e (Geary autocorrelation - lag 5 / weighted by Sanderson electronegativities) descriptors, adding more electronegative elements (GATS5e and MATS4e) would increase the potency of the designed compounds. The modification occurred by adding more electronegative elements to the template (compounds 2 and 4).
