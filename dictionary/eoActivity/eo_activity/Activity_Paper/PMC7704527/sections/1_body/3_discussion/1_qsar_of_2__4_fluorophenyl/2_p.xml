 <sub>50</sub>) against biological activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> indicates the pIC
 <sub>50</sub> has been in good agreement with the biological activities as seen in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the values of both calibration and validation compounds spread on both sides of the graph, showing no systematic errors between the standardized residual versus bio-activities (Experimental activity) (Jalali-Heravi and Kyani 2004). Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows William’s graph (standardized residuals against leverages), indicating that all the molecules fell in the warning leverage area, calculated to be (h = 0.56).
