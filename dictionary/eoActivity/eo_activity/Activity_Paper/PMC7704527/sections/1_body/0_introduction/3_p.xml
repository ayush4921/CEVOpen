<p id="Par4">Luminal type of breast cancer is Estrogen receptor (ER)−/progesterone receptor (PR) - the positive type which is caused by the overexpression of estrogen receptor α (ERα). It is made up of about 70% of the mammary tumor patients tagged as ER-positive (ER+). The endless stimulation of ERα by estrogens induce the multiplication of cancer cells, MCF-7 cell line (Jordan et al.

It is found overexpressed in a large collection of different cancer types and this tumoral overexpression often correlates with poor patient prognosis (De Cárcer
