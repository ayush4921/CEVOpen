<p>Morpholine is a tetrahydro-1,4-oxazine with a saturated heterocyclic ring and provides a promising developmental starting point due to its biological profile with metabolic stability. The presence of a heteroatom like oxygen or nitrogen facilitates hydrogen bonding, and thus, interactions with enzymes, and the presence of electron-deficient atoms may also impart hydrophobic interactions with morpholine. From the synthetic perspective, various molecular scaffolds have been added to morpholine by replacing its secondary nitrogen

 </xref>. Moclobemide (1) and reboxetine (2) (both antidepressants) provide examples of FDA-approved drugs containing the morpholine moiety (

These drugs reversibly inhibit MAO-A and selectively inhibit norepinephrine reuptake in the central nervous system (CNS), and thus, block the human a4b2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. In addition, more than 20 drugs containing the morpholine moiety have been FDA approved; they include mycophenolate mofetil (an immunosuppressant), linezolid and finafloxacin (antibiotics), geftinib (an antineoplastic and epidermal growth factor inhibitor), rivaroxaban (an anticoagulant and factor Xa inhibitor), and eteplirsen, which is used to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy
