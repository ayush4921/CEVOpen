<p>Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) play prominent roles in the inactivations of various biogenic amines in central and peripheral tissues. The isoenzymes of MAO-A and MAO-B are considered major therapeutic targets in various neuropsychiatric illnesses and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD)

 </xref>. During the degradations of various biogenic neurotransmitters catalysed by MAO-A and MAO-B, hydrogen peroxide and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as major by-products, which might cause oxidative damage in brain tissues. MAO inhibitors are considered potential neuroprotective agents and up-regulating agents for neurotransmitter amines

 </xref>. Numerous studies have documented that selective and reversible/irreversible MAO-B inhibitors are likely to play pivotal roles in AD-related therapeutic strategies. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitors also play significant roles in the maintenance of cholinergic functions and are used to provide symptomatic relief in AD. Over the past two decades, many researchers have tried to develop multi-acting MAO-B and AChE/BChE inhibitors
