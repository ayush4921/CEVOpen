<p>The synthesised derivatives were screened for their abilities to cross the BBB using the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) because this ability is a critical developmental requirement for any drug targeting neurodegenerative disorders or depression. The PAMPA used was validated by comparing the experimentally determined permeabilities of eight commercial drugs with reported values (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to reported BBB permeation limits, compounds were classified as follows:
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>36</sup>
 </xref> CNS+ (high): Pe (10
 <sup>−6 </sup>cm s
 <sup>−1</sup>) &gt; 4.00, CNS- (low): Pe (10
 <sup>−6 </sup>cm s
 <sup>−1</sup>) &lt;2.00 and CNS± (uncertain): Pe (10
 <sup>−6 </sup>cm s
 <sup>−1</sup>) from 4.00 to 2.00. Our results suggest that all nine synthesised derivatives could cross the BBB, and that 
 <bold>MO1</bold>, 
 <bold>MO5</bold> and 
 <bold>MO9</bold> would be the most effective.
