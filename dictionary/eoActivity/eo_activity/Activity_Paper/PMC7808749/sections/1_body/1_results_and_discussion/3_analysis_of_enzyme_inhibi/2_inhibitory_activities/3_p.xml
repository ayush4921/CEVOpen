<p>Morpholine-containing compounds in this study shared a 1–(4-morpholinophenyl) prop-2-en-1-one structure. Introduction of various electron-donating and withdrawing groups onto the 
 <italic>para</italic> position of the phenyl 
 <bold>B</bold> ring of the basic chalcone scaffold afforded different derivatives. Surprisingly, unsubstituted 
 <bold>MO1</bold> inhibited MAO-B more potently than the other eight derivatives. All nine derivatives exhibited MAO-B selectivity. In particular, 
 <bold>MO1</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.030 µM) was ∼2 times more potent than the reversible MAO-B inhibitor lazabemide (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.063 µM), and had a high selectivity index (SI = &gt;1333.3), which meant that it was the best inhibitor in the series. Regarding MAO-B inhibition, 
 <bold>MO1</bold> was slightly less potent than the reference irreversible MAO-B inhibitor pargyline (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.028 µM). The presence of dimethylamino, chloro and bromo substituents at the 
 <italic>para</italic> position of the chalcone 
 <bold>B</bold> ring conferred moderate AChE inhibition. Recently, it was reported that shifting of morpholine ring to the phenyl 
 <bold>B</bold> ring of chalcones showed moderate AChE inhibition
