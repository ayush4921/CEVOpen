<p>Inhibition assays were carried out after preincubating MAO-B or AChE with the inhibitors for 15â€‰min. The reversibilities of MAO-B inhibition by 
 <bold>MO1</bold> and of AChE inhibitions by 
 <bold>MO5</bold> and 
 <bold>MO9</bold> were investigated by dialysis

 <bold>MO1</bold> from 21.6% (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>U</sub>) to 77.1% (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>D</sub>), which was similar to that shown by lazabemide (from 38.8 to 90.0%), a reversible MAO-B inhibitor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(A)</xref>). On the other hand, inhibition of MAO-B by pargyline (an irreversible inhibitor) was recovered from 10.7 to 16.5%. In addition, inhibitions of AChE by 
 <bold>MO5</bold> and 
 <bold>MO9</bold> were recovered by dialysis from 35.8% (A
 <sub>U</sub>) to 79.2% (A
 <sub>D</sub>) and from 33.8 to 80.7%, respectively, which were similar to that observed for tacrine (from 32.8 to 91.7%), a reversible AChE inhibitor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6(B)</xref>). These results indicate that 
 <bold>MO1</bold> is a reversible inhibitor of MAO-B, and that 
 <bold>MO5</bold> and 
 <bold>MO9</bold> are reversible inhibitors of AChE.
