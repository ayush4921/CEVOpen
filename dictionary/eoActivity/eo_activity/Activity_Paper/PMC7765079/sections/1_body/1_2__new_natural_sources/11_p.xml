<p>One year later the same research group assessed the presence of 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin in common foods such as spinach (leaves), goji (berries), and quinoa (seeds), applying different mixtures of extracting solvents, namely EtOH, H
 <sub>2</sub>O/EtOH 3:7, and H
 <sub>2</sub>O/EtOH 7:3, under microwave irradiation coupled to UHPLC/PDA analysis [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this case ethanol was shown to be the most efficient in terms of extractive yields. 7-Isopentenyloxycoumarin was detected only in extracts from spinach leaves and goji berries in concentration values of 2.33 µg/g and 8.37 µg/g of dry extract, respectively. Noteworthy results from this study were the confirmation of the presence of an oxyprenylated coumarin in the Amaranthaceae family after those obtained with
