<p>The pieces of femur bone were ground using mortar and pestle. Bone tissues were homogenised in 10% (w/v) homogenising buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1.15% KCl pH 7.4) using a Teflon pestle (Glass-Col, USA). The homogenates were centrifuged at 9000 
 <italic>g</italic> in a refrigerated centrifuge (4 °C) for 10 min to remove nuclei and debris. The obtained supernatant was assayed using commercial kits: TBARS assay kit for monitoring lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) assay kit for GPX activity, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assay kit for SOD activity (Cayman Chemical, USA). Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (
