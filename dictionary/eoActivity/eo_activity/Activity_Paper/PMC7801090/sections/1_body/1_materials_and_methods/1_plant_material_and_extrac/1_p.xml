<p>The leaves of 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> var. 
 <italic>deltoidea</italic> were purchased from Moro Seri Utama Enterprise, Batu Pahat, Johor, Malaysia in September 2016. The plant material was identified and authenticated by Mr. Sani Miran, a specialised taxonomist. A voucher specimen (UKMB-40,315) was deposited in the Herbarium Unit, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia for further reference. The leaves were washed thoroughly, oven-dried at 37 ± 5 °C, ground to a fine powder in an electric grinder, and weighed. The powdered leaves (100 g) were soaked in 1 L absolute methanol for three days at room temperature. Liquid extracts were concentrated using a rotary vacuum evaporator (R-215, Buchi, Switzerland) under reduced pressure. The extracts were kept in tightly closed glass containers and stored at −20 °C until further use.
