<p>A total of 24 male rats were divided into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). The assigned groups were as follows: normal control rats received saline (NC), diabetic control rats received saline (DC), Diabetic rats treated with 1000 mg/kg b.w. of metformin (DMET) and diabetic rats treated with 1000 mg/kg b.w. of 
 <italic>F. deltoidea</italic> (DFD). Treatments were given via oral gavage once daily for a 56-day duration. At the end of the experiment, all animals fasted overnight and blood glucose levels were measured. Animals were then anaesthetised with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg), followed by terminal exsanguination. The femur and tibia were separated by cutting at the stifle joint. Blood samples (10–15 mL) were collected via cardiac puncture from the rats into a plain red-top tube containing no anticoagulants (BD Vacutainer
 <sup>®</sup>, USA). The blood samples were then centrifuged at 4000  
 <italic>g</italic> for 15  min, and serum was stored in aliquots at −80 °C.
