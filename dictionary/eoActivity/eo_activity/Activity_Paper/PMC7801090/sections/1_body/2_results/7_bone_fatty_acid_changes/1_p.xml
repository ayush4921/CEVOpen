 <italic>n</italic> − 3 PUFA was significantly decreased while the ratio of 
 <italic>n</italic> − 6 to 
 <italic>n</italic> − 3 PUFA was significantly increased in the femur of DC rats. Similar observations were noticed in the DMET group. Remarkably, the total bone 
 <italic>n</italic> − 3 PUFA increased and the 
 <italic>n</italic> − 6 to 
 <italic>n</italic> − 3 ratio decreased in the DFD group.
