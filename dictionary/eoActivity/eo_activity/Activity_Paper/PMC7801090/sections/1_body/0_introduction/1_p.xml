<p>Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycaemia. It has been demonstrated that diabetes is associated with several lower extremities orthopaedic conditions and complications that affect the quality of life (Ay et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Diabetes accelerates bone loss, osteopenia, and osteoporosis by promoting osteoclast function (Wongdee and Charoenphandhu 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Reports of delayed bone healing (Ajami et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Marin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), reduced growth plate thickness (Stalvey et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), and increased cortical porosity (Osima et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) support the incidence of compromised bone quality in diabetic subjects. Therefore, appropriate attention is warranted for elucidating mechanisms underlying bone microstructure changes associated with diabetes.
