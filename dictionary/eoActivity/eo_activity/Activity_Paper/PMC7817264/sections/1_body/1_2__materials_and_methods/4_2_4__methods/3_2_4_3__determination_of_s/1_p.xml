<p>The preparation procedures of the liver tissue homogenate and experimental methods were the same as above. After 6 hours of intragastric administration of ethanol or normal saline, the blood samples were collected from the iliac vein and centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 5 minutes to get serum. The activities of ALT, AST, and ALP in serum were detected by automatic biochemical analyzer according to the instructions of detection kits. The preparation methods of 10% liver tissue homogenate were consistent with the previous experiment. The 10% liver tissue homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 15 min, and the supernatant was stored at low temperature for determination of SOD and MDA concentrations. According to Buege [

The preparation methods of the specimen and experimental procedures were the same as before. Besides, the levels of TNF-

 <italic>μ</italic>m thick slices by a microtome and stained by hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The histopathological features of the liver were observed under an optical microscope. Three researchers were blinded to allocation arm of the mice, and they read all the slides. The researchers used the alcoholic liver disease grading and staging criteria [
