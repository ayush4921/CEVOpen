<p>After 6 hours of intragastric administration of ethanol or normal saline, the abdominal skin was cut along the midline of the abdomen, and liver tissue was taken. The left lobe of the liver was washed repeatedly with normal saline and then dried with filter paper. Around 0.3 g liver tissue was cut off and used to prepare liver homogenate by 1 : 9 addition of normal saline, and the 10% liver homogenate was prepared by glass homogenizer. The 10% liver homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 r/min for 15 min at low temperature, and the supernatant was collected for detection. The levels of ADH and ALDH in liver homogenate were determined by ELISA, in accordance with the kit instruction manual. The specific operation methods of the ELISA include standard dilution, sample addition, incubation, liquid mixing, washing, enzyme addition, incubation, washing, coloration, reaction termination, and determination of the absorbance. The determination should be carried out within 15 minutes after the addition of termination fluid. The level of P450 in liver tissue homogenate was also detected by ELISA, and the preparation procedures of the liver tissue homogenate and ELISA method are the same as before. The preparation procedures of 10% brain tissue homogenate were the same as the liver tissue homogenate, and the brain homogenate was put into a −70°C refrigerator for determination. The concentrations of 
 <italic>β</italic>-EP and LENK in brain homogenate were also detected by ELISA, and the specific methods were the same as above.
