<p>Alcohol in the body increases the level of reactive oxygen species, decreases levels of antioxidants of cells, and produces oxidative stress [

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. During acute alcoholism, large amounts of oxygen free radicals are generated, MDA content increases, SOD consumption increases, and SOD activity decreases significantly. Brain tissue is the main organ of oxidative damage, which leads to abnormal neurobehavior after acute alcoholism. The results showed that CTR could significantly increase SOD activity and decrease MDA content. Besides, it could mediate the metabolism levels of oxygen free radicals in the liver, raise body antioxidation, and reduce oxidative stress, so as to protect the liver.
