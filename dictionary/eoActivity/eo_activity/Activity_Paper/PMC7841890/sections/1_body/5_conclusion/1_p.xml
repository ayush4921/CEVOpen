Nevertheless, there has been an increasing concern by the clinicians about the potential of interactions of natural remedies with prescribed drugs. The mechanisms underlying natural remedies-drug interactions are always difficult to predict. Another issue is the general lack of understanding on the composition and pharmacological actions of natural remedies. Therefore, research evidence is necessary to ensure its safety and effectiveness and to warrant the integration of natural remedies into evidence-based clinical practice.</p>
