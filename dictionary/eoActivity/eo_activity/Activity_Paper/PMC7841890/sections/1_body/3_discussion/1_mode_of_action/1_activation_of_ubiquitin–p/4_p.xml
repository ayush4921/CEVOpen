<p id="Par60">A schematic of the possible activation of the UPS signalling pathway by natural remedies is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Natural remedies have been shown to activate UPS, resulting in the suppression of polyQ aggregation and motor dysfunction associated with SCA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The cAMP/PKA pathway is known to activate UPS and promote proteasome activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] involving the activation of adenylate cyclase 6 through the A
 <sub>2A</sub> receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Chou et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] reported that the activation of A
 <sub>2A</sub> receptor by T1-11 and JMF-1907 could enhance proteasome activity and promote degradation of ubiquitin proteins. Similar findings were later reported by Chen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] using puerarin and daidzein compounds extracted from 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. lobata</italic>. Inhibition of A
 <sub>2A</sub> receptor using an A
 <sub>2A</sub> antagonist blocked the effects induced by T1-11 and JMF-1907. This suggests the stimulation of A
 <sub>2A</sub> receptor is required for UPS activation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The suppression of polyQ aggregation was reported to prevent polyQ-induced cell death via suppression of BCL-2-associated X (BAX), and caspase-3 and -9 activities, while enhancing B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL) expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].
