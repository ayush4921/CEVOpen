<p id="Par57">In SCA, abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in respective coding regions of SCA leads to elongated translation of the polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. When the expansion reaches a specific threshold, it causes the abnormal configuration of the encoded polyQ protein, leading to protein aggregation and nuclear inclusions, a pathological hallmark of SCA [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The UPS plays a pivotal role in intracellular protein homeostasis by clearing misfolded and defective proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Furthermore, UPS is one of the major regulators of cell cycle progression and apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Evidence shows polyQ proteins are susceptible to ubiquitination and proteasome degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. However, it was shown that the accumulation of polyQ aggregates compromised the function of UPS in SCA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] potentially through deubiquitylation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], leading to further accumulation of aggregates that would otherwise have been removed. Therefore, restoration of UPS function using natural remedies may serve as a therapeutic strategy against polyQ-induced SCA.
