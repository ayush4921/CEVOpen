<p id="Par61">Oxidative damage occurs when reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation exceeds the antioxidant capacity of intracellular antioxidant enzymes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. It was shown that the accumulation of polyQ aggregates can cause the depletion of antioxidants including glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), contributing to the accumulation of ROS and oxidative damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Patients diagnosed with SCA3 were reported to have reduced levels of glutathione and other thiols, which increased their susceptibility to oxidative damage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. This condition may contribute to ROS-induced DNA damage and cell death, leading to motor dysfunctions associated with the disorder [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] Furthermore, the presence of ROS promoted protein aggregation, causing further generation of ROS [
