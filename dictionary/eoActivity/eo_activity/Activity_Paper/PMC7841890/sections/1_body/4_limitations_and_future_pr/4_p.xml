<p id="Par77">Although various forms of HA have been identified, only four subtypes of HA (SCA3, 6, 17 and FRDA) were investigated with natural remedies in the reviewed studies. Furthermore, the studies demonstrating the positive effects of natural remedies on HA were largely conducted with pre-clinical models such as in vitro cell culture models and in vivo animal models. While these models have facilitated the understanding of mechanisms and signalling pathways in the treatment of HA, the results need to be validated in human studies. Additionally, although there are no models that can reproduce all symptoms of HA patients or cellular mechanisms involved, mammals (
