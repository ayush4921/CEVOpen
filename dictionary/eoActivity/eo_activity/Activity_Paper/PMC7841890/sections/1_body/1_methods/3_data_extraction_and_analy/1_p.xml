<p id="Par54">Collection and extraction of data were conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Two researchers (M.W.L.P and S.Y.L) searched and independently reviewed all the relevant studies and selected the ones meeting the inclusion criteria. Disagreements on the eligibility or on the extraction of data were resolved through discussions between the two researchers. The other team members made the final decision if the two researchers could not reach an agreement. Due to inconsistencies in the methodology or experimental design in the retrieved studies, findings were extracted independently and narrated to the best of our ability.</p>
