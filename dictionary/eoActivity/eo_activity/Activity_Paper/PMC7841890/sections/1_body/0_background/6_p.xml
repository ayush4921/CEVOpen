<p id="Par48">Besides, with the recent shift in the mode of discovery from “one-target, one-drug” to “network-target, multiple-component-therapeutics”, many natural remedies or compounds with broad safety profiles have great potential as they have proven efficacy on multiple targets in different diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The concept of multiple-target compounds involves the merging of active substructures or the fusion of two or more biological active moieties into one compound in the enhancement of biological activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin, green tea catechins and salicylate are some of the well-studied biological compounds with multiple molecular targets and mechanism of action elucidated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. However, a disadvantage of biological compounds with multiple targets is the ability to bind to multiple proteins of unrelated structures or the unintended off-targets, which may result in potential toxicity and adverse effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Therefore, it is crucial to characterise and optimise the structure of biological compounds to boost their affinity against the disease-related targets and weaken the activity towards undesired adverse targets [
