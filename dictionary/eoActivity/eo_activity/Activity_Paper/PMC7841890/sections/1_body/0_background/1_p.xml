<p id="Par43">Ataxia is defined as the loss of full control of bodily movements, and can be inherited, acquired, or occur sporadically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Hereditary ataxia (HA) represents a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases resulting from dysfunction of the cerebellum or disruption of connection between the cerebellum and other areas of the central nervous system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hereditary ataxia is characterised by pyramidal syndrome, movement disorder, seizure, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, HA patients often present with unsteadiness of stance and gait, dysarthria, nystagmus, dysmetria and clumsiness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Classification of the subtypes of HA is very challenging due to the many neurological and metabolic diseases associated with cerebellar dysfunction, and the phenotypic heterogeneity among the hereditary disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, HA can be classified by the pattern of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive and X-linked ataxia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].
