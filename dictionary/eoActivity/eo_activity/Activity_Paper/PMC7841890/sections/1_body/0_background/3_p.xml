<p id="Par45">Generally, HA is first diagnosed by assessing the history of the presenting condition, past medical history, and personal history, and then by neurological evaluation, systemic physical evaluation, and pertinent paraclinical tests. Laboratory tests can rule out acquired ataxia and identify biomarkers specific to the HA. Neuroimaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) are useful to determine the presence of cerebellar atrophy or anomalies. After excluding acquired ataxia, the mode of inheritance is then evaluated. In this context, the age of onset and clinical manifestation can well-describe the HA and may provide crucial clue(s) to identify the mutated gene. Molecular genetic testing for HA with high prevalence such as SCA and FRDA is usually suggested before pursuing other extensive tests [

If single gene testing does not provide a molecular diagnosis, then high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) such as multigene panel testing, whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing can be conducted to identify the mutated genes. Specialised genetic counselling and risk assessment can then be provided once the pathogenic mutation has been identified [
