<p>From a different point of view, saponins that originated from Quillaja and Yucca at high concentrations in water or diets can be considered lethal. The addition of Quillaja saponins to water at a concentration of 4000 ppm did not lead to the deaths of carp within 18 h; meanwhile, the addition of Yucca saponins at a concentration of 1000 ppm led to the death of all fish within 18 h. Moreover, Quillaja saponin at 2000 mg/kg in standard diets of the first-feeding stage induced high mortality of tilapia larvae [
