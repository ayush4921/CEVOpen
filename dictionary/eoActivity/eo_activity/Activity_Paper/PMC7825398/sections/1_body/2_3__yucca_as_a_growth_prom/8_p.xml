<p>For shrimp cultivation, Hernández-Acosta et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] examined Pacific white shrimp (
 <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>, 2.6 g initial body weight) cultured in low-salinity water and fed diets with 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. saponaria</italic> extracts (NTF) at the levels of 0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, and 2.00 g/kg diet for 40 days; they found significant results regarding the weights and FCR with 1.00 and 2.00 NTF compared to other groups. The increase in weights and decrease in FCR in response to 
 <italic>Y. schidigera</italic> and 
 <italic>Q. saponaria</italic> supplementation may be due to increased protein synthesis, digestive enzymes, and promotion of nutrient absorption. Moreover, Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] investigated 
 <italic>L. vannamei</italic> (0.82 ± 0.02 g initial body weight) that were fed diets with YSE at the levels of 0, 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3% for 100 days and reported that the addition of 0.2% YSE in the diet was beneficial to the growth and the quality of water and attributed this enhancement in the growth to YSE steroidal saponins and other surface-active substances, which promoted nutrient absorption.
