 <xref rid="B74-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The liver, intestine, and kidneys are the main components of the antioxidant system due to their function in the disposal of ROS by producing a number of key enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) [
 <xref rid="B75-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The antioxidant defense system is tightly linked to the health status and the immune system of fish [
 <xref rid="B76-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The aquatic animal antioxidant system is vulnerable to biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., phylogenetic position, age, physiological condition, presence of xenobiotics, environmental factors, diets, and feeding behavior) [
