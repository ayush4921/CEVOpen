<p>The accumulation of inorganic nitrogen compounds (NH

 <sup>+</sup>, NH
 <sub>3</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>, HNO
 <sub>2</sub>, and NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) resulting from the feces of aquatic organisms, organic matter, and the leftover feed affects the reproduction, growth, and resistance of fish to stressful conditions [
 <xref rid="B83-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B84-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Romano and Zeng [
 <xref rid="B83-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] concluded that not only the ammonia emissions in the farms could harmfully affect the performance of aquatic animals but also in the ecosystem and outdoors, the accumulation of ammonia emissions deteriorates the survivability of decapod crustaceans. Specifically, exposure to NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> and NH
 <sub>3</sub> (TAN) pollution can cause gill damage, anoxia, disruption of blood vessels and osmoregulatory activity (damage to the liver and kidneys), and a decrease in the effectiveness of the immune system [
 <xref rid="B85-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Furthermore, the NH
 <sub>4</sub>
 <sup>+</sup> ions contribute to an internal reduction of Na
 <sup>+</sup>, which in turn, increases the toxicity of NH
 <sub>3</sub> [
 <xref rid="B86-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. These effects can reduce fish feeding activity, fecundity, performances, and survival, leading to a loss of production and massive economic losses [
 <xref rid="B87-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Concurrently, the fluctuations between the water acidity (pH) and temperature affect the ratio of the formed unionized ammonia (NH
 <sub>3</sub>), which causes toxicity and harmful impacts on the ecosystem and aquatic organisms [
 <xref rid="B84-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="B88-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B89-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Severe ammonia toxicity induces several effects on the aquatic animals, including the decrease of feed consumption, deteriorated physiological functions, unstable breathing through the gills, oxidative stress, diminished immunity, and inflammatory features in the gills [
 <xref rid="B90-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The metabolism of protein inside the body can also be deteriorated, which causes the consumption of high amounts of energy to balance the protein level in the fish body [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The main methods to lower the ammonia toxicity is to stop feeding, change the water, increase the level of dissolved oxygen, use nitrification-specific bacteria, or carefully include lime in the ponds [
 <xref rid="B93-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Additionally, the application of yucca extract is also recognized as a powerful tool for reducing the ammonia level in aquaculture ponds [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Yucca is applied mainly to reduce the levels of ammonia emissions in aquaculture ponds due to its content of steroidal saponin fractions, which has surface-active properties and can bind to ammonia via glycol-component fractions [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The reduced levels of accumulated ammonia would result in the balance of protein metabolism in the fish body and a reduction in energy consumption [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Hence, the feed utilization, growth performance, and physiological status of aquatic species can be improved using yucca. Additionally, yucca application results in the enhancement of the antioxidative, immunological, and anti-inflammatory responses in several aquatic animals [
 <xref rid="B11-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this sense, yucca is an alternative approach to overcoming the excessive use of antibiotics for eco-friendly aquaculture. More specifically, the intensive conditions produce abundant amounts of ammonia emissions, which induces oxidative stress, immunosuppression, and inflammatory features in a fish’s body [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The inclusion of yucca extract improved the quality of rearing water and lowered the accumulated ammonia in the case of mirror carp [
 <xref rid="B42-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Nile tilapia (
 <italic>O. niloticus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], striped catfish (
 <italic>P. hypophthalmus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B52-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and European seabass juveniles (
 <italic>D. labrax</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B45-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Yucca extract has steroidal saponins and glycol with an active surface attributed to ammonia’s adsorption [
 <xref rid="B34-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Correspondingly, the reduction in ammonia levels is attributed to the binding of ammonia with steroidal saponins and glycols or the transformation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Furthermore, the decreased level of NH
 <sub>3</sub> is correlated with a decreased level of pH and water temperature [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this context, Fayed et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-animals-11-00093" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] elucidated that yucca extract reduced the level of pH in water. Concurrently, the level of NH
 <sub>3</sub> was probably lowered due to the relative reduction in the level of pH in rearing water. Hence, it can be concluded that yucca extract’s approach is recommended to protect aquatic organisms from the toxicity of waterborne ammonia.
