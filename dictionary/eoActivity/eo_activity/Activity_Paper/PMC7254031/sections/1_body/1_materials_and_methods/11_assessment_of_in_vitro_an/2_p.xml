<p id="p0060">To analyze anti-inflammatory activity inhibition effect, 0.4 ml Bovine serum albumin (3%, w/v) and different concentration of methanol extract (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μg/ml) were added. 0.1 N Hydrochloric acid was used to reduce the pH value to 6.3. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and kept on a water bath for 2 min. The reaction mixture was cooled and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 6.3) was added and the absorbance was read at 416 nm against reagent blank. The anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac was used as the standard drug. Experiment was performed in triplicate analysis and the percentage inhibition of protein denaturation was calculated.</p>
