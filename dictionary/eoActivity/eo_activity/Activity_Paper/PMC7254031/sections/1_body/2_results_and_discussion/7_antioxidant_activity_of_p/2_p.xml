 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">Sadique et al. (1987)</xref> studied anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>M. cerviana</italic> in 
 <italic>invivo</italic> using mouse model and reported 26% activity at 100 mg/g body weight. The phytochemicals inhibit the levels of acid phosphatase, lipid peroxides and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. In recent years, an attention has been paid to find antioxidant molecules from natural sources for various health benefits. Plants produce various secondary metabolites with antioxidant properties. Polyphenols are the one of the important antioxidant compounds and plant tissues are rich of phenolic compounds such as, tannins, phenolic acids and flavonoids. These compounds have various biological activities, including antioxidant activity (

 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic>, 
 <italic>T. cucumerina</italic> and 
 <italic>M. cerviana</italic> showed the presence of tannin and flavonoids. The combined effect of these plant extracts showed about 95.3 ± 2% antioxidant activity.
