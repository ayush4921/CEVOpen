 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Ates and Turgay (2003)</xref> used methanol and ethanol to extract phytochemicals from the medicinal plants and reported the presence of tannins, terpenoids, essential oil, flavonoids and alkaloids. Ethanol has the capacity to yield more number of phytochemicals. 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Kannan et al. (2009)</xref> reported phytochemicals such as, phenols, saponins, terpenoids, alkaloids and flavonoids showing antimicrobial activity from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Vetiveria zizanioides</italic>. The phytochemical such as, carbohydrate, alkaloids, steroids, saponins, flavonoids and tannin have been detected. These secondary metabolites are useful in cell growth, body building and replacement. These also have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, immune stimulant, antiviral and detoxification activities (
