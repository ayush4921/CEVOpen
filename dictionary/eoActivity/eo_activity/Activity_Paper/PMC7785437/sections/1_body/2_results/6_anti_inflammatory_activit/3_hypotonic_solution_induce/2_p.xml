<p id="p0125">The EEMLR and EEQGL markedly preserved the erythrocyte membrane against denaturation stimulated by the hypotonic solution in the analysis of membrane stabilization function shown in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. EEMLR uncovers RBC 's protection against the negative impact of a hypotonic solution at 500, 250 and 125 μg/ml were 53.6567 ± 0.002, 45.6965 ± 0.0029 and 36.492 ± 0.0025 compared with positive control 69.5771 ± 0.0050, 57.8855 ± 0.0219 and 43.2089 ± 0.006 at the same dosages. On the other hand, EEQGL showed 36.990 ± 0.0029, 31.8407 ± 0.0025% and 26.6169 ± 0.0007% inhibition of hypotonic solution-induced hemolysis at the previous corresponding dosages.
