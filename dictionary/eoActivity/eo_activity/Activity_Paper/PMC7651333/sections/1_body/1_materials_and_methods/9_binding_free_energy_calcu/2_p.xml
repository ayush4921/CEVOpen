<p>The binding free energy of the protein-inhibitor complexation (Δ
 <italic>G</italic>) was calculated using molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA). These classical methods were used to evaluate the energy difference between the two ends states of the system such as bound and unbound. These methods are also allowed to perform a more accurate analysis of residue wise contribution to the overall binding of the ligand to a receptor. The BE comprises of bonds, angles, dihedral, electrostatic interactions, Van der Waals interactions, polar and nonpolar solvation energies. Of the 100 ns simulation trajectories, the first 10 ns were excluded for MM-GBSA/MM-PBSA analysis to facilitate compete equilibration of the system set up. A total of 900 snapshots from the MD simulations were used to calculate the free energies using MM-GBSA, and MM-PBSA methods.
