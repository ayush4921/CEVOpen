<p>Docking results of the selected medicinal plant bioactives with M
 <sup>pro</sup> illustrate that these bioactives have interactions at the catalytic site of proteases, i.e. His41 and Cys145 similar to the standard drugs (Supporting Information 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001 F0002">Fig. S1-S2</xref>). There are 20 amino acids of M
 <sup>pro</sup> that frequently make H-bonds with the medicinal plant bioactives, and their frequencies of interactions are shown in Supporting Information 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Fig. S3A</xref>. Similarly, 25 amino acids of M
 <sup>pro</sup> often make hydrophobic interactions, and their frequencies are shown in Supporting Information 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Fig. S3B</xref>. Similar to standard drugs, bioactives also had a higher binding affinity, and their interactions at the catalytic dyad suggest that the chosen bioactives may also inhibit the activity of M
 <sup>pro</sup> and thereby interfere in the process of viral replication as well as transcription. Among the various selected bioactives, pedunculagin (–8.9 kcal/mol) and echinacin (–8.9 kcal/mol) has shown the highest BE with M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Pedunculagin forms H-bond with Thr26, His41, Ser46, Cys145, His163 as well as it had various non-bonded interactions near the binding pocket of M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Similarly, echinacin forms H-bonds with Thr24, Phe140, His164, Glu166, Arg188, Thr190 and Gln192 in addition, to several non-bonded interactions at the binding pocket of M
 <sup>pro</sup> (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The interactions of the bioactives at the binding pockets may likely to inhibit the activity of M
 <sup>pro</sup>. In addition, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(A)</xref> shows the common amino acids of M
 <sup>pro</sup> interacting with the standard drug nelfinavir, and bioactive withanolide A as well as taraxerol.
