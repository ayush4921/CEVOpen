<p>Toxicity prediction is one major factor in scoring any compound as a drug. The 
 <italic>in silico</italic> toxicological profile of the medicinal plant bioactives was determined by the ProTox-II server and compared with the standard drugs (Drwal et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The LD
 <sub>50</sub> values of standard drugs and predictive different organ toxicity are given in Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0001 t0005" ref-type="table">Table S5.1</xref>. Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals classified different classes of toxicity of orally consumed compounds, described in Supporting Information 
 <xref rid="t0002 t0005" ref-type="table">Table S5.2</xref>. Bioactives from medicinal plants shown a range of LD
 <sub>50</sub> values. Daturaolone and taraxerol were non-toxic as their LD
 <sub>50</sub> was 8800 mg/kg, 70,000 mg/kg, respectively. In contrast, withanolide A was falling under class 2 toxicity. Structural modification is one of the new techniques to reduce the toxicity of any compounds. Recently, different chemical strategies such as applying the structural alert in molecules can reduce the toxicity. These structural alerts reduce the toxicity by partial replacement or a full replacement, or by reducing the electronic density or by introducing the structural element involved in metabolism (Limban et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The level of toxicity also can be reduced by consuming them as dietary formulations rather than purified compounds or drugs. Therefore, toxicity can be reduced by structural alteration or by chemical strategies. Most of the chosen bioactives did not show any hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity and cytotoxicity.
