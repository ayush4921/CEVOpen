<p>Overall, the selected medicinal plant bioactives make H-bonds with more than fifteen amino acids of the ACE2 receptor, as shown in Supporting Information Fig. S9A, which are known to interact with its partner proteins frequently. Among them, His34, Glu35, Glu37, Asp38, Ala386, Ala387 and Arg393 show strong and stable interactions with medicinal plant bioactives (Supporting Information Fig. S9A). Besides H-bonding, 29 amino acids of the ACE2 receptor involve in hydrophobic interactions. Among them, Asn33, His34, Glu37, Asp38, Tyr41, Lys353, Gln388, Pro389 and Arg393 residues interact with more than three bioactives (Supporting Information Fig. S9B). The common amino acids of ACE2 receptor interacting with the standard drug nelfinavir, and bioactivities withanolide A, as well as taraxerol, are shown in
