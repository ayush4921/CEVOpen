<p>The observed post-prandial hypoglycemic potential of 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> catechin can be attributed to its inhibitor effects on carbohydrate digestive enzymes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase). CTN played a significant role in the amelioration of oxidative stress and diabetic complications in STZ-induced injuries in liver and kidneys in rats. CTN significantly decreased hepatic, renal, and lipid parameters, and HbA1c levels in diabetic rats while significantly increased the HDL level, antioxidant enzyme GPx and reduced GSH content. It can be concluded from the results of this study that 
 <italic>E. umbellata</italic> berries catechin could effectively be used as an antioxidant and anti-hyperglycemic factor that has potential to reduce the MDA level in STZ-induced diabetic rats, and thus might be a useful candidate to be used in the management of type-2 diabetes.
