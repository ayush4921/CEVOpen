<p>Diabetes was induced according to the method previously described by Matsuzawa-Nagappa et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Animals were divided into two major groups. One group was given normal pellet diet and the other animal group was fed with high fat diet (HFD: 40% raw beef fat + 30% casein + 10% glucose + 7% wheat flour + 6% barn + 4% vitamin mixture and 3% salt mixture) for two weeks before commencing the experiment. After two weeks, induction of hyperglycemia was carried out in HFD Sprague-Dawley rats via a single intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of STZ (50 mg/kg) prepared in 0.9% normal saline solution after an overnight fast. Blood samples were collected from tail vein and through SD glucometer blood glucose level was measured after 72 h (of STZ injection). Rats with blood glucose levels higher than 300 mg/dL were considered as being diabetic. In the normal control groups only normal saline (8 mL/kg, p.o) was given as a vehicle. Isolated compound catechin was administered to the treatment groups from 3 days after STZ administration for 3 weeks. Blood glucose level and body weights were documented at weekly intervals.
