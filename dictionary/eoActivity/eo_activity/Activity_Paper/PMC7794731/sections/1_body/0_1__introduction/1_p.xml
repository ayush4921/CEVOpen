<p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a metabolic disorder that increases glucose level in blood which ultimately reduces life expectancy, diminishes life quality, and finally leads to mortality and morbidity [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Around 25% of the world’s population in the developing and developed countries are suffering from diabetes mellitus. To decrease the burden of glucose and related complications in diabetes, glycemic control is important from a clinical point of view [

DM is considered as a major chronic disease after cancer and cardiovascular diseases in human, caused either due to insufficient insulin secretion by pancreatic islet cells of Langerhans or due to insulin resistance that leads to hyperglycemia [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increase in blood glucose is associated with the activities of two intestinal enzymes; α-amylase and α-glucosidase that causes the degradation of carbohydrates into disaccharides and finally to monosaccharide. Plasma glucose can be regulated by inhibiting these two enzymes [
