<p>The isolated catechin significantly inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes indicating its antihyperglycemic effects, which is in agreement with reported studies on other phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The obtained data confirmed that the use of catechin (2, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 50 mg/kg) and glibenclamide significantly decreased glucose levels in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Studies have shown [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-26-00137" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that the use of glibenclamide increases the sensitivity of β-cells and activates insulin synthesis and secretion from the β-cells of the pancreas that might be associated with its anti-hyperglycemic activity. Furthermore, catechin has protective effects on the major tissues including liver, kidney, and pancreas thus have a minimizing effect of diabetes associated complications [
