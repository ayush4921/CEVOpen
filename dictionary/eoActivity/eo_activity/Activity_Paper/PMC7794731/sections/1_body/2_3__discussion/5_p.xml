<p>A significant increase in lipid parameters levels such as TC, TGs, LDL, and cholesterol was observed while at the same time a significant decrease of HDL cholesterol in STZ-induced diabetic rats was also evident in comparison to normal control group. These results were in line with other previous studies where it has been observed that increase in circulating free fatty acids enhances hepatic TGs production. High TGs content associated with formation of an atherogenic dyslipidaemia consisting of an elevation in high TG content, low HDL cholesterol and increased LDL or apo lipoprotein-B [

Epidemiological studies indicated that regular intake of more than two cups of green tea and its catechin have been shown to ameliorate oxidative stress, hyperlipidemia and lower the concentration of TC and LDL, which has also been demonstrated in the performed meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [
