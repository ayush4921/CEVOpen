<p>Histopathological analysis clearly showed improvement in pancreas section of the treated groups (catechin treated groups) when compared to STZ-induced diabetic group. The pancreatic tissue of diabetic rat demonstrated degeneration and vacuolization in the Langerhans’s islet cells. The diameter of the islet of Langerhans was decreased with decreased cellular density. Shrined and pyknotic nuclei were also visible in the center of the islet. The boundary of endocrine and exocrine portion of the pancreas was also indistinct, besides decrease in islets size and β-cell number was also observed. This data was in agreement with the study of Ramadan et al. [

Current results indicated that histological pattern of pancreas of groups treated with glibenclamide (5 g/kg/overly) and catechin (15, 30, and 50 mg/kg; p.o) did not show any violation from the normal histological pattern during experimental period. Similar to previous investigations, our study demonstrated that glibenclamide and catechin treatment are useful to increase pancreatic regeneration, number and diameter of islet of Langerhans and an increase in β-cell function after treatment in STZ-induced diabetic rates [
