<p>Glucose is the end product of carbohydrate metabolism that is most readily absorbed into blood and presented as an increase in post-prandial hyperglycemic condition. Inhibition of carbohydrate digesting enzymes; α-amylase and α-glucosidase can delay the absorption of glucose and consequently results in a decline of post prandial hyperglycemic state. Our results were in line with reported study carried out on 
 <italic>Ononis angustissima</italic> aqueous extract/fraction that exhibited strong inhibitory activity on carbohydrate digestive enzymes; α-amylase and α-glucosidase [

 <italic>Elaeagnus umbellata</italic> [
