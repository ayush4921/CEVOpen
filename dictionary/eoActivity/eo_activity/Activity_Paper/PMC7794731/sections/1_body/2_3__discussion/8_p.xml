<p>Among phenolic compounds; flavonoids have been reported as scavenger of free radicals that shows strong antioxidant activity by donating hydrogen group. Catechin also exhibits its antioxidant and free radicals scavenging activity through hydrogen donating ability in STZ-diabetic rats. Glutathione peroxidase is the key antioxidant enzyme which plays a major role in oxidative damage against oxidative stress induced by free radicals. The current study showed that streptozotocin administration in ratâ€™s results in decreased activities of glutathione peroxidase which is a validation of the other investigations. Catechin treatments of diabetic rats cause reduction in free radical generation and lipid peroxidation thus elevating antioxidant defence. Antioxidant activity of catechin has been validated in several other studies as well [
