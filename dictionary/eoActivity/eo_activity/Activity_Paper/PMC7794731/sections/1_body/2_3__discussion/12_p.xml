<p>In conclusion, the current study designated that the anti hyperglycemic and hypolipidemic ability of catechin exhibits a protective effect on various parameters in the STZ induced diabetic rats and helped in relieving the related complications. Based on the results of the histopathological studies of the pancreatic tissue, the anti-diabetic activity of those samples was believed to occur through the mechanism of increasing secretion of healthy pancreatic Î²-cells. However, more studies are needed for evaluating the exact protective mechanism of catechin for diabetes management and its complications in animal models.</p>
