<p>The phenols in mushroom extracts can be linked to their antioxidant capabilities. Our research highlights a correlation between total phenolics and DPPH free radical scavenging activity in mushroom extracts. This is consistent with the research of several authors who reported that the total phenolic content correlated with the free radical scavenging activity of other fungi [
