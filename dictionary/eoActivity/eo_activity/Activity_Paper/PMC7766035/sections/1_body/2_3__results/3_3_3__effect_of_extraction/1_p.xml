<p>The total phenolic content in the extract is expressed in milligrams of gallic acid equivalent and the total flavonoid content in milligrams of quercetin equivalent. In this study, however, the total phenolics yield decreased when the ethanol concentration was more than 80% (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01889-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The total phenolics yield increased with prolonged extraction time from 20 to 45 min. The total phenolics yield increased with an increase in ethanol concentration from 60% to 80%. It should be noted that, although in a very small amount, flavonoids are also present in the extract of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic>. The ethanol extracts exhibited high content of phenolics and high radical scavenging activity (DPPH scavenged, as a percentage). The results strongly suggest that phenolics and flavonoids are important components of the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> extracts, and this could explain their high radical scavenging activity. The total flavonoid (TFC) and phenolic (TPC) contents of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> were quantified using the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent (

 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> reached 23.26 mg GAE/g DM and the total flavonoid content reached 3.26 mg QE/g DM with 80% ethanol concentration, extraction time of 45 min, and solvent–material ratio 30 mL/g, these data being consistent with those from other scientific studies [

 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> corresponded to an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 92.4 µg/mL. The results of the present study showed that a dose-dependent increase in free radical extinction is due to the increase in alcohol concentration (80%) with the lowest IC
