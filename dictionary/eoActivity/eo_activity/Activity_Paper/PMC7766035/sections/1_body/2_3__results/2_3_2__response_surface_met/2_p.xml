 <sub>1</sub>) and extraction time (X
 <sub>2</sub>) regarding the extraction yield. Increasing percentages of ethanol from 60 to 80% with extraction time from 30 to 45 min enhanced the extraction yield. It can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01889-f003">Figure 3</xref>B that by varying the ethanol concentration from 60 to 80% and increasing the solvent-to-material ratio from 10 to 30 mL/g, the extraction yield of target compounds was improved. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01889-f003">Figure 3</xref>C presents the correlation between extraction time and the solvent-to-material ratio. It was found that the maximum yield (17.50%) was achieved when the extraction time was 45 min and the solvent-to-material ratio was 20 mL/g. This result was in accordance with the findings of previous studies [
