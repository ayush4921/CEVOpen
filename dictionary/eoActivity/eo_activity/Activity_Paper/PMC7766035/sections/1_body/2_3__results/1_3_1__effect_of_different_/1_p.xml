<p>A microscopic analysis (Olympus BX 43, Hamburg, Germany) was performed to confirm the development of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01889-f002">Figure 2</xref>), and images were taken with the digital camera of the Olympus Bx 43 instrument. The analysis was performed with white LED lamp housing (U-LHLEDC), with a 40x objective lens and a 10-fold ocular, using an Olympus DP72 camera sensor (Olympus Corporation, Hamburg, Germany) (11.8 megapixel cooled digital color camera, capturing each color of RGB at 12 bits, at ISO 1600 setting, image color-calibrated (XC30 software)). The parameters tracked during ultrasonic extraction by sonochemistry were approximately (extraction time being different) similar for each sample examined and were constantly monitored from the operating system of the device using 27 W per hour, with a net extraction power of 170 W, and maintaining a constant temperature in the ultrasonic bath.
