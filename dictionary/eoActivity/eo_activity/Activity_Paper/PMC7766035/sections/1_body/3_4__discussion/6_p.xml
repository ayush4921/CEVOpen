<p>The chemical composition of mushrooms varies according to species [

 <xref rid="B52-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Among the 
 <italic>Hericium</italic> spp., 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> is the most studied. Its fruiting body is known as a good source of carbohydrates (76.5% DW, dry weight), protein (18.8% DW), ash (7.52% DW), fiber (7.10% DW), and fat (2.01% DW). These mushrooms also contain several amino acids, substantial amounts of potassium and phosphorus, and aroma substances [

 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> can be seen in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01889-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> contains high energy, proteins, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), fiber, and fat. In the literature, arabinose has been evaluated as one of the minor sugars in mushrooms [
 <xref rid="B36-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but for the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> studied herein, arabinose was the major sugar, and this can be attributed to the protocol followed for the development of the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> mycelia. A large amount of arabinose is a characteristic of the genus 
 <italic>Hericium</italic> [

 <xref rid="B54-foods-09-01889" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The nutritional composition of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> biomass can also be related to the composition of fat, protein, and carbohydrates used for cultivation in the glass vessel.
