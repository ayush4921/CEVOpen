<p>Given the follow-up, it can be said that a large amount of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> powder was obtained from a small amount of fungal material. Also, the improvement of the extraction of polyphenols and flavonoids by ultrasonication can mainly be attributed to the effect of acoustic cavitations produced in the solvent by the passage of ultrasonic waves. Therefore, the structure of the cell wall is interrupted, and diffusion through the membranes is accelerated. The most efficient extraction period for achieving the maximum yield was approximately 45 min. However, other parameters could be considered for optimizing the extraction yields of diterpenoids and polyphenols, such as the ultrasonic amplitude of the precipitation time. Based on our results, we can say that the 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> mycelia developed in the culture vessel after our optimized process could improve the extraction of polyphenols, flavonoids, and diterpenoids. This can also be attributed to ultrasonic extraction.
