<p>This is the first study to investigate the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic> extracts obtained by ultrasonic extraction with ethanol. Based on our study, we can conclude that mushrooms seem to be a potential natural source of dietary flavonoids and polyphenols, displaying a great range of compounds in valuable concentrations. These results indicate the medicinal and antioxidant properties of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> for use in alternative medicine. The methodology realized the development of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> biomass in a controlled in vitro medium and its subsequent submission to the ultrasonic extraction technique, which can enrich the isolation of antioxidants in 
 <italic>Hericium erinaceus</italic>, particularly polyphenols and flavonoids correlated with the diterpenoid erinacine A, known for its high antioxidant activity. The optimized extraction conditions were 80% ethanol, extraction time of 45 min, and solvent–material ratio of 1:30 (g/mL). The total content of phenolics in this optimized 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> extract was 23.2 mg GAE/g DM, and in the DPPH test, the antioxidant activity reached an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 87.2 µg/mL. According to the results above, 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> biomass may be introduced as a possible valuable source of nutritive supplements exhibiting antioxidant properties. Our future studies are ongoing and will focus on researching the possible beneficial effects on the brain of 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic> extracts.
