<p>Hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) is also one of the constituents in honey reported to be responsible for its antimicrobial effects [
 <xref rid="B117-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. An in vitro study conducted in 1977 showed that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> has strongly inactivated the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and influenza viruses (A and B) [
 <xref rid="B118-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Another study showed that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> has inhibitory effects on the infectivity of bird viruses: H5N1, IBV, and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) [
 <xref rid="B119-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. A more recent study indicates the promising virucidal activity of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> against the feline calicivirus (FCV), which infects domestic cats [
 <xref rid="B120-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. However, the antiviral activity of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in honey has not yet been assessed.
