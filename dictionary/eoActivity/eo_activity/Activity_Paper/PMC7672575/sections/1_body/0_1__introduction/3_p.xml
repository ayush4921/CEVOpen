<p>The SARS-CoV-2 spreads through droplets of saliva or discharges from the nose when infected persons cough or sneeze [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The S1 subunit comprises of receptor-binding domain (RBD), through the interaction with peptidase domain (PD) from the ACE2, whereas S2 subunit mediates virusâ€“cell membrane fusion [

Upon the S1-ACE2 interaction, another S2 cleavage is identified and broken down by host proteases (i.e., priming) called transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), and this phase is considered crucial during viral infection [
