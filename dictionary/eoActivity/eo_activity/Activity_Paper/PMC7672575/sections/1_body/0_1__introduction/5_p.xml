In order to fight against this disease, researchers have to repurpose and redevelop existing treatments to work against COVID-19 based on the molecular and biological understanding of the COVID-19 pathogeneses, which could be a promising option in terms of cost and time [

Thus, ascertaining effective treatments is imperative for patientsâ€™ benefit. Currently, there are 305 clinical trials to assess the therapeutic potentials of different types of drugs and other therapeutic compounds against COVID-19 and 194 of them reached the clinical stage (
