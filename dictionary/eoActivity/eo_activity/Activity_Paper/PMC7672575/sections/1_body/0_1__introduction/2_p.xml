<p>The common predecessor of all coronaviruses dates back as far as 55 million years or more, hence, suggesting elongated term coevolution with bat and avian species [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Existing historical evidence notifies that coronaviruses were initially discovered in the 1930s, when an acute respiratory contagion of house chickens was initiated by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [

The thickness of the envelope is ~80 nm (0.08 μm), and the spikes are ~20 nm (0.02 μm) long. Electron micrographs helped to identify the virus with an envelope comprising diverse pair of electron dense shells [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Within this envelope, there is nucleocapsid comprised of manifold nucleocapsid (N) protein, bound to the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome in an uninterrupted beads-on-a-string variety conformation [
