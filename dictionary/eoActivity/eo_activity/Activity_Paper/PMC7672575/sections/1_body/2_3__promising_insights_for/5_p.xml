<p>Both the flavonoid hesperidin and rosmarinic acid from plant extracts, which are also reported to be found in honey [
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], have shown potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in a study-based computational analysis [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Interestingly, the analysis showed that hesperidin was the only natural compound that can bind to the RBD of S protein, and thus it could neutralize ACE2 and spike-RBD binding [
 <xref rid="B114-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Thus, honey contains hesperidin could have a potential effect in blocking the adhesion of the virus to the target cells. However, the study of those two flavonoids was based on their presence in plants as origin and no quantitative report is given as an example in honey. These findings should guide researchers to conduct further computational and experimental analysis towards a clear understanding of the potential of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents in honey. This step would be a pivotal point to learn from the past and not repeat conventional studies reporting the effects of honey without understanding its mechanisms of action.
