<p>Levan polysaccharide is a product from the fermentation process of 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and it has been reported that levan can mediate the activation of TLR4 pathway and results in an increase of the inflammation process [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. A study on 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> isolated from honey showed that the biological activity of levan (Î²-2,6-fructan) produced by these bacteria have antiviral activity against the pathogenic respiratory RNA virus avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1) and the enteric DNA adenovirus type 40 [

 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] and both viruses have the potential to cause global pandemics [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Thus, it is crucial to continuously explore potential therapeutics against these viruses, and levan might be a promising compound in honey. Therefore, it would be interesting to evaluate the potential of TLR4-mediated effects from levan in honey to balance the pro-inflammatory versus antiviral effect in patients infected by SARS-CoV2. Moreover, a study using the fish model suggested that levan can facilitate the aggregation of cells and viruses, and thus enhances the phagocytosis process [
