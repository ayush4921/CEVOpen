<p>Based on the floral source, there are monofloral (from a single floral source) and multifloral (from diverse floral sources) honeys. Most honeys are monofloral, produced commonly by bees from the genus 
 <italic>Apis</italic>, and named according to their respective plant species (e.g., Manuka honey). Honeys produced by stingless bees (genus 
 <italic>Meliponinae</italic>) are commonly multifloral [

However, which type of these two honeys can express superior therapeutic potentials (mainly based on its antioxidant activity) is still under investigation. A study of 10 different monofloral and multifloral honeys showed that the antioxidant activities, based on their phenolic content, of some monofloral honeys (i.e., heather &gt; phacelia&gt; honeydew &gt; buckwheat) were higher compared to multifloral honeys, whereas other monofloral honeys (i.e., nectarâ€“honeydew&gt; lime &gt; rape&gt; goldenrods &gt; acacia) showed lower antioxidant activities [
