<p>An interesting case report showed that inhaled NO treatment (approved by the FDA) was used for the remote treatment of an outpatient infected with COVID-19 that had concomitant idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH) [
 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Over 11 days, the inhaled NO dose was started from 20 ppm with oxygen for 12–14 h/day, and gradually decreased to 10, 5, and 0 ppm for 2–3 h/night. The patient had rapid and sustained improvement as evidenced by their symptomatic relief, and they recovered without hospital care [

However, the result of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test after recovery was missed in this report, meaning it is unclear whether NO can express antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 or just prevent the progression of the disease. Therefore, several clinical trials are currently ongoing towards further understanding of the potentials of inhaled NO against COVID-19 [
