<p>It is known that the advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) of DNA and protein give rise to a major cell-permeant precursor “methylglyoxal”. Methylglyoxal reacts with free amino groups of lysine and arginine and with thiol groups of cysteine, forming AGEs [

Thus, higher levels of methylglyoxal were associated with dysfunctioning glyoxalase system, the most important pathway for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, which is related to various diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and central nervous system problems [

It was proven that methylglyoxal effectively inhibited the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. These inhibitory effects were well-discovered, and it started when methylglyoxal levels reached 0.3 mM in media, causing alterations in the structure of bacterial fimbriae and flagella, which would limit bacteria adherence and motility [
