<p>In 1996, Zeina et al. suggested that honey has antiviral activity against the Rubella virus in infected monkey kidney cells (Vero cells) in vitro [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05017" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. After four days of incubation, 1 mL of honey (at a range of concentrations from 1:1 to 1:1000) was enough to kill 1 mL of the virus in the culture in all concentrations (10 to 10
 <sup>9</sup> virus/mL) without causing any cytotoxicity against the cells themselves [

Another study has shown that honeys including Manuka, Soba, Kanro, Acacia, and Renge have antiviral effects, and Manuka honey is the most potent antiviral candidate against influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) in the cultured Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line [
