  <p>The potential antiviral mechanisms of action for honey contain caffeic acid, CAPE, galangin, and chrysin against SARS-CoV-2. Through an endosomal pathway, SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell upon binding its S protein to the cellular receptor ACE2. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The viral RNA is unveiled in the cytoplasm and the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins cleaved by the proteases (3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> and PL
   <sup>pro</sup>) to form nonstructural proteins (nsps) as helicase (for viral RNA synthesis) and the RNA replicase–transcriptase complex (RTC), which includes RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (for virion assembly). RdRp is responsible for the replication of structural protein RNA. The nucleocapsids residing in the cytoplasm are assembled from genomic RNA, whereas the structural proteins S1, S2, E, and M are translated by ribosomes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and then released for preparation of virion assembly. The structural proteins then fuse with virion assembly to virus assembling, which is then transported through the Golgi apparatus to be released via exocytosis. (
   <bold>B</bold>) When honey containing caffeic acid (Caf), CAPE, galangin (Gal), and chrysin (ChR) is being consumed, those compounds could enter the infected cells and inhibit 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup>. This inhibition is based on the chemical interactions of these compounds with 3CL
   <sup>pro</sup> amino acid residues; (1) Caf with GLN-189, HIE-164 through hydrogen (H) bonding, and with HIE-41 through π–π stacking interaction. (2) CAPE with THR-24 and THR-26 through H-bonding, and with HIE-41 through π–π interaction. (3) Chr with SER-46, THR-24 and THR-26 through H-bonding, and with HIE41 through π–π interaction. (4) Gal with SER-46 and THR-24 through H-bonding, and with HIE-41 through π–π interaction. As a result, the process of pp1a and pp1ab polyprotein cleavage will fail to form nsps and RdRp, which means that protein replication cannot be completed and finally, SARS-CoV-2 replication will be stopped.
