  <p>The hypothesized mechanisms of action for NO antiviral effect through the MD-2/TLR4 signaling axis, again implicated in the viral infection at the intracellular level. The MD-2/TLR4 signals activate the transcription of the nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) gene through activation of MAPK and NF-kB. This activation results in expression of NOS2 mRNA to produce NOS enzymes that are responsible for producing NO by the conversion of 
   <sc>l</sc>-arginine (Arg) into 
   <sc>l</sc>-citrulline (Cit), with existing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and oxygen (O
   <sub>2</sub>). There are three isoforms from NOS enzymes that produce NO; neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS); each of them is expressed in different cell types. In the cell infected by a virus, NO might inhibit viral protease enzymes by blocking their cleavage ability of viral polyproteins. This process would inhibit the synthesis of viral RNA, and thus inhibit viral replication.
