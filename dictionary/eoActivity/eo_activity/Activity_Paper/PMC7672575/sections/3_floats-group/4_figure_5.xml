  <p>The signaling pathways of MD-2/TLR4 axis that lead to stimulating the immune responses. Through binding to MD-2 hydrophobic pockets, viral proteins activate the MD-2/TLR4 signaling axis. This interaction enables two cytoplasmic signaling domains; MyD88 via Toll–IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP)/MyD88 adapter-like (Mal), and TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) via TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). The MyD88/TIRAP pathway uses the members of IL-1 receptor-associated kinases 1 and 6 (IRAK1/4), TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex to activate two transcription factors; nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), through the I kappa B kinase (IKK) complex, and activator protein-1 (AP-1), through the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK). Both NF-kB and AP-1 regulates gene expression in response to pathogen infections and controls cytokines expression. On the other side, the TRIF/TRAM pathway activates the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7, through TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), that is involved in the regulation of innate immune responses [
