  <p>Effects of the crude extract (ASL) on caspase activities in CCRF-CEM cells treated for 6 h. Caspase activity is expressed as percentage (%) compared to untreated cells. Shown are mean values ±SD of three independent experiments. Untreated cells were treated only with DMSO to a final concentration of 0.1%. (∗∗): values are significantly different to that of untreated control (P &lt; 0.05).</p>
