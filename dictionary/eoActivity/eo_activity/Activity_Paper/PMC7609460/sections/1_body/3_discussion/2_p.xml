<p id="p0100">Recalcitrant cancers are the major cause of treatment failures in cancer patients suffering from malignant diseases. Therefore, the use of resistant cell lines when searching for novel cytotoxic drugs is an interesting strategy. In the present study, several models of MDR cancer cell lines were used. They included a transfectant cell line harboring a mutation-activated EGFR gene (ΔEGFR), p53 knockout cell line, breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2/BCRP) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-transporter-overexpressing MDR-mediating-P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1/MDR1). The cross-resistance profile of CEM/ADR5000 cells to

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; that of the MDA-MB-231-
 <italic>BCRP</italic> has been shown towards doxorubicin, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone and topotecan [

 <italic>ΔEGFR</italic> glioblastoma cells to ASLb and were observed (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These data clearly indicate that these botanicals can be exploited in the fight against refractory tumors. More importantly, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values below 20 μg/mL were obtained with ASL against 6/9 tested cancer cells lines and with ASLc against 2/9 cancer cell lines (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In effect, the cutoff point for good botanicals has been set below 20 μg/mL upon 48 h or 72 h incubation by the National Cancer Institute USA (NCI) [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It can therefore be confirmed that the crude extract ASL, and in lesser extend fraction ASLc are interesting cytotoxic agents. These data also show that fractions ASLb and had better cytotoxic activity than ASLa, explaining why they were selected for further isolation of their bioactive constituents. The purification of ASLc afforded phytochemicals 
 <bold>1–5</bold> while that of ASLb led to 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold>. Unfortunately, none of these compounds had a good cytotoxic activity, as they generally displayed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values above 10 μM (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In effect, the cytotoxicity of phytochemicals is considered significant if the recorded IC
 <sub>50</sub> value is below 10 μM [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This might be indication that the good activity of the crude extract and in lesser extent that of the fractions ASLc and ASLb could be due the synergistic effects of their various constituents, rather than to the prominent inhibitory activity of individual compounds. It is important to note that several flavonoids such chrysoeriol-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (
 <bold>1</bold>), luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (
 <bold>2</bold>), chrysoeriol-7-
 <italic>O-β</italic>-

 <sub>D</sub>-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>4</bold>), luteolin-3′,4′-dimethoxylether-7-
 <italic>O-β</italic>-
 <sub>D</sub>-glucoside (
 <bold>5</bold>) and luteolin (
 <bold>6</bold>) were isolated from ASL. Their modes of action were not evaluated in the presenst study, in regards to their low or moderate activity towards the tested cancer cell lines. However, various flavone aglycones such artocarpesin gancaonin Q, 6-prenylapigenin or 6,8-diprenyleriodictyol have earlier been shown to induce apoptosis in CCRF-CEM, through caspase activation, MMP alteration or ROS production [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Luteolin has also been reported to induce apoptosis in SMMC-7721 human liver cancer cells [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and A375 human melanoma cells 
 <italic>via</italic> suppression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 through the PI3K/AKT pathway [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Chrysoeriol also had cytotoxic effects towards A549 human lung cancer cells 
 <italic>via</italic> activation of autophagy, sub-G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, cell migration and invasion inhibition, and modulation of MAPK/ERK signalling pathway [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Apigenin induced apoptosis and autophagy in HepG2 cells through inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is worth noting that sitosterol-3-
 <italic>O-β</italic>-
 <sub>D</sub>-glucoside (
 <bold>7</bold>) was not tested in the present study, because a previous work had documented its poor cytotoxicity towards the cancer cell lines tested herein, with all IC
 <sub>50</sub> values above 100 μM [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, only the crude extract, which had the best cytotoxic activity, was further selected for mechanistic studies. The cellular modes of action of ASL, including cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, caspases activation and ROS level evaluations, were determined towards the most sensitive CCRF-CEM leukemia cell line.
