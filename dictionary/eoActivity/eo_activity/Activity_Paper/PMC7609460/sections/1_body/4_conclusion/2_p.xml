<p id="p0110">The results of the present investigation demonstrate that 
 <italic>Acacia sieberiana</italic> is a good cytotoxic plant that can help to fight cancers, including MDR phenotypes. Its active constituents: chrysoeriol-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, luteolin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, chrysoeriol-7-

 <sub>D</sub>-glucopyranoside, apigenin-7-
 <italic>O-β</italic>-
 <sub>D</sub>-glucopyranoside, luteolin-3′,4′-dimethoxylether-7-
 <italic>O-β</italic>-
 <sub>D</sub>-glucoside, luteolin and sitosterol-3-
 <italic>O-β</italic>-
 <sub>D</sub>-glucoside may act synergically to contribute to the cytotoxicity of the plant. The crude extract induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells through increased ROS production. This extract should be further explored to develop a new drug to fight cancers.
