<p id="p0095">After treatment of CCRF-CEM cells with ASL or H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, increase of ROS level was observed as compared to cells treated with solvent control, DMSO (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Botanical ASL significantly enhanced the production of ROS in the range of 3.36% (3.36 μg/mL) to 26.9% (26.9 μg/mL). Treatment of the cells with the reference compound, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, increased the ROS levels to 94.30% at 50 μM, while ROS production in non-treated cells was 0.6%.
