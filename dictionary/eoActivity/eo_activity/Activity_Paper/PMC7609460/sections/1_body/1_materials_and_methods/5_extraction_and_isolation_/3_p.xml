<p id="p0035">For instance, ASLc (18.512 g) was fractionated with DIAION HP-20, using respectively H
 <sub>2</sub>O (100%), MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (1:1) and MeOH (100%). The MeOH sub-fraction (sub-fr; 7.64 g) was further chromatographed using the Flash cartridge (Isolera) with silica gel (63–200, 60 Å) eluted with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90:10:01 to 70:30:03). 115 new sub-fractions (frs) of 25 mL each were collected as follows: CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90:10:01): sub-frs 1 to 71; CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80:20:02): sub-frs 72 to 91; CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (70:30:03): sub-frs 92 to 115. They were further pooled into six sub-frs on the basis of their thin layer chromatography (TLC) profiles as follows: ASLc1 (sub-frs 1 to 21), ASLc2 (sub-frs 22 to 70), ASLc3 (sub-frs 71 to 83), ASLc4 (sub-frs 84 to 91), ASLc5 (sub-frs 92 to 108) and ASLc6 (sub-frs 109 to 115). Sub-fraction ASLc6 was further column chromatographed similarly to the methanol sub-fr above, eluting with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (70:30:03); 120 fractions (frs) of 20 mL each were collected as follows: CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (85: 15 : 1.5): frs 1 to 40; CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80 : 20: 02): frs 41 to 87; CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (70 : 30: 01): frs 88 to 120; Sub-fr eluted with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80:20:02) yielded compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (603 mg) whilst compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (27 mg) was obtained from the eluted with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (80:20:02). The mixture of sub-fractions 1 to 87 was eluted with CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90:10:01 to 80:20:02); 90 new sub-frs of 10 mL each were collected as follows: CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (90: 10: 01): frs 1 to 60; CHCl
 <sub>3</sub>:MeOH:H
 <sub>2</sub>O (85: 15 : 1.5): frs 61 to 90. This afforded compounds 
 <bold>3</bold> (14 mg; sub-frs 78 to 86), 
 <bold>4</bold> (8 mg; sub-frs 59 to 67), 
 <bold>5</bold> (11 mg; sub-frs 28 to 33) and 
 <bold>7</bold> (16 mg; sub-frs 14 to 22).
