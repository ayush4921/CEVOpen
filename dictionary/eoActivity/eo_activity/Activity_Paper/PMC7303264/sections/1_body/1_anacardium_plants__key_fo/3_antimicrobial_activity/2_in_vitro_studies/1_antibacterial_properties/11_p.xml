<p>Fresh and processed (bleached and irradiated) leaves extracts of 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> showed antibacterial effect. The minimum inhibitory doses capable of forming inhibition halos were 0.06 to 0.50 mg/disk, having an effect against 
 <italic>Brevibacillus brevis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus cohnii, E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with the best performance being obtained for the irradiated extract (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> leaf extract was investigated by Ayu et al. (
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>) against 
 <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, a bacterium responsible for gingivitis. Inhibition zones ranging from 4.47 to 8.05 mm were observed for the tested concentrations (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>,

 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>), and 96%) using agar diffusion method. The metronidazole control displayed a halo of 13.91 mm.
