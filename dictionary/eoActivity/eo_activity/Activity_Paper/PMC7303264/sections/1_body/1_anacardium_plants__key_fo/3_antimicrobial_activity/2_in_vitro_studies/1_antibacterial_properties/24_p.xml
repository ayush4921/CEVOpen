<p>Anacardic acid (2, 10, 50, and 250 μg/mL) extracted from the cashew bark oil (
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic>) inhibited 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm formation at 40, 76, 80, and 99.96% as the concentration increased. The acid also reduced 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> adherence to catheters by 20% at the lowest tested dose (

 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> stem bark methanolic extract and isolated compounds (Pinostrobin, Pinocembrin, and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde) presented inhibition zones, through disc diffusion, varying from 6.43 to 12.56 mm against 
 <italic>Salmonella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, with the best results being obtained using Pinocembrin. Chloramphenicol exhibited inhibition zones of 18.71 to 21.50 mm. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> varied from 62.5 to 500 (4,098 μM), with the best effect being obtained using the extract against all strains (
