<p>The purified 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> bark liquid was able to inhibit 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> growth (0.6%) and alter its morphology (0.4%). The activity of the purified cashew nut shell liquid was tested using the colony counting method, where an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.35% (v/v) was observed, presenting a bactericidal effect as well as cellular elongation suggesting bacterial cell division proteins may be a cashew nut shell liquid target (
