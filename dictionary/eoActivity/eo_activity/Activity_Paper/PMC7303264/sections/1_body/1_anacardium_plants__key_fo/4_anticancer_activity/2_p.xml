<p>Taiwo et al. (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) conducted a study with Nigerian 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> leaves in cultured HeLa cells. Four isolated compounds, zoapatanolide A, agathisflavone, anacardicin, and methyl gallate, were identified, and authors found that these components exhibited HeLa cell viability reduction in dose-dependent manner, although with distinct efficiencies: zoapatanolide A &gt; anacardicin &gt; agathisflavone &gt; methyl gallate. The cytotoxic potential of zoapatanolide A is well-documented in literature (
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>). This class of compounds act as Michael acceptor for the cysteines thiol groups, covalently modifying proteins (

 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>). Kubo et al. (
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>) found that the biflavonoid, agathisflavone, has antiproliferative activity against Jurkat cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.45 μM), although other compounds isolated from 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> juice have also revealed cytotoxic abilities, such as anacardicin, gallic acid, and other salicylic acid derivatives. The agathisflavone effect in several cancer cell lines (colon, lung, renal, breast, and ovarian cancer) was assessed, but only a marginal activity was stated, while to the methylated derivatives promissory effects were listed against these cancer cells (
 <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>) and even against chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 (
 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>). Later, the agathisflavone effect on leukemia cells growth was further studied by Konan et al. (
 <xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>); this compound induced lymphopenia 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and selectively triggered apoptosis. In addition, it was also stated that in Jurkat cells the antiproliferative ability of agathisflavone is more effective than on acute promyeloid leukemia (APL) cell line HL60, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.4 and 11.03 μg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, the identification by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) of the cashew nut shell liquid purified from Indian 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic>, revealed a chemical composition of cardanol, anacardic acid, and methyl cardol. It inhibited HeLa cells proliferation, triggered moderate mitotic block and HeLa cells apoptosis, besides to accelerate wound closure in L929 cells, without causing toxic effects on normal cells (
