<p>In another study by Barbosa-Filho et al. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), 
 <italic>A. microcarpum</italic> ethyl acetate fraction and methanolic fraction were tested in isolation or in combination with antibiotics (amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem) against 
 <italic>E. coli, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. All extracts revealed low antibacterial activity against multiresistant strains (MIC = 512 Î¼g/mL). However, the association of natural products with antibiotics presented a synergistic effect against the multiresistant 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain. Moreover, the extract and ethyl acetate fraction, in conjunction with amikacin and gentamicin, also demonstrated synergism with imipenem against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>.
