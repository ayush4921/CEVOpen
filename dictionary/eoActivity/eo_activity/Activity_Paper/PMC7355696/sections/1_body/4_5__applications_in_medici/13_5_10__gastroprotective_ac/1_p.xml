<p>In the model of ethanol-induced ulcers, a significant reduction in all analyzed parameters was observed when 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extract was applied [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The curative ratios were 49.31â€“74.31% for the groups treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extract. For indomethacin-induced ulcers, the percentages of ulcer inhibition were 50.32%, 66.24%, and 82.17% for the groups treated with 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic>. In both models, the marrubiin (25 mg/kg) produced a significant reduction in all parameters compared to the control group. There was also a significant increase in pH and mucus production in groups treated with 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> extracts and marrubiin. The results demonstrated that the gastroprotective effect induced by these extracts and marrubiin is related to the activity of NO and endogenous sulfhydryls, which are important gastroprotective factors.
