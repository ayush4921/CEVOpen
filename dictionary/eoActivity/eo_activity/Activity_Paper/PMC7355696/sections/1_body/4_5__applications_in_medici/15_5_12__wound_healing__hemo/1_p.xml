<p>The study of use of methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> in wound reparation demonstrated that this extract, which was rich in poliphenolic compounds (flavonoids and several phenylethanoid glycosides) and marrubiin (6.62%), showed antioxidant and wound-healing properties by promoting cell migration and the proliferation of fibrosis [
