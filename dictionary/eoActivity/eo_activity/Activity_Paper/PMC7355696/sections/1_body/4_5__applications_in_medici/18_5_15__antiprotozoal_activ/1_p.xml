 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> essential oil and extracts (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol) have potent antiprotozoal activity against 
 <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis</italic>. After 48 h of exposure, the essential oil with a minimal inhibitory concentration value of 291 μg/mL showed the highest antiprotozoal activity, followed by ethyl acetate (541 μg/mL), methanol (1000 μg/mL), and n-hexane (1500 μg/mL). According to the findings of this study, the compounds of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> have a significant effect on
