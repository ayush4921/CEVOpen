<p>The incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases increases in diabetes mellitus patients. Therefore, the effects of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> on the contractile reactivity of isolated aorta were analyzed in an experimental model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats after two months of oral administration of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The results showed that serum glucose levels increased significantly in diabetic rats, while this increase was not observed in animals treated with 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic>. In addition, 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic>-treated rats showed a lower concentration of KCl and noradrenaline in comparison to the control group. Based on these results, it was concluded that the oral administration of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> during 2 months could attenuate the contractile responsiveness of the vascular system, which may prevent the development of hypertension in diabetic rats.
