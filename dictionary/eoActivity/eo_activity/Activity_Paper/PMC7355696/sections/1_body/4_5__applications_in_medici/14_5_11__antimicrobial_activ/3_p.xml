 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> essential oil has a significant effect on microorganisms, especially Gram+ bacteria with inhibition zones and MIC values in the range of 6.6–25.2 mm and 1120–2600 μg/mL, respectively, whereas Gram– bacteria exhibited higher resistance. When it comes to antifungal activity, among the four strains tested, 
 <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> exhibited the strongest response to M. vulgare essential oil, with inhibition zones of 12.6 mm. However, 
 <italic>Fusarium solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium digitatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> were less sensitive to this essential oil [
