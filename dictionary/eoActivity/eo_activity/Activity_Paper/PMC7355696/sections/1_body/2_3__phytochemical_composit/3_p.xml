<p>Marrubiin attributes include a low turnover, high stability, and little catabolism, which are core characteristics required for therapeutic compounds and nutraceuticals of economic importance. It is responsible for the therapeutic properties such as antinociceptive, antioxidant, antigentoxic, cardioprotective, vasorelaxant, gastroprotective, antispasmodic, immunomodulating, antioedematogenic, analgesic, and antidiabetic properties. In addition, marrubiin is considered a potential substrate for potent active compounds, particularly marrubiinic acid and marrubenol. Furthermore, marrubiinic acid possesses antinociceptive activity, while marrubenol is vasorelaxant [
