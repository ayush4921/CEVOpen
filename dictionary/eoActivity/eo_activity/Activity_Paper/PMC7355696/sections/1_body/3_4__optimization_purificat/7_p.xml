<p>Optimal conditions for obtaining essential oil are a 3% mass ratio, extraction time of 180 min, powder particles with 0.1–0.63 mm in diameter, and an extraction temperature of 120 °C. A much higher yield of essential oil is obtained from the dry plant material of 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> than from the fresh plant. The proportion of water pretreatment is also relevant and affects the yield extraction [

The temperature, extraction time, particle size, ratio mass, and nature of solvent all have a positive influence on the yield of essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation and oleoresin produced by volatile solvent extraction. Miloudi et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] reported that the application of a Pulsed Electric Field, as a pretreatment step for the intensification of essential oil extraction, significantly improves the extraction rate by 2–3 times.
