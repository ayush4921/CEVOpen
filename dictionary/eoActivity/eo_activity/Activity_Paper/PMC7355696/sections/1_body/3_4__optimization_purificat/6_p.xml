<p>Bouterfas et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-02898" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] tried to optimize the extraction conditions of phenolics, flavonoids, and condensed tannins from 
 <italic>M. vulgare</italic> with water and various concentrations (20–80%) of methanol, ethanol, and acetone, as well as at various temperatures (20–60 °C) and extraction times (30–450 min). They concluded that the highest amount of phenolics (293.34 mg GAE/g DW) was obtained with 60% methanol solution at 25 °C for 180 min. The total flavonoids content was the highest (79.52 mg CE/g DW) with 80% methanol solution at 20 °C for 450 min, and condensed tannins (28.15 mg CE/g DW) with 60% acetone solutions at 50 °C and for 180 min.
