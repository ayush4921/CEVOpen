<p>In our previous study, we screened medicinal herbs that have been used to treat gastritis symptoms in the Korean medicinal literature, using a rat model of gastritis [

 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. During this screening process, the flowers of 
 <italic>Inula britannica</italic> L. (Inulae Flos) were shown to be effective herbs for gastroprotection. 
 <italic>I. britannica</italic>, also known as the British yellowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows in North America, Europe, and East Asia [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In East Asia, Inulae Flos has been traditionally used to treat epigastric fullness, upper abdominal discomfort, and burping, which are representative symptoms of gastric ulcers. Moreover, Inulae Flos has been used as a beverage, dietary supplement, and natural preservative [

 <italic>O</italic>-diacetylbritannilactone, 1-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylbritannilactone, neobritannilactone A, and neobritannilactone B) and flavonoids (e.g., luteolin, patuletin, and quercetin) and has been reported to have hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor effects [
