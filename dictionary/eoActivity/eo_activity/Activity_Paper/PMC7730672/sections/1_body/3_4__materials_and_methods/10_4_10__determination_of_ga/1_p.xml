<p>The gastric wall mucus content was measured by using the Alcian blue method. The glandular region of the stomach was rinsed with 0.25 M sucrose, immersed in 0.1% (

 <italic>v</italic>) Alcian blue solution for 2 h, and washed twice with 0.25 M sucrose for 15 min. The Alcian blue dye complexed with mucus was eluted by immersion in 15 mL of 0.5 M MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> solution for 2 h, with horizontal shaking every 30 min. Then, the solution was shaken with an equal volume of diethyl ether and left to stand for 10 min. The lower aqueous phase was collected, and the absorbance was measured at 605 nm, using a spectrophotometer (Epoch 2; BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).
