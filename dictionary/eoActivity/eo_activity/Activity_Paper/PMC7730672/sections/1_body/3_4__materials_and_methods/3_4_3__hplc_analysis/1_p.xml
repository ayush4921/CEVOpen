<p>The content of 1-O-acetylbritannilactone, the major active compound of Inulae Flos [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05623" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], was analyzed by using an Agilent 1220 Infinity HPLC system, including a G4281B binary pump, G4282B autosampler, and G4285B diode array detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A Sunfire C
 <sub>18</sub>-column (250 × 4.6 mm id, 5 µm particle size; Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was used at room temperature. The separation was performed by reverse-phase gradient elution, using a mobile phase of 0.1% phosphoric acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The linear gradient was as follows: 0–15 min, 20–20% B; 15–40 min, 20–70% B; 40–45 min, 70–70% B; 45–50 min, 70–20% B; and 50–55 min, 20–20% B. The content of 1-O-acetylbritannilactone in the sample was quantified by measuring the peak areas at 210 nm and comparing them with a standard compound.
