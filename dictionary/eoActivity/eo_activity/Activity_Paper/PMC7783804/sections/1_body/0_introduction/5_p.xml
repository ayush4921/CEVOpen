<p id="p0020">Plants which are found to be medicinally effective and frequently traditionally administered may include substances that are possible drug candidates. Therefore, they should be intensively reviewed. In different countries, scientific research of medicinal plants has been conducted due to their effective role to health care (

 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Aqil et al., 2006</xref>). The active compounds differ from plant to plant due to their biodiversity and they produce a definite physiological action on the human body (
