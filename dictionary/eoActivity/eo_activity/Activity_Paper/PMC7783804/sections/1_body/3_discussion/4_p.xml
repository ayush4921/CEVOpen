 <italic>Cuminum cyminum</italic> and 
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic>, which agree with findings of previous studies by (

 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, which were glycosides, flavonoid, tannins and saponin; a similar finding was reported by (

 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> all of alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids and tannins were found, this result is in agreement with the finding reported by 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al. (2011)</xref>. On the other hand, all of alkaloid, glycosides, flavonoid and saponin were found in 
 <italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic>, which is in agreement with findings by 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Beyazen et al. (2017)</xref>. Hence, the presence of all the six groups of secondary metabolites or the most of them in these five plants could explain why these plants are the most popular medicinal species used in Jeddah.
