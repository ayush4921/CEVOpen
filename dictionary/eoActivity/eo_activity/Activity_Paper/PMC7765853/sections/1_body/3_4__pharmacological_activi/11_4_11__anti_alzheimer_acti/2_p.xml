<p>The acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect of the EO obtained from 2 species of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L.: 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare subsp. vulgare</italic> (OVV) and 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum</italic> (OVH) harvested from Turkey was reported by Sarikurcku et al. The EOs showed a similar action both on AChE (1.57 for OVH and 1.64 mg GALAEs/g oil for OVV) and BChE inhibitory activities (1.74 for OVH and 1.75 mg GALAEs/g oil for OVV). The research team analyzed the oils by GC-FID and gas chromatography/mass spectrophotometry GC-MS techniques. Thus, the inhibitory properties of OVV may be explained by the great amount of thymol and carvacrol, while the inhibitory activity of OVH on AChE and BChE may be due to the high amount of linalool [
