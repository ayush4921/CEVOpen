<p>Only in recent years few promising approaches in the OEO use as pharmaceutical preparations have been reported. Mainly referring to dermal formulations, as topical application of OEO they were proven to be effective, generally safe and useful in various skin conditions. From our knowledge, nanocarriers of two categories, namely polymeric nanoparticles and lipid carriers including nano- and microemulsions, were proposed as drug delivery systems for OEO. OEO nanoencapsulation in such colloidal drug carriers is attractive because it allows to overcome the major disadvantage of OEO use, by decreasing its volatility, improving its stability and hydro solubility, and enhancing its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. </p>
