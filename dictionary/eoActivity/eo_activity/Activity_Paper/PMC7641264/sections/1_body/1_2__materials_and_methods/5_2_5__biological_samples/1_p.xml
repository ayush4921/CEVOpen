<p>Blood samples used for antisickling evaluation were collected from known sickle cell disease patients treated in Centre de Médecine Mixte et d'Anémie 
 <italic>SS</italic> in Kinshasa, DRC. None of the patients had been transfused recently with Hb AA blood. All antisickling experiments were conducted with freshly collected blood. In order to confirm their 
 <italic>SS</italic> nature, the aforementioned blood samples were first characterized by hemoglobin electrophoresis on cellulose acetate gel, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. They were found to be 
 <italic>SS</italic> blood and were then stored at ±4°C in a refrigerator. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients selected in the study. Ethical clearance for the use of sickle blood cells was strictly observed according to international rules.
