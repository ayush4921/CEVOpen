 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> represents morphological types of used plants. Shrub represents the most morphological types (34.8%) followed by tree (26.1%), subshrub (17.4%), and annual herb (8.7%). Vivace herb and perennial herb both represent 13%. Furthermore, 14 plant species, up to 23 representing 61% of species, are trees or shrubs. Only five plant species (21%) are herbs. Thus, a correct use of leaves of these plants can permit a sustainable exploitation of these species in traditional medicine.
