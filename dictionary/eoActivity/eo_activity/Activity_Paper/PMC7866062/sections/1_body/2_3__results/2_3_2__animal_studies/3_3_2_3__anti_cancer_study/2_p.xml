<p>The blood cells such as RBC, WBC, agranulocytes, and granulocytes count were found to be normal in control, cisplatin treated, and DoE treated group of animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00654-f006">Figure 6</xref>A) and the experiments were found to significant. There was a lowest count of blood cells in the group IV but when there was a steady increase in the dosage of DoE, the blood cells also reached the normal range. The antioxidants in the serum such as SOD, CAT, GPx, and GSH was similar in Group I, III, and VII; this exhibited the standard drug cisplatin and DoE has the similar therapeutic index (

The dose of 250 mg DoE has a good potential in the reduction of elevated oxidative stress and redox potentials, which could further aids in the normal cell functioning and apoptosis. Similarly, the antioxidants in the cervical tissues also found to be normal range in control, cisplatin and DoE treated animals (

The LPO was measured by the production of MDA as an important oxidant which damages the DNA; this MDA is formed as an end product of LPO when the ROS reacts with the PUFA. The LPO in serum and tissues was found to higher in group II whereas there was a significant decrease when animals treated with cisplatin and DoE in a dose-dependent manner (

The carcinogenic marker for the CEA and GGT for the control and treated groups were given in
