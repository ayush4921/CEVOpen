<p>The epicatechins and its derivatives have a significant role in treating the cervical cancer by minimizing the cell proliferation in several ways, such as (a) induction of cancerous cell cycle arrest; (b) modulating cancer cell growth; (c) depolymerization of cellular microtubules and inhibition of tubulin assembly; (d) arresting the angiogenesis in cancer cells; and (e) restriction of oncoproteins which has been induced by HPV and oxidative stresses [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The epicatechins family contains the properties in scavenging the free radicals produced during the mitochondrial oxidative stress efficiently [

 <xref rid="B58-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Several researchers has investigated the cervical cancer therapeutic properties of epicatechins and its derivatives on arresting the cells in G1 phase [

 <xref rid="B64-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]; inhibition of proteasomal activities in HeLa cell line; and suppression of mRNA, ERα and aromatase (protein expression) as a result, the cervical cancer cells enters the apoptotic stage [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The telomerase activity in the endocervical and ectocervical cancer cells in human was inhibited by the therapeutic drug EGCG [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Moreover, in cancer cells, there is a vital role of microtubules majorly in signaling process, proliferation, and metastasis (migration) processes in cervical cancer cells; therefore, the microtubule and tubulin are decisive targets for anti-cancer medicines/drugs. The investigation of Chakraborty et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] has studied inhibition of HeLa cells’ proliferation by the implementation of Epicatechins and its derivative and the proliferation of the cancer cells were formed through depolymerizing cellular microtubule and restraining tubulin assembly. Hence, the DoE of current investigation has explicated its maximized anti-cervical cancer activity which was like the epicatechins and its derivatives as stated in the foresaid research. The apoptosis on the HeLa cell lines was effectively implemented by the DoE; the further studies will be explored to determine the inhibition of proliferation in cancer cells and also to analyze the metabolic mechanisms between DoE and cancer cells.
