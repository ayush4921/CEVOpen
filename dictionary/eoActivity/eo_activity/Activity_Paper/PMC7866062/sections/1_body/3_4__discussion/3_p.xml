<p>Further the metabolite DoE was subjected to in vivo studies (animal models) in a sequential manner starting with the dosage fixing through acute toxicity analysis. Usually, any drug of 2 g/kg body weight of the animal is a lethal dose and in this investigation the animals survived at the 75% of maximum dosage level. The highest survival rate of the animals in this toxicity analysis was due to the DoE which is a polyphenol compound explicating the antioxidant properties. The catechins and epicatechins contains the properties such as antioxidants, anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, proapoptotic, anti-metastatic, and cell cycle perturbation [
