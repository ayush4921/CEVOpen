<p>With the results of anti-inflammatory responses, the cervical carcinoma analysis was assessed in BaP induced cancer Sprague Dawley rats. The cancer markers, antioxidants in serum and tissues, LPO in serum and tissues were found to be normal in DoE treated animals and the count were similar to the control group animals. Moreover, the DoE treated grouped results exhibited good survival rate and the hematological parameters were approximate with the blood count of standard drug: cisplatin treated animals. The endophytic fungal metabolites are very efficient in treating various types of cancer and there were several researches found various types of anti-tumor metabolites [

 <xref rid="B56-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] reported that the presence of catechins and epicatechins produced by the endophytic fungus 
 <italic>Diaporthe</italic> sp. had been transformed into dihydroxyflavan derivatives and the endophyte was isolated from the tea plant. Most of the catechins and epicatechin derivatives were extracted from the tea plants but with respect to this investigation, the catechins and epicatechins were present in 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> tree and this is the reason the endophyte isolated from this host tree produced the same metabolites [
