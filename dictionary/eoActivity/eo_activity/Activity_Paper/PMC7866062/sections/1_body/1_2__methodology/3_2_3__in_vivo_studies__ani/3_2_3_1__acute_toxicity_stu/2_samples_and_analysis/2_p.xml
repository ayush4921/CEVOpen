<p>Histopathological analysis reveals the pathological implications on tissues, and this was observed through microscopy. The tissues from various organs of healthy and dead animals were collected wither from biopsy or necropsy. Thin pieces of 3 to 5 mm thickness were sectioned, and the tissue(s) was kept in fixative (10% Formalin) for 24–48 h at room temperature. The section was deparaffinized using xylol for 5–10 min and excess xylol was removed by absolute alcohol. Then the section was cleaned and stained with hematoxylin for 3–4 min. The section was then counter stained with 0.5% eosin (15–30 s), excess stain was removed. The section was blotted, dehydrated in alcohol and cleared with xylol (15–30 s). It was then mounted on a Canada balsam or DPX Mountant. Further, the slide was kept dry and without air bubbles for future studies.</p>
