<p>For this study, the animals were segregated into seven groups with six animals/group female Sprague Dawley (SD). The experimental groups were assigned as: Group I: control (without any test samples or negative sample); Group II: BaP only (negative control); Group III: BaP + cisplastin (10 mg/kg of SD ratâ€™s body weight); Group IV: DoE (100 mg/kg) + BaP (10 mg/kg); Group V: DoE (150 mg/kg) + BaP (10 mg/kg); Group VI: DoE (200 mg/kg) + BaP (10 mg/kg); Group VII: DoE (250 mg/kg) + BaP (10 mg/kg). The cervical cancer was induced in SD rats using BaP [Benzo (a) pyrene] dissolved in corn oil. The SD rats are the best animal model for studying the anti-cancer evaluation especially for the investigation of reproductive tract cancers. The BaP was finely dissolved in 0.2% of corn oil and administered to SD rats orally and similarly the test samples were put into SD rats orally using specially designed needle; but the cisplastin alone was administered intravenously. The BaP was given to SD rats at an interval of 4 days for about 8 weeks; cisplastin was injected twice a week to Group II animals for a period of 8 weeks and the DoE samples were administered to experimental grouped animals at an interval of four days for a period of 8 weeks. After the stipulated weeks, two SD rats were randomly selected from each group, sacrificed and analyzed for histopathological studies only as described in previously. The hematological and biochemical parameters for each tested group were analyzed from the blood samples withdrawn from three animals selected randomly in each group (
