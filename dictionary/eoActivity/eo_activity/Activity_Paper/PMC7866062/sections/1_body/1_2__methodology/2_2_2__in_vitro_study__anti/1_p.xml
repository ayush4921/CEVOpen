<p>This analysis was executed by Hen’s Egg Test on Chorio Allantoic Membrane (HET- CAM), assessed to observe the inflammation/inhibition of tissue reactions by the BSM- DoE on the growing tissues and blood vessels [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-26-00654" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The shell and capsular membrane of 9th day embryonated egg was carefully removed, and the DoE of 200 µL concentration was dispensed on small discs in triplicates and those discs were carefully inserted into the Chorio Allantoic Membrane. The number of blood vessels were counted at initial and after the incubation period of 2 and 18 h; this confirms the inhibition of angiogenic process. The positive control and negative control used in this evaluation were 0.1 N NaOH and 0.9% NaCl.
