<p>Lectins belong to a unique group of proteins that can recognize and interact with various cell surface carbohydrates/glycoproteins. Mushroom lectins have shown specific immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, and antitumor activities [
 <xref rid="B163-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>]. The diverse sources of mushroom lectins have different immunomodulatory mechanisms: some mediate their actions by activating the immune system while others produce potent cytotoxic effects towards cells [
 <xref rid="B91-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. For example, two lectins extracted from 
 <italic>L. mongolica</italic> (syn.
 <italic>T. mongolicum</italic>), TML-1 and TML-2, show immunomodulatory and antitumor activities. These two lectins stimulate the production of nitrite and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and inhibit the growth of mouse lymphoblast-like (p815) mastocytoma cells by the production of macrophage-activating factors. These factors include interferon (IFN)-γ and other cytokines, activated through upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS), interleukin (IL)-1β, and transforming growth factor-β [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> lectin is reported as having a potent cytotoxic effect against HeLa cells in vitro, even at very low concentrations. A 15.9-kDa homodimeric, lactose-binding, ricin-B-like lectin (CNL) from 
 <italic>Clitocybe nebularis</italic> exhibited antiproliferative activity against human leukemic T cells [
 <xref rid="B78-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], which induces the maturation and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) and stimulates several proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α [
 <xref rid="B164-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. The encoding gene of CNL from 
 <italic>C. nebularis</italic> has been cloned and successfully expressed in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [
