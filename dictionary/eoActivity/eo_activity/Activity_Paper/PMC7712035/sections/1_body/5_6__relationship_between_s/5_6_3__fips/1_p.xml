<p>The fungal immunomodulatory proteins are a group of proteins with highly similar amino acid sequences. They exist as dimers in a dumbbell-shaped structure similar to that of the variable region of immunoglobulin heavy chains [

Through binding to Toll-like receptors (TLRs), FIPs stimulate antigen presenting cells and release cytokines such as NO and IL-12. By activating phosphorylation of p38/MAPK and increasing the production of NF-κB, FIPs can promote the proliferation and differentiation of helper T cells (Th0) to form Th1 cells and Th2 cells, activate macrophages and B cells, produce a variety of cell factors (

 <italic>Flammulina velutipes</italic> can upregulate the expression of intercellular adhesion molecules on the T cell surface by phosphorylation of p38/MAPK, and activate Th1 cells to produce IL-2, IFN-γ, to exert its immunomodulatory effect [

FIP-vvo can not only activate Th1 cells and enhance IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ transformations, but also induce Th2 cells to produce IL-4, B cell differentiation, and the transformation of immunoglobulin and production of antibody IgE. Several studies have also shown that by interacting with TLRs, FIP can activate other signaling pathways besides the p38/MAPK and NF-κ B. For example, FIP from 
 <italic>Ganoderma tsugae</italic> (FIP-gts) can stimulate human peripheral blood monocyte to produce IFN-γ and activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [
