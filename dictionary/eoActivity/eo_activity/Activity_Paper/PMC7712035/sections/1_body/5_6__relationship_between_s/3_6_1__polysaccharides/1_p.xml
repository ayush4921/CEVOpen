<p>Polysaccharides are the most commonly reported natural immunomodulators from mushrooms. The immunomodulating polysaccharides are highly diversified in their sugar compositions, main chain polymer structures, degrees of branching, conformations, molecular weights, and other physical properties, which together have significant effects on the bioactivity and mode of action of each polysaccharide [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These polysaccharides are either homoglycans (polysaccharides that contain residues of only one type of monosaccharide molecule) or heteroglycans (polysaccharides that contain residues of two or more types of monosaccharide molecules), and are able to combine with other molecules such as oligo- or poly-peptides to make peptidoglycan or polysaccharideâ€“protein complexes. In general, higher molecular weight polysaccharides exhibit greater bioactivity [
 <xref rid="B155-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. These large polysaccharides are not able to penetrate the immune cells, but instead act to bind cell receptors. For example, the highest immunomodulatory activity of PSK was associated with the highest molecular weight fraction of this compound, at &gt;200 kDa [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> extract was ascribed to one with a molecule weight of over 800 kDa [
