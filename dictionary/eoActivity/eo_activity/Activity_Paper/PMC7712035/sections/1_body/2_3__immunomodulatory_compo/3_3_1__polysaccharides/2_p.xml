<p>Other polysaccharide-based compounds showing immunomodulatory properties have a similar core polysaccharide chemical structure but contain different branching linkages and/or branches with different conjugates. These polysaccharide-conjugate complexes are called heteroglucans, with α(1–4)- and β(1–3) glycosidic linkages to protein components. For example, in the presence of fucose (a hexose deoxy sugar with the chemical formula C6H12O5), the turkey tail mushroom 
 <italic>Trametes versicolor</italic> produces a Krestin bound β-glucan polysaccharide K (PSK). PSK is commercially produced from this mushroom in Japan and has been approved for clinical use since 1977 [
