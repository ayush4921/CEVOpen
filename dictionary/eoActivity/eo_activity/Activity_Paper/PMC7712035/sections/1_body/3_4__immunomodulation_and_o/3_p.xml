<p>The significance of functional components from medicinal mushrooms has been shown not only from clinical perspectives but also from foods. Because many medicinal mushrooms are commercially cultivated for food, there has been an increasing trend of including mushrooms and their components into other foods to develop functional foods, including adding new flavors or promoting certain types of functions. For example, Ulziijargal et al. used mushroom mycelia of 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. blazei</italic>, 
 <italic>H. erinaceus</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. linteus</italic> to substitute 5% of wheat flour to make bread. The final product contains substantial amounts of the amino acids gaminobutyric acid (GABA) and ergothioneine and showed beneficial health effects [

 <italic>L. edodes</italic> paste, resulting in a higher quality, fibre-rich functional food with antioxidant and hypocholesterolemic properties [

 <italic>Pleurotus sajor-caju</italic> dry powder, 
 <italic>A. bisporus</italic> extracts, the freeze-dried powder from 
 <italic>A. aegerita</italic>, 
 <italic>Suillus luteus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Coprinopsis atramentaria</italic> have been used to develop snacks and cheese-related products with much commercial success [

 <xref rid="B146-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>,
 <xref rid="B147-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>,
 <xref rid="B148-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The benefits include increased proteins, minerals, crude fiber or ingredients with antioxidant potentials and free radical scavenging capacities. The diversified flavors and tastes as well as the enhanced nutritional values of food due to the addition of mushroom components represent an exciting direction for the edible and medicinal mushroom industries.
