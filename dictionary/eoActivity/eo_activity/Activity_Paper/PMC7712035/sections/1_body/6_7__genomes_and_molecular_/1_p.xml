<p>Due to their environmental, agricultural, commercial, and/or medical interests, the genomes of a number of medicinal mushrooms have been sequenced and annotated. 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00269-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> lists the genomic features of 12 representative medicinal mushrooms. These species differ in genome size and/or gene content. Analyses of these genomes have revealed some of the genes related to the synthesis and production of immunomodulatory compounds in medicinal mushrooms. Not surprisingly, the most commonly identified genes related to immunomodulatory effects are those coding for FIPs (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00269-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). However, in 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic>, genes involved in the synthesis of several other immunomodulators have also been identified. The identification and confirmation of those genes require genetic manipulation systems which are not available at present for most medicinal mushrooms. In 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic>, such a system is available.
