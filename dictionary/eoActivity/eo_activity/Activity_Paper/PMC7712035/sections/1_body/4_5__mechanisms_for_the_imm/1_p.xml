<p>The immune system consists of a network of cells, tissues and organs that work together to defend the body against attacks by “foreign” invaders [
 <xref rid="B2-jof-06-00269" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The network is connected by lymphatic vessels from organ to organ. The network includes protective barriers that constantly communicate with lymphatic fluid rich in white blood cells and leukocytes. When pathogens break our physical barriers (i.e., skin and mucosal membranes of the mouth, nose, the gastrointestinal tract, and the urogenital tract), the next line of the body’s defense response is activated. This line of defense includes granulocytes and monocytes that also function as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for helper T lymphocytes. These cells synthetize and secrete lipid mediators such as prostaglandins as well as cytokines which act as messengers in regulating immune response and stimulating adaptive immunity. For example, natural killer (NK) cells can recognize infected and abnormal cells, such as cancer cells and kill these cells by inducing them to undergo apoptosis or by producing cytokines, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). They also activate macrophages and kill phagocytosed microbes.
