<p>Some of these bioactive compounds can also directly attack cancer cells while showing immunoregulatory effects. For example, Li et al. reported that polysaccharide LRP-1 purified from 
 <italic>Leccinum rugosiceps</italic> inhibited the growth of human hepatoma cells HepG2 and human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells, and induced the secretion of NO, IL-6 and TNF-α in vitro [

 <italic>Sarcodon imbricatus</italic> (SIE) effectively inhibited the growth, migration, and invasion properties of breast cancer cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo, while showing increased expression of PD-L1 and increased NK cell viability [

 <italic>Pleurotus eryngii</italic> inhibited MCF-7 cell lines proliferation with an EC50 of 298.26 μg/mL, and significantly inhibited the growth of CD-1 tumors (inhibition rate of 65%) in mice in a dose-dependent manner without toxicity [
