<p>It is known that the AOA of plant extracts is due to phenolic compounds and especially to flavonoids in plant material. The 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>(M) and 
 <italic>S. galericulata</italic>(P) we studied, which are the richest in polyphenols and flavonoids (represented mainly by baicalin, scutellarin and wogonoside), show the highest ORAC-assay AOA, respectively. This assay is based on the transfer of a hydrogen atom from the antioxidant to the peroxide radical. HORAC-assay takes into account the chelating ability of the antioxidant and according to it the AOA of 
 <italic>S. albida</italic>(M) and 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>(B) is the most pronounced, probably due to the content of scutellarin and luteolin and chrysin, respectively. Baicalin, baicalein, and scutellarin are very strong antioxidants because the 6th position in nucleus A and 4â€™ in nucleus B, in their molecules, contain OH-groups that are thought to contribute most for radical scavenging ability. AOA of aqueous, methanolic and 70% and 96% ethanol extracts was determined by electrochemical method. The extracts obtained with 70% ethanol from all five samples contained the highest amount of biologically active substances and showed activity in the range from 7.9 to 10.1 AOA, again the highest being that of 
 <italic>S. altissima</italic>(M). However, methanol extracts of 
 <italic>S. albida</italic>(M), 
 <italic>S. galericulata</italic>(P) and 
 <italic>S. albida</italic>(A) have been shown to be more active. This is probably due to the presence of verbascoside, which is best extracted with methanol and has strong antioxidant properties [

 <italic>S. altissima</italic> and determined their AOA by ABTS, FRAP and LPO assays. The authors confirmed that the total polyphenolic content correlated with the AOA determined by the three methods [

 <italic>S. lateriflora</italic> in mouse brain tissue and demonstrate a significant effect [
