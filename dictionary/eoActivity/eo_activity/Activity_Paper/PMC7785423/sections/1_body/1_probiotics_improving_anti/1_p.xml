<p id="p0040">Oral probiotics are live bacteria that can improve gut health in homeostasis, and can exhibit antiviral effects [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] via the gut–lung axis [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Upon delivery, probiotics are understood to adjust the crosstalk between commensal microbes and the mucosal immune framework, and in this way alter the basal and induced inflammatory balance in response to viral infections [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Regarding upper respiratory tract disease, some probiotics have shown anti-viral protective and therapeutic effects, lessening the severity and extent of tissue damage from infection and inflammation [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Diminished plasma titres of Epstein–Barr virus and antibody titres against cytomegalovirus were observed in upper respiratory tract infections upon treatment with the lactic acid-producing bacterium 
 <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic>, by a mechanism dependent on Toll-like receptors [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Another probiotic bacterium, 
 <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> JCM 5805, was demonstrated to have antiviral activity against influenza virus infection and to activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells using Toll-like receptor 9 [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Treatment with the probiotic 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium lactis</italic> HN019 was reported to increase mononuclear leucocyte recruitment and elevate phagocytic and lytic activity [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The probiotic impact of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> has been shown against respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice by a significant reduction of viral titre in the lungs along with decreases in several pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokines, but increases in interferon types I and II [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Lactic acid-producing bacteria (LAB) have been used in probiotic settings via nasal and oral application, where modulation of cytokine profiles was associated with protection against respiratory syncytial virus [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and wider application for respiratory infections has been suggested [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A clinical report in neonates demonstrated that probiotic treatment in early life was associated with decreased rates of subsequent respiratory tract infections [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Up to this point, many clinical trials have investigated the potential impacts of probiotics on viral infections (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with some current trials exploring the effectiveness of probiotics in the context of COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
