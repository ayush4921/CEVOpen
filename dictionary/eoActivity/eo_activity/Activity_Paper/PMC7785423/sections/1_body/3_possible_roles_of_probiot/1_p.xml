<p id="p0060">Probiotics can produce direct antimicrobial effects via metabolites and antimicrobial peptides, including bacteriocins, which could potentially contribute beneficial effects against SARS-CoV-2 as a membranous envelope virus. A species of genus 
 <italic>Lactococcus</italic> is in a current clinical trial for probiotic activity against COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), and this genus includes LAB whose anti-viral effects may be due in part to secreted metabolites and an enormous number of bacteriocins [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], one class of antimicrobial peptides considered to be guard peptides [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Nisin is one of the most widely studied bacteriocins and has been approved for many years as an FDA endorsed food additive. Antimicrobial peptides that can be expressed by LAB appear to contribute to probiotic antiviral effects against influenza A virus and other respiratory viruses [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. From a different genus, the probiotic 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> strain was shown to produce an antiviral peptide, P18, which inhibited influenza infection both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Examples of probiotic lipopeptides include lipopeptide detergent-12, subtilisin, curvacin A, sakacin P and lactococcin Gb, which are well described extracellularly expressed products that may block the virus–cell fusion process or other steps of viral entry by mechanisms involving their amphiphilic nature [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. If such probiotic products were to have direct access to SARS-CoV-2 virions in the gut, or perhaps in the lungs through disease-induced dysbiosis, gut permeability, and dissemination, it can be hypothesized that direct antiviral effects may be possible.
