<p>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Î²</italic> genus of the Coronaviridae family. The SARS-CoV-2 virion consists of at least four (4) structural proteins: Spike (S) protein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). These proteins, along with other non-structural ones, have been identified as important drug targets (Dong et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), and have been widely investigated since the pandemic started. However, despite the efforts of the global community, only few treatments have shown positive outcomes in their clinical trials, with their worldwide accessibility remaining as a challenge.
