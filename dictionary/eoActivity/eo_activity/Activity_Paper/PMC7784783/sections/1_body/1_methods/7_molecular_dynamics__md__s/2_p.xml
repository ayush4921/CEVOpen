<p>MD simulations were performed on complexes of the selected ligands and dimers. Since these systems have a positive net charge, chlorides were added as counterions with Leap module to achieve electroneutrality. The neutralized complexes were immersed in a box of TIP3P waters which extended up to 15 from the complex. Dimers were described using the Amber14SB force field (Maier et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Ligand topologies were built using the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) with charges derived from RESP, which were calculated with Antechamber module and Gaussian03 (Frisch, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Leap and Antechamber (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) are included in the package AmberTools 19.0 (Case,
