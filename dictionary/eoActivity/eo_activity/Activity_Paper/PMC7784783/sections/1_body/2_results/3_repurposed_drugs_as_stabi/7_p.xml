<p>From this list, Ruxolitinib is already being tested in several clinical trials against COVID-19, and some results proving its effectiveness have been published (Koschmieder et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; La Rosée et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In our simulations, this molecule was able to stabilize 
 <bold>IF-1</bold> and 
 <bold>IF-2</bold>, with a TIE of −81 and −114 kcal/mol respectively. As can be observed in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, this last energy value is 12 kcal/mol more stable compared to P3/
 <bold>IF-MERS-CoV</bold>, the active ligand in MERS-CoV. Although it is believed that this molecule’s effectiveness relays on JAK inhibition, our results suggest that part of its potency may be explained by this other mechanism of action. Another molecule included in this list that is also in clinical trials against COVID-19 is Quercetin, with results still pending (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04377789).
