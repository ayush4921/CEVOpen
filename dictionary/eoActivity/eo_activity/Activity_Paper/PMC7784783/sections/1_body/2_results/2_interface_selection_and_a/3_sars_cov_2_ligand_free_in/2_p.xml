<p>The stabilization of PPIs with small molecules is a challenging task that begins with the accurate selection of the interfaces that might be stabilized. A numerous amount of interfaces can be built with two monomers of the same protein, but not all of them are capable of being induced by small molecules. As mentioned in the methodology section, three interfaces were built relaying on experimental information: 
 <bold>IF-1</bold> and 
 <bold>IF-2</bold>, which were reported in a non-native tetramer crystal structure including a Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> cation, and 
 <bold>IF-3</bold>, which was built by homology modelling of the previously analyzed MERS-CoV interface.
