<p>Our previous docking results showed that most of the molecules with the lowest score were polyphenols, in particular flavonoids (Table S1). Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations and energy calculations showed that all of these molecules were able to stabilize at least two interfaces. This is particularly interesting since polyphenolic compounds are phytochemicals widely spread throughout plants and fruits, and are known to have medicinal and chemopreventive activities, for example they are good natural antioxidants. Moreover, the flavonoid skeleton has been reported as a privileged substructure for PPIs modulation (Bosc et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study has reported that some polyphenols inhibit nucleocapsid phosphoproteinâ€™s function in SARS-CoV (Roh, 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), which has a 90.52% of identity with SARS-CoV-2 analog (Figure S2). In this work, Roh compares the binding affinity of an engineered RNA oligonucleotide with several polyphenols that block its interaction with the protein, and therefore inhibit its functionality. Even though many of these molecules are considered PAINS due to their catechol substructure and are usually excluded in virtual screening, we believe that these mentioned literature together with the high availability of these compounds in nature makes them relevant to further study their potential applications in the present context. Consequently, a polyphenol-specific database was added to further study this possibility.
