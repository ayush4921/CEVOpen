<p>Once the interfaces were selected and the pockets generated, molecular docking calculations with both investigational and approved DrugBank’s databases on all the interfaces were performed. At first, the high mobility of these systems seemed incompatible with the rigid nature of standard docking calculations. To address this situation, the compounds were ranked according to a 
 <italic>consensus</italic> docking score (CDS), constructed from the relative docking position of each compound in each interface. Another important issue was that each system was being considered as equally probable to be induced, which was not necessarily true. Since RNA assembly is the main function of this protein, a good strategy to solve this problem would be to prioritize those ligands capable to interact with the residues involved in this process, which had already been described in literature (Kang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). With this in mind, a fourth system centered on those residues was added to the previous 
 <italic>consensus</italic> docking score ranking (Table S1, Column “Score RNA and Pos. RNA”).
