<p>Molecular dynamics simulations were in line with our previous calculations, since all catechins tested stabilized at least two interfaces (see Table S9). However, this was not the case for Gallic acid 3-O-gallate, which left the binding site in 
 <bold>IF-2</bold> and 
 <bold>IF-3</bold>. This result highlights the importance of the common catechin heterocyclic motif for this type of stabilization.
