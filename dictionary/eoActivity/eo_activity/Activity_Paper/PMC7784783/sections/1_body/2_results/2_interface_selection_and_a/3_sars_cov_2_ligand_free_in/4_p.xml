<p>Per-residue energy decomposition for these interfaces showed that, when comparing the two stable systems with the unstable ones, the first ones present a higher number of strong interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). In the case of 
 <bold>IF-1</bold> three important pair interactions can be observed, these are B:Asp101/A:Lys196, B:Asp38/A:Lys263 and B:Thr33 with A:Ser270 and A:Gly272. The contribution to the stability provided by these residues should be considered in future drug design, since their blockage may act against dimer stabilization.
