<p>Energy decomposition is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. In these graphics, the most important ligand/residue interactions for each interface can be easily observed. Ligands with the strongest ligand/dimer interactions can be visualized in Figures S6-13. A possible strategy to analyze these results in 
 <bold>IF-1</bold> and 
 <bold>IF-2</bold> is to focus on those residues that are known to interact with RNA (Kang et al.,
