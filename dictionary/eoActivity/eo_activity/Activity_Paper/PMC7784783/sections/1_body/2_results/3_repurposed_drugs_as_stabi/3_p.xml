<p>Rational manual selection of the best candidates was made. For this task, the best approved ligands were given priority over the investigational ones, and those compounds that had a top score in any of the interfaces were also considered, even if their 
 <italic>consensus</italic> ranking was not the best. With this strategy, 13 initial compounds were selected (Table S1) for molecular dynamics.
