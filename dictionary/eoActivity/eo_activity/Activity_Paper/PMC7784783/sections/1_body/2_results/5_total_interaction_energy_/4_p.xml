<p>Some stable complexes where the monomer/monomer interaction term was significantly stronger when compared with the isolated dimer were observed in the case of 
 <bold>IF-2</bold>. Per-residue decomposition showed that many new interaction pairs were induced when a ligand was present (Figure S5), contributing for the complex stability. Even though few patterns can be observed between the ligands, most interactions involve Arg177 (chain B) and Asn76 (chain C) or residues close to them. These results suggest that the ligandâ€™s ability to induce strong interactions between the interface-forming residues is an important aspect to take into account when aiming for PPIs stabilization.
