<p>These simulations showed that several compounds were able to effectively stabilize one or more of the studied interfaces (see Table S9, and Figure S3). Moreover, we observed that those compounds selected because of their higher CDS behaved better as stabilizers rather than the ones selected because of their good performance in only one of the interfaces. However, we noticed that positively charged ligands were not able to stabilize any of the interfaces, which is in accordance with the highly positive charge of both monomers reported in the literature (Kang et al.,
