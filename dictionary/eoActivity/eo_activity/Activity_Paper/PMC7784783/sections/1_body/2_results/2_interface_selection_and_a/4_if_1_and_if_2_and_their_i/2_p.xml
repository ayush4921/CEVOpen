<p>With the intention of understanding the role played by Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> cation in the crystal structure, it was incorporated to 
 <bold>IF-1</bold> and 
 <bold>IF-2</bold> dimers. Molecular dynamics simulations and TIE calculations showed that this cation is able to stabilize both 
 <bold>IF-1</bold> and 
 <bold>IF-2</bold> dimers (see 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), verifying that these two interfaces can be effectively induced. This discovery might contribute to the understanding of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> potential therapeutic action against COVID-19, since it has aroused interest during the pandemic due to its medicinal properties (Derwand &amp; Scholz, 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) and has been proposed in many clinical trials.
