<p>The skin represents the largest organ of the body and consists in 3 layers: epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05557-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Epidermis is the outer most layer of the skin and is stratified in 5 layers such as: (1) 
 <italic>stratum basale</italic>, the deepest layer of epidermis that contains melanocytes, (2) 
 <italic>stratum spinosum</italic> or squamous cell layer, (3) 
 <italic>stratum granulosum</italic> that contains keratohyalin granules and keratin precursors, (4) 
 <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>, and (5) 
 <italic>stratum corneum</italic>, the uppermost layer that contains anucleate keratinocytes, also known as corneocytes, mostly made up by keratin, and acts as a barrier against external factors and water loss [

The epidermis cells include (i) keratinocytes, able to produce keratin and to act as epidermal water barrier, (ii) melanocytes that secrete melanin, the skin’s pigment which act as protective shield against UV radiation, (iii) Langerhans’ cells, providing the first line defense, and (iv) Merkel’s cells, possessing sensory functions [

Dermis consists in 2 layers, the papillary layer, formed by loose connective tissue with small diameter collagen fibres and the reticular layer, formed by more dense connective tissue with large diameter collagen fibers, mostly type I collagen, accompanied by type III collagen in a lesser extent [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Fibroblasts are the main components of dermis, responsible for collagen fiber and elastin production, accompanied by proteoglycans and skin appendages such as sweat glands, hair follicles, muscles, sensory neurons, and blood vessels [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hypodermis or the subcutaneous fascia is formed by adipocytes arranged in lobules and is located between the dermis and the muscles; it serves as a shield for the internal organs against trauma or cold and participates in energy production [
