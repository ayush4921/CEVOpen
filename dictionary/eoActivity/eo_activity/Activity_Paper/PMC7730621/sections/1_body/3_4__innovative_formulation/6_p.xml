<p>Nanoliposomes are vesicular nanosystems exhibiting high flexibility, stability and biocompatibility and can therefore be used as dermal delivery carriers with increased drug concentrations delivered into the skin levels as well as longer retention times and efficacy compared to the free drug, traditional liposomes or even ethosomes [

 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], was formulated as nanoliposomes by a double-emulsion method in order to enhance its transdermal and wound healing effects; the biological effects were clearly superior to those reported for film dispersion liposomes designed by the same research group [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] in terms of leakage rate, stability, absorption and penetration into the skin and encapsulation efficiency. Therefore, madecassoside nanoliposomes stand as promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of a wide range of skin injuries including surgical, ulcers and burns [
