<p>FÃ¤rber et al. comparatively assessed oleogels, water-in-oil emulsions and water-in-oil foams containing birch bark triterpenes in terms of their permeation flux, by quantifying betulin permeation through porcine skin; experimental data showed that similar results were obtained from all samples, thus indicating that foams can be successfully used in wound healing [

The advantage of foams lies in the fact that, unlike oleogel application which can cause physical stress and pain, foams allow almost touchless application thus leading to a better patient compliance. Nanoemulsions have become frequently used as carriers for the skin delivery of active drugs due to their particle sizes which increase the contact surface area thus exhibiting higher efficacy, safety, permeability and bioavailability compared to other topical formulations [

Mixtures of natural or synthetic pentacyclic triterpenes, respectively, were formulated as nanoemulsion by using various ratios of surfactant/co-surfactant mixture and assessed in terms of anti-inflammatory activity by means of Draize test on rabbits; the study revealed a high amount of active compounds retained to the skin level and thus available for local effect as well as strong anti-inflammatory activity and the lack of toxic and/or irritative reactions [
