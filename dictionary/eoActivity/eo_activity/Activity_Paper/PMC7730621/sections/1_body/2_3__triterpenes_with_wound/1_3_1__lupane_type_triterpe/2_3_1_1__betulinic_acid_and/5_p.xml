<p>Ebeling et al. conducted a complex study, in vitro on human keratinocytes and ex-vivo on pig ear, in order to establish the wound healing effect of birch bark extract compared to individual isolated triterpenes (betulin, betulinic acid, lupeol, oleanolic acid and erythrodiol) [

For the porcine excision wound healing model, an oleogel containing 10% birch bark extract and 90% sunflower oil was used; after 48 h, a faster reepithelization process occurred. The same 10 µg/mL extract was dissolved in PBS and applied in the same wound model resulting in a similar effect evaluated after 48 h and consisting in the acceleration in wound healing as compared to the plain PBS. In addition, the same concentration of betulin found in the extract (8.69 µg/mL) was also applied to the wound, but the effect was lower compared to the extract, thus supporting the conclusion that the other associated extract components significantly contributed to the recorded result. Betulin and birch bark extract promoted the formation of the skin barrier, also a very important phase in the complex process of skin restoration [

When applied on human keratinocytes, the effects of betulin as well as the corresponding extract influenced the inflammatory stage by increasing COX-2 (cyclooxygenase-2), IL-6 (Interleukin 6) and IL-8 (Interleukin 8) levels. Also, the birch bark extract, lupeol, betulin and erythrodiol affect the actin cytoskeleton by stimulating the actin filopodia, stress fibers and lamellipodia formation, dependent on Rho GTPases activation [
