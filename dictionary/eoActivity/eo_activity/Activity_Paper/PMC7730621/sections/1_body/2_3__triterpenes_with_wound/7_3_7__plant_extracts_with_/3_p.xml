 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> extracts are mainly composed of several triterpenes whose beneficial effect in the treatment of wounds of various etiology is well known, the plant being used in medicinal and nutraceutical products [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. A series of vegetal extracts were prepared by using sequential hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water as extraction solvents; the extracts were applied topically, once daily, on incision and partial-thickness burn wound models in rats [
 <xref rid="B139-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. All extracts significantly improved the tensile strength of incision wounds and the epithelialization and keratinization of burn injuries; the ethyl acetate extract, containing mainly asiatic acid, exhibited the strongest healing activity. 
 <italic>Antrodia cinnamomea</italic> is a mushroom used for medicinal purposes due to its antitumor, immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory activities; phytochemical studies revealed the presence of polysaccharides, proteins, fatty acids, and phenyl derivatives but mostly triterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B140-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Various concentrations of triterpene ethanolic extract was orally administered to streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic mice; the assessed parameters such as weight gain, volume of drinking water, liver and spleen weight revealed a positive regulation of metabolic abnormalities. By reducing hyperglycemia, the triterpenes extract was able to modulate the inflammatory response at the wound site and promote wound recovery.
