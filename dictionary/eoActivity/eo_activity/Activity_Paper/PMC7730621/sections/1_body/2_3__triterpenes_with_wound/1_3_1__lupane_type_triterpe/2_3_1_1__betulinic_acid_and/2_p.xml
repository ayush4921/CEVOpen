 <italic>Dillenia indica</italic> fruit extracts standardized in betulinic acid were tested in vitro on egg yolk (lipid peroxidation test) and in vivo on male albino Wistar rats, with ultraviolet induced psoriasis-like wounds [

 <italic>D. indica</italic> extracts can provide a substantial protection against lipid peroxidation, while a significant speed-up healing process was observed on induced wounds of rat tail, when extracts with 50 mg/mL concentration in betulinic acid were used. As revealed by the histological examination, 
 <italic>D. indica</italic> extracts produced a diminished immune cell infiltration in the granulation tissue and also limited para-keratosis. Moreover, the tested extracts exhibited an important anti-inflammatory effect and presented accelerated wound healing properties on psoriasis-like wounds [

 <italic>Diospyros kaki</italic> was investigated for the anti-inflammatory effects in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages [

Macrophages play an important role in the inflammatory process, being part of the formation of pro-inflammatory facilitators; the study pointed out that betulinic acid determined HO-1/Nrf2 translocation by suppressing the NF-κB pathway. The suppressing effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 as well as the inhibition of COX-2 and iNOS determined by ELISA assays were dose-dependent, confirming yet again the anti-inflammatory effect of betulinic acid [

In perspective, a more thorough understanding of the role that betulinic acid has in wound healing should come from the exploration of its effect on macrophage polarization, as the transition of local macrophage populations from a predominantly pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1) to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) is crucial to an effective wound closure Furthermore, Wang et al. noted that betulinic acid mitigated the myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury by oxidative stress inhibition and cell apoptosis due to the inhibition of JNK phosphorylation, p38 by Nrf2 and HO-1activation [
