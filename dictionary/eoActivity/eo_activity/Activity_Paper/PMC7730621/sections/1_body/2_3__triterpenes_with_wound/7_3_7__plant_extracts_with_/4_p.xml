<p>Licorice, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> L., which contains triterpene saponins, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, chalcones and glycyrrhizic acid, displays a large plethora of biological effects; the hydroalcoholic extract and its cream formulation were tested on full thickness wounds in guinea pigs revealing an increase in epidermal formation, collagen deposition and angiogenesis as well as a decrease in acute inflammation thus improving the wound healing rate in a dose-dependent manner [

 <italic>Rubia cordifolia</italic> L. contains mainly antraquinones combined with flavonoids, polyphenols, saponins and triterpenoids (including pentacyclic triterpenes); it has long been used in the Ayurvedic medicine [
 <xref rid="B142-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The ethanolic extract and its formulation as hydrogel were tested on excision wounds in mice; the histological evaluation highlighted a significant infiltration of the inflammatory cells, enhanced angiogenesis and cell proliferation, resulting in wound healing effects and a shortened inflammatory phase [

 <italic>Emblica officinalis</italic> (Euphorbiaceae) is an important plant in Ayurvedic medicine, containing mainly ascorbic acid, polypenols, flavonoids and tannins [
 <xref rid="B144-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]; two triterpenes were found in the plant roots: secofriedelanophyllemblicine (seco-friedelane type) and ursophyllemblicoside (ursane-derived saponin) [
 <xref rid="B145-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. The alcoholic extract of emblica fruits was tested in vivo on excision wounds and was found to increase cell proliferation and stimulate collagen synthesis at the wound site, presumably through an antioxidant mechanism [
 <xref rid="B146-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. The extract of 
 <italic>Jatropha curcas</italic> (Euphorbiaceae) stem bark was assessed in terms of wound healing effect on excision and incision wounds in rats by using standard silver sulfadiazine (0.01%) cream as reference. All monitored parameters—percentage of wound contraction, hydroxyproline content and tensile strength including histopathological studies—showed the significantly superior wound healing effect of the extract ointment compared to control [
