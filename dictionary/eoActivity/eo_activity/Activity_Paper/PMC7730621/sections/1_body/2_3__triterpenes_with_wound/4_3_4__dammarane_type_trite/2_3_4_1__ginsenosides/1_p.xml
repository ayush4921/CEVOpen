<p>The major representatives of the dammarane-type triterpene class are the ginsenosides. In terms of chemical structure, ginsenosides can be grouped into two classes: protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol glycosides. The main plant source of ginsenosides is ginseng, belonging to the 
 <italic>Panax</italic> genus. Ginsenosides are widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for their tonic effect, but also in traditional medicine for their numerous pharmacological effects such as immunostimulatory, antitumor and antihypertensive [

 <xref rid="B102-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Following the observation that ginsenosides increase cell proliferation in different healthy cell types, while inhibiting proliferation in tumor cell types [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], numerous studies have focused on their healing effect, trying to explain their mechanism of action. In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies performed on purified ginsenosides, but also on ginseng root extracts, have shown that they have a beneficial effect on skin lesions [

 <xref rid="B106-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Although there are numerous studies that highlight the repairing role of ginsenosides, the mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. In a study by Lee et al., the protective effect of some ginsenoside derivatives on HaCaT human keratinocyte cells exposed to UVB ratios was observed [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]; it has been shown that ginsenosides reduce cell death after exposure to UVB radiation. After treatment with ginsenosides and exposure to UVB radiation, it was reported that they prevent a decrease in Bcl-2 mRNA expression, concluding that ginsenosides have a protective effect on keratinocytes by maintaining a constant level of Bcl-2 [
 <xref rid="B104-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. In another in vitro study by Lee et al., on human dermal fibroblasts, results showed that ginsenosides obtained from a 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> root extract exert a healing effect by increasing type I collagen synthesis through the activation of the Smad pathway; the antioxidant effect of the extract also contributes to the healing process [
