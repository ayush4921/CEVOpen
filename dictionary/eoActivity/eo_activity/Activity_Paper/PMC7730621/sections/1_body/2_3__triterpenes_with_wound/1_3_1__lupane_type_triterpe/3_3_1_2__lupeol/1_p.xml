<p>Lupeol is a triterpene found in many edible fruits and vegetables and in various plant species, standing as a major constituent in medicinal herbs from the Fabaceae or Euphorbiaceae families with demonstrated anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, anticancer, and hepatoprotective effects [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Baserra et al. conducted an in vitro migration assay in order to assess the effect of lupeol on wound healing (proliferation, migration, cell contraction) and also to elaborate on a possible mechanism of action [

 <italic>Bowdichia virgilioides</italic> using a 95% alcohol solution as solvent, and then isolated using multiple purification steps; when lupeol was used in high concentrations, the cell proliferation decreased in fibroblasts and also in keratinocytes, without affecting cell viability. Also, the wound healing increased in keratinocytes and the contraction of dermal fibroblasts progressed in the collagen gel matrix [

Moreover, the level of p38 and Akt proteins, involved in cell apoptosis and tissue repair, was significantly increased while Tie-2, receptor of the vascular endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis, decreased in a dose-dependent manner; also, an increase of p-Tie-2 levels (the phosphorylated isoform) was recorded. Hence, the anti-inflammatory activity of lupeol could be explained by the suppression of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) expression in keratinocytes and the regulation of MMP-2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2) [

 <italic>Bowdichia virgilioides</italic>), conducted an in vivo study on rats aiming to evaluate the healing properties of lupeol in wounds generated after streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia on an excision wound model [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Lupeol was topically applied as cream on the wounds and the histopathological examination indicated an enhanced vascularization and proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of collagen fibers. The ELISA assay revealed an upregulation of the IL-10 levels (anti-inflammatory cytokines) and a downregulation of the IL-6 levels (pro-inflammatory cytokines). Moreover, an enhanced intensity of collagen III production, TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor beta 1) and FGF-2 (basic fibroblast growth factor) as well as a repression of NF-κB were reported. While this research provides important elements regarding the effects of lupeol on wound healing, additional research employing human models are needed. Significant differences—wound contraction in rats as compared to re-epithelization in humans—underline the importance of further studies in humans.
