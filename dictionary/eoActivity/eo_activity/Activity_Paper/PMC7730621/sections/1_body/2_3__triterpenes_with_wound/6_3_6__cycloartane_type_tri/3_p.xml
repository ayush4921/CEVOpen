<p>Due to its wound healing promoting activity, astragaloside IV, the major bioactive compound found in 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> (Umbelliferae), was formulated as hydrogel based on sodium alginate-gelatin thus achieving a sustained release at the wound site [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. When tested on the rat skin excision model, the hydrogel inflicted the significant improvement of collagen synthesis and skin tensile strength recovery through the activation of skin appendages regeneration and the increase of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) serum level; overall, a faster wound closure was reported compared to control. Similar results were reported by Chen et al. in 2012 on a skin excision wound model; in addition, anti-scar effects were recorded, presumably due to decreased levels of collagen I/III and a dose-dependent TGF-β1 secretion by fibroblasts [

The same research group prepared solid lipid nanoparticles loaded with astragaloside IV and embedded them into a carbomer hydrogel; the enriched hydrogel was tested in vitro and in vivo in terms of wound healing and anti-scar formation effects [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>], the study focusing in particular on the re-epithelization, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix remodeling processes. The nanoformulation exhibited a sustained release of the active compound, increased the wound closure rate and stimulated the angiogenesis and collagen regular organization, thus achieving promising results as wound healing and anti-scar agent.
