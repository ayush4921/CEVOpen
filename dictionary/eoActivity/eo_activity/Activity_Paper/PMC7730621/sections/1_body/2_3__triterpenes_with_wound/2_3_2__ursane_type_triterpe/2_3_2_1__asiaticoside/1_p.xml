<p>Asiaticoside, the major constituent of 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> extracts, has a glycosidic structure and is made up of the aglycone asiatic acid and three sugar moieties. Its presence in the plant is related to mutualistic interactions with fungal partners: the compound has been isolated from one of the plant’s endophytes, 
 <italic>Colletotrichum gloeosporioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and its content is enhanced by the fungus Piriformospora indica [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Asiaticoside has been intensely studied in the last decade due to its potential in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], its neuroprotective effect [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], as a possible novel drug in bone diseases [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], multiple sclerosis [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], allergies [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], cancer [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and other conditions. The cicatrizing effects of this triterpene have been studied for over six decades [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and its intervention in nearly all stages of wound healing have been demonstrated. The capacity of asiaticoside to increase the levels of several cytokines including monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and interleukin-1β is relevant for the inflammatory phase of wound healing, a phase which prepares the migration and division of cells involved in cicatrization [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Recently, the effects of asiaticoside on cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, IL-1β, VEGF) production has been evaluated in an experimental model of rat skin flaps. The increased levels of VEGF were determined through immunohistochemistry and correlated with the improved microcirculatory flow and viability of the skin flaps [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. VEGF stimulation is crucial for the formation of new blood vessels or angiogenesis during the proliferative phase, allowing the access of oxygen and nutrients to the fibroblasts. Increased VEGF expression by asiaticoside has also been demonstrated in the treatment of deep burn injury for coaxially electrospinning nanofibers loaded with this triterpene [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The efficacy of asiaticoside in wound healing was evaluated recently in association to a NO-generator on a diabetic wound model. The mechanism of action indicated the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and raised levels of expression for VEGF, CD34, iNOS and eNOS [
