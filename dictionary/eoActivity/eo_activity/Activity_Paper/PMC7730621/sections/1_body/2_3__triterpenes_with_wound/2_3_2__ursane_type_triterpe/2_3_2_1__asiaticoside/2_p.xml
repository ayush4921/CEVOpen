<p>During the proliferative phase, fibroblasts migrate into the wound and proliferate, then deposit ground substance and collagen. The effects of asiaticoside on events during this phase have been intensely researched [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]; the main effects are promotion of migration and proliferation of normal fibroblasts and stimulation of collagen biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Asiaticoside increases the synthesis of type I and III collagen [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]; the mechanism involves activation of the Smad pathway, with asiaticoside binding to Smad 2, Smad 3 and Smad 4. However, asiaticoside is also able to induce collagen synthesis by triggering the transforming growth factor beta receptor I (TβRI) kinase-independent Smad pathway [

An additional element in understanding the mechanism for enhanced collagen I synthesis by asiaticoside is offered by molecular docking experiments that identified a possible binding site of this triterpene at the hydrophobic groove of protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) [

In an in vivo experimental excision wound model, the application of an extract standardized to 2.4% asiaticoside could demonstrate a highly significant shortening of the epithelization period from 10.75 ± 0.50 days to 8.50 ± 0.58 days, after the application of a gel containing 2.5% extract. This observation was correlated with an increase in hydroxyproline content, induction of collagen synthesis, and several markers of wound healing in the histopathological examination: keratinization, fibroblastic proliferation, and neovascularization [

 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> triterpenes on cellular migration, a research on HaCaT keratinocytes could point out a pro-migratory effect, the stimulation of filopodia formation, and the upregulation of signaling pathways involved in wound healing: FAK, Akt, and MAPK [
