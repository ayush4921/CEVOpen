<p>Several other oleanane-derived triterpenes with activities relevant for wound healing have been isolated from plants: camellioside B is a major constituent of 
 <italic>Camellia japonica</italic> L. flower buds, able to enhance fibroblast proliferation and to inhibit melanogenesis in vitro [

 <italic>Bellisperennis</italic> L., a plant with cicatrizing effects from the Asteraceae family, have been shown to promote collagen synthesis in vitro; these derivatives include six types of perennisosides (I, II, VII, IX, XI and XVIII), asterbatanoside D, bernardioside B2, and two bellissaponins (BS5 and BS9) [

 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]; its flowers contain between 2–10% derivatives of oleanolic acid, divided in two families: 3-O-monoglucoside and 3-O-monoglucuronide derivatives [

 <xref rid="B96-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Marigold extracts act during the inflammatory phase by activating nuclear factor NF-κB transcription and triggering high levels of interleukin 8 in keratinocytes; while no pro-migratory effects were recorded, the inhibition of collagenase increased the collagen quantity) [
