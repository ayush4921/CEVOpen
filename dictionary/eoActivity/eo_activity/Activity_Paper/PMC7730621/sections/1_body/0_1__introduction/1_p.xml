<p>The skin is an effective barrier against all external factors including microorganisms, also providing other important physiological functions such as thermoregulation, fluid regulation, sensory detection and even vitamin synthesis [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Wounds can be classified by: (1) their onset, as acute or chronic, or (2) their etiology, as surgical incisions which provide minimal tissular destruction, and traumatic wounds such as abrasions, lacerations, contusions, open wounds as well as, thermal, physical and chemical burn wounds [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Wounds can be limited to superficial skin layers or go deeper and affect the blood vessels, nerves, muscles, ligaments, tendons and even bones in certain severe traumatic conditions. The skin has the ability to heal itself through a complex process but often local or systemic factors such as infection, alterations in blood supply of venous drainage, foreign body as well as diabetes, cancer, chemotherapy, vasculitis, obesity, anticoagulant treatment or immunosuppressive therapy interfere and delay wound healing [
