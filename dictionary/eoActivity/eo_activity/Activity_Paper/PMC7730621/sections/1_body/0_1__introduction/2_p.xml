<p>Consistent with WHO recommendations, the management of open wounds must eliminate any possibility of infection, because it may lead to chronic lesions of more severe outcomes, such as bone infection, necrosis or even death; thus in addition to all the procedures of wound cleaning, a course of systemic antibiotics such as penicillin G and/or metronidazole may be indicated [

Also, very often, various wound dressings are applied as standard procedure to promote wound healing, either passive dressings or active/interactive dressings such as alginate, hydrogels, hydrocolloids, semipermeable films, foams or antimicrobial dressings [

Furthermore, among the strategies involved in the management of wound healing, bioengineered skin is currently being used, either as autografts or allografts (epidermal, dermal or composite grafts), accompanied by some non-surgical procedures such as vacuum-assisted closure, intermittent pneumatic compression or hyperbaric oxygen; also, several drugs that produce vasodilation or blood thinning such as pentoxifylline, iloprost, calcium channel blockers and nitroglycerin can be recommended [

Future perspectives include the use of epidermal stem cells, previously demonstrated in preclinical studies as highly efficient for wound repair and currently undergoing several clinical trials with confirmed results; thus, tissue-engineered epidermal stem cells are considered a potential treatment for wound healing and repair [

Last but not least, ever since ancient times, medicinal plants and plant-based pharmaceutical formulations, rich in various types of bioactive phytocompounds, are important and widely used therapeutic options in the management of wound healing due to either their implication in accelerating the wound healing process or their antimicrobial activity and infection prevention [

 <italic>Aloe vera, Calendula officinalis, Camellia sinensis, Centella asiatica, Curcuma longa</italic> or 
 <italic>Panax ginseng</italic> are widely recognized as efficient and safe remedies for wound treatment [
