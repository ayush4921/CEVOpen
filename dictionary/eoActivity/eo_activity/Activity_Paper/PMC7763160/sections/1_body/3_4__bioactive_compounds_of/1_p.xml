<p>There is an array of evidence suggesting that LO is a potential source of antioxidant compounds. Hong et al. (2013) investigated quercitrin (62.9%) and afzelin (22.0%) in a 70% ethanolic extract of LO. Choi et al. (2013) isolated eight phenolic glycosides—tachioside, isotachioside, koaburaside, 2,6-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-1-O-beta-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, 4,6-dihydroxy-2-methoxyphenyl-1-O-beta-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, a mixture of erigeside C and salidroside, and 6-hydroxyphenyl)-1-O-beta-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside—from the stems of LO and investigated their anti-allergic inflammatory activities [

GC-MS analysis of the extract of LO bark detected α-cadinol (11.8%), hedycaryol (9.8%), α-eudesmol (9.7%), caryophyllene (6.4%), T-cadinol (6.2%), terpinolene (5.7%), eudesmol (5.1%), α-elemene (4.8%), cadinene (4.3%), elemene (4.0%), etc [

(1983) reported the major oil components of LO; myrcene (20.60%), α-humulene (21.45%), humulol (6.03%) and bornyl acetate (5.06%) in mesocarp; 5-dodecanolide (15.29%), lauric acid (8.74%), bornyl acetate (5.01%) and cis-4-dode-cenoic acid (4.07%) in seed; caryophyllene (7.37%), elemol (5.06%), and unidentified sesquiterpene oxidated compound (7.96%) in leaf [
