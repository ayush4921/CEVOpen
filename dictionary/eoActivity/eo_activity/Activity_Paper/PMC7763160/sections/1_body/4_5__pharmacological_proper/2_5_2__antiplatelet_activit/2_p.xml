<p>Secolincomolide A, a compound isolated from LO, showed platelet activity in collagen-induced platelet aggregation and serotonin secretion in platelets freshly isolated from a rabbit (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01765-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, Secolincomolide A effectively decreased the production of diacylglycerol, arachidonic acid, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). In an arterial thrombosis model, this compound also prolonged the bleeding time and reduced FeCl3-induced thrombus formation. In addition, Secolincomolide A inhibited the activation of the collagen receptor, glycoprotein VI (GPVI) and inhibited phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) p47, phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt). The researchers concluded that Secolincomolide A inhibits the GPVI-mediated signalling pathway and the COX-1-mediated arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism pathway [

Overall, both extracts and compounds isolated from LO have shown antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects in both in vitro and in vivo models through modulating different molecular pathways. Therefore, further elucidation of LO extracts and its components on different models of pulmonary thrombosis may provide potential drug candidates to treat such disorders.
