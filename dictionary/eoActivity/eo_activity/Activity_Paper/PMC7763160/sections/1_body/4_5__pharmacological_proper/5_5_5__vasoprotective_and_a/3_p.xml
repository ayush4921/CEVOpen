<p>The lignan (+)-episesamin, one of the active constituents of LO, has been reported to interfere with the TNF-α-induced activation of VSMC via diminishing activation of NF-ĸB, ERK1/2 and AKT and decreased activity of gelatinases. Activation of VSMC is the key event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. VSMC is triggered by TNF-α, which results in a mitogenic VSMC response. (+)-episesamin (1–10 μM) inhibits the activation of Akt, NF-ĸB and MMP-2/-9, thus inhibiting TNF-α-induced proliferation of human and murine VSMC. Moreover, (+)-episesamin reduced TNF-α- and H

Overall, the study showed that (+)-episesamin decreases VSMC activation, proliferation, and migration, and therefore contributes to the formation of atherogenesis. The strong antioxidant property of (+)-episesamin suggests that it has potential for the treatment of VSMC activation-associated vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and cardiovascular disorders.
