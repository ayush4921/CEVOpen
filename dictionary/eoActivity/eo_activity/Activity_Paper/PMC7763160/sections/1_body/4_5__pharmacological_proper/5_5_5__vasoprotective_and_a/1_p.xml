<p>An array of evidence suggests that in type II diabetes (T2DM), dysregulation of the angiotensin system contributes to impaired endothelial function. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor type I blockers have been used for a long time to prevent endothelial dysfunction in T2DM patients. Moreover, Ang II is a potent inducer of NADPH oxidase-derived vascular oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction [

LOSE improved the capacity of physical exercise and normalized the angiotensin system and metabolic parameters through improving endothelium-dependent relaxations and vascular oxidative stress. Further, treatment with LOSE (100 mg/kg/day by gavage for eight weeks) restored the vascular oxidative stress through increasing the expression of cyclooxygenases, NADPH oxidase, angiotensin II, angiotensin type 1 receptor, and peroxynitrite. Further, LOSE treatment significantly decreased the expression of endothelial NO synthase in db/db mice in comparison with the antidiabetic drug pioglitazone (30 mg/kg/day by gavage) [

Interestingly, in the LOSE-administrated group, lower blood glucose level, albuminâ€“creatinine ratio, and reduced body weight were observed. These results were due to the inhibition of purified ACE, COX-1, and COX-2. Overall, the study suggests that LOSE restores the angiotensin system and resets its metabolic parameters, therefore improving the physical performance of diabetic mice. Hence, LOSE is a potential vasoprotective agent that may be transformed into a therapeutic agent in future.
