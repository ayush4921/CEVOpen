 <italic>L. aggregata</italic> (LA) is widely used as a tea in China and Southeast Asian countries. Both ethanolic and water extract of different parts of 
 <italic>L. aggregate</italic> have been shown to possess antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Water and EtOH extract of 
 <italic>Lindera</italic> radix and the dried root of LA have been reported to decrease methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels and the expression levels of nuclear factor (NF-κB), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL-1β) in alcoholic liver injury. Further, the extract improved the histopathological status and decreased the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and MDA and NF-κB, TNF-α, and IL-1β in liver tissues [

 <sc>l</sc>-rhamnoside was detected in the extract and showed strong antioxidant capacities. Two alkaloids—linderaggredin C (3), (+)-
 <italic>N</italic>-methyllaurotetanine and (+)-isoboldine—isolated from the extract showed significant inhibition of superoxide anion generation in human neutrophils [

 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, linderanean, which is an active compound isolated from LA root, increased activation of the Nrf-2 pathway in INS-1 cells and protected it from streptozotocin-induced apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Five sesquiterpene lactones—lindera, galactone E, linderane, hydroxylindestenolide, and linderalactone—were isolated from the roots of LA and showed hepatoprotective activity against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative damage on HepG2 cells [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Quercetin, quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside were found in high concentrations in the LA leaves, demonstrating free radical scavenging activity and modulation of the Nrf-2 pathway [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01765" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Overall, most of the compounds identified in the extracts of LA were associated with a higher level of antioxidant activities in different assays; hence, LA could be a potential source of antioxidant compounds and should be further studied for its therapeutic possibilities.
