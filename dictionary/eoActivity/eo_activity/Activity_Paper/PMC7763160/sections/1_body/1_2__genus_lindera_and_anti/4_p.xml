 <italic>Moreover, LA</italic>, has long been used as a traditional medicine for rheumatic, cardiac and renal diseases in Japan and other countries. The water extract of its roots has been found to scavenge free radicals in a DPPH assay, and the leaf extract showed ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and superoxide anion scavenging activity as well as inhibition of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation [

 <sub>ATP</sub>) channels [

Lindenenyl acetate, a compound isolated from the MeOH extract of the roots of LA, was reported to possess strong neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced oxidative injury in hippocampal neuronal cells, most likely via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway-Nrf-2/ARE-dependent HO-1 expression. Further, lindenenyl acetate increased the expression of HO-1, accumulation of Nrf2 and increased the promoter activity of ARE in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells [
