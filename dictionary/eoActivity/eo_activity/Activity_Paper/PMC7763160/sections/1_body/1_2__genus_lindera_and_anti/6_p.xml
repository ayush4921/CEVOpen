 <italic>L. pulcherrima</italic> (Nees.) Benth. (LP), also termed an evergreen shrub, is distributed in temperate Himalayan regions, and is used as a medicinal plant. The leaves and bark are used as a spice for the remedy of cold, fever, and cough. In an in vitro study, the antioxidant activity of the essential oils of LP leaf was assessed by DPPH radical scavenging and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. The essential oils of LP leaf showed potent free radical scavenging activity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. In another study, two constituents—furanodienone and curzerenone—of the essential oils of LP leaf were investigated for free radical scavenging activity in a DPPH assay and inhibition of lipid peroxidation. These oil constituents showed the same inhibition of lipid peroxidation and free radical scavenging activity [
