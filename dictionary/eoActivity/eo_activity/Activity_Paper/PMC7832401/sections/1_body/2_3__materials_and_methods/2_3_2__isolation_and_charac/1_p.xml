<p>The fresh aerial parts of 
 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> (2.5 kg) were cut into pieces and macerated in about 2.0 L of a solution made of hexane, dichloromethane, and acetone (2:2:1) for 1 h under frequent swirling at room temperature. After filtration, the combined extracts were evaporated to yield ~13.0 g of total extract, which was subjected to silica gel column chromatography using a hexane/ethyl acetate (Hex/EtOAc) gradient of increasing polarity. The similar fractions were combined according to their thin-layer chromatography profiles to yield 16 main fractions labeled I to XVI.
