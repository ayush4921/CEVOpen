<p>Medicinal plants are fundamental components of research development in the pharmaceutical industry, whose pharmacological properties were first discovered through traditional medicine and ethnomedicinal studies [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. From the ethnomedicinal studies done so far, natural products have been the main source in the discovery and development of many drugs. These natural productsâ€™ functional groups and diversity have exhibited their impact on drug effectiveness, optimization, safety, and the ability to prevent infectious and chronic diseases from spreading. Ethnomedicinal plants generally have smaller adverse effects, cultural acceptability, and excellent compatibility with the human body [

 <xref rid="B4-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Among the different infectious diseases present in South Africa, the airborne disease tuberculosis (TB), present in the immune system of approximately two billion people [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], is the main cause of mortality and morbidity in the country. Most of the infected people have latent TB infection, which can easily develop into active TB when associated with diabetes, psoriasis, and human immunodeficiency virus [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the risk of severe TB infection in patients affected by any of the associated diseases is twice as high as the risk for the normal population to contract either disease [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, the frontline TB antibiotics, namely, rifampin, streptomycin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, cause painful and disagreeable side effects such as anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, orange/red-colored urine, skin itching, and peripheral neuropathy. Moreover, the ability of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) to readily mutate has led to the spreading of multidrug resistance (MDR) to the abovementioned five frontline antituberculosis drugs. This phenomenon has limited the use of these medicines to eradicate TB, thus leading to significant health problems as the level of MDR is growing every year [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hence, finding new or more efficient bioactive anti-TB agents with antimycobacterial and antioxidant effects is crucial. In the quest for new and effective medicines, scientists have been turning to medicines from natural resources as they are reported to have fewer side effects compared to chemically synthesized or clinical drugs [
