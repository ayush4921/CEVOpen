<p>The compounds (

 <xref rid="plants-10-00175-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Some of the isolated compounds, such as 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, and

 <bold>1</bold> and

 <bold>4</bold>, isolated from the study plant by Kubínová et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], showed moderate to poor activity against a α-glucosidase inhibitor. Compounds 
 <bold>1–4</bold> were found to possess cytotoxic activities against NCI-H460 (lung cancer), NCI-H460/R (lung cancer), MCR-5 (healthy lung), and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell lines. However, compounds 
 <bold>1–5</bold> were never evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against HaCaT cells, thus indicating their antipsoriatic potential. Compound 
 <bold>5</bold>, previously isolated from 
 <italic>P. cyanus</italic>, is an efficient antioxidant agent and is the only compound among the isolated ones which was assessed for its antioxidant activity [
