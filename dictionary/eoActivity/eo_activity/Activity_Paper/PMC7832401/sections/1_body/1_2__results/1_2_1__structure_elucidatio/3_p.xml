<p>The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> showed signals of five upfield methyl groups at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 1.55 (
 <italic>s</italic>, Me-20), 1.16 (
 <italic>s</italic>, Me-19), 0.92 (
 <italic>s</italic>, Me-18), 1.13 (
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 7.08 Hz, Me-17), and 1.11 (
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 7.08 Hz, Me-16), as well as the signal of a downfield methyl attached to a carbonyl group at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 1.98 (OCO
 <underline>C</underline>H
 <sub>3</sub>). Two signals of two deshielded protons attached to an oxygenated carbon were observed in the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum at δ
 <sub>H</sub> 4.24 (H-6β) and 5.60 (H-7α). Moreover, a cluster of protons signals between δ
 <sub>H</sub> 1.10 and 1.70 was observed (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00175-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> showed a similar 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR profile to compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, except for the low-field shift of H
 <sub>7</sub>α (from 4.53 ppm to 5.60 ppm), which indicated the link of an acetoxy group to this position. The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> showed 22 signals, which were classified according to DEPT-135 as six methyl groups, three methylene groups, four methane groups, and nine quaternary carbons, with six of them forming a quinonoidal structure (ring C), at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 137.0 (C-8), 150.1 (C-9), 183.3 (C-11), 151.2 (C-12), 124.3 (C-13), and 186.0 (C-14). Moreover, two oxygenated carbons at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 66.4 (C-6), and 69.0 (C-7) and an acetoxy group at δ
 <sub>C</sub> 21.0 (7-OCO
 <underline>C</underline>H
 <sub>3</sub>) and 170.1 (7-O
 <underline>C</underline>OCH
 <sub>3</sub>) were identified.
