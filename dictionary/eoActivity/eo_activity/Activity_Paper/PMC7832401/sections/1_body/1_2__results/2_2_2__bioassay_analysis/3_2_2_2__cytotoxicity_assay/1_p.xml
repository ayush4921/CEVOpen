<p>The isolated phytochemicals (compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>5</bold>) were tested for their cytotoxicity against HaCaT cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to assess their antipsoriatic potential. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>3</bold> showed that compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (109.38 µM) is more potent than compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> (173.15 µM) and 
 <bold>3</bold> (161.74 µM). These results corroborate with Matias et al. [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], who stated that the polarity and lipophilicity of the substituent at 7α position increase the cytotoxic effect of royleanone abietane diterpenoids. It was also observed that compound 
 <bold>3</bold> is more active than compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, which implies that the substituents at position 6 of royleanone-type abietanes can also affect the compound’s cytotoxic effect. González [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-10-00175" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] stated that aromatic abietane diterpenoids with catechol-containing molecules and a carbonyl group at C-7, as well as coleon-type abietanes with a diosphenol moiety in ring B, displayed significant cytotoxicity activity. This statement was corroborated by compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>, which were found to be the most active isolated compounds with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 98.49 µM and 79.77 µM, respectively.
