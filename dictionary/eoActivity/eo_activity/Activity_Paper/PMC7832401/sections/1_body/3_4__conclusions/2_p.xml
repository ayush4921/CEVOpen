<p>The antitubercular activity of compounds 
 <bold>1–5</bold> showed that the medium, in which the Mtb bacillus is cultured, affects the percentage inhibition of the compounds. Moreover, the 
 <italic>p</italic>-benzoquinone ring C in quinone compounds and the substituents at C-6 and C-7 in ring B considerably influence the antimycobacterial activities. Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is the only isolated compound to show activity against Mtb H
 <sub>37</sub>Rv in 7H9/ADC/Glu/Tw medium due to the acetate group at position 7α in ring B. Compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold> effectively inhibit Mtb H37Rv in the 7H9/CAS/Glu/Tx medium after 14 days, with MIC
 <sub>90</sub> values of 5.61 μM and 11.93 μM, respectively. Although not definitive, the differences in antimycobacterial activity in the two media can be instructive for medicinal chemistry teams, as well as during determinations of mechanism of action. Compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold> exhibited good cytotoxic activities against HaCaT cells, whereas compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>–
 <bold>3</bold> showed little cytotoxicity.
