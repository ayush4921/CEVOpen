<p>Antifungal activities (MICs) of 
 <bold>8 g</bold> and reference compounds (fluconazole and voriconazole) against our set of clinical 
 <italic>Candida</italic> strains are summarised in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Against CLSI quality control strains, MICs of 
 <bold>8 g</bold> were 0.125, 0.016 and 0.032 µg/mL for 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> ATCC6258, 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC22019 and 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> ATCC90018, respectively. This compound displayed high significant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against the most clinically important species tested especially against low-susceptible or resistant 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic>. Indeed, 
 <bold>8 g</bold> was always more potent than fluconazole and at least as potent as voriconazole. MIC
 <sub>90</sub>s against 
 <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> were as low as 0.25 and 0.125 µg/mL, respectively, while MIC
 <sub>90</sub>s of fluconazole were 64 and &gt; 64 µg/mL, respectively. MIC
 <sub>90</sub>s of voriconazole were 4 and 4 µg/mL, respectively. MIC
 <sub>90</sub>s against completely tested strains were 0.5, 64 and 1 µg/mL for 
 <bold>8 g</bold>, fluconazole and voriconazole, respectively.
