<p>Cytotoxicity evaluated on human fibroblast (MRC5) showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 35 µM for 
 <bold>8 g</bold> that is lower than for fluconazole or voriconazole (IC
 <sub>50 </sub>&gt;100 µM). Nevertheless, its cytoxicity occurred at concentration 280-time higher than geometric mean MIC against 
 <italic>Candida</italic> (while fluconazole and voriconazole toxicity index were &gt; 15 and &gt; 590, respectively).
