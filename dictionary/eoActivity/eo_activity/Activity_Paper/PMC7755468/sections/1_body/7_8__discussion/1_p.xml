<p>In this study, an attempt was made to analyze available information with on phytochemistry, ethnomedicinal uses, and biological activities of the medicinal herb, 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic>, and to explore the correlation between its ethnomedicinal uses with the related biological activities. This study was therefore aimed to scientifically analyze the potential of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> having many therapeutic indications, which appears to be applicable in curing diseases pertaining to most of the body systems. In agreement with the broader nature of the ethnomedicinal use of TI, treating a number of diseases rather than a specific disease, TI has shown to possess a range of different biological activities. Moreover, the fact that TI possesses a variety of biological activities which can interplay to relieve symptoms in a particular ailment makes TI as a remedy with a broader therapeutic value. For example, having activities of antibacterial and analgesic for treating an infection and having activities of antidiabetic, antioxidant, and antibacterial for treating diabetes can be shown. It is currently not clear whether all these activities could be mediated by TI by triggering the activation or inhibition of a biochemical pathway that would be common to all the body systems. It would be interesting, therefore, to investigate the mechanism of action of TI in depth to clearly understand its broader therapeutic indications. Although most of the biological activities have been scientifically proven, except for the antioxidant activity, the mechanism of action of other biological activities have not been scientifically explained in literature. Further research needs to be carried out to investigate the mechanisms of action of these biological activities to get a more clear understanding about the pharmacodynamics of TI.
