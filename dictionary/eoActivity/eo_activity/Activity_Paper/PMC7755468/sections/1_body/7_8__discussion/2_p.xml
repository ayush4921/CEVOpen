<p>Regarding the available literature on the phytochemistry of TI, it is clear that only a number of chemical compounds have been isolated so far from TI. Also, most of these chemicals have been studied for their antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory actions alone. These chemicals have not been investigated for multiple biological activities so far. Therefore, studies should also be focused in isolating biologically active chemicals from TI and carry out investigations to understand its mechanism of action responsible for multiple activities.</p>
