<p>TI consists of stinging hair/trichomes with sharp siliceous points which can be found on the whole plant. When the trichome is touched, the tip breaks triggering a basal pump mechanism which acts as a hypodermic syringe and release calcium oxalate and toxic peptides such as Shellsol [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. These toxins on physical contact cause severe itching, burning pain, and inflammation that may persist for few hours to few days. These proteins like any other proteins are denatured once dried, and therefore, the inflammatory symptoms are present mildly in the dried plant. Furthermore, the water solubility of calcium oxalate is 0.67 mg/L (20°C). Therefore, the plant decoctions which is the medicinal preparation used in traditional medicine does not contain the toxins which cause the inflammatory action.
