<p>Ethnomedicinal uses of TI for diseases concerning the respiratory system [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] such as asthma, cough, and bronchitis and integumentary system [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] such as skin diseases are caused by allergies or microbial activity which in turn stimulate inflammation and histamine release. Hence, anti-inflammatory [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], antihistamine [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and antimicrobial [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] actions can eliminate these diseases. To evaluate the antihistamine effect of TI, Yadav et al. [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] isolated the potent bioactive molecule, 5-hydroxy-1-methylpiperidin-2-one, from the methanol extract of TI leaves. At a dose of 12.5â€‰mg/kg, this compound showed muscle relaxant, bronchodilating, and antiallergic effects, as tested on histamine-induced muscle contraction in the ileum, bronchoconstriction in the bronchioles, and triple response in the skin of guinea pig. To relieve the asthmatic condition, ethnomedically, the root of TI and two other plants, taken in equal portions, is boiled with rice-washed water [
