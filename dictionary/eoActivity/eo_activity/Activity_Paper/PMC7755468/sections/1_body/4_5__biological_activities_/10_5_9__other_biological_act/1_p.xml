<p>An in vitro study on the antiarthritic activity of the TI leaf extract which has been investigated [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] showed the extracts having potent activity. Yadav et al. [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] shows antihistamine activity of 5-hydroxy-1-methylpiperidin-2-one (5-HMP) isolated from the TI leaf extract, which further found to be mediated through the formation of protein-ligand complex by binding to human serum albumin [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Also, a few in vivo studies have been performed to check antifertility activity [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], antiepileptic activity [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], antihistamine activity [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], hepatoprotective activity [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], and nephroprotective activity [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] using different extracts of different parts of TI plant. All these activities showed positive results for the used extract and for the given dose.
