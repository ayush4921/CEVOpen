<p>A number of controlled researches both in vitro and in vivo have been carried out to scientifically validate the ethnopharmacological properties of TI. Owing to the broader use of TI as an ethnomedicine in traditional medical practice, a larger number of investigations have devoted to scientifically evaluate its biological activities. Many of these studies have supported the value of TI in treating diseases pertaining to the major systems of the body and have further shown to possess a range of biological activities such as antibacterial/microbial activity, antidiabetic/hyperglycaemic activity, antioxidant activity, and anti-inflammatory activity. Since phytochemicals are responsible for these biological activities, simultaneous research carried out on phytochemical analysis of the whole part or parts of TI show that it is rich with phytochemicals, which agrees with its broader biological activities. The major phytochemical groups found to be present in different extracts of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic>, the whole plant or its parts, as at present, are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. These phytochemicals are distributed in different parts of the plant and are extractable with different solvent systems. Accordingly, the ethnomedicinal uses of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> also varies depending on the part of the plant involved. Further details into the biological activities of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic>, shown by different parts of the plant under different extraction methods, and the chemical compounds identified as the potential biologically active ingredient are discussed and summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.
