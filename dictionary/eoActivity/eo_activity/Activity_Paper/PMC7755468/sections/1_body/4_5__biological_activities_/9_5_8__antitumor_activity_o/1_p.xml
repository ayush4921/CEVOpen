<p>Hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of the aerial parts of TI were used on Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) bearing mice to investigate the antitumor effect. The extract proved to have antitumor activity at the tested doses [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Cytotoxic activity of aerial parts of TI was explored using MTT assay in an in vitro test which also showed potent antitumor activity [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Furthermore, the in vitro study performed on Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma-induced albino mice showed anticancer activity in the TI ethyl acetate extract [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>].
