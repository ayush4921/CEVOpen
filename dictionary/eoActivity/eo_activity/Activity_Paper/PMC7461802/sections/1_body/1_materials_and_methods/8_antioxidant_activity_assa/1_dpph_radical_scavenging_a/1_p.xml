<p>The DPPH radical scavenging activity of endophytic metabolite extracts was measured according to the method of 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Du et al. (2013)</xref>. 2.0 mL of different concentrations of the test sample (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1 mg/mL) which was added to a tube containing 2 mL of DPPH solution (0.05 mg/mL in ethanol). The reaction mixture was shaken well and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Then, absorbance was measured at 517 nm. In this study, distilled water (negative) and ascorbic acid (positive controls) were used and the absorbance at 517 nm was measured. The following formula is used to calculate DPPH free radical scavenging activity (
