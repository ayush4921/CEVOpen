<p>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed using our previously reported method (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2017b</xref>). Reaction mixtures contained 5 μL 10 × PCR buffer, 4 μL 2.5 mmol/L dNTPs, 1 μL 5 μmol/L forward primer, 1 μL 5 μmol/L reverse primer, 0.5 μL Taq enzyme, 1 μL Template DNA and was add ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O to 50 μL. The thermal cycling conditions were: denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 56°C for 30 s and an extension at 72°C for 50 s. At the end of the cycles, the reaction mixture was kept at 72°C for 7 min and then cooled to 4°C (
