<p>Ferric cyanide reducing power (FRAP) of the endophytic metabolite extracts was determined by the method of 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2012)</xref>. Reaction mixtures were prepared by adding 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6), 2.5 mL potassium ferricyanide (1%) and 2.5 mL varying concentrations (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1 mg/mL) of tested samples and incubating reaction mixtures at 50°C for 30 min, allowing to cool at room temperature (28°C), and adding 2.5 mL of 10% TCA (Trichloroacetic acid) to each reaction mixture, followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Five milliliter of the supernatant was added to 4 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of 1.0% FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> in a test tube, and the absorbance was measured at 700 nm after reacting at room temperature for 10 min. Ascorbic acid solution was used as a standard.
