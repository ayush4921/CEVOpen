<p>The 16S rDNA or 18S rRNA gene sequences were subjected to BLAST search against the GenBank database. The sequences determined and reference sequences downloaded from GenBank were aligned using multiple-sequence alignment software CLUSTAL X version 1.81. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the molecular evolutionary genetics analysis software MEGA 5.0 program.</p>
