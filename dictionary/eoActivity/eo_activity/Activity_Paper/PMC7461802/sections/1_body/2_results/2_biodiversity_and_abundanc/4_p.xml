<p>The relative ratio of bacteria to fungi composition at the order level is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Relative abundance analysis showed 26 orders of bacteria and 17 orders of fungi from each seed sample of

 <italic>sinensis</italic>. As demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, the dominant bacteria order with abundance larger than 1% (the main order with abundance larger than 1%) in the four biosamples was 
 <italic>norank_c__Cyanobacteria</italic> (65.45–90.4%), 
 <italic>Rickettsiales</italic> (0.47–17.45%),

 <italic>Rhodospirillales</italic>,
