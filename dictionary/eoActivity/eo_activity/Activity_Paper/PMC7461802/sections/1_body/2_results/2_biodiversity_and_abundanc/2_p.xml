<p>Using a 97% similarities sequence cutoff value, the valid sequences were further clustered into 152 OTU for bacteria and 83 OTU for fungi. Furthermore, a Community Diversity index, including Ace, Sobs and Chao, and a Community richness estimator, including Shannon and Simpson, were further analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). No significant differences between the Community Diversity index and Community richness estimator could be observed for bacteria and fungi, suggesting that the difference in the diversity of bacteria and fungi, in the

 <italic>sinensis</italic> seeds, is not obvious and that as previously reported, bacterial and fungal diversity in the rhizosphere around the plants are similar (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref> was almost the same (from 99.95 to 100.0%), which was consistent with the demonstration of the rarefaction curve (
