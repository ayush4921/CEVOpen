<p>This study also aimed to obtain isolates with high antimicrobial activity from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. We found that some sample of 190 crude extracts of endophytes from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> mostly displayed inhibitory activity against one or more of the five indicator bacteria. The primary screening results also showed that the mycelia extracts displayed higher antimicrobial activity than those of the filtrates. Furthermore, the MIC of four extracts (ZHLB-3 mycelium, ZWD-1 mycelium, YS-1-2 mycelium, and YH-12-1 mycelium) with high antimicrobial activity from the 190 endophytic metabolite extractions were determined, and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. As we can see, YH-12-1 mycelium exhibited good inhibitory activity against the five test strains, including 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus licheniformis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. In particular, the MIC value against 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> was 25 μg/mL, and MIC value against 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>licheniformis</italic> was 30 μg/mL. Compared with the MIC of ampicillin against 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> of 8 and 6 μg/mL, this strain showed very good potential for further research.
