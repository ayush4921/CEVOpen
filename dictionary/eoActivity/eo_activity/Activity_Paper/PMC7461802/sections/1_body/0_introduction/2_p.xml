<p>Although endophytes have been studied for a long time, they were found to be able to mimic the secondary metabolite repertoire of host plants only in the last two decades (

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Golinska et al., 2015</xref>). More importantly, many compounds with unique structures and highly biologically active secondary metabolites were isolated from endophytes. An increasing number of novel compounds are being isolated from endophytic fungi and actinomycetes, including alkaloids, peptides, steroids, terpenoids, quinones, flavonoids, aliphatic compounds, and phenols (
