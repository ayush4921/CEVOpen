<p>Endophytes, including endophytic bacteria and endophytic fungi, are microorganisms that asymptomatically live in different healthy tissues of plants during the whole or part of their lifetime (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Promputtha et al., 2005</xref>). Compared with the external dynamic environment of plants, a relatively stable environment can be obtained for microbial population adapted to endogenous life from the interior of the plant (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Siqueira et al., 2016</xref>). There are about 300,000 terrestrial host plant species distributed in temperate regions and tropical rain forests, each of which has one or more endophytes, and the biodiversity of these naturally occurring endophytes is very great (
