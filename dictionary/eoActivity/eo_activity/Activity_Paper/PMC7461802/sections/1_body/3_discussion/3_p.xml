<p>With 20 different media used, the results showed there are many endophytes in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>, which have abundant biodiversity. Furthermore, 226 representative strains were isolated and distributed in at least 13 genera belonging to 4 phyla. For endophytic fungi, the most frequent genera were 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp. The results also agreed with other previous reports that members of a variety of common fungal genera, such as 
 <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Penicillium</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp., are usually isolated from a variety of plants around the world (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Wȩżowicz et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, organ specificity of endophytes were observed (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Kusari et al., 2013</xref>). For example, in the present study, 
 <italic>Serratia</italic> sp. preferred to colonize the roots and 
 <italic>Pseudallescheria</italic> sp. inhabited only the leaf. However, 
 <italic>Brevibacillus</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Erwinia</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Enterobacter</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> sp. inhabited only the seed. Compared with the MiSeq sequencing method, a minority of endophytes were identified from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. This indicates that there are still some defects in the traditional approaches. Therefore, different cultivation methods, such as diffusion box cultivation 
 <italic>in situ</italic>, still need to be carried out in future.
