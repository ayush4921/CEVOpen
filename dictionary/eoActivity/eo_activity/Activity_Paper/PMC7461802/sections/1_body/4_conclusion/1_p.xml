<p>In the present study, with 20 different media, 226 endophytes were isolated from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> and identified based on morphological characteristics and molecular biology. This study was the first of its kind to study the diversity of endophytes in the seeds of medicinal plants. Compared with high-throughput sequencing, a minority of endophytes were isolated from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. Furthermore, results of bioactivity evaluation showed that JH-4 mycelia and YH-12-1 mycelia have good antioxidant and inhibitory activity. All of our results showed that endophytes were highly abundant in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>, and indicated that their metabolites are potential viable sources for exploring many novel active compounds. Further exploration of endophytic isolation methods to obtain as many microbial resources as possible is still necessary.
