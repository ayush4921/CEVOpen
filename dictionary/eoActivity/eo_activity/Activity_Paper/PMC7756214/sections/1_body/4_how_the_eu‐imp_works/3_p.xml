<p>The EU‚ÄêIMP has a proactive and a reactive component. The proactive component has the objectives of: (1) continuously scanning the horizon and monitoring various sources of information (eg, newly published data, communications from other RAs, signals from safety databases, and so on) on incidents impacting medicinal products, (2) reviewing their public health impact, and (3) recommending the necessary routine measures to remedy the situation.</p>
