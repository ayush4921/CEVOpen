 </xref> is a review procedure used to resolve issues such as concerns over the safety, or risk benefit balance of a medicine (or class of medicines). During a referral, the EMA, through its scientific committees and/or the CMDh, conducts a thorough scientific assessment on the issue and makes a recommendation on behalf of the EU. For most of referrals, the EC issues a decision to all MSs to reflect the measures to take to implement the recommendation.
