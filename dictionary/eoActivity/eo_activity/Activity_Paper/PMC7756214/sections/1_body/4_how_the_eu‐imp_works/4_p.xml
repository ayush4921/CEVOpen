<p>When a serious concern for a medicinal product with the potential of leading to major risks for public health is identified, the Incident Review Network (IRN) is involved within the shortest possible time. After reviewing the information available on a particular incident, the IRN Chair (or back‐up) takes the decision on whether an IRN is needed. This is normally the case when discussion within the Network is needed as to the most appropriate assessment pathway for the issue and there is need for coordination at EU level in terms of actions and communication. The IRN then convenes by teleconference and is chaired by the EMA. It has a core of about 20 members (from the EMA, its scientific committees, EC and NCAs) with multidisciplinary expertise covering risk management, risk communication, regulatory affairs and pharmacovigilance (Figure

For example in case of quality and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) issues, participation from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM),

 </xref> and so on may be required. The Chairs of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) and the co‐ordination group for mutual recognition and decentralized procedures—human (CMDh) are also invited, as applicable, to link the IRN and the scientific committees, which may subsequently be called on to conduct a detailed scientific assessment. This ensures that the right expertise and leadership are available to rapidly provide perspective and direction on how to best address an incident.
