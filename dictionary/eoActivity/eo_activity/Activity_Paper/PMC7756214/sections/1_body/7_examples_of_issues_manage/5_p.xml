<p>The IRN has also dealt with numerous important quality issues. Shortly after the initial notification of potential genotoxic impurities (N‐nitrosamines) in valsartan containing products (used to treat hypertension), an IRN teleconference was convened. Considering that the impurity was due to the route of synthesis and cross‐contamination, the IRN discussed that the issue could also be relevant for products containing other sartans (provided they had a tetrazole ring). Therefore, the issue was judged to significantly impact public health (there were about 13 000 sartan containing medicines on the EEA market) and likely to attract media interest. Due to its complexity, as well as the limited information initially available, several IRN teleconferences were needed to discuss the most appropriate routine measures to handle the issue. These included recommendations for harmonized market actions (batch quarantines and recalls), initiation of an Article 31 referral procedure,

The evaluation resulted in a recommendation for MAHs to review their manufacturing processes, introduce rigorous testing regimens, and ensure that sartan medicines currently on the EU market would only contain levels of those impurities below agreed safe thresholds, and that by 2021 no quantifiable levels of those impurities should be present in sartan products.
