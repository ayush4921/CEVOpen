<p>The IRN recommended to trigger a referral in almost half of the total number of incidents, that is, in 37 (47%) cases, while other assessment pathways (see Figure 
 <xref rid="pds5133-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) were advised in 41 (53%) cases. The legal bases underpinning the triggering of the referral procedures were different articles of the EU legislation, depending on the type of underlying issue, mainly Articles 31 (10, 13%) and 107/107i (10, 13%) of Directive 2001/83/EC and Articles 20 (7, 9%) and 5(3) (4, 5%) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004, or various combinations thereof. Article 31 or 20 is invoked in case of safety, quality, or efficacy issues, when the concerned products include at least a NAP or exclusively CAPs, respectively. An article 107/107i procedure is triggered in case an urgent regulatory action is necessary due to a safety concern with an authorized medicinal product, while article 5(3) is invoked when an opinion on a scientific matter related to the evaluation of medicines for human use is sought from the CHMP.
