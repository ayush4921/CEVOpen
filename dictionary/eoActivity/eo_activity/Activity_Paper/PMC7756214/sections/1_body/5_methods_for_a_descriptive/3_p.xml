This provides key information such as date of first notification; source; geographical origin; channel of communication; product concerned; authorization route of the product; description of the issue; category of the issue (safety, quality, Good Clinical Practice [GCP] non‐compliance, and so on); type of issue; date of IRN; IRN recommendation and outcome of the issue. Whenever an EU‐IMP results in a referral procedure, the article from the legislation underpinning its triggering is also tracked.</p>
