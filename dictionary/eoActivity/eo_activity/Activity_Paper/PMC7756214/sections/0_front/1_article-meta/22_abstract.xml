  <title>Results</title>
  <p>During the 10 years of observation, 78 incidents were reviewed by the Incident Review Network and addressed through routine measures. Their number has varied throughout the years with a significant decrease after 2012. Incidents mainly covered safety (56%) and quality (34%) issues or a combination thereof (5%). The majority (70%) were notified by EU regulators and involved centrally and nationally authorized product in similar proportions. A referral was recommended as the assessment pathway for 47% of the issues while lines‐to‐take were the most frequent communication measure (the sole measure in 65% cases). Forty‐six per cent of the issues resulted in a variation, whereas 22% resulted in maintenance of the marketing authorization.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>The EU‐IMP is underpinned by a robust regulatory framework with defined processes and clear roles and responsibilities and offers a platform to coordinate actions and communication at EU level, rapidly pool expertise, minimize duplications, and address public health incidents.</p>
