<p>Chromatographic analysis of the studied extracts affirmed the presence of several components in the capitula, leaves, and seeds of 
 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> (L) that may be involved in analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and healing activities. In the present work, twenty compounds were detected by GC-MS, and among them, sarcosine 
 <italic>N</italic>-(trifluoroacetyl)-butyl ester, levulinic acid, propanedioic acid, palmitic acid, morphinan-6-one, 4,5 alpha-epoxy-3-hydroxy-17-methyl, 2,4-undecadiene-8,10-diyne-
 <italic>N</italic>-tyramide, and isovaleric acid compounds were detected for the first time in this work, according to the best of our knowledge. Some of the compounds identified in the studied extracts of 
 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> (L), such as alkylamides ((2,4)-
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-2,4-undecadiene-8,10-diynamide, 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-dodeca-2,4,8,10-tetraenamide, 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-2,4-octadiene-6-monoynamide, 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-2,4-heptadiene-6-monoynamide, and N-isobutyl-2,6,8-datrienamide), were previously confirmed to have activities such as immunomodulatory, antithrombotic, antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anticancer, antidiabetic, and antiprotozoal activities [
