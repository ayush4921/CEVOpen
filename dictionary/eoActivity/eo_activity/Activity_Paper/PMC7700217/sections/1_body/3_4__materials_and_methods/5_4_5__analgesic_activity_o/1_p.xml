<p>The analgesic effect of different extracts was evaluated according to the method described by Ouédraogo et al. [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05469" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The mice were randomly divided into 14 groups, with five mice in each; each extract (roots, seeds, leaves, and capitula) was orally administered to mice in three different doses of 300, 500, and 1000 mg/kg with the time. The negative control group was treated with physiological water and the positive control group was treated with 100 mg/kg of paracetamol. One hour after the administration of each extract, the pain was provoked by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid solution at 0.6% (10 mL/kg) in each mouse. Five minutes after the injection, the number of contortions was counted for 30 min in each mouse. The percentage of pain inhibition was calculated according to the following formula:
