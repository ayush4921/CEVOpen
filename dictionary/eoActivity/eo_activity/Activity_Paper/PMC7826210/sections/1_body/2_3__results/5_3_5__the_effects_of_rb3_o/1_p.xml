<p>In order to determine whether mitochondrial participated in Rb3 suppressing cellular apoptosis evoked by CPT, the mitochondrial membrane potential of GP-293 cells was detected by flow cytometry of JC-1 staining, and mitochondrial-related protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was probed by Western blotting. The histogram from flow cytometry analysis (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(b)</xref>) showed that the fluorescence ratio of green/red in the cells of the CPT group is nearly four-folds to that in the control group and demonstrated that CPT induced mitochondrial depolarization which is the early event of cellular apoptosis. Reservedly, the administration of Rb3 at 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>M significantly repaired the mitochondrial depolarization induced by CPT, and its fluorescence ratio of green/red is similar to that in the control group. Additionally, Western blot showed that CPT induced the expression of Bax and inhibited Bcl-2 expression; meanwhile, Rb3 relieved the CPT-mediated protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 in GP-293 cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5(d)</xref>). Together, these results demonstrated that Rb3 might suppress the CPT-induced apoptosis via mediating mitochondrial depolarization and protein expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in GP-293 cells.
