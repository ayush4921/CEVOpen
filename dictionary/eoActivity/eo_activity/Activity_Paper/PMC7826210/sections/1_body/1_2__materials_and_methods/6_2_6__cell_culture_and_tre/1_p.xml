<p>The oral carcinoma ACC83 cells and normal renal epithelial cells GP-293 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37°C. When the amounts of ACC cells in the logarithmic phase reached to 12 of 10 cm cell culture plates with 90% confluence, they were digested with 0.25% trypsin solution and resuspended into 5 mL EP tubes with PBS according to 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L PBS per 10 cm cell culture plate; following, the resuspended cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice at 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L for one mouse to construct the oral tumor mice model. When GP-293 cells in the logarithmic phase were about 85% confluence, they were seeded into 6 wells cultured plate and treated with CPT and/or Rb3 as necessary. And then, the cells were collected and detected by the following experiments.
