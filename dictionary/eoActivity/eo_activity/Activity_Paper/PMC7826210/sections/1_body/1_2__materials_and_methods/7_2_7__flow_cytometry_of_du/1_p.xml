<p>The GP-293 cells treated by CTP and/or Rb3 were digested into single cells with 0.25% trypsin and transferred into 1.5 mL EP tubes. The digested cells were washed with precold PBS and centrifuged at 1500 rpm and 4°C for 5 minutes. The precipitate of cells was resuspended with 300 
 <italic>μ</italic>L 1 × binding buffer; following, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L Annexin V-FITC was added to incubate at room temperature away from light for 15 minutes, and then, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of PI was added to stain. At last, the stained cells were supplied with another 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L 1 × binding buffer and detected by the flow cytometry (Bechman, USA).
