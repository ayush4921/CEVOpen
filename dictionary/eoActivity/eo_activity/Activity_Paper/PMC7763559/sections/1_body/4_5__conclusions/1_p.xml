<p>LC-MS-based multivariate data analysis and molecular docking is a promising technique for investigating bioactive compounds associated with folk medicine, for example those from herbal plants. In the present study, three AG inhibitor compounds were identified from methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaves by using this approach. The compounds were identified as 5′-hydroxymethyl-1′-(1, 2, 3, 9-tetrahydro-pyrrolo (2, 1-
 <italic>b</italic>) quinazolin-1-yl)-heptan-1′-one, α-terpinyl-
 <italic>β</italic>-glucoside, and machaeridiol-A, being reported for the first time in this plant in this study. Their AG inhibitory activity was confirmed through in silico molecular studies, which predicted the binding mode and binding interactions between the identified compounds and the binding site on the enzyme. This information is useful for future studies on the bioassay assessment of these compounds for exploration of their potential uses as novel anti-diabetic agents. Purification and identification of the unknown compounds suspected to possess AG inhibitory activities in this study are required to be conducted in the future study.
