<p>Various extraction methods using a methanolic solvent have been applied to enhance the content of the bioactive compounds possessing anti-diabetic and antioxidant activities in medicinal herbal extracts. Kidane et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] reported that the extraction of 
 <italic>Psiadia punctulata</italic> leaves in a methanolic solvent produced an extract with high AGI activity. A similar result was found by Bhatia et al. [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] who reported the high AGI activity of a methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Cornus capitata</italic> Wall leaves. Extraction with aqueous methanol was shown to be better for the recovery of the largest amount of phenolic compounds from 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> and rice bran, which are related to antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, different ratios of aqueous methanolic solvent were investigated, which led to obtaining an extract with high AGI activity in 100% methanol. The trend of AGI activity (100 &gt; 25 &gt; 50 &gt; 0 &gt; 75% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> methanolâ€“water) is caused by the difference of metabolite profiling among the extracts which were affected by the solvent used during extraction [
