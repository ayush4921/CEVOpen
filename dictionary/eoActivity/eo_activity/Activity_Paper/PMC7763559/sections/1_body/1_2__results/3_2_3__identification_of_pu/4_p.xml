<p>Compound 
 <bold>3</bold>, a phenolic compound with two hydroxyl groups in its structure, contains cyclic hydrocarbon with methylene and methyl. In the ESI positive ionization mode, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> was protonated at the oxygen atom of one of the hydroxyl groups to form the parent ion [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 349. The cyclic rearrangement and removal of C
 <sub>4</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>, C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>, C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>10</sub>, and C
 <sub>10</sub>H
 <sub>18</sub> from the parent ion produced ions with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 295, 281, 267, and 211, respectively. Removal of a water molecule from the parent ion produced an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 331, which was further fragmented to produce an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 313 by removal of another water molecule. The loss of C
 <sub>3</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub> from the parent ion led to the formation of an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 309, this was followed by the loss of C
 <sub>14</sub>H
 <sub>11</sub>O to form an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 114.
