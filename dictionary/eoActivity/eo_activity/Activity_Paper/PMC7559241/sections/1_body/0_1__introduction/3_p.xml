<p>Taking into consideration the above-mentioned information, this study was designed to determine the biologic properties and chemical profiles of eight mushroom species (
 <italic>Amanita crocea</italic>, 
 <italic>Hemileccinum depilatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Cyclocybe cylindracea</italic>, 
 <italic>Lactarius deliciosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Hygrocybe acutoconica</italic>, 
 <italic>Neoboletus erythropus</italic>, 
 <italic>Russula aurea</italic> and 
 <italic>Russula sanguinea</italic>) from Turkey. The mushrooms species were collected from same specific area, whereby most of the species edible by local people form that region. However, only one mushroom (
 <italic>H. acutonica</italic>) is not edible (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Biologic properties included the antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory and mutagenic/antimutagenic effects. Chemical profiles were also established by LCâ€“MS/MS technique. It is anticipated that results generated from study, could be a cornerstone for designing further studies on these mushroom species.
