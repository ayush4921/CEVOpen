<p>Oxidative stress, which is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidant, is closely linked to several health problems including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. In this respect, several novel and effective antioxidants relevant in the management and prevention of the diseases are being probed [

 <xref rid="B30-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, the antioxidant propensities of the mushroom extracts were investigated via several assays including free-radical quenching, reducing power, metal chelating and phosphomolybdenum. The results are given in 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. DPPH and ABTS are the most popular radicals in the in vitro antioxidant assays to evaluate radical scavenging ability. In these assays, 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic> exhibited the best activity (84.33 mg TE/g for ABTS and 41.89 mg TE/g for DPPH); (N) 
 <italic>erythropus</italic> showed the second highest radical quenching ability, while the weakest ability was observed by 
 <italic>L. deliciosus</italic>. FRAP and CUPRAC are reducing power assays, which contain the reduction of metals (from Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> in FRAP assay and from Cu
 <sup>2+</sup> and Cu
 <sup>+</sup> in CUPRAC assay). Similar to radical scavenging assays, 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic> and 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic> depicted the strongest reductive abilities in these assays. These mushrooms had also the highest level of total phenolics. In this context, the observed abilities may be explained by the presence of phenolics. This fact was also confirmed by several authors [
 <xref rid="B32-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], who reported a strong correlation between total phenolics and antioxidant properties of some mushroom extracts. Transition metals play significant role in the production of hydroxyl radical via Fenton reaction and thus, the chelation of them is one important antioxidant mechanism. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the metal chelating ability of the tested mushrooms were very close. The best chelating ability was recorded for 
 <italic>A. crocea</italic> with the value of 14.91 mg EDTAE/g, while 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic> had the lowest chelating ability. When compared with other antioxidant assays, the results were different in the metal chelating ability. These contradictory results may be explained by the presence of non-phenolic chelators such as peptides or vitamin C. In addition, some authors reported that the metal chelation ability of phenolic is a minor way in their antioxidant mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B35-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. As different from radical scavenging and reducing power assays, the order of phosphomolybdenum assay was 
 <italic>H. acutoconica</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>R. sanguinea</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>C. cylindracea &gt; R. aurea</italic> &gt; 
 <italic>H. depilatum &gt; L. deliciosus &gt; N. erythropus &gt; A. crocea</italic>. The different order could be explained with the actions of non-phenolic antioxidants such as tocopherol and ascorbic acid in the assay. Thus, the assay could be considered as one total antioxidant capacity assay and not only phenolic, but also non-phenolic antioxidants could be effective role in the assay. As far as the literature could ascertain, many authors have reported the antioxidant properties for the tested mushrooms, such as 
 <italic>L. deliciosus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B7-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], 
 <italic>Cyclocybe cylindracea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and 
 <italic>Amanita crocea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B25-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We have observed different results in these reports which could be justified based on the (equivalent or IC
 <sub>50</sub> values) antioxidant assays.
