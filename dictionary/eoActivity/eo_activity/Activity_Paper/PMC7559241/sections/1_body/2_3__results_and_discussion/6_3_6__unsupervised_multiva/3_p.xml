<p>PCA and HCA allows the statistically significant discrimination of mushroom species according to their bioactivities. For two species including 
 <italic>N. erythropus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic>, the significant antioxidant activities was obtained. Many publications have documented the presence of specific bioactive compounds like tocopherols, polysaccharides, ergosterol, ascorbic acid and phenolic as responsible for the antioxidant properties of various mushrooms species [
 <xref rid="B67-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. These compounds make mushrooms an alternative attractive source of food to deal with damage caused by the oxidation reaction of free radicals in the human body. On the other hand, 
 <italic>H. acutoconica</italic> is found to possess good anti-amylase, anti-glucosidase activities. In fact, the anti-diabetic potential of several mushrooms is very well documented. For example, water extracts of wild edible mushrooms, i.e., 
 <italic>Clitocybe maxima</italic>, 
 <italic>Stropharia rugoso-annulata</italic>, 
 <italic>Craterellus cornucopioides</italic>, 
 <italic>Catathelasma ventricosum</italic>, 
 <italic>Laccaria amethystea</italic> and 
 <italic>Catathelasma ventricosum</italic> have been shown to have potent inhibition of alpha-glucosidase activity [
 <xref rid="B68-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Similarly 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. versicolor</italic> have been reported to possess strong inhibitory effect on alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase activities, respectively [
