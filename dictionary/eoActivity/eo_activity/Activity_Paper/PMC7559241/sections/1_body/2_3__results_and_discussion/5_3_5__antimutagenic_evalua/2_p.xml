 <italic>A. crocea</italic> methanol extract can be considered as weak antimutagenic at all test doses (10,000, 5000 and 2500 µg/plate) against 4-NPDA for TA98 strain in the absence of S9 mix. The inhibition rates were determined as 15%, 19% and 22% (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The same extract revealed excellent antimutagenicity against 2-AF with a rate of 94% at a concentration of 10,000 µg/plate and 55% inhibition rate at a dose of 5000 µg/plate for TA98 strain after addition of metabolic activation enzymes. However, it was ineffective at the minimum dose (2500 µg/plate). For TA100 strain, 
 <italic>A. crocea</italic> extracts did not reveal any antimutagenicity against SA at all test doses in the absence of S9 mix as in strain TA98. However, when this extract exposed to metabolic activation system, especially the highest dose of extract manifested strong antimutagenicity (83%) against 2-AA (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). However, weak antimutagenic potential was observed at 5000 and 2500 µg/plate doses for TA100 strain. Both for two strains it can be said that metabolic activation system ameliorated the mutagenic effects of positive mutagens. When the 
 <italic>H. depilatum</italic> methanol extract was evaluated, it was found that all tested concentrations had no activity against 4-NPDA for TA98 without S9 mix. By the addition of metabolic activation enzymes, this extract alleviated the mutagenic effect of 2-AF at a dose of 10,000 µg/plate with a rate of 93%, making the extract excellent antimutagenic (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The 5000 g/plate dose also revealed strong antimutagenicity with 41% inhibition rate. Except for 2500 g/plate concentration, other doses manifested moderate antimutagenic activity (32% and 32%, respectively) against SA for TA100 strain without S9 mix. After addition of S9 mix only 10,000 µg/plate dose revealed very strong inhibition (80%) against 2-AA, while other concentrations were considered to be weak action (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The potential antimutagenic action was not detected against 4-NPDA for TA98 strain at all test doses, although 
 <italic>C. cylindracea</italic> extract associated with S9 showed strong activity against 2-AF with rates of 92% (10,000 µg/plate) and 40% (5000 µg/plate) (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The extract showed inhibition of revertants exceeding 27%, reaching 35% and 31% at three concentrations representing moderate antimutagenicity against SA for TA100 strain. Only 10,000 µg/plate dose manifested strong antimutagenicity against 2-AA with a rate of 84% with S9 mix for TA100 strain (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>); (L) 
 <italic>deliciosus</italic> extract could not combat with the mutagenic effects of 4-NPDA without S9 for TA98, while metabolic activation enzymes induced the inhibition of revertants as 92% and 54% at doses of 10,000 and 5000 µg/plate for this strain against 2-AF (
 <xref rid="jof-06-00166-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Associated with SA, 
 <italic>Lactarius</italic> extract was described as moderate antimutagenic for all test doses with ratios of 36%, 36% and 29%, respectively for TA100. Exposing to S9 mixture of plates affected the inhibition ratio only for 10,000 µg/plate dose with 58% inhibition ratio against 2-AA. Other doses had no antimutagenic capacity. When compared with other mushroom extracts, only 
 <italic>H. acutoconica</italic> revealed strong antimutagenicity (45%) against 4-NPDA in the absence of S9 mix at a dose of 10,000 µg/plate for TA98. All tested concentrations showed more than 40% inhibition and concentrations in the range of 10,000–2500 μg/plate achieved 96%, 93% and 73% inhibition, respectively, making the extract a very strong antimutagen in the presence of metabolic activation system for TA98 (
