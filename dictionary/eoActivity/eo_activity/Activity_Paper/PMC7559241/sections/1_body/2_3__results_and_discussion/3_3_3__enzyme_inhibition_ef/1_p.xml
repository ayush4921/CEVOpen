<p>The inhibition of key clinical enzymes have gained much momentum among the scientific as a therapeutic avenue for the management and prevention of global health problems including Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes mellitus and obesity. This fact is well known that the enzyme inhibition theory is based on the inhibition of key enzymes in the pathologies of these diseases. For example, cholinesterase is a key enzyme in the management of Alzheimer’s disease, which hydrolyzing acetylcholine in the synaptic gap. At this point, the inhibition of cholinesterase could increase the level of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft and these effects may help to improve cognitive dysfunctions in Alzheimer patients [

However, a number of studies has shown that the synthetic compounds exhibited undesirable side effects including gastrointestinal disturbances, toxicity [
