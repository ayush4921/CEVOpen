<p>The Ames test was employed as described below: The overnight cultures (16 h) of test strains were obtained in an orbital shaker and adjusted to turbidity of 1–2 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> cfu/mL. Then, 100 µL of fresh bacteria culture, 500 µL Na–P buffer (0.2 M, pH 7.4 for experiment without S9 mix) and 100 µL different extract concentrations were added to top agar (2.5 mL) supplemented with (0.5-mM L-histidine/D-biotin solution) and gently mixed by vortex. Then complete mixture was poured on minimal agar plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48–72 h and the revertant bacterial colonies of each plate were counted. Data were collected with a mean ± standard deviation of two assays (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3). In each experiment positive and negative controls were included routinely. The potential mutagenicity was considered for extracts when a dose–response relationship was detected and a two-fold increase in the number of revertants was observed for at least one concentration [
