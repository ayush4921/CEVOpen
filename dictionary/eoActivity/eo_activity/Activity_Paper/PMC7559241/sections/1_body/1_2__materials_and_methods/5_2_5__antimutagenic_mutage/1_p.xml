<p>In the present study, mutagenic potential of eighth mushrooms were evaluated by Salmonella/microsome test system in the presence and absence of metabolic activation at the same time. The plaque incorporation method was employed with two mutant Salmonella strains. 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> TA98 strain was capable for detecting of frame shift mutations while 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> TA100 strain was competent for elucidating of base pair exchange mutations. These two strains were kindly obtained from Microbiology Research Laboratory, Vocational School of Health Services, Selcuk University and are maintained as described by Maron and Ames [
 <xref rid="B18-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The mushroom extracts were subjected to toxicity testing described by Dean et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-jof-06-00166" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, nontoxic dose levels of the extracts were revealed. According to the results of the test it was determined that 10,000 Âµg/plate and lower doses manifested no toxicity both for two strains of Salmonella with and without S9 mix.
