<p>Since the one-step difluorination method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C1">Scheme 1</xref>) was unsuccessful, we decided to pursue a stepwise fluorination approach [
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C2">Scheme 2</xref>). Thus, the allylic alcohol 
 <bold>7</bold> [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] was protected as the benzyl ether then subjected to a Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation reaction to furnish the diol 
 <bold>8</bold> in modest yield. The diol 
 <bold>8</bold> was then converted into the cyclic sulfate 
 <bold>9</bold>, which was ring-opened using TBAF to furnish the fluorohydrin 
 <bold>10</bold>. A Mosher ester analysis of the fluorohydrin 
 <bold>10</bold> suggested that the earlier dihydroxylation reaction had proceeded with 90% ee. The deoxyfluorination of 
 <bold>10</bold> was then attempted using several reagents including DeoxoFluor, DeoxoFluor in combination with TMS-morpholine [
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and PyFluor [
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The optimal yield of the 
 <italic>threo</italic>-difluoroalkane 
 <bold>11</bold> was obtained with DeoxoFluor at elevated temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="C2">Scheme 2</xref>). A side-product in this fluorination reaction was the tricyclic compound 
 <bold>12</bold>, which presumably formed through an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of the activated alcohol intermediate. The inclusion of TMS-morpholine [
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] reduced the formation of this side-product but did not lead to an overall increase in the yield of 
 <bold>11</bold>. Despite the modest optimised yield of the difluoroalkane 
 <bold>11</bold>, a sufficient quantity of this material was secured to continue with the synthesis. The hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ether of 
 <bold>11</bold> provided the primary alcohol 
 <bold>13</bold>, which only needed to be oxidised to the carboxylic acid 
 <bold>14</bold> then coupled to piperidine in order to deliver the target compound, 
 <bold>2</bold>. However, the oxidation of 
 <bold>13</bold> proved to be unexpectedly troublesome. Mild oxidising agents caused incomplete consumption of 
 <bold>13</bold>, while vigorous conditions led to the oxidation not only of the primary alcohol of 
 <bold>13</bold> but also of the electron-rich aryl moiety (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supporting Information File 1</xref>).
