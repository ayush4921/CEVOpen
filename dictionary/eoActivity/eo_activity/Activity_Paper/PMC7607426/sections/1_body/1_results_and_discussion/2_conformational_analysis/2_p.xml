<p>The three lowest-energy structures to emerge from the computational analysis (i.e., 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold>) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. The global minimum structure 
 <bold>2a</bold> has a F–C–C–F dihedral angle of 73°, giving an extended zigzag carbon chain. This approximates rotamer I (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and in this regard 
 <bold>2a</bold> is a good conformational mimic of 
 <bold>1</bold>. However, 
 <bold>2a</bold> has a F–C–C=O dihedral angle of 152°, approximating rotamer III (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and in this regard 
 <bold>2a</bold> is a poorer conformational mimic of 
 <bold>1</bold>. The next-higher energy structure (
 <bold>2b</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) is related to 
 <bold>2a</bold> through a ring-flip of the piperidine moiety (equivalent to a 180° rotation of the amide bond). The structures 
 <bold>2a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold> are close in energy, suggesting that both puckers of the piperidine moiety would be substantially populated in solution. A similar situation occurs for piperine itself; an indirect evidence for this comes from the crystal structure of 
 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), where there is a second molecule in the unit cell (not shown) that has the alternative ring pucker [
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The next-higher energy calculated structure of 
 <bold>2</bold> (i.e., 
 <bold>2c</bold>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) has a F–C–C–F dihedral angle of −52°. This approximates rotamer II (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), giving a bent carbon chain that contrasts with the extended chains of 
 <bold>2a</bold>,
 <bold>b</bold>. The structure 
 <bold>2c</bold> has a F–C–C=O dihedral angle of −118°; this approximates rotamer IV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Together, the structures 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold> seem to dominate the conformer population distribution of 
 <bold>2</bold> in chloroform solution, because the weight-averaged calculated 
 <italic>J</italic>-values of 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold> match the experimentally-measured 
 <italic>J</italic>-values quite well (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). But none of the structures 
 <bold>2a</bold>–
 <bold>c</bold> are a close conformational match with piperine (
 <bold>1</bold>).
