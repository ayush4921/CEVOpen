<p id="p0130">In the same way, the hole cross test revealed that the number of holes crossed by the experimental mice was gradually decreased throughout the observation period (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). The dose of 400 mg/kg was found statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) from 30 min to till the end when compared with the control group. Similarly, the dose of 200 mg/kg was significantly different from control at 60, 90, and 120 min. The overall number of hole cross reduced to 10.2 ± 1.16 and 2.8 ± 0.37 for 200 and 400 mg/kg respectively. This reduction in mobility is similar to the effect of CNS depressants. Therefore, it is predicted that MEBJ might function by enhancing GABAergic inhibition in the CNS through membrane hyperpolarization which eventually leads to a reduction in the firing rate of critical neurons in the brain [

 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. It might also be due to either increased affinity for the GABA receptor or owing to an increased GABA-gated channel opening duration [
