<p id="p0155">As per an investigation, it has been revealed that the symptoms of anxiety and depression are the considerable risk factors for the occurrence of type-2 diabetes [

 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. After taking food with a high carbohydrate level, noticeable hyperglycemia leading to hyperinsulinemia is observed [

 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Therefore, high postprandial blood glucose levels in diabetes can be reduced by inhibiting the alpha-amylase. In this study, MEBJ was found to inhibit alpha-amylase enzyme in a dose-dependent manner. Calculated IC
 <sub>50</sub> of MEBJ was 24.56 μg/mL, and that of the standard drug (Acarbose) was 11.7 μg/mL (
