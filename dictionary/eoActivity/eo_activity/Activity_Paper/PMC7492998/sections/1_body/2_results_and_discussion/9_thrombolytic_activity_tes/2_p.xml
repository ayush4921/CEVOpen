<p id="p0160">Thrombosis is a critical event caused by plaque generation in a blood vessel due to platelets, tissue factors and fibrin deposition [
 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Plaque formation and growth occur when activated platelets interact with leucocytes [
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. However, thrombolytic agents can disrupt the fibrinogen and fibrin in a clot, which leads to clot lysis. Although streptokinase is a well-known thrombolytic agent, it has several deleterious effects, including embolism and bleeding [
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. As a result, many studies have been conducted to overcome these complexities by discovering novel sources of thrombolytic agents with less adverse effects [
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In our experiment, MEBJ showed a significant percentage of clot lysis when compared with the control. Streptokinase and MEBJ exhibited 73.71 ± 1.45% and 30.76 ± 1.01% clot lysis, respectively, significantly different from the negative control with negligible clot lysis of 5.93 ± 1.13% (

 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Thus, the presence of the mentioned phytochemicals in MEBJ is thought to be responsible for its antithrombotic activity.
