<p id="p0170">In addition, pharmacokinetic (ADMET) and toxicological properties of a compound are essential parameters during the process of novel drug discovery. Our study demonstrated the physicochemical properties of the compounds from

 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), namely chrysoeriol, quercetin and fisetin, exhibit no violations. Additionally, toxicological characteristics of studied constituents were predicted (
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), which suggests that 9 out of all tested compounds are non-hepatotoxic and non-mutagenic. Particularly, chrysoeriol, fisetin, and triacontane showed no toxicity (hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity and mutagenicity) at all while ursolic acid and betulinic acid were predicted to be carcinogenic and immunotoxic. The rest of the predicted compounds either showed carcinogenicity or immunotoxicity.
