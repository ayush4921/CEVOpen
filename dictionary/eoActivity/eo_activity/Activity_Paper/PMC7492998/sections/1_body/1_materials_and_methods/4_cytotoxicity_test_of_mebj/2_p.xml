<p id="p0040">Brine shrimp lethality bioassay was followed for assessing general toxicity of MEBJ [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The procedure was initiated by hatching the eggs of shrimp in unnatural brine formulated previously by the addition of sea salt (38 g/L). The plant extract was mixed with prepared brine by using DMSO (not more than 0.01%) and obtained different concentrations (31.25, 62.50, 125, 250 500 and 1000 μg/mL) of extract solution followed by the addition of 10 nauplii in each concentration. Vincristine sulphate was taken as standard, and validation of the process was done by using negative control DMSO. After 24 h of incubation at 25 °C-30 °C, the number of living nauplii was counted and calculated the percentage of mortality applying the following formula.
 <disp-formula id="ufd1">% Mortality = (N
  <sub>t</sub>/N
  <sub>0</sub>) × 100
 </disp-formula>where N
 <sub>t</sub> represents the number of nauplii died after incubation and N
 <sub>0</sub> represents the total number of nauplii transferred.
