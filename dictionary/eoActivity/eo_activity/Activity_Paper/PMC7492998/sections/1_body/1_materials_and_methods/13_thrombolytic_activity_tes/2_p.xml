<p id="p0095">The thrombolytic test was performed following the method described by Prasad et al. [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Firstly, 2 mL of venous blood was withdrawn from each 10 healthy human participants with no record of anticoagulants or oral contraceptives. The Institutional Ethical Review Board endorsed the protocol followed in this experiment, and a consent paper was provided to each volunteer before the collection of the blood sample. The collected samples were transferred to pre-weighed Eppendorf tubes and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min to set up clots. After the formation of a clot, the serum from all the Eppendorf was withdrawn carefully without breaking the clot and weighed to measure (clot weight). A volume of 0.1 mL extract (different concentrations) was added to the clot and again incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Commercially available streptokinase was taken as a positive control, and distilled water was taken as a negative control. After the final incubation period, the fluid of the upper layer from Eppendorf was removed, and the final weight was taken to calculate the difference in clot weight and measure the percentage of clot lysis.
