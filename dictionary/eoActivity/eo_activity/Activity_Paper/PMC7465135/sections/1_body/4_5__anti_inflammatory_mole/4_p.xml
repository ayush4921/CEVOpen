<p>Flavonoids have an anti-inflammatory capacity since they inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators by modulating the arachidonic acid pathway, inhibiting several enzymes such as ATPase, prostaglandin, cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, NADH oxidase, protein kinase, hydrolases, peroxidases, metallopeptidases, tyrosinases, and phospholipases. Thus, flavonoids have been the target of increasing interest as a potential therapeutic drug in inhibiting or even decreasing inflammatory activity [
