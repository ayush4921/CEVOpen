<p>Although an expressive number of flavonoids are present in plants in the form of glycosides, consignments about the biological activities of flavonoids have been made mainly for aglycones. Some research on the structure-activity relationship and the inhibition of inflammatory mediators can also be found in the scientific literature. It has been reported that the presence of hydroxylations at the 3′ and 4′ positions of the B ring of the flavonoid structure enhances the modulatory action on the inhibitory activity of TNF-α [
