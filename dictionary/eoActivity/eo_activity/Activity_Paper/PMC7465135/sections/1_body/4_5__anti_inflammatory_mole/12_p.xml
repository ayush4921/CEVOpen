<p>Alkaloids can also be classified according to their biogenetic precursors, which confer their structural characteristics, such as indole alkaloids. Alkaloids are derived from amino acids such as ornithine, lysine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. Ornithine is a precursor for pyrrolidine and tropic alkaloids, while lysine gives the piperidine alkaloids. Tyrosine and tryptophan are formed by the shikimic acid pathway and originate the isoquinolinic and indole alkaloids respectively [
