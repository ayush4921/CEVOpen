<p>There are several ways to classify NSAIDs; according to COX-2 inhibitory potency over COX-1, concentration to achieve clinical effects, among others. NSAIDs can be classified into non-selective NSAIDs (ketoprofen, aspirin, naproxen, flunixin, meglumine, and others), preferential COX-2 inhibitors (meloxican, etodolac, nimesulide), and highly selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxib). Most of the side effects are related to the inhibition of COX-1 due to its performance in several systems related to cell cleansing. Besides, NSAIDs can also be classified according to their chemical structure (
