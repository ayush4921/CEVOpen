Therefore, the study of the immunopharmacological activities of plant species has provided evidence on different extracts/fractions and chemical classes with high therapeutic potential, which represents a promising alternative to the inflammatory processes and diseases related to them, as well as a form of validation of their ethnobotanical use. Besides, data from the scientific literature have shown that molecules of plant origin present important anti-inflammatory activities and that many of their actions are related to the ability to inhibit the synthesis or action of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, and arachidonic acid and nitric oxide pathways [
