<p>Reviewer #2:Â The simultaneous recovery of polysaccharides and triterpenoids were reported by the authors using ultrasound-assisted extraction. The authors first performed one factor at a time experiment in order to determine the domain of the experimental design and optimised the influence of four significant variables (ultrasonic power, temperature, liquid/solid ratio, and extraction time). The introduction of the manuscript is well prepared and follows the theme of the article. A good methodology was established, the authors provide a clear rationale for each experiment conducted and the results are discussed thoroughly. Discussions are very well reported, and the authors focused on comparing their finding with previous reports. The figures are self-explanatory, clear, and easy to understand. However, I provided a few suggestions and recommend the acceptance of this paper in PLOSONE.</p>
