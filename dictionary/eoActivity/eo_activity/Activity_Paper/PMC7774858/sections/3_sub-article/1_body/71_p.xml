<p>In this study, the author describes the usefulness of simultaneous extraction, but I think it is not enough to confirm with DPPH alone.If you have a reason, please state why you expressed the bioactivity only with the DPPH result. In some cases, I suggest removing the DPPH results and changing to a paper with only extraction methods.</p>
