<p>As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, the yields of both polysaccharides (0.44%) and triterpenoids (0.32%) were high after the first extraction, and only small amounts of both components were extracted from the residue after an additional extraction. After extraction number two, almost no additional polysaccharides and triterpenoids could be extracted. The changing trend of 
 <italic>D</italic> values against extraction number was the same for extraction yields of both polysaccharides and triterpenoids.
