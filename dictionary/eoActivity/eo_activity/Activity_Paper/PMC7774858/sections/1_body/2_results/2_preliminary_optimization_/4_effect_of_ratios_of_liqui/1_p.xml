<p>As presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, the yield of polysaccharides increased from 0.21% to 0.3% as the liquid/solid ratio rose from 10 to 20 mL/g but decreased as the ratio further increased to 30 mL/g, while a yield increase from 0.28% to 0.32% was observed when the liquid/solid ratio ascended from 30 to 40 mg/L. Afterward, the polysaccharide yield decreased gradually. The maximum yield of polysaccharides (0.32%) was obtained at a liquid/solid ratio of 40 mL/g. The yield of triterpenoids increased with the increasing liquid/solid ratio within the tested range except when the liquid/solid ratio was 20 mL/g, with a maximum yield of 0.34% at a ratio of 60 mL/g. As to the combined extraction efficacy, the maximum 
 <italic>D</italic> value (0.17) was shown to be at a liquid/solid ratio of 40 mL/g, hence, this ratio was considered as the center point in the subsequent BBD.
