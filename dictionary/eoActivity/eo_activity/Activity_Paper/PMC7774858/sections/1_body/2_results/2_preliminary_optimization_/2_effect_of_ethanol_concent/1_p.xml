 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g001">Fig 1B</xref> shows that the polysaccharide yield decreased in a rapid manner with increasing ethanol concentration in the scope of test, with the maximum yield of 0.46% observed at the lowest concentration of 20%. Conversely, the highest triterpenoid yield of 0.34% was obtained at the highest investigated ethanol concentration of 80%. The 
 <italic>D</italic> value increased to 0.15 from 0.04 as ethanol increased from 20% to 50%, then slightly decreased when it increased from 50% to 80%. The optimal ethanol concentration was therefore around 50%. As ethanol concentrations between 40%âˆ’60% gave little variation in the 
 <italic>D</italic> value, and the extraction was poor outside of this range, the ethanol concentration of 50% was selected, and not included in BBD for further optimization.
