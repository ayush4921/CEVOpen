<p>According to the preliminary study, the parameters of the desirability function in this study were set as 
 <italic>Y</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>min</italic>
 </sub> = 0.1%, 
 <italic>Y</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> = 2.0%, importance 
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.5 for polysaccharides, and for triterpenoids, they were as 
 <italic>Y</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>min</italic>
 </sub> = 0.05%, 
 <italic>Y</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>max</italic>
 </sub> = 1.0%, and importance 
 <italic>w</italic> = 0.5. The individual desirability value 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>1</italic>
 </sub> for polysaccharide was calculated based on Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0244749.e004">4</xref>), and the individual desirability value 
 <italic>d</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sub> for triterpenoid was calculated according to Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0244749.e005">5</xref>). The overall desirability (
 <italic>D</italic> value) of the optimization was calculated using the individual desirability values according to Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0244749.e006">6</xref>).
