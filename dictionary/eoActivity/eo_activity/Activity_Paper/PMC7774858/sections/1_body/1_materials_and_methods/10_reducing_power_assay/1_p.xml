<p>The reducing capacity of a natural component can employ as a significant indicator of its potential antioxidant activity [

 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The reducing power of the polysaccharides and triterpenoid-rich extracts was determined following the method described by Ahmadi et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], with minor modifications. Briefly, 2 mL sample at varying concentrations (0.1âˆ’0.5 mg/mL) was mixed with 2 mL potassium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6), then incubated at 50C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 mL trichloroacetic acid solution (10%, w/v). Then, the reaction solution (2 mL) was mixed with 0.4 mL ferric chloride (0.1%, w/v) and distilled water (2 mL), and the absorbance was measured at 700 nm against a blank after 10 min.
