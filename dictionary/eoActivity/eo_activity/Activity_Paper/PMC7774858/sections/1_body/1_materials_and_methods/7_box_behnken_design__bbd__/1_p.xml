<p>After the single factor experiments, four significant variables including

 <sub>
  <italic>1</italic>
 </sub> (ultrasonic power), 
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sub> (extraction temperature), 
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>3</italic>
 </sub> (liquid/solid ratio), and 
 <italic>X</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>4</italic>
 </sub> (extraction time) were selected and further optimized by RSM with BBD [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The coded and actual values of the four selected variables are listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A BBD matrix comprising 29 trials was formulated with Design-Expert software (version 8.0), and was shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A total of five replicates (runs 6, 7, 10, 16, and 29) were performed at the center point of the design to allow for estimation of a pure error sum of squares for statistical analysis. To simplify the study, only one extraction number was tested for all experiments in this design. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and average values were shown.
