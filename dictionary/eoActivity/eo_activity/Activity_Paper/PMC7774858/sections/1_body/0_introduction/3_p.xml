<p>Polysaccharides are generally prepared by traditional hot water extraction due to its easy operation and low instrument input [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it also has many shortcomings such as low extraction yield and long extraction duration, as well as requirement of high temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To overcome these problems, a variety of novel techniques, including pressurized liquid extraction [
