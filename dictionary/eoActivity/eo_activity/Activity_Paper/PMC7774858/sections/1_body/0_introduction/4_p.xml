<p>In recent years, the simultaneous extraction of multiple biologically active components from plants has become increasingly popular in order to improve extraction efficacy and reduce the number of extraction steps [

 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, there have been no available reports on the simultaneous extraction of multiple objective constituents from mushrooms to date. Most of previous studies pertaining to the extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from

 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hence, the significant loss of either polysaccharides or triterpenoids occurred during the extraction, and this would lead to a waste of resources. To our knowledge, the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids in 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> has not yet been reported to date. In the present study, to better utilize

 <italic>lucidum</italic>, ultrasound technology was examined for the co-extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids, and an optimization study is essential.
