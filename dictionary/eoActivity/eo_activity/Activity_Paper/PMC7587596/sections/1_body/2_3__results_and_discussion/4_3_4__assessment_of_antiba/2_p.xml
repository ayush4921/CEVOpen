<p>The antibacterial properties of honey are related to the level of hydrogen peroxide and other non-peroxide factors as lysozyme, phenolic acids, and flavonoids [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The polycationic nature of Chitosan is a major cause of its antibacterial activity, which leads to cell leakage and death due to the interaction with the negatively charged surfaces of the bacteria [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. AuNPs can directly induce bacterial cell wall damage, acting as bactericidal and bacteriostatic agents as they attach to the bacterial DNA and inhibit the uncoiling of the double-helix structure during replication or transcription [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Consequently, they can inhibit multidrug-resistant pathogens, such as 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic>. Furthermore, AuNPs inhibit the formation of reactive oxygen species and therefore behave as antioxidant agents that can aid the healing process [

 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The antimicrobial mechanism of capsaicin is related to changes in the cell membrane fluidity due to the disruption of bacterial cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Antibacterial data show the enhanced antibacterial activity of HTCs-AuNPs against 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> and 
 <italic>K. rhinoscleromatis</italic> and relatively less antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f002">Figure 2</xref>). HTCs-capsaicin exhibits high antibacterial efficacy against all bacterial strains. The antibacterial efficiency of honey, chitosan, AuNPs, and capsaicin have been confirmed in Gram-positive and-negative bacteria [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Moreover, the increased antibacterial efficiency against 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> compared with 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> has been emphasized in previous studies for chitosan [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] as well as capsaicin extract and a mixture of honey and AuNPs [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The data obtained are consistent with the results achieved here concerning the enhanced antibacterial efficacy exhibited against 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Efren et al. (2016) tested poly(Îµ-caprolactone) (PCL)-formulated silver nanofibrous mats (PCL-AgNPs) on different types of bacterial strains, such as 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vulnificus, P. multocida</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes,</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. They reported a significant antibacterial activity of PCL-AgNP mats on all mentioned strains [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In another study, Thenmozhi et al. studied the inhibitory effect of chitosan and honey on 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Their results indicated an inhibitory effect of chitosan and honey on both strains and matches antibacterial data concerning the developed HTCs mats [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].
