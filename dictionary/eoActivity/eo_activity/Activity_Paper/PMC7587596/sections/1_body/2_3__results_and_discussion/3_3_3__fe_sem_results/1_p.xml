<p>The FE-SEM image of HTCs and HTCs-AuNP nanofibers revealed an identical dense, smooth, clear, and bead-free morphology. Furthermore, adding AuNPs enhanced the nanofiber diameter compared with the other nanofibrous mats. The size of the HTCs nanofibers was enhanced from 225 ± 32 to 291 ± 42 nm due to presence of AuNPs. In the case of HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP nanofibers, a uniform deposition was critical. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f001">Figure 1</xref> depicts the bimodal distribution of the diameters of the HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNPs nanofibers. The fibers in the HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats were not as compact and dense as those in the HTCs and HTCs-AuNP mats. The nanofibers of the HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats were 312 ± 62 and 351 ± 78 nm in diameter, respectively.
