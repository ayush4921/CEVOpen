<p>The developed nanofiber mats were successfully tested in vitro and in vivo. From the SEM results, a uniform and bead-free morphology for the HTCs, HTCs-AuNP, HTCs-capsaicin, and HTCs- capsaicin/AuNP mats were observed. The size of the fiber diameter of the HTCs-AuNP, HTCs-capsaicin, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP formulations was enhanced compared with that of HTCs enriched with AuNPs and capsaicin alone and together. These results confirm that AuNPs and capsaicin had an incremental effect on the fiber diameter size. Moreover, the SEM micrograph shows that the AuNPs created a denser and compact nanofiber compared with capsaicin. This result is in excellent agreement with previous studies [
