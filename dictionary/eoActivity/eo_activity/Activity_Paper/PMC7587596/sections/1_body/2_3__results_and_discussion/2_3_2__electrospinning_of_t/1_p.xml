<p>Electrospun HTCs nanofibers were developed using about 50 
 <italic>w/v</italic> honey and 5.5 
 <italic>w/v</italic> chitosan. Among the effective types of developed dressings, the HTCs dressing was composed of remarkable concentrations of chitosan and honey with biocompatible solvents. The capsaicin substituted 50% of the HTCs solvent, whereas the AuNPs enriched the suspensions of the HTCs and HTCs-capsaicin before electrospinning. The obtained blend suspensions were then electrospun and collected as nanofibrous mats for subsequent experiments.
