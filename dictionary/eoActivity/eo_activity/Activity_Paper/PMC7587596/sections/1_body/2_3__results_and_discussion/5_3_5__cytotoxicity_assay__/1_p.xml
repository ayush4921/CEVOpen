<p>The cytotoxicity of the developed HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP nanofibrous mats, and Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag, was evaluated via MTT tests. Cultured Vero cells were subjected to various doses of the extract suspension of all the developed mats (25, 50, 75, and 100%). The cytotoxicity index was then calculated by evaluating the viable cell value after 48 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04770-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The HTCs and HTCs-capsaicin mats showed the highest cell viability rates, at 83 and 80%, respectively, in the treatment of 100% extract suspension. Conversely, the HTCs-AuNP and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats were associated with significantly lower cell viabilities of 70 and 61% (

 <sup>®</sup> Ag showed noticeable cytotoxicity at all mentioned dilutions (

 <sup>®</sup> Ag dressing using an MTT test. Most levels of proliferation and cell viability are related to HTCs and HTCs-capsaicin. The addition of the capsaicin extract to HTCs-AuNP nanofibers reportedly increases their viability and cell proliferation levels [
