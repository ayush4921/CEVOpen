<p>Honey, chitosan, and TPP-based nanofibers; nanofibers with 50% of the solvent substituted with capsaicin; and HTCs and HTCs-capsaicin nanofibers loaded with 10% AuNPs in the HTCs-AuNPs and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNPs were prepared via electrospinning. All developed wound dressings and commercial Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag were characterized and evaluated to determine their antibacterial activity, cell viability, proliferation effect, and wound-closure ability. Enriching HTCs with capsaicin and AuNPs separately and in combination significantly reduced the viscosity. The HTCs-capsaicin and HTC-AuNP suspensions showed similar results against 
 <italic>P. multocida</italic> and 
 <italic>K. rhinoscleromatis</italic> bacteria, while the HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP suspension had less effect on such bacteria. The HTCs suspension showed results similar to those of difloxacin with a significantly reduced inhibition zone in comparison with the other suspensions. The HTCs-capsaicin suspension achieved the best results against 
 <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> bacteria. Furthermore, HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP mats exhibited high levels of cell viability and proliferation compared with Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag. The wound-closure ability of all fabricated dressings, except that of HTCs, was stronger than that of Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag. The wound-healing rate of HTCs was similar to that of Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag. Among all the developed dressings and Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag, HTCs-capsaicin mats showed the highest wound-healing rate. The demonstrated effectiveness of the developed dressings, as measured by antibacterial efficiency, cell viability, proliferation effect, and wound-closure ability, along with their negligible side effects, make them promising and competitive candidates for application in efficacious wound dressings.
