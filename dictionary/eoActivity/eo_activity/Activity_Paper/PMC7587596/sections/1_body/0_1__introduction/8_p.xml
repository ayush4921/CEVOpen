<p>In this study, a novel nanofibrous compound with high levels of honey and chitosan (CS) and enriched with capsaicin and AuNPs was developed for progressive antibacterial and injured-tissue healing efficacy. Honey and chitosan are well-established antibacterial agents that enhance the wound-healing process. The nanofibrous dressing stimulates the extracellular texture of the skin and therefore increases the wound-healing mechanism. This study aims at identifying a method of accelerating the wound-healing process using such materials. We intensified the antibacterial efficacy of honey/tripolyphosphate (TPP)/chitosan (HTCs) mats by enriching them with capsaicin and AuNPs and evaluated their antibacterial properties through in vitro and in vivo study of their wound-healing abilities.</p>
