<p>Natural and readily available polymers, such as chitosan (Cs), are the most frequently used additives for this purpose [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cs is a glycosaminoglycan obtained via the heterogeneous deacetylation of chitin [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04770" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and due to its unique polycationic character, it binds quickly to negatively charged cellular membranes or anionic AuNPs. Moreover, amine chemical groups present in its structure enable chitosan in binding to serum proteins and recognize specific receptors on different cancer cells [
