<p>Different suspensions of HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNPs, and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNPs were prepared. To prepare HTCs-capsaicin, 2 mL of capsaicin was dissolved in DDW (1 mg/mL) to form 50% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) of the HTCs-capsaicin solvent. Afterward, 25% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>), 3% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>), and 8% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) ratios of honey, chitosan, and TPP, respectively, were dissolved in the HTCs-capsaicin solvent. Both suspensions of HTCs and HTCs-capsaicin were enriched with at 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) AuNPs and stirred for 45 min to produce HTCs-AuNP and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP suspensions, which were left at ambient condition for 96 h (
