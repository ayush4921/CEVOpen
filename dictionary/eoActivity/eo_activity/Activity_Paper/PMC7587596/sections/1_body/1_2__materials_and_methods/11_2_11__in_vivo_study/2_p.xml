<p>All rabbits were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine HCl (50 mg/kg) and xylene HCl (20 mg/kg). The back of each rabbit was shaved and a 1-cm wound was made on it back using a biopsy puncher. According to the different treatment methods employed, the experimental groups were divided into 6 groups. HTCs, HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP nanofibrous mats, and Aquacel
 <sup>®</sup> Ag were placed on the wound site after UV sterilized for 20 min. Untreated rabbits served as negative controls. The wounds were covered with cotton gauze afterward. Changes in wound areas were measured after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 days by observing the change in wound contraction (cm
 <sup>2</sup>), change in wound color (chromatic red), and luminance in red, green, and blue color values. Each treatment and control were evaluated on four rabbits, and the mean value of the four measurements was recorded by 
 <disp-formula>wound size (%) = [W 
  <sub>(1,3,5,7,10,14)</sub>/W 
  <sub>(0)</sub>] × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where W 
 <sub>(0)</sub> and W 
 <sub>(1,3,5,7,10,14)</sub> represent the exposed areas of the wounds on days 0 and 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14, respectively.
