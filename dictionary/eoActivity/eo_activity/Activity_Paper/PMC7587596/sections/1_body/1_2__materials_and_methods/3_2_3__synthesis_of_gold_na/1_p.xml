<p>Initially, 6 mL of 65 mM tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) was added to 500 mL of distilled deionized water and stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer while being heated to boil on a hot plate. Moreover, 20 mL of 20 mM trisodium citrate was poured into the solution, and the reaction was allowed to continue until the solution turned red. The solution was then cooled to ambient temperature. The AuNPs were separated via centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 7 min) and re-dispersed in 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature, which was subsequently was stored at 4 Â°C for further use.</p>
