 <italic>Nomenclatural remarks</italic>. The name “Hoelen” is derived from Rumphius (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">1750</xref>), and frequently cited as 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> Rumph. in scientific literature (e.g., Saccardo et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1889</xref>; Hino and Katô, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">1930</xref>; Takeda, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">1934</xref>). In the work of Rumphius (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">1750</xref>) it is mentioned under the species 
 <italic>Tuber regium</italic> Rumph. [nom. inval., Art. 32.1(a); current name is 
 <italic>Pleurotus tuber-regium</italic> (Fr.) Singer], but without the name 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic>, the genus which was introduced by Fries (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1822</xref>). Although, Fries (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1822</xref>) presumably adopted the description of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>hoelen</italic> from Rumphius (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">1750</xref>), this work was not cited by him. Therefore, the names 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>hoelen</italic> Rumph. and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>hoelen</italic> Rumph. ex Fr. are incorrect interpretations. However, “Hoelen” formally was not clearly discussed by Fries (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1822</xref>) as a binomial like the other two taxa, i.e., 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cocos</italic> (Schwein.) Fr. and 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>tuber-regium</italic> Fr. (see also Donk, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>). This nomenclatural uncertainty is supported by the index of the same work (Fries, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1822</xref>, p. 608), where 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>hoelen</italic> was not listed under the genus 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> like the other two species. However, in his later work Fries (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1832</xref>) clearly indicated that he accepted 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>hoelen</italic> as a distinct species in the genus 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic>. When Fries (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1822</xref>) proposed the new genus 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic>, he noted that “Hoelen” is a little-known species and marked it with a separate serial number (like the other two species) under the genus. Given that the epithet “Hoelen” can be assigned to the generic name 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic>, and the species has a short diagnosis, the name 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> Fr. was published validly by Fries (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1822</xref>) and sanctioned by the ICN (Art. F.3.1).
