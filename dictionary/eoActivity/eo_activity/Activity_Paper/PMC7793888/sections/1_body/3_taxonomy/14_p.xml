<p>Remarks. New combination is proposed for 
 <italic>Wolfiporia pseudococos</italic> in 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> based on molecular data and morphological features of the basidiocarp. Ecologically, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>pseudococos</italic> grows on angiosperm trees in tropical China, while 
 <italic>P. hoelen</italic> has a distribution in temperate areas and usually grows on conifers. Phylogenetically, the two species are closely related, but 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>pseudococos</italic> forms a separate lineage based on the analyses of ITS sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The basidiocarps of 
 <italic>P. hoelen</italic> shares similar morphological characteristics with 
 <italic>P. pseudococos</italic>, but differs by the absence of cystidioles, and longer and thinner basidia (25–32 × 7–8 μm vs. 16–25 × 10–14 μm in 
 <italic>P. pseudococos</italic>).
