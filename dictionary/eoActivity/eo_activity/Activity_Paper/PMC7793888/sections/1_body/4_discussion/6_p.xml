<p>In conclusion, 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Wolfiporia cocos</italic>) has been applied to the prized Chinese medicinal mushroom “Fuling,” according to changes in Art. 59 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants, its correct binomial name is 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> Fr. which was validly published by Fries and sanctioned by the ICN. The wild teleomorphic stage (basidiocarps) of 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> is found and collected as the first time in China, and both tested wild specimens and commercial cultivars known as “Fuling” represent a single species. The illustrated description of 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> is given based on wild fruiting bodies and cultivated sclerotia, and its neotype is designated. The Chinese “Fuling” 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> is different from North American “Tuckahoe” 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Wolfiporia cocos</italic>), and 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> is recommended over 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic> because it is the earliest and sanctioned generic name. Accordingly, 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic> (Schwein.) Fr. is the valid name for “Tuckahoe” in North America, and three taxa are existed among 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic> sensu lato. Currently five taxa are accepted in 
 <italic>Pachmya: P. hoelen, P. pseudococos, P. cocos</italic> I
 <italic>, P. cocos</italic> II and 
 <italic>P. cocos</italic> III. The phylogeny of other taxa previously described or combined in 
 <italic>Wolfiporia</italic> are not analyzed, and their taxonomy is uncertain without molecular data.
