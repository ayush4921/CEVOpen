<p>Based on molecular phylogenetic analysis, for the time being we accept two species in the genus 
 <italic>Pachyma</italic> from China. We found that the tested wild specimens and commercial cultivars known as “Fuling” represent a single species and are not identical with the true 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>Poria cocos</italic>) from North America. Based on a thorough study of the literature, the forgotten Friesian binomial 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> has proved to be the correct scientific name for this widely cultivated East Asian edible and medicinal mushroom. In addition, 
 <italic>Pachyma hoelen</italic> grows in wood of 
 <italic>Pinus</italic> exclusively in China, and it is cultivated on pine wood, too. 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic> sensu lato is widely distributed in North America, and both the sclerotia and basidiocarps grow on various angiosperm and gymnosperm hosts (Davidson and Campbell, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1954</xref>; Lowe, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>). A few European locations of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cocos</italic> have also been reported from France, Austria and Switzerland (Prilleaux, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">1889</xref>; Bernicchia and Gorjón, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Based on the high variability observed in the sequenced ITS region of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cocos</italic> samples from the Americas, three taxa seems to be existed in North America, but no voucher teleomorphic samples of these taxa were studied, so we currently treat them as 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic> I
 <italic>, Pachyma cocos</italic> II and 
 <italic>Pachyma cocos</italic> III. Further studies are needed to clarify the taxonomy of this species.
