<p>Broth microdilution was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Sabouraud's dextrose agar (SDA) media were used to subculture yeast following the recommendation of international guidelines [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; for 
 <italic>A. flavus,</italic> potato dextrose agar (PDA) media were used [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The essential oil was prepared in serial dilutions in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). 100 mg of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> essential oil was measured and DMSO was added to 1 ml total solution forming 100 mg/ml. Serial dilution was made in twofold dilution (1.56 mg/ml–100 mg/ml). Each serially diluted essential oil was further diluted in a ratio of 1 : 50 in RPMI media (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of stock solution was added to 4.9 ml of the RPMI), giving dilutions in the range of 0.03125 to 2 mg/ml. 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l from each dilution was filled in the 96-well plates in accordance with CLSI protocol. The essential oil in the well was further diluted when the inoculum was added to the well to obtain dilutions in the range of 0.0156 mg/ml–1 mg/ml [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Fluconazole and amphotericin B were used as standard drugs for yeasts and Aspergillus, respectively. Twofold serial dilutions ranging from 0.25 to 128 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for fluconazole and 0.031 to 16 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for amphotericin B were used as a positive control; 1% DMSO was used as a negative control. Quality was controlled by using quality control strains: 
 <italic>C. parapsilosis</italic> (ATCC 90018) and 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> (ATCC 6258) [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The MIC was the lowest concentration that inhibited the visible growth of the fungi.
