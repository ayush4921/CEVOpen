<p>In agar well diffusion, wells filled with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of different concentrations of EO produced inhibition zones ranging from 3 mm to 17 mm. The largest diameter was against 
 <italic>C. neoformans</italic> and the lowest was against 
 <italic>C. krusei</italic> ATCC 6258. The zone of inhibition of controls varied from 10 ± 2 mm to 22 ± 2 mm. The lowest diameter was produced by 
 <italic>A. flavus</italic> and the widest was produced by 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Two-way analysis of variance showed that both concentration and fungal species had significant effects (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) on the zone of inhibition (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>); for concentration, 
 <italic>F</italic> = 39.08, df = 9,
