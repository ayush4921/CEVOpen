 <italic>Alnus japonica</italic> (
 <italic>A. japonica</italic>) belongs to 
 <italic>Betulaceae</italic> family and originally it was found in Japan, Korea, China and Russia [
 <xref rid="B128-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. This medicinal plant has wide range of biological activities comprising antiviral, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects, as well as the induction of lymphatic and gastroenteric disorders [

 <xref rid="B130-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. It is mostly used for the treatment of various diseases such as fever, cancer, and blood, lymphatic and gastroenteric disorders [
 <xref rid="B263-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>]. Additionally, and most importantly, 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> has been known to have an antiviral effect on SARS-CoV, and its potent bioactive compounds include hirsutenone, oregonin, rubranoside rubranoside B, rubranol, and hirsutanonol, which are extracted from the bark of the 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> plant [
 <xref rid="B130-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. These bioactive components have also been recommended as a promising medicinal plant for the development of potential drugs against SARS-CoV PLpro. In 2012, Park et al. investigated the effect and efficacy of 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> bark against SARS-CoV. An in vitro study showed that 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> is able to inhibit the SARS-CoV PLpro with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value ranging from 3 to 44.5 ÂµM of these compounds (hirsutenone, oregonin, rubranoside rubranoside B, rubranol, and hirsutanonol) [
 <xref rid="B130-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. However, the mode of action suggested that 
 <italic>A. japonica</italic> bark can possibly inhibit the SARS-CoV PLpro activity.
