 <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> (
 <italic>P. corylifolia</italic>) belongs to the 
 <italic>Leguminosae</italic> family and mostly occurs in India, China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and other Asian countries. 
 <italic>P. corylifolia</italic> is known for its antiviral, antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-depressant activities [

 <italic>P. corylifolia</italic> seed extract and showed an imperative inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV PLpro, and their IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 15 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B134-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Furthermore, all these bioactive components were tested by Kim et al., and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of these components against SARS-CoV PLpro was estimated to range between 4.2 to 38.4 µM. In addition, psoralidin and isobavachalcone showed the highest inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV PLpro, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.2 ± 1.0 µM and 7.3± 0.8 µM, respectively [
