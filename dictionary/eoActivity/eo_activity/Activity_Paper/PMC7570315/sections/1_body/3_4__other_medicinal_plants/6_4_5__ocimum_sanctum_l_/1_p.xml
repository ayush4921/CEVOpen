 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> (
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic>) belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> and is commonly known as tulsi [

 <xref rid="B173-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. This aromatic plant is basically found in all Asian countries. It is used for the treatment of diseases such as cough, anxiety, arthritis, dysentery, diarrhea, asthma, fever, skin and eye disorders, otalgia, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiac and genitourinary disorders, back pain, snake, insect and scorpion bites, malaria, and H9N2 influenza disease [

 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> contain several bioactive compounds, such as alkanoids, saponins, tannins, flavonoids, phenols, anthocyanins and triterpenoids [

However, this medicinal plant has the potential to block the activity of different pathogens and can act as a potent antiviral, antifungal, anti-protozoan, anti-malarial, anti-helminthic, antibacterial, mosquito repellent, etc.; its other clinical activities are detailed in

 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> leads to significant H9N2 virus reduction in assessing all three—virucidal, therapeutic and prophylactic—activities using an in vivo model. They suggested that the crude extract of 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> could be a promising extract for developing safe and efficacious antiviral compounds against the H9N2 virus. The protecting effectiveness of the crude extract of 
 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> might be ascribed to multiple mechanisms of action (specific inhibition of viral intracellular multiplication stage and non-specific interference with virus–cell interactions such as masking/blocking the HA glycoprotein [

 <italic>O. sanctum</italic> might be helpful for the treatment of COVID-19, and can potentially block the entry of virus as well as its replication.
