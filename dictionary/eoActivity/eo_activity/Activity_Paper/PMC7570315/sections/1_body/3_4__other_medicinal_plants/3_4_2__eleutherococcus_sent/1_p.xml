 <italic>Eleutherococcus senticosus</italic> (
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic>) belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Araliaceae</italic> and is mostly found in China, Japan and Korea [

 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> leaves have the potential efficacy to inhibit bacterial glucosidase activity, reported in in vitro results by many researchers. The nature of the component of 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic> responsible for its antiviral activity remains to be determined, and is currently under investigation together with the characterization of the target molecules and the molecular basis of the antiviral efficacy of 
 <italic>E. senticosus</italic>. However, its extract is able to inhibit the replication of the influenza virus, and viral replication is common in all kinds of viruses [

 <xref rid="B272-plants-09-01244" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>]. Several potent bioactive components are known to be present in the roots of this medicinal plant, such as phenols, lignans, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, hyperin, rutin, afzelin, quercetin, kaempferol, phenolic acids, triterpenic acids, and anthocyanin, etc. Due to the presence of these bioactive compounds, in vitro results showed some antiviral activity too, by blocking the replication of influenza virus in the cells [
