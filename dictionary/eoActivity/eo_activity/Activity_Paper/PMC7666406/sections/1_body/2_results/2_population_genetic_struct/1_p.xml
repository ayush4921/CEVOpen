<p id="Par11">Hierarchical cluster analysis (UPGMA) revealed that populations sampled from South-West, North-West and North-East regions of Brahmaputra valley were grouped separately (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Cluster I, with a bootstrap value of 100%, included all the populations of South-West region of Bramaputra valley. Cluster I can be divided into two groups, viz., group I contains two populations (CP and LG), whereas group II contains the remaining 3 populations (ML, BP, SS). Cluster II, with a bootstrap value of 100%, included all the populations sampled from North-East region of the Brahmaputra valley. Cluster III, with a bootstrap value of 100%, contained the two populations (GT and KP) sampled from North-Western region of the valley. The UPGMA clustering also revealed that all the populations from Northern Region were well separated from the populations of Southern region of Brahmaputra valley. The remaining South-Eastern populations could not be grouped into a single cluster where population MR was found to be grouped with NG. The principal coordinate analysis also revealed that populations of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. grouped according to regional distribution with Northern populations (KJ, NB, DM, IN and NL) well separated from Southern populations (BP, ML, CP, LG and SS) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which is consistent with the results of UPGMA-based cluster analysis. Furthermore, our model-based clustering analysis using program STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2000</xref>; Falush et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>; Evanno et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2005</xref>) showed likelihood of LnP(D) was greatest when 
 <italic>K</italic> = 4. We found that for 
 <italic>K</italic> &gt; 4, LnP(D) increased slightly but more or less plateaued (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>), i.e. ∆
 <italic>K</italic> reached its maximum at 
 <italic>K</italic> = 4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>), thus indicating that all our selected populations can be included into one of the four clusters, which interestingly corresponds to the geographic distribution of these populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
