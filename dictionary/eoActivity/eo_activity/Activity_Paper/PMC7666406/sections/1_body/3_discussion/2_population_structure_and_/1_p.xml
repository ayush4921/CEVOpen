<p id="Par16">The results of the hierarchical and model-based cluster analyses of ISSR data strongly suggested that the 18 sampled populations of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. could be grouped into four clusters based on the regions of sample collection—South-Western, North-Eastern, North-Western and South-Eastern regions of Brahmaputra river regardless of the approach used for genetic structure analyses. AMOVA also clearly indicated that the genetic variation within population among regions was much higher than that among populations within region. This similarity between the clustering pattern and geographical distribution of populations of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. suggests continued gene flow among populations of the same region (Schaal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1998</xref>) and restricted gene flow between populations of different regions. We found high genetic differentiation but restricted gene flow between populations which were geographically fragmented (Gst = 0.4324, Nm = 0.6564) due to the river Brahmaputra. Since 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. is a short, small plant and reported to propagate mostly by formation and separation of underground stems or parthenogenesis (Mihara 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1960</xref>), the probability of gene flow via seed and pollen dispersal is very low. Moreover, polyploidy complex of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. with 36 to 126 chromosomes (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2002</xref>) will hinder gene exchanges among populations with different chromosome numbers (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2005</xref>). These facts suggest that the observed pattern of genetic differentiation and population structure may not be due to ongoing gene flow rather due to historical association among populations. Earlier studies have suggested that during late tertiary to early quaternary period, 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. survived and adapted through asexual reproduction in the central and southern areas of the Northern hemisphere (Liang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1995</xref>). Furthermore, during glacial maxima, 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. was restricted in small climatically stable refugia areas in small population size (Liang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1995</xref>), the genetic consequence of which may be high level of genetic drift (Barrett and Kohn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1991</xref>; Ellstrand and Elam 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1993</xref>). This could be one reason for observed high genetic variation between regions and low genetic variation among population within region. Similar explanation was also suggested by Zhong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>, where they investigated genetic diversity and population structure of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. from China using sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) marker.
