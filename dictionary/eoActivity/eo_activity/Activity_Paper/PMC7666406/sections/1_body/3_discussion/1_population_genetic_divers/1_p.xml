<p id="Par15">In the present study, ISSR-based analysis of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. populations revealed overall high genetic diversity (Ht = 0.1769). This corroborates with results obtained by Wei and Wu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>) in which they reported genetic variation and population differentiation of 15 populations of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. in central, South Eastern and South Western China. Generally, it is believed that genetic diversity of asexually reproducing plants is low (Hamrick and Golt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1990</xref>). However, several studies on asexually reproducing plants such as 
 <italic>Leymus chinensis</italic> (Zu and Cui 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2002</xref>), 
 <italic>Cyclobalanopsis glauca</italic> (Chen and Song 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>) and 
 <italic>Potamogeton malianus</italic> (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2006</xref>) suggest that genetic diversity of asexually reproducing plants can also be very high. Moreover, we observed comparatively high average gene diversity within population (Hw = 0.1081) than among populations (Hb = 0.0689). Similar results were also obtained by Wei and Wu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>) using ISSR marker and Wu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2002</xref>) using RAPD marker.
