<p id="Par5">In the present study, 18 populations of 
 <italic>H. cordata</italic> Thunb. (28–32 individuals per population) were sampled from 18 locations of North-East India during 2012 and 2013 (Fig.

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All these collection sites are largely distributed on Northern and Southern bank of river Brahmaputra. We divided our sampling areas into four regions with respect to the river Brahmaputra. These regions are (1) North-Eastern region which includes Nalbari (NB), Dhemaji (DM), Itanagar (IN), Kokrajhar (KJ) and North Lakhimpur (NL); (2) South-Western region which includes Cherapunji (CP), Shora Shella (SS), Mawlai (ML), Barapani (BP) and Laitryngew (LG); (3) South-Eastern region which includes Nagaon (NG), Margherita (MR), Golaghat (GG), Tinsukia (TS), Guwahati (GW) and Jeypore (JP) and (4) North-Western region which includes Kalimpong (KP) and Gangtok (GT). From each of the sampling site, random sampling was done covering an area of about 2-km radius. While collecting the leaf samples from each of the population, care was taken to maintain a minimum distance of at 0.3 km among sampled individuals to avoid sampling clonal relatives. Young leaves for DNA extraction were collected in zip-lock polybags, temporarily stored on ice until brought to the laboratory for storage at − 80 °C. The DNA from leaf was extracted following the procedure described by Doyle (
