<p id="Par7">In the present study, all the genetic diversity and differentiation statistics were computed using AFLP-SURV v 1.0 program (Vekemans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2002</xref>; Vekemans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2002</xref>). Bayesian method with non-uniform prior distribution of allele frequencies was used to estimate band frequency distribution (Zhivotovsky 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1999</xref>) followed by genetic diversity analysis within and between population (Lynch and Milligan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1994</xref>). Banding pattern across population, proportion of polymorphic loci (PPL) at 5% level, Nei’s gene diversity (Hj), Shannon diversity index (I), Wright fixation index, Fst (Weir and Cockerham 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1984</xref>), population differentiation (Gst) and gene flow (Nm = 0.5(1 − Gst)/Gst) were also computed in GenAlEx V6.5 (Peakall and Smouse 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2006</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>) and POPGENE v1.32 (Yeh et al.
