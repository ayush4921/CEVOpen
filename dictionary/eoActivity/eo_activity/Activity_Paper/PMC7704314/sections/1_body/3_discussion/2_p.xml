<p>According to the results shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table-2</xref>, dichloromethane extracts from O.F and P.B, ethanol extract from P.B, and ethyl acetate extracts of all plants were active with EC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt;30 μg/mL. Ethyl acetate was the most active extract, which showed EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 9.8, 14.1, 23.7, and 25.5 μg/mL, for L.S, P.B, O.F, and P.F, respectively. Hexane extract from P.B and O.F exhibited moderate activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 84.8 and 87.4 μg/mL, respectively. The activity of these extracts was probably due to the presence of compounds such as terpenoids, flavonoids, and coumarins (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table-1</xref>), which have long been recognized for their antiprotozoal activity [
