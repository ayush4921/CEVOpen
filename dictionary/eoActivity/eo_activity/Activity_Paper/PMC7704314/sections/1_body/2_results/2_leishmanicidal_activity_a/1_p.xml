<p>The effects of extracts on cell growth (viability) were assessed in human macrophages (U937 cells), which are the host cells for

 <italic>panamensis</italic> parasites. Alternatively, the antiparasitic activity of these extracts was tested on intracellular amastigotes of

 <italic>V</italic>) 
 <italic>panamensis</italic> according to their ability to reduce the number of parasites after exposure. The results are summarized in
