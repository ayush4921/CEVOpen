<p>Cytotoxicity was determined according to cell mortality percentages obtained for each isolated experiment (extracts, AmB, Sbv, and culture medium alone). Results were expressed as median lethal concentrations (LC
 <sub>50</sub>), and was calculated by Probit analysis [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] using the percentage of mortality, calculated using the formula in Equation 1, where the O.D of the control corresponds to 100% of viability (Cell growth).
