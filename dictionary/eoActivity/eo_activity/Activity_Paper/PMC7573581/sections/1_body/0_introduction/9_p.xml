<p id="Par10">A protein may contain two binding sites for two different ligands. Under this circumstance, noncovalent ligand binding in the first site may alter the shape and thus the binding characteristics of second binding site. This biological phenomenon is known as allosteric modulation (as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This protein with two binding sites is termed as allosteric protein. The first and second binding sites of that allosteric protein, are the functional (or active) and regulatory sites respectively. The first site carries out the protein’s physiological function (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The ligand in second binding site is the modulator molecule, which allosterically modulates the shape and thus regulating the functional site activity of that protein.
