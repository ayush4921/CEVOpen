 </sup> showed that, 1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone (emodin) can block interaction between SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2, with 94.12% inhibition at 0.05 mM. 1,8 dihydroxy-3-carboxyl-9,10-anthraquinone or rhein and anthraquinone exhibit slight inhibition in spike protein binding. But, 5,7-dihydroxyflavone or chrysin can act as a weak inhibitor.
