<p id="Par41">Bound structure of SARS CoV2 spike protein fragment with ACE2 receptor protein is considered as therapeutic target for SARS-CoV2 treatment and screened with Indian phytochemicals e.g. hesperidin, emodin, anthraquinone, rhein and chrysin by molecular docking study. Among them, hesperidin binds with ASN 63, ALA71, LYS 74 of H2 helix and SER 44 of H1 helix of human ACE2 receptor protein noncompetitively in presence of spike protein fragment of SARS CoV2. Similarly, emodin binding amino acids i.e. ALA 71, ASP67 and LYS 74 are present on H2 helix of ACE2 molecule. Phytochemical anthraquinone interact with spike protein fragment and rhein has no interacting amino acids with ACE2 receptor. So, both of them are not considered as therapeutic agents in COVID treatment. But when chrysin binds with target molecule the interacting amino acids (THR 129, ILE 126 and THR 125), are located on H5 helix of ACE2 receptor protein.</p>
