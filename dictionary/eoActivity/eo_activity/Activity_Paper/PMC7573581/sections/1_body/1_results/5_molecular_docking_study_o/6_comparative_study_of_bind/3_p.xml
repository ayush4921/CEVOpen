<p id="Par31">Considering the lowest binding energy, the phytochemical hesperidin is considered as the most suitable ligand for target molecule, which is formed by binding of spike protein fragment with its human host ACE2 receptor. Similarly, the protein–protein interaction energy of spike protein fragment bound with ACE2 receptor, has been marginally changed (15.4–14.5 kcal/mole) after their binding with phytochemical hesperidin as shown in Supplementary File
