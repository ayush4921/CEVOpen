<p id="Par29">Binding energy of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquin with the bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment are − 8.99 kcal/mole and − 7.83 kcal/mole, respectively. Among these two well inhibitors of spike protein, hydroxychloroquine is bound with docking structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment almost exactly at the same position, compared to that of hesperidin (shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). Their binding energies are also comparable to that of hesperidin (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
