<p>In this study, we report for the first time the antibacterial activity of 7 plant species (
 <italic>Vicia faba</italic>, 
 <italic>Carya alba</italic>, 
 <italic>Juglans regia</italic>, 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum armatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Morella cerifera</italic>, 
 <italic>Sassafras albidum</italic>) and one part of 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> (fruits) on 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic> growth. Each of the 11 plants selected for MIC testing in our study are used in various traditional medical systems in everyday oral hygiene care or as treatments for symptoms related to periodontitis; therefore, the traditional uses of these plants were supported by this study. Moreover, these 11 plants represent a promising collection of sources of natural products which could be further explored for use in pharmaceutical and oral hygiene care product development.
