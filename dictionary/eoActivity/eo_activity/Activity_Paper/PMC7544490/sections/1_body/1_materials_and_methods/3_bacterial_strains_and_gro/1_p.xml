 <italic>gingivalis</italic> strain ATCC® 33277 was rehydrated in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) media supplemented with 5 μg/mL hemin (Alfa Caesar®, Heysham, UK) and 1 μg/mL menadione (Alfa Caesar®, Heysham, UK). Bacteria were grown on supplemented BHI (sBHI) agar plates (5 μg/mL hemin, 1 μg/mL menadione) and supplemented blood agar plates (5% defibrinated sheep’s blood (Hemostat Laboratories, Dixon, CA), 5 μg/mL hemin, 1 μg/mL menadione, 2 g/L yeast extract) [
