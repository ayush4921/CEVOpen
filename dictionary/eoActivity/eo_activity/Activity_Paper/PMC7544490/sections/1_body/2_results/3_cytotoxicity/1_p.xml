<p>All 21 high-activity extracts were tested for cytotoxic effects on human keratinocytes. Extracts were tested at starting concentrations of 512 μg/mL (4–512 μg/mL) with the exception of 
 <italic>Vicia faba</italic> (MeOH) and 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> (stem, MeOH), which were tested at starting concentrations of 128 μg/mL (1–128 μg/mL) due to low supply of extract in the QNPL. None of the plant extracts tested had high cytotoxicity; IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 256 μg/mL to greater than 512 μg/mL. Sixteen samples had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values higher than the range of testing, two (
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> and 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) had IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 512 μg/mL, one (
 <italic>Sassafras albidum</italic>) had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 256 μg/mL, and both samples tested at 128 μg/mL did not exhibit toxicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0239316.g002">Fig 2</xref>). When the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was undetectable, SI was calculated using the highest concentration of extract tested, and reported as greater than the resulting value. 
 <italic>Sassafras albidum</italic> showed the lowest SI with value of 4, while 
 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> (fruits, EtOH) showed the highest SI with a value of 256.
