 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>lentiscus</italic> mastic gum 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. in saliva compared to a placebo gum, finding significantly fewer bacteria in saliva samples after chewing mastic gum. Consistent with the results of our study, no toxicity was detected for 2% 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>lentiscus</italic> mastic dissolved in 38% ethanol against keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT), human osteoblastic cell line (Sa-OS-2), mouse fibroblast cell line (Mc3T3-E), and human gingival and periodontal ligament fibroblast cells [

 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] examined the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>lentiscus</italic> seed oil, finding an LD
 <sub>50</sub> of 37 mL/kg for orally ingested seed oil. Smaller doses (100 uL) of orally administered oil daily was found to have no toxic effects on kidneys, livers, or gastrointestinal systems of mice [
