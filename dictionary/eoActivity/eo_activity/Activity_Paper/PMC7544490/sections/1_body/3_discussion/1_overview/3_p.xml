<p>Aside from the promising antibacterial activity of our extracts, their low cytotoxicity on human cells was also demonstrated. As reported by More et al., a SI greater than 10 (for plant extracts) confirms that the dose that can be administered in most physiological systems [

These results suggest that 13 plant extracts (7 plant species) tested in our study may have therapeutic benefit with acceptable toxicity. However, it is noteworthy that the selectivity index used in this study is based on
