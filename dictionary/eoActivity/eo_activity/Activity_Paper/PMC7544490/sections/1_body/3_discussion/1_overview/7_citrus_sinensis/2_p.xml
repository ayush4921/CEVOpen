 <italic>sinensis</italic> fruit peel. One study of ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> peels found limited inhibition of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic>, with MICs of 12.5 and 12.8 mg/mL [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], orders of magnitude more than 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> woody part extract MIC determined in this study, but other studies have demonstrated lower MICs for 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic> peels against other bacteria. For instance, Tao et al. tested the essential oil from the fruit peel with the following results: 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (MIC 9.33 μg/mL), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MIC 4.66 μg/mL) and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (MIC 18.75 μg/mL) [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Dzotam and Kuete tested methanol extracts of the peel against multidrug resistant gram-negative bacteria and found MICs of 32–512 μg/mL for different 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>coli</italic> strains, 128–512 μg/mL for different 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic> strains, 128–512 μg/mL for different 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> strains, and 256–512 μg/mL for different 
 <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The presence of limonene, linalool, citral and myrcene in the essential oil has been linked to its antibacterial activity [
