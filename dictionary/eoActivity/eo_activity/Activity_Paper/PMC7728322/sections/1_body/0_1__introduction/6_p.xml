<p>Previous investigations on other 
 <italic>Breynia</italic> species revealed the presence of unusual spiroketal sulfur containing glycosides named breinins [

 <italic>B. fructicosa</italic> (L.) Müll. Arg. (
 <italic>B. fructicosa</italic>), but in small amounts namely 10–150 mg each from 30 kg of plant material [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05537" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Literature indicated that up to now limited number of such derivatives have been reported. For instance, breynins A and B were isolated from 
 <italic>B. officinalis</italic> (Koshiyama et al., 1976; Smith et al., 1992), and breynins B-D, G and epibreynins D-H were isolated from 
 <italic>B. fruticosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05537" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. From 10 kg of whole dried plant of 
 <italic>B. fructicosa</italic>, isolated compounds were obtained in amount ranging from 40 to 620 mg. These compounds were then subjected to in vivo anti-inflammatory testing [
