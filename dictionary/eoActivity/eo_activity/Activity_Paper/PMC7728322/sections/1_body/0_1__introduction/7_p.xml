<p>For these reasons, 
 <italic>Breynia</italic> species appear to be attracting candidates to be considered as significant source of secondary metabolites with health promoting or medicinal properties. Thus, 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> extracts were screened in terms of antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activity. Three plant parts namely leaf, fruit and bark were evaluated using a battery of in vitro bioassays to assess its potential biological activity. Furthermore, detailed phytochemical profiles were obtained via chromatographic approach using HPLC-DAD-MS
 <sup>n</sup> analysis.
