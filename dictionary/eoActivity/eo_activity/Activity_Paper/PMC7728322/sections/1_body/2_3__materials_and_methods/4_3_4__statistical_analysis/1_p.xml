<p>All tests were repeated three times and results were done as means following by the standard deviation. The means values comparisons were done by two way-ANOVA following by Tukeyâ€™s post-hoc test at the 5% level of significance using Xlstat software version 2018 (Addinsoft Corporation). Multivariate analysis (Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Clustered Analysis) were achieved using R software version 3.6.1. Before performing PCA, all variables were auto scaled. The selection of the components was relied on two metrics; the components having an eigenvalue above 1 and components which the cumulative percentage of variance explained was equal to or more than 80%. Finally, the correlation coefficient between the phenolic contents (TPC, TFC, TFvl) and the biological activities were calculated.</p>
