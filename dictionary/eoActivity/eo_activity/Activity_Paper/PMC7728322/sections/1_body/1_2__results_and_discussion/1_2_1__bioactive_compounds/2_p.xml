<p>Among the prepared extracts, the methanolic bark yielded the highest phenolic (145.79 ± 0.84 mg GAE/g) and flavanol (35.24 ± 0.39 mg CE/g) content while the methanolic leaf possessed the highest flavonoid content (34.49 ± 0.18 mg RE/g). However, a different trend was observed in another study. The ethyl acetate leaf and fruit extracts were found to be higher in flavonoid content (208.94 ± 50.03 and 259.33 ± 7.37 mg RE/g, respectively) and the methanolic leaf and fruit extracts yielded the highest phenolic content (81.05 ± 0.42 and 53.02 ± 0.95 mg GAE/g, respectively) [

Furthermore, it is important to highlight that plants and their respective ecosystems are connected whereby the type and amount of phytoconstituents are produced with respect to the plant’s environment and living conditions since secondary metabolites are only produced as part of the defensive mechanism of the plant [
