<p>PCA proved to be very useful since it allowed to show a heterogeneous distribution of 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> samples in the respective score plots. Nevertheless, it was difficult for us to achieve the typology of some samples including DCM, EA, MEOH extracts of fruit, DCM and EA extracts of bark and MEOH extract of leaves. For this purpose, the result of PCA was submitted to hierarchical clustered analysis. The purpose of this approach is to emphasize clustering of samples according to their similarity/dissimilarity. The cluster map is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f009">Figure 9</xref>. Six main clusters were obtained among which some were previously identify in the PCA score plots. To highlight the characteristics of the samples constituting the different clusters, the comparison of mean values of each biological activity were reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f010">Figure 10</xref>A. It can be seen, the sample (MEOH-Bark) representative of the cluster 6 was the most active; indeed, it combined a highest antioxidant activity and ability to suppress amylase and glucosidase. Additionally, despite it had lowest Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> chelating activity, it showed excellent inhibition against BChE and tyrosinase on an equal footing with the samples constituting the clusters 4 and 5, respectively. Further, the samples of clusters 3, 4, 5 and 6 were found to be more active inhibitor compared with those of the first and second clusters.
