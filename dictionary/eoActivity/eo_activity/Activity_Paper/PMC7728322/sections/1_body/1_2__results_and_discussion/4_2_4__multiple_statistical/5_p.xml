<p>The correlation between the 11 biological activities and the three phenolic contents (TPC, TFC, TFvl) were assessed to clarify their relationships (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f010">Figure 10</xref>B). The total phenolic content and total flavanol content were positively correlated with antioxidant activities (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, CUPRAC and PBD); that means that the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> samples increase with increased phenolic content. As earlier reported bark presented the highest polyphenolic content, in particular, it contained Epicatechin, epigallocatechin, proanthocyanidins known as powerful antioxidant agents. In fact, Pauli et al. [

 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (L.) Kuntze leaves is link to the presence of abundant catechin compounds such as epicatechin and epigallocatechin. The condensed tannin, i.e., proanthocyanidins constituting of catechin and epicatechin was also point out to possess significant antioxidant property [
