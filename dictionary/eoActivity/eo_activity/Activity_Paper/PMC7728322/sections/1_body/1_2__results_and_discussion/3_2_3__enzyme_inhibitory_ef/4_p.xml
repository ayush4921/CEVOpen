<p>Irrespective of the type of plant parts assessed, the aqueous extracts were the least effective extracts in inhibiting the activity of enzymes. For instance, aqueous leaf extract poorly inhibited the activity of AChE (0.09 ± 0.01 mg GALAE/g) and α-amylase (0.19 ± 0.01 mmol ACAE/g) and no activity was reported for BChE while aqueous fruit extract was less successful in inhibiting tyrosinase (52.44 ± 3.87 mg KAE/g) and α-glucosidase (not active) enzymes (
