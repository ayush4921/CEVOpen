<p>Our results showed that the methanolic bark extract of 
 <italic>B. retusa</italic> has strong inhibitory effects on α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes which may delay the degradation of starch and oligosaccharides. These findings are in agreement with the study of Murugan, Prabu, Chandran, Sajeesh, Iniyavan and Parimelazhagan [

Our data suggested that this potent activity may be attributed to the high level of phenolic present in the extract because phenolics are important bioactive compounds responsible for a broad spectrum of biological activities, including antidiabetic, anti-tyrosinase, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-aging, among others [
