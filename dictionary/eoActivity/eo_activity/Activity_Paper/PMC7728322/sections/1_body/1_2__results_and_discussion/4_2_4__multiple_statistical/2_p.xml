<p>The results of PCA were depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f008">Figure 8</xref>. An estimated 90.5% of the total variation was summarized by the first three principal components, which were found to have an eigenvalue higher than 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, 90.5% of the information from the 11 initial variables (biological activities) can be condensed into relatively three new variables (principal components), which was significant by retaining most information. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f008">Figure 8</xref> displayed that the most important variable contributing to PC1were the antioxidant assays and to a lesser extent the tyrosinase and amylase assays. Thus, PC1 is defined by the antioxidant properties and inhibition ability against tyrosinase and amylase. PC2 was described predominantly by BChE, AChE, amylase and modestly by FRAP and tyrosinase, whereas PC3 was bound to MCA, PBD and glucosidase. Therefore, PC1 can be expressed as the antioxidant power, PC2 was defined as the suppression potency against cholinesterase enzymes while PC3 was considered as Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> chelating ability, the antioxidant level and inhibition ability against glucosidase enzyme. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f008">Figure 8</xref>C displayed the projection of the samples in the space of the first three retained principal components. It can be seen a dispersion of samples in the different score plots, with however the emergence of some groups. Indeed, by observing the three score plots, the methanol bark extract (group A) and water fruit extract (group C), respectively, were outstanding from the other extracts. In regard to both score plots, PC1 vs. PC2 and PC2 vs. PC3, the water extract of barks and leaves (group B), much closed together, appeared to be in a unique group, separated from the others. In addition, in the score plot PC1 vs. PC2, the eight remaining samples seemed not-to-distant; however, by viewing the score plots PC1 vs. PC3 and PC2 vs. PC3, we can notice the separation of DCM and EA extracts of leaves (E) of this large group.
