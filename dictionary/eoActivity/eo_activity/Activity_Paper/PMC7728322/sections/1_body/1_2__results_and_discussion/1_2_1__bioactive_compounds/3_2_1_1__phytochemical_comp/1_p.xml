<p>The extracts were dissolved in deuterated chloroform and in spectra signals ascribable to fatty acid was observed in all the three samples. Then, the residual after chloroform extraction was collected, dried under vacuum and redissolved in deuterated methanol. Residuals of leaves and fruits were dissolved in methanol, and 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR was reported in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f001">Figure 1</xref> in blue and red, respectively. Due to the fact that bark residue was not significantly soluble in deuterated methanol, we decided to dissolve it in D
 <sub>2</sub>O and the spectra is showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05537-f001">Figure 1</xref> in green color. In all the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra intense signal was present in the region between 3–4 ppm ascribable to sugar derivatives, that is confirmed by the presence of signals ascribable to anomeric proton of sugar moiety was present in the spectral region 4–5.5 ppm. In the spectra of leaves and fruits extracts, three singlets at δ 8.15, δ 7 91, δ 7.68 and two doublets at δ 6.78 and δ 6.55 (
 <italic>J</italic> = 8.94) were present suggesting the presence of aromatic compounds. In the spectra of bark there is a broad signal at δ 6.59–7.00, ascribable to proanthocyanidins or tannin derivatives. The screening obtained by NMR suggested that the bark extract is rich in tannin while aerial part and fruit extracts may contain other phenolics. To obtain more detailed information LC-DAD-MS
 <sup>n</sup> approach was used.
