<p>Leaves and fruits chromatograms are quite similar and the identified compounds are reported in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05537-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, no peaks ascribable to procyanidins are detected, main constituents of fruits as observed in NMR are disaccharides that were also detected in LC-MS, but not quantified. Considering the phenolic compounds most abundant constituents are gallic acid and quercetin derivatives. Leaves and fruits contain also flavonoid glycosides that are absent in the barks sample (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05537-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Total amount of phenolics in leaves and fruits are 51 and 32 mg/g, respectively.
