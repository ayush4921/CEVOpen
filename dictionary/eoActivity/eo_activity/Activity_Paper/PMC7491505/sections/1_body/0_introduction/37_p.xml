<p>Thymoquinone, as volatile oil, is abundantly found in 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). It has different therapeutic effects, such as anti-oxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective actions (

 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>). Also, the neuroprotective effect of thymoquinone has been demonstrated against neurotoxic agents such as amyloid-β and α-synuclein peptides (

Findings have shown that glutamate increased cell death, ROS production, and disturbance of the mitochondrial and apoptosis pathway by increasing caspase-9 and Bax expression, and reducing Bcl-2, while thymoquinone attenuated glutamate toxicity via reduction of ROS generation and apoptosis (

 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> seed capsule (500 mg, twice daily for nine weeks) was shown to improve cognition, memory, and attention in elderly volunteers (

 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic>, especially its constituent, Thymoquinone, could be a promising neuromodulator agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
