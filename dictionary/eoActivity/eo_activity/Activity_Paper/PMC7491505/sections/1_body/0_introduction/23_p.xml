<p>Over the past ten years, the impact of curcumin on various diseases was reported to have hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, anti-carcinogenic, thrombo-suppressive, anti-arthritis, and anti-infective activities (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>). Lately, curcumin, as a significant constituent of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, has been reported to have anti-excitotoxicity activity, as well (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). A major enthusiasm has been created due mainly to the lack of toxicity and low cost of curcumin in several preclinical trials for neurodegenerative diseases (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Several studies have demonstrated that curcumin counteracts the depolarization-evoked release of glutamate by reducing voltage-dependent Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> entering from nerve terminals in rat (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Also, curcumin protects neurons from excitotoxicity caused by glutamate through the AKAP79-PKA membrane-anchored interaction network and decreasing mGluR5 and NMDA expression (

 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have found that curcumin protects the cerebral cortical neurons of rats against glutamate excitotoxicity by increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level and activating tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Chang 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have reported that curcumin has protective effects in PC12 cells against the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity through glutathione-dependent nitric oxide- ROS pathway and the mitochondria-dependent nitric oxide- ROS pathway (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Furthermore, Suh 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have shown that by blocking MAPK signals, curcumin alleviates glutamate-induced HT22 cell death (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). The results of an encouraging study have shown that curcumin attenuated the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome activation in a manner dependent on 5â€™ AMP-activated protein kinase (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Hence, curcumin could be a therapeutic agent in the treatment of neurotoxic situations.
