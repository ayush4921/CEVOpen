<p>Extraction time, drug-solvent ratio (% 
 <italic>w/v</italic>) and alcohol-water ratio (% 
 <italic>v/v</italic>) are essential factors in getting maximum yield with optimum therapeutic potential. The extraction parameters have greatly influenced the yield value of the extract as well as the biological activities. The results indicated that the maximum yield with the optimum antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>B. diffusa</italic> was obtained in 5 h, the solvent was 12 times higher solvent ratio and 60% alcohol. Similarly, for 
 <italic>R. emodi,</italic> the optimized parameters was 7 h, six times higher solvent ratio and 70% alcohol. Parameters of extraction were ranging from 5–7 h as extraction time, 6–12 times solvent, and 58–70% alcohol were the best for maximum yield with optimum antioxidant activities for these plant materials.
