<p>Phenols are essential plant constituents. A direct connection exists between complete phenolic content and plant species' antioxidant activity. It is mainly attributed to the scavenging ability of their phenolic hydroxyl groups that are reported to be effective hydrogen donors, making them excellent antioxidants (Vinson et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Thus, it was rational and valuable to determine the total phenolic content of the selected plant extracts. These selected plant extracts showed good antioxidant activity and proved to also have higher phenol content. The results indicated that there was a positive and parallel relationship between phenol content and antioxidant activity. Several studies have shown that phenolic compounds in herbs, vegetables and fruits are a significant antioxidant component, and their antioxidant activity and complete phenolic content are directly related. Cai et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) also found a linear correlation between the content of total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of several plant species. Phenolic compounds, including phenolic acid and flavonoids, can be enriched in aqueous extract (Dudonne et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). The extracts and their combinations showed potent DPPH scavanging potential. However, the extract may contain other metabolites also, and these can also contribute to antioxidant activity (Belyagoubi-Benhammou et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The antioxidant activity of herbal extract could also be associated to its flavonoid content.
