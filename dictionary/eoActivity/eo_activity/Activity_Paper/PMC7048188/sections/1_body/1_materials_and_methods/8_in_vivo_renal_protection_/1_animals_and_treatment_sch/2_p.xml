<p>Animals were randomly divided into nine groups (six animals each). The study was carried out for eight days. Group, I served as the control group that received a normal diet. Group II–VI were administered methotrexate 7 mg/kg/day (intraperitoneally) for the last three days of the study period to induce nephrotoxicity (Morsy et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Group II animals received only a normal diet for the whole study period along with methotrexate treatment for the last three days to serve as toxic control. Group III and IV received combination ABCD with a dose of 200 and 300 mg/kg, respectively, for eight days. Group V and VI received combination ABD with a dose of 150 and 250 mg/kg, respectively, for eight days. Group VII received Ayurvedic marketed combination (Neeri KFT, Aimil Pharmaceutical Ltd, India) with a dose of 100 mg/kg. Group VIII and IX received combination ABCD and ABD with a dose of 200 and 150 mg/kg, respectively, for eight days, but no methotrexate treatment served as sham control of respective combinations. Animals of all groups received equivalent volumes of the vehicles. Rats were sacrificed 24 h after the last methotrexate injection, and blood samples were collected and centrifuged at 3000
