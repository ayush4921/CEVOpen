<p>The antioxidant potential of each extract was determined by the 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The potential of extract to scavenge the free radicals were expressed as equivalent to antioxidant potential. Accurately weighed 10mg of each prepared extract was suspended separately in 70% methanol and vortexed for 2 min, followed by sonication for 25 min. Further, it was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was used for analysis. The prepared extract stock solution was diluted with 70% methanol. Different concentrations of extract solution (10, 20 and 40 µg/mL) were mixed with 1 mL of a methanolic solution of DPPH (0.5 mM) and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. After complete incubation, absorbance was recorded at 517 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Dudonné et al.
