<p>Serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, protein, albumin, globulin levels in serum were quantified by using commercially available kits according to their manufacturers’ guidelines (Span Diagnostics Ltd, Surat, India). Oxidative markers such as SGOT and SGPT were analyzed using a fully automated clinical chemistry analyzer (Chem 5X, Erbachem, Mannheim, Germany). Catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured spectrophotometrically. As quantitative estimation of MDA depends on the formation of MDA as an end product of lipid peroxidation, which reacts with thiobarbituric acid, which produces a pink chromogen thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), TBARS was measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm (Ohkawa et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). Catalase estimation is based on the production of chromic acetate from dichromate and glacial acetic acid in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Colorimetrically, chromic acetate was measured at 570 nm. Under assay condition, the amount of enzyme was expressed as equivalent to 1 μmol H

Renal tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) assay was performed with rat TNF-α ELISA kit (RayBiotech, Inc., Peachtree Corners, GA, USA) according to supplier’s instructions. For determination of oxidative stress markers in the kidney, excised kidneys were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Before analysis, frozen kidneys were homogenized in cold 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).
