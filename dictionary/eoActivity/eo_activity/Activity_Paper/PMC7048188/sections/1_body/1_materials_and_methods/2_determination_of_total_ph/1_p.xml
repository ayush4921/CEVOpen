<p>Total phenolic and flavonoid content was determined for all the extracts. Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminium chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) colorimetric methods were followed for the determination of total phenolic and flavonoid content, respectively (Khan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Standard gallic acid and rutin were used for the quantification of phenol and flavonoids, respectively. Different concentrations of standards ranging from 10–100 µg/mL were used for establishing the calibration curves and the obtained regression equations were used for the determination of total content. The amount of phenol and flavonoids in the extract were expressed as mg/g of gallic acid and rutin equivalent, respectively. Quantitative estimation was performed in triplicate (Khan et al.
