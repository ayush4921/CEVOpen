<p>The extracts obtained by using optimized extraction parameters were used for preparing polyherbal combinations. A randomized block design was used to develop the polyherbal combination. The experiment used a randomized block design with four plant extracts at a fixed concentration and three replications to test the XO inhibition potential and DPPH scavenging activity of the polyherbal combination. A combination of these extracts were dissolved in a solvent. The concentration used for these combinations were 4, 3 and 2 mg/mL, respectively. This concentration was mixed separately with the same volume of solvent to achieve a final concentration of 1 mg/mL for each extract.</p>
