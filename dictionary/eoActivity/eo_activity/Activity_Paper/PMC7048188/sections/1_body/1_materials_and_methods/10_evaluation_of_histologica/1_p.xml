<p>For histological examination, the longitudinal part of the left kidney was excised from each animal. Renal tissue specimens were set for seven days in 10% neutral formalin buffered. Fixed tissue samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological examination. Using light microscopy, three sections of each group of animals were subjected to microscopic study. Changes in renal structure have been classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Scores +, ++ and +++ were assigned for mild, moderate and severe levels, revealing less than 25, 50 and 75% histopathological changes of total examined fields, respectively.</p>
