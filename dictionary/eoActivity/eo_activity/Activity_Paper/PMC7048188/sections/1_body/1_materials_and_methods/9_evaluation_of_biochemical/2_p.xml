<p>Oxidative stress was directly measured by determining ROS in kidney homogenate by using florescent dye, namely 2, 7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2-DCFH-DA). The stored kidney was thawed at room temperature and then washed with phosphate buffer saline. Further, it was homogenized and the cell suspension was prepared in Hanks' balanced salt solution. After that, 10 µM of DCFH-DA was added in cell suspension and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Reading was measured at Ex/Em = 485/530 nm in endpoint mode (Cary Eclipse, Varian, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA; Chester et al.
