<p>The kidney carries out the essential excretory procedures in the human body, therefore becoming the primary target organ for different circulating toxins that can lead to nephrotoxicity. Nephrotoxicity is a renal dysfunction that arises from direct exposure to environmental chemicals or as a side effect of many drugs such as some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aminoglycoside antibiotics, anticancer drugs, etc. (Perazella 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, is widely used in the treatment of various malignancies and inflammatory diseases. However, nephrotoxicity is a substantial adverse effect of methotrexate therapy (Widemann 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The pathogenesis of methotrexate nephrotoxicity involves multiple pathways, including oxidative stress and inflammation (Devrim et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Gentamycin, the commonly used broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic, causes nephrotoxicity in 30% of cases. Long-term exposure of gentamycin results in dysfunction of mitochondria and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overproduction of ROS increases the oxidative burden, which causes inflammation and apoptosis in the proximal convoluted tubular kidney cells. Another primary reason for nephrotoxicity is the generation of free radicals in the kidney cortex that leads to dysfunction of renal proximal tubule cells. Clinically significant nephrotoxicity has been observed due to the administration of various other therapeutic drugs. Several agents have been used, with various degrees of success, to ameliorate or prevent methotrexate nephrotoxicity (Caglar et al.
