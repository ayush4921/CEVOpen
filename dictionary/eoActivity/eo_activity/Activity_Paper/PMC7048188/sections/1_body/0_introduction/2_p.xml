<p>Researchers have evaluated different approaches, including atrial natriuretic peptide, low dose dopamine, endothelin antagonists, loop diuretics, prostaglandin analogues, sodium bicarbonate and Î±-lipoic acid to manage kidney damage due to nephrotoxicity (Waikar and Bonventre 
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). However, the current treatment of kidney damage is still empirical. Therapeutic agents are used indiscriminately without considering the underlying aetiology of kidney damage. Though these approaches have shown favourable results in several experimental models, they have either failed to show consistent benefit or proved ineffective when used therapeutically. Due to the limitations of modern medicine, researchers are exploring medicinal plants that are used to treat patients having impaired renal functions.
