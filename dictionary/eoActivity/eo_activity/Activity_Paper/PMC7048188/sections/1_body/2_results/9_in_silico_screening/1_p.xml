 <italic>In silico</italic> screening, studies help to predict the extent of ligand-receptor interaction based on the binding energies or fitness score. In the present study, the docking of tested metabolites with xanthine oxidase was performed and the corresponding fitness score was &lt; −5 kcal/mol. The highest fitness scored metabolites were further subjected to compare their interaction surface and total intermolecular energy with targeted molecules and proteins separately. We have tried four ligands (Boeravinone b, emodin, lupeol and armepavine) for protein-ligand interaction in docking studies. All these metabolites revealed a high fitness score (&lt; −5 kcal/mol). Interaction of protein and ligand are shown in
