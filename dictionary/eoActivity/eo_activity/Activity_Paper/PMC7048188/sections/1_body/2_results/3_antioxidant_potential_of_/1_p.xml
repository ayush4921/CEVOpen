<p>The hydroalcoholic extract of selected plants were found to be rich in secondary metabolites with antioxidant activity owing to the presence of phenolics and flavonoids. Because of the ease of response, radical DPPH is frequently used to determine any plant extract’s free radical scavenging activity. The maximum DPPH scavenging activity was recorded for 
 <italic>R. emodi</italic> (78.6%), followed by 
 <italic>B. diffusa</italic> (74.25%), 
 <italic>C. nurvala</italic> (68.56%) and 
 <italic>N. nucifera</italic> (64.36%), while that of the control, ascorbic acid, was 83.42%. The DPPH scavenging potential of each extract was increased upon concentration increment. Flavonoids are extremely potent scavengers of most oxidizing molecules, including singlet oxygen and other free radicals. Flavonoids suppress reactive oxygen formation, scavenge reactive species, up-regulate antioxidant defences and chelate free-radical in trace elements (Agati et al.
