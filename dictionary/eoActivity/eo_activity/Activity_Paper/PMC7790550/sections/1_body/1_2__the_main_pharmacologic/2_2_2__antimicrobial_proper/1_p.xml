<p>Studies have shown that quercetin has broad-spectrum antibacterial properties; it not only has a good inhibitory effect on bacteria but also has a significant inhibitory activity on fungi. Several experiments have found that quercetin has a good inhibitory effect on the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> [

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Hossion et al. [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found that novel, artificially designed and synthesised, quercetin acyl glucosides effectively inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> In addition, bayberry extract has significant antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic>, 
 <italic>Listeria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 2.07 to 8.28â€‰mg/mL [
