<p>Quercetin has a broad inhibitory effect on bacteria, but as far as the current research on the fungal inhibitory effect is concerned, its fungal inhibitory effect is not as obvious as that on bacteria. Quercetin has no antifungal effect on 
 <italic>Clostridium neospora</italic> when used alone, but when used together with AmB (amphotericin B), the antifungal activity is greatly improved. This implies that quercetin is a potential adjuvant drug for antifungal treatment of AmB [

 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> biofilms and is a promising synergistic agent with fluconazole [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Quercetin enhances fluconazole-resistant 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>-induced apoptosis by regulating quorum sensing [
