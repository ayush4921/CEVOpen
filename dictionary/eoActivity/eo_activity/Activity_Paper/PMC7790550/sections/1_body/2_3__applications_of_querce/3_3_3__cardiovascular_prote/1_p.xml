<p>The quercetin exerts beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, or cardiotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>–
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], which are closely associated with the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of quercetin. The protective mechanism of quercetin on the cardiovascular system includes (1) reducing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure. (2) The levels of ST segment, lipid peroxidation in the plasma and heart, free fatty acid, phospholipid, total cholesterol, and triglyceride in serum were decreased. (3) It can regenerate blood vessels and reduce blood sugar. (4) It can effectively decrease the thickness of the aortic wall. Edwards et al. [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] found that, among patients with stage 1 hypertension, those who took 730 mg of quercetin for 28 days had a decrease in their systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure. Quercetin presents significant heart-inhibiting effects on LDL oxidation and endothelium-dependent vasodilation [

In addition, a study of 93 overweight or obese subjects at high risk of metabolic syndrome who were given a daily dose of 150 mg quercetin for six weeks showed significant reductions in plasma concentrations of LDL oxidised by systolic blood pressure and atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The protective effect refers to the effects of nitrogen oxide (NO) and endothelial function and the prevention of oxidative inflammatory damage of neurons and the antiaggregation effect of platelets. Wei et al. [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] found that quercetin has a potential for use in treating heart disease as quercetin treatment is found to be capable of reducing LPS-induced cardiac abnormalities in mice.
