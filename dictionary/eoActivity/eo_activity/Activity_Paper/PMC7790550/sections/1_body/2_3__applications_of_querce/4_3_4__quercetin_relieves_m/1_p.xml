<p>According to multiple studies, quercetin can alleviate the toxicity of mycotoxins. Quercetin alleviates mycotoxin toxicity due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Quercetin alleviates mycotoxins by protecting cells from endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis induced by mycotoxins, increasing the level of glutathione peroxidase, enhancing the activity of oxide dismutase, increasing the activity of catalase, reducing the lipid peroxidation reaction, and decreasing the level of ROS (

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] proved that quercetin could prevent a/b-ZOL-induced ROS generation in HCT116, prevent a-ZOL and b-ZOL-induced ER stress, and reduce a-ZOL and b-ZOL-induced apoptosis. Their experiments show that quercetin protects HCT116 cells from a-ZOL and b-ZOL-induced apoptotic cell death. This is in good agreement with the existing literature on quercetin as an antioxidant in various types of oxidative damage [
