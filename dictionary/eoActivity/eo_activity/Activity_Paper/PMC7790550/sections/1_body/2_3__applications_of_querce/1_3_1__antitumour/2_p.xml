<p>Quercetin can affect the cancer cell apoptosis pathway and induce tumour cell death. Experiments have shown that a reasonable dose of quercetin can increase the expression of proapoptotic protein and reduce the expression level of antiapoptotic protein. Granato et al. [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] found that quercetin inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and STAT3 pathways in PEL, which downregulated the expression of survival cell proteins such as c-FLIP, cyclin D1, and cMyc. Deng et al. [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] found that quercetin induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells in a time and concentration-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting breast cancer cells. In addition, Teekaraman and others [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] studied the role of quercetin apoptosis in the human metastatic ovarian cancer PA-1 cell line. The results showed that quercetin induced the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway, thereby inhibiting metastatic ovarian cancer cell growth. Seo et al. [
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] showed through experiments that quercetin induced apoptosis at concentrations in excess of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M by inhibiting STAT3 signalling and could be used as a useful compound for the prevention or treatment of breast cancer overexpressing HER2 (
