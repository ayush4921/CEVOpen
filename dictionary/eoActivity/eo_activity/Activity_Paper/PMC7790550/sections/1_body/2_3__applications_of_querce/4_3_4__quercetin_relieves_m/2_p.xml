<p>Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a common mycotoxin found in feed, which has a variety of toxic effects. The neurotoxicity of AFB1 can lead to memory disorder. Quercetin plays a preventive role in antioxidant stress by promoting the antioxidant defence system and limiting lipid peroxidation. Studies have shown that quercetin can increase the level of glutathione peroxidase (GSH) and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the brain and reduce the lipid peroxidation of AFB1-treated mice. This is consistent with the effect of quercetin on behavioural and cognitive impairment in a Parkinson's disease model [

 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Quercetin can significantly reduce the synthesis of AFB1. In recent years, it has been found that quercetin in tea polyphenols can hinder the conversion of aflatoxin AFB1 to the carcinogenic product AFB1-8,9-epoxide [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], which matches the findings in a study by Ghadiri et al. [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Resveratrol and quercetin (both 5

 <italic>μ</italic>M). There are toxicological implications associated with AFB1 intake such as hepatotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Quercetin can detoxify AFB1 by regulating the activity of glutathione and SOD; also, the participation of mitochondria and lysosomes in AFB1-induced cytotoxicity might be a possible proposed mechanism thereof.
