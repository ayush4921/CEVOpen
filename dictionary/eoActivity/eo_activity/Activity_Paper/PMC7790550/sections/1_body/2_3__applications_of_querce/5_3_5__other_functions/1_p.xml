<p>Currently, quercetin extract is widely used as a nutritional supplement and therapeutic ingredient for many diseases, such as diabetes, which is associated with obesity and circulatory dysfunction (including inflammation and emotional distress) [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Previous experiments showed that quercetin can inhibit fat production and benefit obese people [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The mechanism of action of quercetin is pleiotropic, involving inhibition of intestinal glucose absorption, insulin secretion, and insulin sensitisation activities, and improvement of glucose utilisation in peripheral tissues [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. In addition, quercetin helps reduce lipid peroxidation, platelet aggregation, and capillary permeability and may be used in the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes [

 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Quercetin also reduces obesity-induced skeletal muscle atrophy by inhibiting inflammatory receptors and their signalling pathways. Quercetin is used to prevent obesity-induced muscle inflammation and sarcopenia [
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Ying et al. [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] suggested that quercetin can decrease the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO by changing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, activating the expression of PI3K/PKB signalling pathway-related genes, regulates glucose metabolism, reduces oxidative damage, and has a protective effect on ascorbic acid therapy.
