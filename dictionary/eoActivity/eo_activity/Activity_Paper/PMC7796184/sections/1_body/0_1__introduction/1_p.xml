 <italic>Pulicaria</italic>, belonging to the Asteraceae family, tribe Inuleae, consists of 100 species distributed in Europe, North Africa, and Asia, especially in Yemen and Saudi Arabia and is known for its medicinal properties [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Yemen and Saudi Arabia, plants of genus 
 <italic>Pulicaria</italic> are known for their common uses as herbal teas, insect repellant, and alleviate inflammations [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities were also reported for these plants [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Earlier phytochemical investigations on different 
 <italic>Pulicaria</italic> species afforded several sesquiterpenoids [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], diterpenoids [

 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> [syn. 
 <italic>Pulicaria orientalis</italic> Jaub. and Spach] is one of the 
 <italic>Pulicaria</italic> species indigenous in Yemen. It is a perennial aromatic plant used by local people as a flavoring agent for food preparation [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The plant is used also in the preparation of soaps and as a spicing agent due to their essential oil constituents [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> has an important application in the folk medicine, as it is used for treatment of inflammation, urogenital pyritic conditions, and for relieving fever [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, it has been used as a diuretic and insect repellent [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The volatile oil composition of 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> species originated from different sources was reported. In addition, the antimicrobial, antifungal, antimalarial, and insecticidal activities of the plant were previously investigated [

 <xref rid="B7-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Flavonols, dihydroflavonols, monoterpene glucosides, stigmasterol glucoside, and hydroquinones were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction and CH

 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic>, the nonpolar 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction has not been chemically inspected. Phytochemical investigation of the plant 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract was conducted in the current study as a part of 
 <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> phytochemical characterization. Biological investigations in this study were conducted for the total alcoholic and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of the plant and were rationally selected according to the reported traditional use of the plant.
