<p>Compound (
 <bold>2</bold>) was isolated as colorless needles; mp 239–241 °C. The molecular formula was deduced to be C
 <sub>32</sub>H
 <sub>48</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> from EIMS (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 468) suggesting the presence of an additional acetoxy group in comparison to 
 <bold>1</bold>, which was established by the IR absorption band at 1735 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for an ester group. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectral data of 
 <bold>2</bold> were almost identical to that of 
 <bold>1</bold> except for ring A. The major differences were the presence of signals corresponding to an acetyl group (δ
 <sub>H</sub> 2.04, 
 <italic>s</italic>; δ
 <sub>C</sub> 171.06 and 21.35) attached to C-3 position in 
 <bold>2</bold> instead of a hydroxyl group in 
 <bold>1</bold>. The downfield shift of H-3 proton, which appeared at δ 4.48 (dd, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 11.0, 5.1 Hz, H-3) in 
 <bold>2</bold> compared with the corresponding proton in 
 <bold>1</bold> (δ 3.20), confirmed the presence of the acetyl moiety. The large vicinal coupling constant (11.0 Hz) is consistent with an axial position for H-3 and an equatorial orientation for the acetate. From these data it was evident that compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was the acetylated derivative of pseudo-taraxasterol 
 <bold>1</bold>. On the basis of the abovementioned data and through comparison with the literature [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was identified as pseudo-taraxaterol acetate.
