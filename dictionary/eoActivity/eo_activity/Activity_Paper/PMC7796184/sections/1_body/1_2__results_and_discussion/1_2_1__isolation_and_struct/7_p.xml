<p>Compound (
 <bold>6</bold>) was obtained as a colorless oil and had an [M − H]
 <sup>-</sup> ion peak at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 461 in the negative ESIMS, which is compatible with the molecular formula C
 <sub>29</sub>H
 <sub>50</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>. The IR spectrum of 
 <bold>6</bold> showed absorptions for hydroxyl (3435 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>), five-membered ring conjugated carbonyl (1720 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and olefinic (1655 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) groups. Its UV spectrum showed an absorption band at 236 nm. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum exhibited signals for a hydroxyl proton at δ 4.69 (brs, 4-OH), a methylketone at δ 2.02 (s, H
 <sub>3</sub>-3a), a tertiary methyl at δ 1.31 (s, H
 <sub>3</sub>-9a), two olefinic methyls at δ 1.81 (d, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 0.8 Hz, H
 <sub>3</sub>-5a) and 1.84 (d, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 0.8 Hz, H
 <sub>3</sub>-6a) and four secondary methyls at δ 0.83 (d, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 5.9 Hz, H
 <sub>3</sub>-17a), 0.84 (d, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 6.8 Hz, H
 <sub>3</sub>-13a), 0.86 (6H, d, 
 <italic>J.</italic>=6.8 Hz, H
 <sub>3</sub>-21a and H
 <sub>3</sub>-22). The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>6</bold> showed 29 carbon signals, including one methyl ketone carbon [δ 24.87 (C-3a)], two vinyl methyl carbons [δ 11.78 (C-5a) and 8.75 (C-6a)], two olefinic carbons [δ 139.51 (C-6) and 163.21 (C-5)], three oxygenated carbons [δ 87.24 (C-9), 89.43 (C-4), and 92.59 (C-2)] and two carbonyl carbons [δ 205.18 (C-1) and 207.01 (C-3)]. The above data suggested that 
 <bold>6</bold> was a spiro compound of two five-membered rings with a branched hydrocarbon chain and was considered to be a α-tocopherol-related compound. The relative stereochemistry of the spiro moiety in 
 <bold>6</bold> was also assigned on the basis of comparison of the chemical shift of H
 <sub>3</sub>-9a (δ 1.31) of 
 <bold>6</bold> with those of H
 <sub>3</sub>-9a (δ 1.02) of α-tocospiro A and H
 <sub>3</sub>-9a (δ 1.29) of α-tocospiro B previously isolated from 
 <italic>Ficus microcarpa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-26-00203" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, compound 
 <bold>6</bold> was identified as α-tocospiro B.
