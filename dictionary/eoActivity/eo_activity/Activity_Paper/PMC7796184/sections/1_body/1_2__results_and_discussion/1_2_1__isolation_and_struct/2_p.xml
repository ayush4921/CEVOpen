 <sup>+</sup>. The IR spectrum exhibited absorption bands corresponding to a hydroxyl group (3400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and a trisubstituted double bond (1650 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR spectrum of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> exhibited the signals of seven singlet tertiary methyls at δ 0.73 (Me-28), 0.76 (Me-24), 0.85 (Me-25), 0.95 (Me-27), 0.97 (Me-23), 1.04 (Me-26), and 1.63 (Me-30), one doublet secondary methyl at δ 0.99 (
 <italic>J.</italic>= 5.9 Hz, Me-29), an oxymethine at δ 3.20 (dd, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 11.7, 4.5 Hz, H-3α), and an olefinic proton at δ 5.26 (d, 
 <italic>J.</italic>= 6.8 Hz, H-21). The 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>1</bold> displayed 30 carbon resonances, including two olefinic carbons at δ 139.86 (C-20) and 118.87 (C-21) and one oxygen bearing carbon at δ 79.03 (C-3), indicating a pentacyclic triterpene alcohol with one trisubstituted double bond. According to these data and through comparison with the literature [
