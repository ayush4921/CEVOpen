  <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> is a medicinal herb that alleviates inflammations and fever. Chromatographic separation, phytochemical characterization, and in vitro biological activities of the plant 
  <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract were conducted for the first time in this study. Six compounds were isolated for the first time from the 
  <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction of 
  <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> aerial parts and were identified on the bases of NMR and MS analyses as pseudo-taraxaterol (
  <bold>1</bold>), pseudo-taraxasterol acetate (
  <bold>2</bold>), 3β-acetoxytaraxaster-20-en-30-aldehyde (
  <bold>3</bold>), calenduladiol-3-
  <italic>O</italic>-palmitate (
  <bold>4</bold>), stigmasterol (
  <bold>5</bold>), and α-tocospiro B (
  <bold>6</bold>). Compound (
  <bold>6</bold>) was a rare tocopherol-related compound and was isolated for the first time from family Asteraceae, while compound (
  <bold>3</bold>) was isolated for the first time from genus 
  <italic>Pulicaria</italic>. The total alcoholic extract and 
  <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction were tested for their anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, and cytotoxic activities. The 
  <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction has dose dependent red blood cells (RBCs) membrane stabilization and inhibition of histamine release activities with IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 60.8 and 72.9 µg/mL, respectively. As antidiabetic activity, the alcoholic extract exerted the most inhibition on the activity of yeast α-glucosidase, with an IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 76.8 µg/mL. The 
  <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction showed cytotoxic activity against hepatocarcinoma (HepG-2), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cell lines with IC
  <sub>50</sub>: 51.8, 90.8 and 62.2 µg/mL, respectively. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effect of 
  <italic>Pulicaria jaubertii</italic> might be attributed to the triterpenoid constituents of the 
  <italic>n</italic>-hexane extract of the plant.
