 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">Yadav and Agarwala, 2011</xref>) was followed with slight modifications. The leaf and root powder was collected in the apparatus, separately and was treated with extraction solvents i.e. n-hexane and hydromethanol solution. Both the solvents were heated at 67 ℃, until the siphon tube of the Soxhlet’s apparatus showed a colorless extract. The n-hexane and hydromethanol solution treated leaves and roots extracts were dried using rotary dryer and fan drying method respectively (
