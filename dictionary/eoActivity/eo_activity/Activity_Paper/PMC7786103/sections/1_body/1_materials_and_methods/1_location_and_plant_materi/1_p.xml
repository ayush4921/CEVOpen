<p>This research was carried out in the Experimental Farm of Faculty of Agriculture, Lorestan University, Iran (33°29′N, 48°22′E and altitude 1,125 m), during 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 growing seasons. Weather conditions during the experimental period are shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Physicochemical properties of soil at the depth 0–40 cm are presented in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Different cropping patterns included: sole cropping pattern of sweet basil (80 plants per m
 <sup>2</sup>), and the additive intercropping of sweet basil at 25% (20 sweet basil plants m
 <sup>−2</sup>), 50% (40 sweet basil plants m
 <sup>−2</sup>), 75% (60 sweet basil plants m
 <sup>−2</sup>), and 100% basil (80 sweet basil plants m
 <sup>−2</sup>) stand into maize at 10 plants m
 <sup>−2</sup>. Crops seed were sown in plots whose area was 5 m
 <sup>2</sup>, consisting of five 2-m rows spaced 50 cm apart. Both crops were planted on the same day in early May 2018 and 2019. The distance between plants on the row was 20 cm for maize (
 <italic>Zea mays</italic> L. cv. S.C. 704) and was 2.5, 3.3, 5, and 10 cm for different ratio of sweet basil, respectively. All plots were irrigated immediately after sowing and subsequent irrigations were performed every 5 days. Hand weeding was done as needed.
