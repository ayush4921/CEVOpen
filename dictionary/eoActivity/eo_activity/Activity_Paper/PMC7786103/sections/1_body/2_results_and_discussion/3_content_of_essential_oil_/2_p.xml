<p>In a study by Nobahar and Pazoki (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) on sweet basil, increasing the number of plants per area significantly reduced the content of EO. A reduction in plant density resulted in an increase in percentage of EO due to reduction in the level of plants' competition. However, in our study, there was not a significant difference in EO content between intercropping patterns (forage maize + 100% basil and forage maize + 50% basil) nourished by 
 <italic>A. brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic> and sole cropping pattern of sweet basil nourished by 
 <italic>A. brasilense</italic> and 
 <italic>A. chroococcum</italic>. This showed that, in addition to producing more forage maize per area which is considered as a merit of cropping medicinal forage, the quality was not negatively affected by intercropping with maize when fertilized with N
 <sub>2</sub> fixing bacteria.
