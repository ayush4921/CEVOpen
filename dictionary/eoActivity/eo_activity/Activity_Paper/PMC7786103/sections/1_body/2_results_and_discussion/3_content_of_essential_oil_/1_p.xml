<p>Intercropping forage maize + 100% basil with chemical nitrogen fertilizer resulted in the lowest content of EO (0.53%) while the highest (0.75%) was obtained by sole cropping of sweet basil with N

Thus, sole cropping pattern, as compared to intercropping pattern, adequately supplied light and soil resources to increase EO content in plants. Amaki et al. (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) stated that amount of EO of sweet basil was affected by intensity of light, as EO was enhanced by excessive light. Figueiredo et al. (
