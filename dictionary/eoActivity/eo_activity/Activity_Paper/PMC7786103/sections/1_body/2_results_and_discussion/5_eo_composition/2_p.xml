<p>In the first year of the experiment, the highest amount of α-
 <italic>trans</italic>-bergamotene (1.38%) was achieved by intercropping forage maize + 25% basil and without-fertilizer treatment, but in second year, highest amount (1.7%) was obtained by intercropping forage maize + 100% basil and without-fertilizer treatment. Based on Nurzyńska-Wierdak et al. (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), different levels of nitrogen was shown to have a significant effect on the main constituents in the EO of basil in such that the highest amount α-
 <italic>trans</italic>-bergamotene in sweet basil was found by lowest level of nitrogen. At first year of experiment, the highest content of (Z)-α-bisabolene (3.86%) was obtained by intercropping forage maize + 75% basil without-fertilizer, while its highest rate in second year was found by intercropping forage maize + 75% basil and applying

 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). There are some reports on effects of intercropping patterns on quality and quantity of EO. Rajeswara Rao (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>) figured out that intercropping corn mint (
 <italic>Mentha arvensis</italic> L.) with tomato under different planting dates, in addition to achieving an acceptable corn mint yield, increased the constituents' quality of corn mint EO up to different extents such as menthol (73%), menthone (9.6%), isomenthone (4%), menthyl acetate (4%). Amani-Machiani et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) showed that the highest and lowest menthol, germacrene-D and (E)-caryophyllene were gained by intercropping peppermint with soybean and sole cropping of peppermint, respectively.
