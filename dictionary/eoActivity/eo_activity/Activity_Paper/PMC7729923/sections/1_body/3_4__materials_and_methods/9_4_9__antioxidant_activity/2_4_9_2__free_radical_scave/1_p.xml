<p>The free radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts (
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB, and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo) was determined using the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) method [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. An aliquot (0.5 mL) of a methanol solution containing a different amount of each extract (0.0625–2 mg/mL) was added to 3 mL of daily prepared methanol DPPH solution (0.1 mM). The optical density change at 517 nm was measured, 20 min after the initial mixing, with a model UV-1601 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a reference.The results, obtained from the average of three independent experiments, are reported as mean radical scavenging activity percentage (%) ± SD and mean 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) ± SD.
