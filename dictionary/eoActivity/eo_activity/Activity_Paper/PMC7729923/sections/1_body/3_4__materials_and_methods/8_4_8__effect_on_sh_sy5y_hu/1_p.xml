<p>The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was originally obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD, USA), maintained and kept as described by Cirmi et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Cell culture reagents were from Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy). For cell viability assays, stock solutions of the four extracts were prepared in DMSO at the highest concentration depending on each solubility. Aliquots were stored at −20°C and defrosted prior to the dilution in culture media. For each extract, the highest DMSO concentration was used as a control for the corresponding extract concentration.
