<p>The reducing power of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts (

 <sup>3+</sup>→Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> transformation method [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Different amounts of samples (0.0625–2 mg/mL) in 1 mL solvent were mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide [K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>]. The mixture was incubated at 50 °C for 20 min. The resulting solution was cooled rapidly, mixed with 2.5 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The resulting supernatant (2.5 mL) was mixed with 2.5 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of 0.1% fresh ferric chloride (FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>), and the absorbance was measured at 700 nm after 10 min. Ascorbic acid and BHT were used as a reference. The results, obtained from the average of three independent experiments, are expressed as mean absorbance values ± SD and ascorbic acid equivalent (ASE/mL) ± SD.
