<p>The two types of bioreactors were applied for experimental suspension cultures: commercially available stirred-tank bioreactor (STB) (Bellco Glass, Vineland, NJ, USA), and custom-made balloon bioreactor (BB) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05609-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D). The details of the used STB were presented earlier [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the current work, the system was operated at 33 rpm and continuous 0.5 
 <italic>vvm</italic> aeration. The design of the BB bioreactor used was similar to the BB system previously used by the authors [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In the present study, a larger vessel was employed (170 mm i.d., 300 mm height). Continuous aeration (0.5 
 <italic>vvm</italic>) was provided through silicone foam sparger.
