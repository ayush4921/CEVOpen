<p>The Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> chelating activity of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts (
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB, and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo) was estimated by measuring the formation of the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>-ferrozine complex, according to the method previously reported [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Briefly, different concentrations of each sample (0.0625–2 mg/mL) in 1 mL solvent were mixed with 0.5 mL of methanol and 0.05 mL of 2 mM FeCl
 <sub>2</sub>. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mL of 5 mM ferrozine. The mixture was shaken vigorously and left standing at room temperature for 10 min, then the absorbance of the solutions was measured spectrophotometrically at 562 nm. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as a reference. The results, obtained from the average of three independent experiments, are reported as mean inhibition of the Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>-ferrozine complex formation (%) ± SD and IC
 <sub>50</sub> ± SD.
