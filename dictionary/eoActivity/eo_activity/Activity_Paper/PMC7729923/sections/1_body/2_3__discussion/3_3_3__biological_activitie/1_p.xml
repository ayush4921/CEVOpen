<p>The second part of our research was focused on the comparative investigation of the antiproliferative, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts obtained from in vitro grown biomass and from the parent plant. Nowadays, finding new candidate drugs from the plant kingdom is highly appealing since an ever-increasing number of people is turning to natural remedies to treat or at least to ameliorate the symptoms of many diseases. Among these, chronic pathologies, such as cancer or degenerative ones, represent the main target of interest since, during longer therapies, it is more likely to come across the unwanted side effects of synthetic drugs, that natural ones instead are less prone to have. Moreover, natural extracts have the advantage that they can be used as multitarget drugs that target different intracellular targets [

In this regard, our study emphasized the biological value of extracts rich in both verbascoside and isoverbascoside, indicating that there is a clear link between their high contents in in vitro grown biomass and their proven biological activities. Indeed, the 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extract with the highest levels of verbascoside, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB, among the others present in this study, showed the strongest anti-proliferative activity in SH-SY5Y cells, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values from 1.5 to 1.9-fold lower than those of the values for other two extracts (

This is in line with the scientific literature, where verbascoside is widely acknowledged as an anti-cancer agent that acts following several mechanisms to achieve this outcome, like activating the apoptotic machinery, influencing cell cycle or interacting with damaged DNA [
