<p>Strong primary antioxidant properties were highlighted for all the extracts and a positive correlation between polyphenol content and both DPPH and reducing power assays was found. Among the tested extracts, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB showed a higher primary antioxidant capacity than that of the parent plant grown in vivo. Compared to 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo extract, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB contain higher quantities of phenylpropanoid glycosides and quite a similar amount of phenolic acids. 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C contains a concentration of verbascoside and isoverbascoside superimposable to 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S but about half the amount of phenolic acids, which could explain the lower antioxidant efficacy observed for the extract. These findings suggest that the antioxidant ability of the extracts may be attributed both to the phenylpropanoid glycosides and to the phenolic acids, whose antioxidant properties have been previously demonstrated [
