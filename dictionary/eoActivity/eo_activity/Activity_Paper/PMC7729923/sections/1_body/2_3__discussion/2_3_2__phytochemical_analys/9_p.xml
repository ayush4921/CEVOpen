<p>In other cell cultures investigated, the concentrations of verbascoside are much lower than those obtained in our research but concentrations of isoverbascoside were higher. For instance, 
 <italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic> callus cultures contain a maximum of 4.7 g/100 g DW verbascoside and 5.0 g/100 g DW isoverbascoside. Suspension cultures of this species reached 3.9 g/100 g DW verbascoside and 2.9 g/100 g DW isoverbascoside [

 <italic>H. procumbens</italic> reached a maximum level of 3.1 g/100 g DW verbascoside, but the concentration of isoverbascosideâ€”0.7 g/100 g DW, was higher than in our research [

 <italic>Scutellaria alpina</italic> cell suspension cultures reached maximal content of verbascoside equal to 2.7 g/100 g DW [
