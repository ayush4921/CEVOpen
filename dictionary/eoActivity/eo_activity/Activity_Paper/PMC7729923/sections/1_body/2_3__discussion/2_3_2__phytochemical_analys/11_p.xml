<p>High amounts of phenylpropanoid glycosides are also observed in transgenic root cultures of various plants. The maximum verbascoside amounts obtained by us, above 9.2 g/100 g DW (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05609-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), are comparable with those obtained in 
 <italic>Paulownia tomentosa</italic> hairy root cultures, (max. 9.5 g/100 g DW DW), and higher than in transformed roots of 
 <italic>Rehmannia glutinosa</italic> (max. 1.69 g/100 g DW). Moreover, the highest concentration of isoverbascoside obtained in our research (0.61 g/100 g DW) is higher than in 
 <italic>R. glutinosa</italic> transformed roots (0.35 g/100 g DW) [
