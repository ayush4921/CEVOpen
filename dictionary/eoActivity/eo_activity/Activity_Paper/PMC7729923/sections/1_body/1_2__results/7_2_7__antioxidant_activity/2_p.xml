<p>The primary antioxidant efficacy of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts was examined using the DPPH test and the reducing power assay; the secondary antioxidant properties were determined by measuring the chelating activity of the extracts. Furthermore, linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts and their phenolic content [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The results of the DPPH assay showed that all 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts exhibited strong radical scavenging ability (

 <italic>Vo</italic>-S and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB were the most effective, as confirmed also by the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (0.110 mg/mL and 0.137 mg/mL); indeed, at the dose of 0.25 mg/mL both the extracts showed an activity superimposable to that of the standard BHT (88%), and much higher than that of 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C extracts. At the concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, all the tested extracts reached their maximum effect, which was comparable to that of BHT (96%). Based on the comparison of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, the scavenging activity of extracts and standard decreased in the order: BHT &gt; 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S &gt; 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB &gt; 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C = 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05609-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). A strong positive correlation was found between total phenolic content and DPPH radical scavenging activity (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9839).
