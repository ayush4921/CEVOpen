<p>The sizes of inoculum that provide the best accumulation of the two groups of metabolitesâ€”phenylpropanoid glycosides and phenolic acids are 0.6 g and 0.9 g. It was with these amounts of inoculum that the high concentrations of both groups of compounds were obtained. However, the optimum amount of inocular biomass is 0.6 g, which provides both high production of secondary metabolites (7704.31 and 26.90 mg/100 g DW) and high dry biomass increases (9.88 times) (
