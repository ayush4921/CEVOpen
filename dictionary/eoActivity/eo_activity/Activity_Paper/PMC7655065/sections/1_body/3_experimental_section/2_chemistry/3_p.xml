 </bold>): A solution of 8-nitroquinoline (1 eq) in AcOH (10 ml) was stirred at 110 °C and 
 <italic>N</italic>-halosuccinimide (1.1–1.4 eq) was added in portions to the solution. The mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 1 h, and then cooled to room temperature (RT). The reaction mixture was poured into H
 <sub>2</sub>O (50 ml), and the resulting precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with H
 <sub>2</sub>O. The crude product was purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel eluting with EtOAc/
 <italic>n</italic>-Hexane to afford desired compound.
