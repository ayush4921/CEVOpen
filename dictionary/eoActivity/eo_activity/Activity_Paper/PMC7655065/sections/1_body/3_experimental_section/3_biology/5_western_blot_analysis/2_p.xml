Protein concentrations were determined and equal amounts of protein were separated by 8–15% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) and transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then applied to appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT. Signals were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK).
