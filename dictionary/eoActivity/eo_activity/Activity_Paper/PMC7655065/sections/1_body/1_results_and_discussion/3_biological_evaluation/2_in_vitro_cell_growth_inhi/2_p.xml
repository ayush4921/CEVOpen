 </xref>. Cell line inhibitory results show that halogen-substituted or most aryl/heteroaryl-substituted compounds have similar cellular activity. However, the methoxyphenyl group in 
 <bold>19</bold> and 
 <bold>20</bold> and the 2-cyanophenyl group (
 <bold>21</bold>) result in diminished activity. Comparison of 
 <bold>21</bold>, 
 <bold>22</bold>, and 
 <bold>23</bold> revealed that the cyano group is disfavoured at C2’ of the C3-phenyl group. Among compounds possessing a C3-heteroaryl group, compounds 
 <bold>25</bold> and 
 <bold>26</bold> with pyridine substituents showed improved antiproliferative activity against A549 and HCT116 cells. Compound 
 <bold>25</bold> in particular, inhibits the growth of A549 and HCT116 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.29 and 1.61 µM, respectively.
