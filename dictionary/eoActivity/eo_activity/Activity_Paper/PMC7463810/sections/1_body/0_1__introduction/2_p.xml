<p>Grains (rice, corn, barley, wheat, oat, millet, etc.) are staple foods worldwide. Grains belong to the monocot Poaceae family and are widely cultivated to obtain the edible components of their fruits. Whole grains have an outer bran coat, a starchy endosperm, and a germ. Concerning the medicinal values of grains, previous studies have demonstrated that active ingredients such as polyphenols in sorghum bran [

The bioactive phytochemicals present in rice bran such as ferulic acid, tricin, Î²-sitosterol, g-oryzanol, tocotrienols/tocopherols, phytic acid are regarded to possess chemo-preventive potential [
