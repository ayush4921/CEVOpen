<p>On the other hand, the abundancy of macrophages and tumor infiltrated lymphocytes in colon tumors were determined by flow cytometry (with anti-CD11b &amp; anti-F4/80 antibodies) and immunohistochemical staining (with anti-CD8 antibody), respectively. Tricin-H treatment significantly reduced the number of macrophages in tumor (
