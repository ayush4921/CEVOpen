<p>Results showed that tricin treatments at these two tested dosages did not affect the final body weights of mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), while the chemotherapeutic treatment FOLFOX slightly decreased the body weight. Tumor growth in the rectum was monitored using IVIS imaging as the colon tumor cells were tagged with luciferase. The tumor burden in terms of bioluminescent signal emission (expressed as average radiance) increased from day 9 onwards in all groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,C). Treatment with Tricin-H or FOLFOX resulted in obvious inhibitory effects on tumor growth in rectum as lower average radiance was observed in these groups. On day 18, significant smaller tumor size in Tricin-H group was shown when compared with untreated control group (
