<p>In addition, the inhibitory effects of tricin on lung metastasis were further confirmed by histological assessments. Tumor burden in lungs were determined in the paraffin-embedded sections after H&amp;E staining.

Overall, FOLFOX treatment was shown to be the most potent in term of inhibition of tumor growth and lung metastasis, while efficacy of Tricin-H treatment could be comparable to that of FOLFOX. Nonetheless, the Tricin-H treatment did not cause body weight loss as FOLFOX treatment did, although the difference between the FOLFOX and control groups was not statistically significant (
