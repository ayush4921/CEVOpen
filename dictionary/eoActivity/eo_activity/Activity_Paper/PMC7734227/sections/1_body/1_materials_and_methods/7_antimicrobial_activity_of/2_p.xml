<p id="p0050">The antimicrobial activity of EPS was tested against strains of microorganism using agar well diffusion method (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cheesbrough 2000</xref>). Microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) were cultivated on their respective broth and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and 28 °C for 48 h for bacteria and fungi, respectively. The inoculum size was a to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard at 600 nm using visible spectrophotometer (UNICO S-1100 RS). A sterile swab stick moistened with bacterial or fungal inoculum was spread on Mueller Hinton agar. Subsequently, wells of 4 mm diameter were bored into the agar medium and filled with 50 μl of EPS (1.0 mg/ml). Antibiotics namely; amoxicillin and ketoconazole were used as positive control, while sterile distilled water was served as negative control. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and 25 °C for 72 h for bacteria and fungi, respectively. After incubation, zones of inhibition were measured and recorded in millimeters (mm). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of EPS was determined by varying concentrations of 0.25 mg/ml to 1.0 mg/ml. The lowest concentration of EPS that shown no visible growth were regarded as MIC.
