<p id="p0100">Figure S1(supplementary file 1) shows FT-IR spectra of EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in a submerged culture without agro-wastes, EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in submerged culture supplemented with groundnut shell, EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in submerged culture supplemented with coconut shell and EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in submerged culture supplemented with pineapple peel. The wave number (cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) interpreted for functional groups in EPS were shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A peak of 3448.84 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 3404.47 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> indicated hydroxyl group (-OH). A peak around 2929.97cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 2937.68 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> suggested the presence of methyl (–CH
 <sub>3</sub>). Bands at 1639.55 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1724.42 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> were assigned to carbonyl (-C=O). The −C=O group (carbonyl), –CH
 <sub>3</sub> group (methyl) and –OH group (hydroxyl) were functional groups in EPS produced by 
 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> spp. The result is in agreement with a previous study by 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al. (2013)</xref> who conducted FT-IR analysis on EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic>. Findings of 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al. (2014)</xref> indicated sharp peak in FT-IR spectra of functional groups in fungal EPS, which ranged from 1400-1500 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1631.45 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The band at 1,162 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to 1,4-glycosidic linkage in polysaccharides that gives absorption bands in the range of 1,175–1,140 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Nikonenko et al., 2000</xref>). The different functional groups in EPS occurred as a result of varying contents of monosaccharide composition. Fungal EPSs contain sugars of different monosaccharide units such as glucose, mannose, galactose, xylose, arabinose, fucose and rhamnose (
