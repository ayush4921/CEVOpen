<p id="p0085">Agro-industrial wastes contain nutrients and bioactive compounds that can be biologically converted into value added products and this therefore, remain circular strategies, implementing policy regulation and most cost-effective methods to utilize lignocellulose biomass as eco-friendly alternative to increase biobased products (

 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> to enhance production of EPS. 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the yield of EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> in a submerged culture supplemented with agro wastes. 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> produced EPS of 1.20 g/L in a submerged culture without agrowaste. When 4.0 mg/L of agrowaste was supplemented into submerged culture, EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> was within 2.0–3.8 g/L. When 12.0 mg/L and 20.0 g/L of agrowastes were added into submerged culture, EPS produced by 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> ranged from 2.0 to 2.7 g/L and 2.0–5.6 g/L, respectively. 
 <italic>P. pulmonarius</italic> produced more EPS when agrowastes was supplemented into submerged culture. The higher proportion of EPS from culture media containing agro-wastes could be attributed to colonizing potential of 
 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> spp. on various agro-industrial residues (

 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> spp. possesses ability to grow on varieties of lignocellulosic biomass, utilizing them as substrates to degrade both natural and anthropogenic aromatic compounds, which occurs by virtue of nonspecific oxidative enzymatic system that consist mainly laccases, phenol oxidases, manganese peroxidases and versatile peroxidases (

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Sekan et al., 2019</xref>). The degrading enzymes in 
 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> spp. mycelia enable them to store some metabolic products such as sterols, triterpenes, phenolic compounds and largely; polysaccharides (
