<p id="p0120">The variability observed in biofunctionality of EPS against microorganisms, free radicals and towards the growth of 
 <italic>L. delbrueckii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. thermophiles</italic> could due to the content and quantity of monosaccharides as well as their molecular weight. Biological activities and therapeutic effects of polysaccharides depend on specific glycosidic linkages, degree of branching, monosaccharide composition and molecular weight (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). EPSs are natural polymers of microbial products with novel biological properties (anticancer, antimicrobial and antioxidants) and thus, serve as valuable resources with multiple biotechnological applications in industries.
