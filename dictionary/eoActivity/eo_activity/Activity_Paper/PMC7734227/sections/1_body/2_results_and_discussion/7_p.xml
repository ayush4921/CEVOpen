 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows antioxidant activity of EPS against DPPH, OH, Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and NO. The scavenging activity of EPS ranged from 67.80-81.80%, 60.60–81.20%, 70.40–84.70%, 78.40–88.50% against DPPH, OH
 <sup>−</sup>, Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> and NO, respectively. 
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2017)</xref> revealed EPS as antioxidant agent that scavenged OH
 <sup>-</sup>and DPPH radicals. The researchers revealed that EPS exhibited antioxidant activity of 100%, which is the same as scavenging activity of vitamin C. In the findings of 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2015)</xref>, EPS produced by submerged culture of 
 <italic>Inocutus hispidus</italic> showed antioxidant activities of 70.7% on hydroxyl and 50% on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radicals. EPS produced by 
 <italic>Gomphidius rutilus</italic>, mutant 
 <italic>Cordyceps militaris</italic> SU5-08 and 
 <italic>Pleurotus</italic> spp. in submerged fermentation demonstrated pronounced antioxidant effects on superoxide anion, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl radical, and reducing power (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bamigboye et al., 2016</xref>). EPS have different monosaccharide composition with functional groups such as –OH, –CH
 <sub>3</sub>, –COOH, and –C=O that substantiate its free radical scavenging and metal chelating activities (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2013</xref>). Such functional groups in biomolecules or functional foods are stable enough to donate electrons to reduce the free radicals to a more stable form or react with the free radicals to dismiss the radical chain reaction (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Leung et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Lobo et al., 2010</xref>). Fungal polysaccharides (extra- and intra-cellular) are of great economic importance with wide variety of biological activities, that promote health benefits 
 <sup>with</sup> relatively nontoxic property (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Mantovani et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Santa et al., 2015</xref>). Exopolysaccharides from different Basidiomycota are reported to have a large potential for human health maintenance as well as reducing the risk of various diseases. 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> polysaccharides suppressed cell viability, colony-formation, and triggered cell apoptosis and thus, can be used as a promising alternative or supplementary medicine for cancer therapy (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2019)</xref> revealed that 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> polysaccharides and 
 <italic>Polyporus umbellatus</italic> polysaccharides significantly enhanced the phagocytic function of macrophages and the activity of NK cells. EPS, having displayed different bioactivities, can be combined with compounds of potential value to produce new drugs for better and effective treatments of organic diseases.
