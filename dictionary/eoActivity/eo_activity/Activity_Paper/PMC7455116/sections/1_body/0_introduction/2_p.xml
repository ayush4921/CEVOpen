<p id="para0005">In face of gradual exhaustion of fossil energy shortage around the globe, biomass energy is considered to be the most green and sustainable alternative with the environmental friendliness for worldwide utilization

 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Among myriads of bioresources of biomass energy, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were effective electrochemical systems to convert chemical energy for bioelectricity generation via simultaneous waste biotreatment and product biosynthesis

 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. However, the relatively low capacity of bioelectricity generation still greatly limited its potentials for practical applications due to the low electron transfer efficiency 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. To overcome this disadvantage, exogenous supplementation of redox mediators (RMs) was considered to effectively improve the electron transfer capability for augmenting power generation [
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Regarding such electroactive RMs, several pioneer works selected artificially synthesized compounds for feasibility study

 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. For example, aromatic compounds with promising electrochemically active functional groups (e.g.,-OH and -NH
 <sub>2</sub>) at 
 <italic>ortho</italic> or 
 <italic>para</italic> positions could exhibit significant redox capabilities to effectively enhance power-generating capabilities in MFCs 
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Compared with amino group, hydroxyl group sometimes owned the more reversible and stable electrochemical activity for electron-shuttling 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. However, for green sustainability using synthetic compounds as RMs may still introduce several inevitable concerns for practice (e.g., inhibitory potency for biocompatibility towards biological systems) [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Therefore, natural resources or products were recently considered to replace such artificially synthesized compounds for sustainable applications. Several studies clearly revealed that appropriate supplementation of natural products abundant in electrochemically active substances could significantly promote simultaneous bioelectricity generation and wastewater treatment in MFCs

 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Recently, Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> extracted natural herbal substances abundant in anthocyanins to effectively increase nearly threefold efficiency of bioelectricity generation in MFCs. From the perspective of chemical structure, in fact these bioelectricity-stimulating substances were mostly polyphenols, which are abundant in natural plants
