 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> , the retention time peak of these three standards increased with the increase in concentration of GA, EGCG and CAF. The linear relationship between the integral area of the retention time peak and the concentration of the three standards was shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>(D). As indicated in the calibration line, the concentration of these three standards and the integral area of corresponding retention time peak showed a well-correlated linear relationship. The corresponding concentrations of GA, EGCG and CAF in the two extracts could be quantitatively determined by matching the integral area of corresponding retention time peak with the standard calibration line. The corresponding concentrations of these three standards in the water extraction and MEOH extraction were listed in

 <sup>1</sup> nearly at the same level. The content of GA in the water extraction was nearly 4 times of that in MEOH extraction, while the content of EGCG was only ca. 50%. These indicated that the contents of these three standards and other unknown substances in the two extracts also exhibited significantly different. This considerable difference might result in diverse outcomes of electrochemical and antioxidant activities as revealed in details afterwards.
