<p id="para0022">As indicated in these calculated indices (
 <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ), continuous increases of Shannon's Diversity Index (Hâ€™) and decreases of Shannon's Evenness Index (J) from phylum to family in both MFC-A and MFC-B suggested that the bacterial community tended to be highly diverse with low evenness if more specific levels were considered. This might suggest that some species populations were possibly on the verge of extinction as well. Furthermore, comparing the two different bacterial communities before and after the supplementation of MEOH extract, both the Shannon's Diversity Index and Shannon's Evenness Index exhibited significant decrease. This result was consistent with significant extinction of species as microbial community analysis indicated.
