<p id="para0018">To reveal the electrochemical capability of water extract and MEOH extract from green tea (e.g., reversibility and stability of oxidation and reduction potential peaks), 100 cycles CV scanning of these candidate redox mediators with the same mass concentration was also carried out 
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As indicated in 
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> , both the water extract and MEOH extracts of GT exhibited significant redox potential peaks, which directly reflected the bioenergy-stimulating capability. Regarding the electrochemical reversibility, the redox peaks of water extract tended to be stabilized after serial CV scanning (i.e., repeated reduction and oxidation) and both oxidation peaks and reduction peaks could be clearly revealed. However, the redox peaks of MEOH extract seemed to show significant electrochemical instability of CV profiles and gradually attenuated. This was likely due to antioxidant and/or anti-reductants compositions present in most of extracted contents. Therefore, it could be seen that the water extract owned more significant electroactive capabilities than MEOH extract for bioenergy extraction. Since both the extracts were mixtures of phenolic acids and catechins, especially GA and EGCG, the redox capability should be the overall responses present of the electrochemical components. In fact, the redox capabilities of both GA and EGCG were also evaluated by CV inspections under the same scanning conditions for comparison. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> , both GA and EGCG owned the chemical structure with three consecutive hydroxyl groups attached to the benzene ring. However, both redox capabilities of GA and EGCG were exhibited in significant differences. The CV profile of GA emerged significant redox potential peaks with higher stable reversibility. However, the redox capability of EGCG tended to be attenuated possibly due to electrochemical instability. This might indicate that GA owned more significant electrochemical capability than EGCG for electron-shuttling catalysis. Moreover, this seemed to explain why the redox capability of water extract was greater than that of MEOH extract. The water extract contained higher amount of electrochemically convertible GA, leading to the difference of electrochemical capability from MEOH extract.
