 <sub>50</sub> values 6.24–11.96 μM against MCF-7, HeLa, A549, and Hep G-2 cell lines. The preliminary research indicates that the presence of the methyl group at the C-1 position and the substituted group at C-9 in the structure of these thymol derivatives seem to be essential for the inhibition of the proliferation of four cancer cell lines [
