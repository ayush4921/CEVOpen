<p>Sun et al. [
 <xref rid="B120-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>] described borneol-modified poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA based on a facile and effective stereochemical strategy, generating an antibacterial copolymer named P(MMA-
 <italic>co</italic>-BA)â€”compound 
 <bold>148</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f043">Figure 43</xref>). This copolymer, which effectively prevents bacterial adhesion and is environmentally benign, might be successfully applied for the prevention of bacterial colonization in biomedical devices. Its unique antibacterial character depends on the percentage of BA segments in the copolymer.
