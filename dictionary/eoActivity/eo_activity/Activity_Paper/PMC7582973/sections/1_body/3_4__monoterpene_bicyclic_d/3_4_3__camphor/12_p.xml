<p>Mikláš et al. presented an interesting set of homochiral quaternary ammonium sulfonamides bearing hydrophobic camphor derived moieties [
 <xref rid="B101-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. The authors used commercially available (1
 <italic>S</italic>)-(+)-camphor-10-sulfonic acid 
 <bold>125</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f032">Figure 32</xref>), as a precursor for targeted monoterpene-based sulphonamides molecules 
 <bold>126</bold>–
 <bold>128</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f032">Figure 32</xref>). Optically active quaternary ammonium bromides 
 <bold>126</bold>–
 <bold>128</bold> containing camphor components were tested as antibacterial and antifungal agents and almost all of them show important antimicrobial activities. Compound 
 <italic>N</italic>-{2-[((1
 <italic>S</italic>, 4
 <italic>R</italic>)-7,7-dimethyl-2-oxobicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-1-yl)methylsulfonamido]ethyl}-
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-dimethyltetradecan-1-aminium bromide 
 <bold>128</bold> is regarded as highly active against tested bacteria and fungi. The microbiological activity of this bromide 
 <bold>128</bold> is approximately 25 times more effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 100 times more active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> than commercially used antimicrobial standard: Benzalkonium bromide.
