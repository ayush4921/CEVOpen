<p>(+)-Camphoric acid 
 <bold>120</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f031">Figure 31</xref>), which is the product of oxidation of (+)-camphor, was a substrate for an effective technique for the one-stage synthesis of new polycyclic nitrogen-containing compounds [
 <xref rid="B100-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In this work, various aliphatic and aromatic diamines were selected as reagents for target polycyclic molecules because of the considerable role in the medicinal and organic chemistry of nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds. In vitro screening for the activity of the influenza virus A was performed for all synthesized polycyclic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, and synthetic analogs of natural alkaloids. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f031">Figure 31</xref> shows selected structures (
 <bold>121</bold>â€“
 <bold>124</bold>), which were most effective in inhibiting the influenza virus A (H1N1). Compound 
 <bold>124</bold>, exhibiting the best antivirus agent among others, has inhibitory activity against different strains of influenza virus A. This quinazoline like agent 
 <bold>124</bold> has inhibitory activity against strain H5N2 comparable to reference compounds. In the case of effective inhibiting of strain H1N1, molecule 
 <bold>124</bold> indicates an antivirus activity exceeding that of reference compounds.
