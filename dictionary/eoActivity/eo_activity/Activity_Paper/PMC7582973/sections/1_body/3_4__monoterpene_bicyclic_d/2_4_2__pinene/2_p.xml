<p>Song and co-workers focused their attention on the preparation of novel 3-cyanopyridine derivatives of (–)-
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene 83 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f019">Figure 19</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B77-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. All compounds were evaluated in vitro against four bacteria (
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterobacter aerogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic>) and a fungus (
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>). The tested compounds exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, weak antibacterial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>E. aerogenes</italic>, and moderate antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>. 4-(3,4-Difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxy-7,7-dimethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6,8-methanoquinoline-3-carbonitrile 
 <bold>83h</bold> with double fluoro substituents at 
 <italic>m</italic>- and 
 <italic>p</italic>-position on the pyridine ring demonstrates the best antimicrobial activity against overall strains.
