<p>Camphor, 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one, is an abundant monoterpenoid with a bicyclic framework structure. This inexpensive natural compound occurs in dextrorotatory form, i.e., 
 <italic>R</italic>,
 <italic>R</italic>-(+)-camphor, and was one of the first plant metabolites isolated in the chemically pure form [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Nowadays, it is obtained through distillation of camphor laurel tree wood (
 <italic>Cinnamomum camphora</italic> (L.) J.Presl) or otherwise by chemical transformation of other natural products, among other turpentines [

 <italic>S</italic>,
 <italic>S</italic>-camphor) only exists in a synthetic form or very small quantities in specific species of plants [
