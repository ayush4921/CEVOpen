<p>The next example, showing the use of naturally occurring camphor as a substrate, led to obtaining imines 
 <bold>100</bold>–
 <bold>102</bold>, and also hydrazones 
 <bold>103</bold>–
 <bold>105</bold>, which belong to 
 <italic>R</italic>,
 <italic>R</italic>-(+)-camphor derivatives [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f026">Figure 26</xref> presents a few selected examples from a large set of synthesized compounds. Antimycobacterial activity against 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> ATCC 27294 was investigated for all the obtained (+)-camphor derivatives and the results were satisfactory. (
 <italic>E</italic>)-2-Hydroxy-
 <italic>N</italic>-(1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-ylidene)aniline 
 <bold>100</bold>, one of the imine derivatives, exhibits the best activity (minimal inhibitory concentration MIC = 3.12 µM). The antimycobacterial activity against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> of this (+)-camphor derivative is comparable to that of the antitubercular drug ethambutol. The other derivatives exhibit modest antimycobacterial activities at a range of 25–50 µM. In vitro tests against cancer cell lines show noncytotoxic activities for all the (+)-camphor derivatives.
