<p>Wang’s group synthesized a series of novel hydronopylformamides derivatives 
 <bold>84</bold> from (–)-
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene and evaluated the repellency of these derivatives against the cockroach 
 <italic>Blattella germanica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f019">Figure 19</xref>). The results showed that only the compound with methyl, ethyl, phenyl, and 4-chlorophenyl units exhibited repellency against 
 <italic>B. germanica</italic>. Compound 3-((1
 <italic>S</italic>,5
 <italic>S</italic>)-6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]heptan-2-yl)-
 <italic>N</italic>-methylpropanamide 
 <bold>84a</bold> shows a much better repellency than other derivatives and the traditional insect repellent 
 <italic>N</italic>,
 <italic>N</italic>-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET) [
