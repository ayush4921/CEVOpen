<p>Sokolova et al. [
 <xref rid="B97-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] presented the efficient synthesis of 
 <italic>α</italic>-truxillic acid derivatives containing a monoterpenoid fragment. The authors used natural terpene, (+)-camphor, as a starting monoterpenoid because of its high biological activity and commercial availability. Novel (+)-camphor derivative of 
 <italic>α</italic>-truxillic acid, namely 2,4-diphenyl-
 <italic>N</italic>

 <bold>112</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f028">Figure 28</xref>), was investigated for its analgesic activity in in vivo tests. The tested compound containing the cyclobutane unit and monoterpene bicyclic element at a dose of 10 mg/kg (per os) has good analgesic activity. Importantly, 
 <italic>α</italic>-truxillic acid (tested for the same dose) did not show analgesic activity. Thus, the cause of considerable analgesic activity occurring in the tested compound is the introduction of (+)-camphor 
 <bold>112</bold> fragment into 
 <italic>α</italic>-truxillic acid.
