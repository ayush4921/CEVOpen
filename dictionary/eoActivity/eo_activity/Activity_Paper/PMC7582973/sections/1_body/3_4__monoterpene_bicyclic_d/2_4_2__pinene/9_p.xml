<p>Lin et al. [
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] presented the efficient synthesis of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene-based dithiadiazoles 
 <bold>92</bold> by the cyclization reaction of 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene-based disubstituted phenyl acyl amino thioureas 
 <bold>91</bold>. The experiments showed that both compounds have weak herbicidal activity and the inhibition rates against fungi (
 <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> L., 
 <italic>Physalospora piricola</italic>) are moderate except for 2,2′-methyl-substituted derivatives. A better plant growth-regulating activity was observed for derivatives with halo groups as compared to the other functional groups (
