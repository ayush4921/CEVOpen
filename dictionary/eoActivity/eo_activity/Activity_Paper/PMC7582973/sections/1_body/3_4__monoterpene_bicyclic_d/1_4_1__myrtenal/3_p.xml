<p>Duan’s group also focused their attention on the preparation of novel myrtenal-based 2-acyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones [
 <xref rid="B65-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. These compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antifungal and herbicidal activities. Some of those myrtenal derivatives exhibit favorable antifungal activity at 50 mg/L. Myrtenal-derived 2-(
 <italic>p</italic>-methylbenzoyl)-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione 
 <bold>71a</bold> demonstrates 83.7% and 72.5% inhibition rates against corn southern leaf blight (
 <italic>Bipolaris maydis</italic>) and apple root spot (
 <italic>Physalospora piricola</italic>), respectively, and myrtenal-derived 2-(3′,5′-dimethylbenzoyl)-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione 
 <bold>71b</bold> has a 72.5% inhibition rate against 
 <italic>P. piricola</italic> (the positive control commercial fungicide chlorothalonil with growth inhibition rates of 90.4% and 75.0% against 
 <italic>B. maydis</italic> and 
 <italic>P. piricola</italic>, respectively). Furthermore, most of the derivatives exhibit excellent herbicidal activity against the root-growth of rape (
 <italic>Brassica campestris</italic>) at 100 mg/L, with inhibition rates of 80.2% to 99.1%, showing much better herbicidal activity than that the commercial herbicide flumioxazin (positive control) with an inhibition rate of 63.0% (
