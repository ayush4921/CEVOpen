<p>Another work presents (–)-bornyl ester derivatives with 
 <italic>N</italic>-containing heterocycles as vaccinia virus (VV) inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B98-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Some of the structures of the large set designed and synthesized by Sokolova et al. are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f041">Figure 41</xref>. Bioassay results confirmed that four (–)-borneol derivatives (
 <bold>143</bold>, 
 <bold>144</bold>) exhibit the best inhibitory activity against VV and low cytotoxicity. The authors emphasized two important structural issues that affect high anti-VV activity. Firstly, SAR studies suggest that the incorporation of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-heterocyclic unit into the 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane scaffold caused a significant improvement to antiviral activity. Secondly, (–)-borneol does not exhibit activity against VV. Thus, the presence of both heterocyclic elements and 1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptane fragment is responsible for the antiviral activity against VV. The effectiveness of presented esters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f041">Figure 41</xref>, compounds 
 <bold>143</bold> and 
 <bold>144</bold>) is comparable to the reference drug Cidofovir and suggests that those (–)-borneol heterocycle derivatives should be considered as potential anti-VV drug candidates.
