<p>Borisova et al. presented the antiulcerogenic activity of heterocyclic (–)-borneol derivatives [
 <xref rid="B116-ijms-21-07078" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Some selected structures of the prepared set are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-07078-f040">Figure 40</xref>. Compounds 
 <bold>140</bold> and 
 <bold>142</bold> containing piperazine moiety demonstrate antiulcerogenic activity on the indomethacin-induced ulcer model. Moreover, those (–)-bornyl ester derivatives possess a considerable antiulcerogenic effect, which is comparable to that shown by Omeprazole and Famotidine, used as standards. Bornyl 2-piperazinoacetate with a non-substituted piperazine moiety 
 <bold>140</bold> shows maximum antiulcerogenic activity. Furthermore, this ester has a significant gastroprotective effect on the ethanol-induced ulcer model, which was similar to the one presented by Omeprazole. Therefore, further biological research into this (–)-borneol derivative containing piperazine moiety 
 <bold>140</bold> should be aimed at the implementation of this compound as an antiulcerogenic agent.
