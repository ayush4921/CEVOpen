 <italic>N</italic>-acylhydrazones exhibit inhibitory activity against vaccinia and influenza viruses. Compounds 
 <bold>108</bold>, 
 <bold>109</bold>, and 
 <bold>111</bold>, containing an aromatic substituent, demonstrate low toxicity and the best activity against vaccinia virus. Furthermore, compound 
 <bold>111</bold>, having aromatic and heterocyclic moieties, as the only one among the tested series of compounds, shows moderate activity against the influenza virus.
