<p>Terpene compounds might also be used as substrates for the synthesis of specific polymer biomaterials as effective fouling resistant materials with lower cytotoxicity. An example of such an application is the utilization of natural borneol in designing a novel antibacterial material and developing an advanced strategy for antibacterial adhesion through polymer surface stereochemistry [

The PBA polymers were evaluated as noncytotoxic and should be considered a great potential for many biomedical applications. Superior antibacterial adhesion properties result from the borneol isomers on the material surface. This proof-of-concept improves polymer surface stereochemistry is an advanced strategy for antimicrobial adhesion, and the use of natural monoterpenes for this purpose is highly advisable.
