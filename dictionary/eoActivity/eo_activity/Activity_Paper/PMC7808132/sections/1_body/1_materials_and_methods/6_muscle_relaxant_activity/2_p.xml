<p>The muscle coordination effect of peshawaraquinone 
 <bold>1</bold> (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg, PO) was evaluated through traction tests and inclined plane tests using specific wires for hanging and special wood inclined planes, respectively. The activity was performed exactly following our published procedures.

 </sup> Animals were classified into positive control (diazepam 0.5 mg/kg, IP), negative control (normal saline 10 mL/kg, ip), and test groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6). Thirty minutes after these administrations, each animal was tested for muscle relaxant effects in both models. In the case of the traction experimental model, each animal was allowed to hang by a wire on their hind leg, and the duration of holding the wire by claws was noted in seconds. Hanging for less than 5 s means the muscle relaxant potential and vice versa. Regarding the inclined plane 30 min after administration, animals were allowed to slide on the inclined plane. Resistance to sliding was considered for no muscle coordination, and ease of sliding was considered for an animal with relaxed muscles.
