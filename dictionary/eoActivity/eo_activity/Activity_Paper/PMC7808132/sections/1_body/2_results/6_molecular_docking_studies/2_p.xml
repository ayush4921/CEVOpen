<p>We performed molecular docking studies to explore the mechanism of analgesic activity. Based on the mechanism of action of tramadol, a standard drug used, we first performed docking studies on the μ-opioid receptor (μOR). For this purpose, we obtained the 3D crystal structure of the μ-opioid receptor with the native ligand BU72 (PDB id = 5C1M). The redocking process was carried out to assess the docking reliability. After docking validation, the standard drug used in the current study, that is, tramadol, was docked into the active site of 5C1M. Moreover, we also analyzed the binding orientation and binding energy of the irreversible morphinan antagonist β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA) (PDB-entry 4DKL). The 3D interaction plots of the three studied drugs are shown in
