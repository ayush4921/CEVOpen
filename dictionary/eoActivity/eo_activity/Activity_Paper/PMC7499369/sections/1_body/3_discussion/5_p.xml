<p id="p0100">Naturally occurring plant extracts and compounds are an important source of drugs against many diseases including cancer. Almost half of the FDA approved pharmaceutical drugs are either derived from plant source directly or from plant derivatives (

 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">Zilla et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with previous results, our findings revealed that T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> methanolic extracts display strong antiproliferative effect by reducing the cell viability of MCF-7 (breast cancer) and RKO (colorectal cancer) cells significantly; however the most promising effect was exerted by methanolic extract of dry leaves of T.

 <italic>articulata</italic> extracts exhibit a promising antiproliferative effects on cancer cells.
