<p id="p0070">The total phenolic content of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> extracts was determined by colorimetric assay and the absorbance was measured at 760 nm. The phenolic content was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent per gram of dry weight of T.

 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> extracts showed the 137.12 ± 5.01, 409.92 ± 6.03, 141.75 ± 4.21, 387.08 ± 5.93 mg GAE/gDW (p &lt; 0.01) for fresh leaves, dry leaves, stem, and root respectively, indicates that methanolic extract of dry leaves has highest polyphenolic content (409.92 ± 4.21) than other methanolic extracts of T. 
 <italic>articulata.</italic> The total flavonoid content of methanolic extract of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> was calculated by colorimetric assay, absorbance was measured at 430 nm and total flavonoid content was expressed as mg quercetin equivalent per g dry weight of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> extract. As summarized in (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) of each T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> extracts showed the 80.66 ± 3.54, 177.71 ± 3.76, 60.66 ± 2.88, 45.23 ± 2.13 mg QE/gDW (p &lt; 0.01) for fresh leaves, dry leaves, stem, and root respectively, indicates that methanolic extract of dry leaves has high flavonoid content (177.71 ± 3.76) than other methanolic extracts of T. 
 <italic>articulata.</italic> Collectively these results demonstrate methanolic extracts of different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> exhibits significant antioxidant activity, and have abundant total polyphenolic and flavonoid content; however, methanolic extract of dry leaves displays highest antioxidant activity and demonstrates that polyphenolic and flavonoid content, indicates promising biochemical activities among all extracts.
