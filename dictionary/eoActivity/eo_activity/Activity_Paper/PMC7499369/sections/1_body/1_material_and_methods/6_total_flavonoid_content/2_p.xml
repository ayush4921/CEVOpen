<p id="p0040">The total flavonoid content of methanolic extracts of different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> was determined by using the AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> method (
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">Eberle et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, 2.0 ml of methanolic extract of different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> with concentration (1.0 mg/mL) were added to 2.0 ml of 10% AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> solution and vortex the solution to ensure complete mixing. After 10 min of incubation, record the absorbance of different extracts at 430 nm. Quercetin (0–40 µg/mL) was used as a reference for establishing standard curve (y = ax + b) and quantification of the flavonoid content of methanolic extracts from different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic>. The concentration of total flavonoid content was expressed in milligrams of QE equivalent per gram dry weight (mg QE/g DW).
