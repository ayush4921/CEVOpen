<p id="p0030">MCF-7 (breast cancer) and RKO (colon cancer) cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in a humidified incubator with 5% CO₂. The cells were cultured in the Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 and Dulbecco’s Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) cell culture media respectively, which were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution to avoid any bacterial contamination. Both the cell lines were free from Mycoplasma contamination.</p>
