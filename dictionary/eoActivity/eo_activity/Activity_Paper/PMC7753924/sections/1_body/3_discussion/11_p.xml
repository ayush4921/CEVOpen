<p id="par0210">Cow dung, an easily available bioresource harbours a wide variety of microorganisms which are still underexplored for their antimicrobial potential. The present investigation elucidated strong antagonistic potential in KD155 which was taxonomically identified as 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The extra cellular chloroform crude extract of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155 showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity and found highly effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>V. cholera</italic>. The produced metabolite demonstrated strong antioxidant potential and was found to be non-toxic that may be considered as safe for human consumption. An attempt was made to recognize the chemical nature of the produced bioactive compounds revealing the presence of phenolic compounds (quercetin). The GC-MS confirmed the extracellular secretion of quercetin compounds by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155. As far as the literature is concerned, this is the first report on isolation of quercetin producing 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from cow dung. The findings established the fact that bacterial strains from underexplored sources such as cow dung in this study have an enormous potential for the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds that may lead to the development of antimicrobial agents against microorganisms of medical importance.
