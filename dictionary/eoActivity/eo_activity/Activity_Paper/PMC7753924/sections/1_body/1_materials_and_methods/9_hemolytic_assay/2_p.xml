<p id="par0100">Hemolytic activity was detected using blood agar with 5 % (v/v) human blood, prepared by adding 7.4 g of blood agar base powder in 95 ml of distilled water. This mixture was sterilized and left until it reached the temperature around 45 ± 1 °C. After that, 5 ml of the defibrinated blood was added aseptically in the blood agar base with constant shaking in such a way that froth formation prevented. The blood agar was poured in sterile petri-plates and was solidified. Wells were cut with sterile cork borer, loaded with 100 μl of crude extract and incubated at 35 ± 1 °C for 18−24 hrs. After incubation, the plates were inspected for hemolysis pattern around the wells [
