<p id="par0060">Cultural and morphological characteristics of strain KD155 were analysed by growing on nutrient agar and broth using traditional methods reported in the Bergey’s manual of determinative bacteriology [
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The bioactive strain was subsequently analysed for macroscopic (colony form, margin, colour, elevation and opacity) and microscopic analyses (motility, spore formation, cell shape and gram staining). For assessment of carbohydrate utilization by strain KD155, different carbon sources were supplemented in basal medium at a concentration of 1% and incubated at 35 ± 1 °C for 24−48 h. Physiological characters for growth were determined on NA medium by growing at different temperatures (15 ± 1 °C, 35 ± 1 °C and 45 ± 1 °C), pH (5–9) and NaCl (1 %–9 %) ranges. Hydrolysis of starch, liquefaction of gelatine and other biochemical tests were also evaluated as criteria given in Uzair et al. [
