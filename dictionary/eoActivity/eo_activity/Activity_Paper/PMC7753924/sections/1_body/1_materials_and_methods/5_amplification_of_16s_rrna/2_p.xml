<p id="par0065">The isolate was recognized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing method. The genomic DNA of KD155 was isolated as described by Ganesan et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. (50AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG30) and 1492R (50TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT 30) were used to amplify 16S ribosomal sequence from genomic DNA in thermal cycler. The amplified product (âˆ¼1400 bp) was sequenced using ABI PRISM [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The similarity of obtained sequences was compared using the BLAST tool. CLUSTAL W program was used for multiple alignment of DNA sequence and phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbour-joining method from MEGAX software. The 16S rRNA sequences were submitted to the GenBank, NCBI, USA.40.
