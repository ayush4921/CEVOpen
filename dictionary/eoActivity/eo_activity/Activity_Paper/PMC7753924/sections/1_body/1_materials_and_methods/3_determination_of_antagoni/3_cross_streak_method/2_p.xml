<p id="par0055">The antagonistic activity of isolated strain was evaluated using cross-streak method. KD155 was streaked in the centre of plate and incubated at 35 ± 1 °C. After 48 h, test strains were streaked perpendicularly to the edge of initial streak and further incubated at 35 ± 1 °C for 24−48 h. The antagonistic activity was measured by distance of inhibition between the test isolate KD155 and test strains [
