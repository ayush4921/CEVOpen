<p id="par0125">The 16S rRNA folding was predicted to comprehend the thermodynamic stability of the gene sequence (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>a). The free Gibb's energy of 16S rRNA in its folded form for KD155 was observed to be âˆ’480.10 kcal/mol. This study suggested the minimal energy level of 16S rRNA sequences, specifying high folding stability of nucleotides in the organisms. The restriction analysis of 16S rRNA sequence of KD155 indicated the presence of GC-AT content to 54 % and 46 % respectively. However, a total of 54 restriction sites were observed in the obtained gene sequence of the strain KD155. (
