<p id="par0140">On the basis of the results of antimicrobial assays performed on both the extracellular crude extracts, chloroform extract was selected to carry out further studies. The results presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> showed that the MIC values varied from 41−164 μg/ ml against the entire test strains. The inhibitory effect of chloroform extract obtained from strain KD155 started at 41 μg/ ml against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MTCC 7443), 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (MTCC 6728) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MTCC 424) whereas higher MIC value of 328 μg/ ml was found against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (MTCC 441). However, most of the test bacterial organisms were inhibited at concentration of 164 μg/ ml. Apart from this, MIC range of chloroform extract against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (MTCC 227) was found to be 164 μg/ ml. Chloroform extract of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD155 showed potentially bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MTCC 7443), 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (MTCC 6728) and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (MTCC 424) with MBC of 86 μg/ ml. The fungal pathogen i.e., 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> (MTCC 227) was observed sensitive towards higher values of MFCs i.e., 410 μg/ ml (
