<p id="par0135">The bioactive strain was cultivated in BPB medium for the production of bioactive metabolite. BPB medium was extracted using two organic solvents i.e., ethyl acetate (EA) and chloroform (CHL). Ethyl acetate and chloroform are widely used as suitable solvent for extraction of bioactive compounds. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> KD 155 showed yield of 1.315 g and 0.954 g of crude metabolite from chloroform and ethyl acetate respectively. The antimicrobial activity of both the extracts was assessed by agar well diffusion method against 7 Gram-positive, 7 Gram-negative bacteria including one fungal pathogen, compared with standard drugs. Here we found that both the obtained crude extracts have shown broad spectrum bactericidal and fungicidal action. However, chloroform extract obtained from KD155 was found more potent than ethyl acetate extract as it inhibited 12 test pathogens out of 15 whereas, ethyl acetate extract could only able to inhibit only 11 test organisms. Chloroform extract depicted improved activity by 7 % as compared to ethyl acetate extract. Chloroform extract showed better activity against 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> (25 ± 1 mm) in comparison with tetracycline (16 ± 1 mm). Isolate KD155 maximally inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S.aureus</italic> (27 ± 1 mm) as compared to tetracycline (24 ± 1 mm). Crude extract of KD155 (24 ± 1 mm), showed improved activity in comparison with ethyl acetate extracts against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> which is quite comparable with ketoconazole (20 ± 1 mm). Both the extracts were found inactive against 
 <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (MTCC 439) and 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> (MTCC 442). Although, it was also noted that apart from improved bioactivity of chloroform extract, one test organisms i.e., 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> (MTCC 426) was inhibited by ethyl acetate extract only (
