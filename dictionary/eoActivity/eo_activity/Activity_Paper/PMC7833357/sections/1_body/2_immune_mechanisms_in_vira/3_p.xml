<p id="p0135">Innate mechanism in human acts by the interaction of the virus particles with various receptors like endosomal Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I receptors, and Nod-like receptors. Once induced, these receptors produce cytokines and interferons. Following the action encountered by the innate cells like neutrophils and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, special T cells get induced to respond to the invaders. These cells also persuade B cells to secrete antibodies, which form immune complexes. They further invoke cytotoxic T lymphocytes CD8+ to transfer to the infection site and kill infected cells. Antibody mediated immune responses ie. antigen-antibody complexes induce activation of complement cascade. HIV-1, human cytomegalovirus, and certain other viruses use the host complement control proteins into their virions that create cell lysis (
