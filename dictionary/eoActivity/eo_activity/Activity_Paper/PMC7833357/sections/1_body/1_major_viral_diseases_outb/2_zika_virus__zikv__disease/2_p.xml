<p id="p0050">Zika virus belongs to family Flaviviridae. The virus is transmitted through the bite of infected female mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Flaviviruses in human can also lead to many diseases that include West Nile, dengue, yellow fever, tick-borne, and Japanese encephalitis. The route of transmission of ZIKV is through arthropod vectors, central nervous system injury, and hemorrhagic fevers. The infection of ZIKV during pregnancy results in birth defects in new born babies, a condition called microcephaly. In adults, it leads to temporary paralysis. In Flaviviridae family, all members have enveloped virus with single stranded RNA genome and possesses 3 structural proteins envelope, capsid, precursor membrane, and 7 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). Patients in phase I and II clinical trials are vaccinated with DNA/mRNA vaccine. Symptoms of this infection include skin rashes, headache, joint pain, muscle pain, and fever. The major outbreak took place in Yap Island (2007), South America (2015–2016), and French Polynesia (2013–2014). Guillian-Barre
 <sup>`</sup> syndrome and microcephaly are common neurological manifestations of this disease (
