<p id="p0055">Nipah virus can be transmitted to humans from animals like bats or pigs. It can also transmit through contaminated food or directly from people to people. It was first recognized in Malaysia (1999), the people who were in contact with sick pigs or contaminations of tissues. Transmission is through unprotective contact or secretions from pigs, and fruits contaminated with secretions of urine by infected fruit bats. Symptoms include fever, headache, myalgia, and acute encephalitis. Incubation period ranges from 4 to 14Â days. The diagnosis includes reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from body fluids and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The fruit bats belonging to the family Pteropodidae are the host of NIV. It has also been reported in other animals such as horse, sheep, goats, cats, and dogs. It is a single stranded and non-segmented enveloped RNA virus. The NIV is second member of genus 
 <italic>Henipavius</italic> belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae. Prevention can be done by reducing overcrowding between animals and avoiding consumption of contaminating foods (
