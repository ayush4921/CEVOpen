<p id="p0125">Hepatitis viruses are hepaciviruses that belong to Flaviviridae. These viruses possess a linear and positive sense single stranded RNA genome coding for nearly 10 proteins. There are 7 genotypes encountered till date (genotype 1 to 7). Hepatitis A virus (HAV), a member of hepatovirus is an endemic spread by fecal-oral route. Symptoms include necrosis and inflammation of the liver cells. It includes a positive sense RNA and the genome comprise of about 7500 (nucleotides). The incubation period is approximately 3–5 weeks. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) belongs to Hepadnaviridae family and includes dsDNA virus that replicates via reverse transcription (

This is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus similar to flavivirus. It leads to complications such as liver cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, no treatment is available for HCV infections.
