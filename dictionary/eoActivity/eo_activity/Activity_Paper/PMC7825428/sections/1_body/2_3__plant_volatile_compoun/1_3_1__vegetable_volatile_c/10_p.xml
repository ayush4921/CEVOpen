<p>Although many of the volatile and nonvolatile compounds responsible for aromatic features have been identified, many of their biochemistry pathways are still not well explained. Still, several metabolic pathways are involved in the biosynthesis of compounds responsible for the aromatic features and taste in vegetables. Many volatile compounds are synthesised from fatty acid, amino acid, and carotenoid pathways [

 <xref rid="B158-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>], others from isoprenoid substrates. However, it is well-known that primary metabolism is fundamental for the formation of nonvolatile compounds, which also contribute to the aromatic features and taste of vegetables [
