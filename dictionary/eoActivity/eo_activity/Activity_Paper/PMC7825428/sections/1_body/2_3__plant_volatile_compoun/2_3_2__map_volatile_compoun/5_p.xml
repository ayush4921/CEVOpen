<p>For better exploitation of any MAP species, it is necessary to evaluate the genetic stability of their populations, i.e., whether such populations continue to produce the same characteristic products after being transplanted to and grown in habitats with different edaphoclimatic conditions. In all, for each species, it is crucial to perform a detailed study, which addresses, for instance, the influence of seasonal and geographic variations and local environmental conditions. The results obtained will provide the scientific basis for the selection and cultivation of species showing better qualities, thus bringing some economic and social benefits for local growers.</p>
