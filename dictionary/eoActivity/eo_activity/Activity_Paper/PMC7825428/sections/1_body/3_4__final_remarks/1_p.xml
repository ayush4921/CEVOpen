<p>Vegetables and MAPs are two important sources of bioactive and volatile compounds that are responsible for consumer perceptions on their importance in human health. Hundreds of studies using in vitro and in vivo models have shown that phenolics and volatile compounds are directly involved in different degenerative cellular mechanisms and thus are being considered as key compounds to reduce or to inhibit pro-oxidant and inflammatory processes. The combination of such compounds gives us an important view on the quality of vegetables and MAPs. Thus, it is important to understand what types of compounds are present in vegetables and MAPs, the relations between them, and how they can be affected by biotic or abiotic factors. This review summarises all these aspects. This information is important to a better understanding of all the processes behind the formation of volatile and nonvolatile compounds as well as their bioactivities, their interaction with other compounds, but, more importantly, how they influence the consumerâ€™s perception of quality. Moreover, their influence on the human tendency to buy vegetables and MAPs is also supported by this type of information. This is true to all plant species reported in this work, but also to those not included here, and a continuous effort to identify volatile and nonvolatile compounds is ongoing. Furthermore, the improvement of aromatic features is fundamental and must be achieved without compromising other quality traits of crops.</p>
