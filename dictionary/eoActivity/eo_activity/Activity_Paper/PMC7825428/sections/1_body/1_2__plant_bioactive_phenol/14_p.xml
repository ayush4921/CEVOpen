<p>Monomeric flavan-3-ols include catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, catechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and gallocatechin gallate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00106-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Catechin and epicatechin are the most abundant flavanols found in fruits, while in the seeds of some leguminous, the most abundant flavanols are gallocatechin, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate [

 <italic>Vicia faba</italic> L.), (−)-epicatechin and epigallocatechin were detected by Helsper et al. [
