 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00106-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Quercetin levels in the edible parts of most vegetables are generally (of fresh weight, mg/kg) below 10, except for onions (284–486), kale (110), broccoli (30), French beans (32–45), and slicing beans (28–30) [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Kaempferol could only be detected (fresh edible weight, mg/kg) in kale (211), endive (15–91), leek (11–56), and turnip tops (31–64) [

 <xref rid="B37-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and also sweet potato leaves (purple) showed 156 mg/kg of myricetin and 267 mg/kg of quercetin [

 <xref rid="B45-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], quercetin is an antioxidant protecting against reactive oxygen species and shows also antiatherosclerosis, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and cholesterol-lowering properties. Flavanones are colourless compounds characterised by the absence of a double bond in the 2, 3-position of the pyrone ring, and are isomeric with chalcones. Low concentrations of flavanones, namely naringenin, are found in tomatoes [
