<p>Phenolic acids have been recently widely studied because of their potential protective roles. Phenolic acids have a benzene ring, a carboxylic group, and one or more hydroxyl and/or methoxyl groups. They are usually divided into benzoic acid derivatives (i.e., hydroxybenzoic acids, C
 <sub>6</sub>-C
 <sub>1</sub>) (

 <sub>6</sub>-C
 <sub>3</sub>) (

 <sub>6</sub>-C
 <sub>1</sub> derivatives) (e.g., gallic acid, salicylic acid, salicylaldehyde, and protocatechuic acid) is typically low in edible plants [
