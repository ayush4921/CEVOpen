<p>The basic structures of anthocyanins are anthocyanidins, in which the two aromatic rings A and B are linked by a heterocyclic ring C that possesses oxygen. More than 23 different anthocyanidins have been found with pelargonidin, cyanidin, peonidin, delphinidin, petunidin, and malvidin being the most common (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00106-f007">Figure 7</xref>). Anthocyanins in plants mainly exist in conjugated form as glycosides. Monomeric anthocyanin changed the hydroxylation and methoxylation patterns on the B ring; the nature, position, and the number of conjugated sugar units; the nature and number of conjugated aliphatic or aromatic acid groups; the existence or lack of an acyl aromatic group in the molecule [
