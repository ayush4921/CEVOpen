<p>A PCA model was used to identify the difference in the metabolites of the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> treatment and control groups. The PCA score plots are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238927.g004">Fig 4</xref>. OPLS-DA was used to discriminate between the groups as well. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238927.g005">Fig 5</xref>, the group differences were clearly divided into three regions, indicating that there were significant chemical differences between them, and the established metabolomics method could successfully characterize the chemical characteristics. VIP values are commonly used to evaluate the contribution of variables in OPLS-DA. Based on the results of the t-test (P&lt;0.05) performed for the different groups, ions with VIP values ≥2 were selected and regarded as the most significantly different chemical markers of the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> treatment and control groups. Therefore, shikimic acid, citric acid, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, 3,5,7,2',6'-pentahydroxyflavanone, 5,2',6'-trihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy flavone, chrysin, eriodictyol, 5,8-dihydroxy-6,7- dimethoxyflavone, skullcapflavone Ⅱ, and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8,2',3'-tetramethoxy flavone presented significant differences.
