<p>When the ROS content declined, superfluous baicalein or wogonin was converted into baicalin and wogonoside by baicalein7-O-glucuronosyl transferase. The baicalin and wogonoside are confined to certain domains in cells due to hydrophilic glucuronic acid, making it difficult for baicalin and wogonoside to play a role and resulting in a declined antioxidant capacity. In addition, the biosynthesis of flavonoids declined as the level of ROS decreased.</p>
