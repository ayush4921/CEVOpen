<p>In this paper, only two primary metabolites were observed in the mass spectral data. Citric acid, a major substance in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, decreased slightly and continuously with increased Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> exposure, indicating that its primary metabolism was weakened. Shikimic acid, from which various flavonoids originate, is a branch point of the primary and the secondary metabolic pathways, and the decreased citric acid content and increased shikimic acid content indicated enhanced secondary metabolism, resulting in increased secondary metabolite production; additionally, the content of a total of 13 secondary metabolites increased with the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> treatment. Shikimic acid is located upstream of citric acid, which indicates that more shikimic acid would be converted into secondary metabolites.
