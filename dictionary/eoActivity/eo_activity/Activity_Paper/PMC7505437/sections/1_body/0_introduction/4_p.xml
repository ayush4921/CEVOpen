<p>Metabolomics can acquire comprehensive information about various metabolites by using untargeted biochemical approaches to monitor metabolites and is a new technique used in the field of plant research. Quantitative plant metabolomics, with the ability to improve the comprehensive understanding of plant metabolism under different conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0238927.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], has been considered the most promising approach for the detection of primary and secondary stress-response metabolites [
 <xref rid="pone.0238927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since ROS have a dual effect, too much or too little is harmful, and plants require that the equilibrium of ROS is exactly maintained. The large quantities and constantly changing activities of secondary metabolites are perhaps an important tactic for plants to respond to changing environments as quickly and as delicately as possible, which is probably performed through the biosynthesis and conversion of numerous flavonoids for
