However, plants face more environmental stress than animals and generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group of small molecules that can harm proteins, necessitating distinctive metabolic processes. Secondary metabolites in plants are a group of chemical components that can eliminate ROS and can also exhibit medicinal properties; therefore, herbal medicines are often closely linked to the ecological significance of secondary metabolites. Why plants contain so many, not few, active medicinal ingredients is unknown. The root of <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic>, a popular herbal medicine, is rich in various flavonoids with diverse structural features. Sodium hydrosulfite (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) can produce O&#x002d9;<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub> radicals and induce physical conditions under environmental stress. Using UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis, a total of 25 different compounds were identified in the roots of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>baicalensis</italic> between the Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> groups and suitable conditions. Based on the results of the t-test (P&#x0003c;0.05) performed for the groups and ions with values of VIP &#x02265; 2, the most significantly different chemical markers with Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> treatment were shikimic acid, citric acid, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, 3,5,7,2',6'-pentahydroxyflavanone, 5,2',6'-trihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy flavone, chrysin, eriodictyol, 5,8-dihydroxy-6,7 -dimethoxy flavone, skullcapflavone &#x02161;, and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8,2',3'-tetrame thoxyflavone, and most of them were free flavonoids with many phenolic hydroxyl or methoxyl groups and characteristically high antioxidant activities. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>baicalensis</italic> roots modified their ability to eliminate ROS and maintained the equilibrium of ROS through the multitudinous biosynthesis and conversion of flavonoids, which is similar to the equilibrium established by an intricate buffer solution and perfectly explains the diversity and complexity of medicinal plant ingredients.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007224</institution-id><institution>National Foundation for Science and Technology Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81573523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Xiangcai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>The National Survey of Traditional Chinese Medicine Resources</institution></funding-source><award-id>GZY-KJS-2018-004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Xiangcai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors wish to thank for providing financial supports from the National Science Foundation (81573523).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals can avoid unfavourable circumstances, and the survival of native species is mainly dependent on intraspecific or interspecific competition for foods, not the ecological environment; however, immobile plants can get enough light from the sun, but must face high temperatures, drought, and low soil fertility stress factors, so various adverse effects are almost uninterrupted. Under stress, the light energy absorbed by chloroplasts far outweighs the need to capture CO<sub>2</sub>, leading to a surfeit of light energy. In addition, closed stomata under stress block O<sub>2</sub> emissions outward, and the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to O<sup>&#x02022;-</sup><sub>2</sub> (Mehler reaction) is exacerbated [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. O<sup>&#x02022;-</sup><sub>2</sub> radicals can be converted further into &#x000b7;OH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These molecules have a strong oxidation power and are described as reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can modify the structures of proteins, including enzymes, by affecting disulfide bridges and regulating various metabolic processes. Therefore, a suitable level of ROS also acts as an indispensable messenger to regulate various physiological actions in plants [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], but once ROS are overproduced, a range of destructive forces follow, such as altered adjacent molecular configurations, a reduced cell-membrane stability, DNA strand destruction, protein crosslinking, and peptide chain breakage, resulting in metabolic disorders and even cell death [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It has been confirmed that increased ROS levels are a result of stress, resulting in a 3-fold increase in O&#x002d9;<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub> and a 10-fold increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under certain conditions [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Under high levels of O&#x002d9;<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub>, metabolic alterations under stress can be reproduced; the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD) are decreased, and the content of baicalein, an antioxidant compound, was shown to increase from 0.28% to 1.96% [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>ROS are eliminated mainly by antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, CAT, and POD, and secondary metabolites, including phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and tocopherols. O&#x002d9;<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub> is converted to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> either spontaneously or by SOD and then converted into H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> by CAT or POD. A suitable level of ROS is an indispensable part of metabolism; however, antioxidant enzymes are also proteins. In particular, some -SH groups that maintain the secondary structure and tertiary structure of the enzymes are liable to be injured if an undue amount of ROS in plants is generated under severe abiotic stresses [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, this might be the reason why plants possess the ability to produce secondary metabolites in addition to antioxidant enzymes.</p><p>The secondary metabolites in plants are numerous; by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, a total of 132 metabolites in <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic>, 447 metabolites in <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> Fortune, 122 in <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> leaves, and 128 in American ginseng roots were identified [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], most of which were secondary metabolites. It has been proven that the proportion of secondary metabolites varies according to ever-changing environmental conditions [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is known that the ingredients in herbal medicines are complex, so it is impossible to assess their value by only one or several secondary metabolites. These compounds are usually put into classes with similar structures, whose changes result in variations in their activities [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Secondary metabolites are important for plants to adapt to adversity; the reason why plants contain so many, not few, secondary metabolites is unknown. Additionally, the connection between the secondary metabolites is also unknown. <italic>S</italic>. <italic>baicalensis</italic> Georgi is distributed throughout semi-arid (steppe) climates and often undergoes severe drought stresses, which are a main factor affecting the biosynthesis of flavonoids [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To protect themselves under adverse environmental conditions, plants produce various kinds of secondary metabolites, which are also active ingredients exhibiting anti-inflammatory, antitumour, and anti-HIV activities [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Metabolomics can acquire comprehensive information about various metabolites by using untargeted biochemical approaches to monitor metabolites and is a new technique used in the field of plant research. Quantitative plant metabolomics, with the ability to improve the comprehensive understanding of plant metabolism under different conditions [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], has been considered the most promising approach for the detection of primary and secondary stress-response metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Since ROS have a dual effect, too much or too little is harmful, and plants require that the equilibrium of ROS is exactly maintained. The large quantities and constantly changing activities of secondary metabolites are perhaps an important tactic for plants to respond to changing environments as quickly and as delicately as possible, which is probably performed through the biosynthesis and conversion of numerous flavonoids for <italic>S</italic>. <italic>baicalensis</italic>. O&#x002d9;<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub> is an original ROS that is not present long term in nature due to its poor stability, with a half-life of only approx. 1 &#x003bc;s. Sodium hydrosulfite (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) can produce O&#x002d9;<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub> spontaneously under alkaline conditions [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and is regarded as an important carrier [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> can easily control O&#x002d9;<sup>-</sup><sub>2</sub> production, creating stress physiology. Here, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was employed to induce stress, and we investigated the different secondary metabolites, the biological significance of flavonoids in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>baicalensis</italic> under stress and the diversity and complexity of medicinal ingredients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Plant materials and reagents</title><p><italic>S</italic>. <italic>baicalensis</italic> Georgi samples were collected from the medical plant garden at Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine.

Citric acid, a major substance in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, decreased slightly and continuously with increased Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> exposure, indicating that its primary metabolism was weakened. Shikimic acid, from which various flavonoids originate, is a branch point of the primary and the secondary metabolic pathways, and the decreased citric acid content and increased shikimic acid content indicated enhanced secondary metabolism, resulting in increased secondary metabolite production; additionally, the content of a total of 13 secondary metabolites increased with the Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> treatment. Shikimic acid is located upstream of citric acid, which indicates that more shikimic acid would be converted into secondary metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Biological significance of varied compounds</title><p>Three features of these enhanced secondary metabolites became prominent. First, the molecular structure of the secondary metabolites dictated the biological effect based on the number and sites of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in flavonoids. Flavonoids are a series of compounds containing two benzene rings connected by 3 carbon atoms, and phenolic hydroxyls are a regular moiety on them, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238927.g006">Fig 6</xref>. It has been proven that the number of hydroxyl groups on the B ring directly impacts the activity, which is also markedly enhanced when a double bond is introduced into the C ring [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The hydroxyl group at positions C-5 and C-7 together in the A ring, as well as the C-3', C-4' and C-5' sites on the B ring, can all increase the activities obviously [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A hydroxyl group can also be located in another position, such as C-6 [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It has been proven that baicalein is 2~5 times more antibiotically active than baicalin and 1~3 times better than baicalin at inhibiting IL-1&#x003b2; and converting enzymes [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Second, except for baicalin and wogonoside, the other flavonoids were free flavonoids without sugar moieties. The biosynthesis of flavonoids is performed in the endoplasmic reticulum, and it is difficult for flavonoid glycosides with hydrophilic sugar moieties to freely pass through biomembranes with a lipophilic phospholipid bilayer. The biomembranes of animals and plants are the same; therefore, the biological effect of glycosides would be limited in animals and plants unless the sugar moieties were removed. A study showed that the activities of flavanone disappear when a sugar moiety is introduced into the A ring [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and another study showed that baicalein is more than 7 times more bioavailable than baicalin due to hydrophilic variations [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Flavonoid glycosides therefore are regarded as superfluous flavonoids; when required, they work mainly after their conversion into free flavonoids [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Third, the contents of some components with methoxy groups increased under high levels of ROS. The methoxy groups on flavonoids have the ability to donate electrons and exhibit a weak antioxidant capacity in their natural state, but their power is remarkably enhanced with the help of peroxidase (POD) [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The activity and biosynthesis of POD, an adversity-resistant antioxidase, are induced by ecological stress. Only when the POD activity was high under stress can the components with methoxy groups exert a strong power. These components are usually located at the downstream or terminus of biosynthesised flavonoids and are stable. Therefore, the activities of the components with methoxy groups constantly changed due to ROS formed from ecological stress.</p><fig id="pone.0238927.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0238927.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Molecular structure and biosynthesis diagram of flavonoids.</title><p>CHI: chalcone isomerase; FNSII-2: flavone synthase; OMT: O-methyltransferases; FH: flavanone hydroxylase; F6H: flavone 6-hydroxylase; F8H: flavone 8-hydroxylase; UBGAT: glucuronyltransferase; BG:&#x003b2;-glucuronidase.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0238927.g006"/></fig><p>Interestingly, the above-mentioned secondary metabolites were all highly active at relatively low concentrations, indicating that the effect of compounds with a low concentration cannot be ignored.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Regulation of secondary metabolic pathways</title><p>The effects of ROS depend on their concentration in plants, as too much or too little is harmful. Whether there is an overabundance or shortage of ROS depends on the delicate equilibrium between radical production and scavenging [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which is maintained by antioxidants. Under severe stress, secondary metabolites are highly produced and are coordinated with ROS. The more ROS produced, the higher the flavonoid activity is. The flavonoid activity is regulated through the biosynthesis and interconversion of these flavonoids.</p><p>When facing environmental stresses, the increased ROS content swiftly triggered a change in the secondary metabolism. First, the glucuronic acid moieties on baicalin and wogonoside were removed by &#x003b2;-glucuronidase, and baicalin and wogonoside were rapidly converted to baicalein or wogonin as a result of increased activities [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Chrysin, with only C-5 and C-7 hydroxyl groups, could also receive a hydroxyl group and was converted into baicalein, norwogonin, and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8,2',3' -tetramethoxy flavone with more hydroxy groups. The contents of baicalin, wogonoside, and chrysin are all high in the natural state, and furthermore, these reactions are fulfilled by only one step; therefore, the reaction was swiftly performed. Second, ROS can increase the activity of phenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL) [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], continuously replenishing flavonoids.</p><p>When the ROS content declined, superfluous baicalein or wogonin was converted into baicalin and wogonoside by baicalein7-O-glucuronosyl transferase. The baicalin and wogonoside are confined to certain domains in cells due to hydrophilic glucuronic acid, making it difficult for baicalin and wogonoside to play a role and resulting in a declined antioxidant capacity. In addition, the biosynthesis of flavonoids declined as the level of ROS decreased.</p><p>The components with methoxy groups can astutely regulate the antioxidant capacity according to the ROS level, which also plays an important role in maintaining the equilibrium of ROS.</p><p>In this paper, only the components with VIP values &#x02265;2 were selected and regarded as the most significant differential chemical markers, and the biosynthesis pathway of 13 different components was summarized, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238927.g006">Fig 6</xref>, according to the literature [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Now, more than 120 components have been reported in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>baicalensis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0238927.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and in reality, the number of activity-relevant pathways must be numerous to maintain the equilibrium of ROS as quickly and delicately as possible.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The diversity of secondary metabolites plays a crucial role in plant bioactivity. A variety of secondary metabolites in <italic>S</italic>. <italic>baicalensis</italic> was produced in varying proportions. Under ROS, the contents of free flavonoids with many phenolic hydroxyl groups and characteristically high antioxidant activities increased. The change in the proportion and activities of these compounds modified the ability of the plants to eliminate redundant ROS and maintain ROS equilibrium through the biosynthesis and conversion of flavonoids in a manner similar to that occurring in an intricate buffer solution; in addition, the complexity of the active compounds ensures that plants respond to changing environments as quickly and delicately as possible. Herbal medicines are often closely linked to the ecological significance of secondary metabolites, which perfectly explains the diversity and complexity of medicinal plant ingredients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0238927.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Elstner</surname><given-names>EF</given-names></name>. <article-title>Mechanisms of oxygen activation in different compartments of plant cells</article-title>. <source>Current Topics in Plant Physiology</source>, <year>1991</year>; <volume>15</volume>: <fpage>13</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>25</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0238927.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Foyer</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name>. <article-title>Oxygen metabolism and electron transport in photosynthesis</article-title>. <source>See Ref</source>. <year>1997</year>; <volume>185</volume>:<fpage>587</fpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0238927.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>CH</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>XL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Ng</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>

Overall, the results and discussion of this study are still weak. The manuscript is poorly prepared and required significant improvement. Therefore, unfortunately, this manuscript may not be suitable for publication in PLOS One.</p><p>In order to improve the quality of the manuscript, further specific comments are given below, although the list is not exhaustive:</p><p>1. First of all, it is very confusing between Scutellaria baicalensis and Radix Scutelariae as the author used in the title and through the text. At least, the authors should be mention Radix Scutelariae is the root of Scutellaria baicalensis, and used one name in all the text.</p><p>2. In the abstract and introduction part, the author mention: &#x0201c;The reason why plants contain so many secondary metabolites is unknown&#x0201d; is not exactly. Although we can not discover all the reason, numerous reason for plants contains many secondary metabolites were observed, such as:</p><p>- Some of these chemicals enhance their own survival.</p><p>- Some plants produce chemicals that act as herbicides to inhibit the growth of competing plants.</p><p>- Other plants produce substances that deter browsing by insects and herbivores</p><p>- Many plants produced secondary metabolites to respond to environmental stress (biotic, abiotic stress), etc.</p><p>3. It is not necessary and too long for explaining bout ROS and antioxidant enzyme in the introduction part. Better to focus on the main content of these results. The role of Na2S2O4 should be deeply mentioned.</p><p>4. In material and method: &#x0201c;&#x02026; 2-year-old plants of S. baicalensis were sprayed with aqueous Na2S2O4 aqueous solutions at concentrations of 40 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.4 &#x003bc;mol/L, and 0.004 &#x003bc;mol/L, and the control group was kept moist with just water. The samples were collected 0, 1, 2, and 3 days after spraying&#x0201d;. However, the result was not mentioned about the difference of result among those treatments.</p><p>5. Which treatment was showen in Table 1?</p><p>6. Result and discussion too short to difficult to understand this study.</p><p>7. The authors should establish a metabolic synthesis pathway for this plant. It helps explain the result easily.</p><p>8. There have no Fig 5L in Fig. 5.</p><p>9. All the species name in the references list should be in Italic.</p><p>Reviewer #2: manuscript can be accepted after thorough revision keeping in view following points:</p><p>1. English writing.</p><p>2. cite relevant references.</p><p>3. provide some possible mechanisms in the discussion.</p><p>4. please rewrite conclusion and make abstract crispy and to the point.</p><p>5. a clear hypothesis is missing.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Comments</p><p>1. In the Abstract of the article, line 8, it is better for the authors to add the Scutellaria inside the parentheses after the root of Scutellaria, and use it later in the whole article.</p><p>2. The authors used the Na2SO4 compound to induce oxidative treatment. What is the reason for using this compound? Explain in the article</p><p>3. &#x0201c;Sodium Dithionite-Enhanced Quality of Scutellaria Through Modification of Secondary Metabolism&#x0201d; in the introduction, the last paragraph, the reference should be given.</p><p>4. In the materials section, ethanol solvents are used for extraction, while methanol solvents are commonly used to extract flavonoids. What is the reason for use? Explain the reason in manuscript</p><p>Results</p><p>5. In Table 1, the acronym&#x0201d; m / z &#x0201c; should be written in Italic</p><p>6. In the table in the column related to MS / MS fragment ion, for the compounds that have been identified in both positive and negative ionization methods, the negative ionization pattern is also should be written.</p><p>7. In Table 4, combinations 4 and 5 both have the same negative and positive ionization modes, the same m / z, and the same ionization pattern have considered while they did not use any standard combinations.</p><p>8. In Table 1, the authors include 25 compounds. Are these compounds first identified from this plant? If not, it is best to briefly explain the composition of each compound and add the relevant references.</p><p>9. In Figure 2, the chromatogram images please show the root extract in the positive and negative ionization state of the peak corresponding to each combination with numbers.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>10. According to statistical analysis, compounds whose VIP is larger or equal to 2 (VIP &#x02265;2) have been selected for further study and the number of these compounds is 13, while in the discussion section of the first paragraph, 12 compounds are mistakenly written. That needs to be edited.</p><p>11. In the discussion section of the last paragraph, it is better for the authors to give a brief explanation about the path of biosynthesis of flavonoids in the roots of Scutellaria.</p><p>12. In the last paragraph of the last line, in explaining Figure 5, we talk about the multiplicity of biosynthetic pathways of flavonoid compounds, while Figure 5 does not. Figure 5 provides information on the content of compounds identified under different doses of oxidative treatment, and no such connection is made.</p><p>13. In Figure 5, it is best to add a chart of the contents of the studied compounds to the image in control mode. The values provided are for treatment only</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

Overall, the results and discussion of this study are still weak. The manuscript is poorly prepared and required significant improvement. Therefore, unfortunately, this manuscript may not be suitable for publication in PLOS One.</p><p>Answer: Thank you for your suggestion. This manuscript aim to clarify why medicine plants contain so many active medicinical ingredients in the perspective of ecological stress. The discussion part were supplemented and throughly revised. </p><p>In order to improve the quality of the manuscript, further specific comments are given below, although the list is not exhaustive:</p><p>1. First of all, it is very confusing between Scutellaria baicalensis and Radix Scutelariae as the author used in the title and through the text. At least, the authors should be mention Radix Scutelariae is the root of Scutellaria baicalensis, and used one name in all the text.</p><p>Answer: Radix Scutelariae is the root of Scutellaria baicalensis, to avoid confusing, the difference between them was labeled at starting part.</p><p>2. In the abstract and introduction part, the author mention: &#x0201c;The reason why plants contain so many secondary metabolites is unknown&#x0201d; is not exactly. Although we can not discover all the reason, numerous reason for plants contains many secondary metabolites were observed, such as:</p><p>- Some of these chemicals enhance their own survival.</p><p>- Some plants produce chemicals that act as herbicides to inhibit the growth of competing plants.</p><p>- Other plants produce substances that deter browsing by insects and herbivores</p><p>- Many plants produced secondary metabolites to respond to environmental stress (biotic, abiotic stress), etc.</p><p>Answer: It is a problem coming from confussing expression! We mean to express the reason that plants contain so many secondary metabolites, can a few kinds of secondary metabolites with similiar effects do that? Based on this hypothesis, complexity&#x000a0;of Active Medicinical Ingredients in Radix&#x000a0;Scutelariae can be pesented. The manuscript was revised in another words. </p><p>3. It is not necessary and too long for explaining bout ROS and antioxidant enzyme in the introduction part. Better to focus on the main content of these results. The role of Na2S2O4 should be deeply mentioned.</p><p>Answer: This article aim to expound the complexity of active medicinical ingredients in Radix Scutelariae, nevertheless, active medicinical ingredients are often closely linked to the ecological stress, to which ROS and antioxidant enzymes can adjust automatically. It is probably caused by poorly expression, have been revised in article.</p><p>4. In material and method: &#x0201c;&#x02026; 2-year-old plants of S. baicalensis were sprayed with aqueous Na2S2O4 aqueous solutions at concentrations of 40 &#x003bc;mol/L, 0.4 &#x003bc;mol/L, and 0.004 &#x003bc;mol/L, and the control group was kept moist with just water. The samples were collected 0, 1, 2, and 3 days after spraying&#x0201d;. However, the result was not mentioned about the difference of result among those treatments.</p><p>Answer: With aqueous Na2S2O4 at different concentrations, Citric acid presented a downtrend, the other ingredient a uptrend, as shown in Fig. 3.</p><p>5.
