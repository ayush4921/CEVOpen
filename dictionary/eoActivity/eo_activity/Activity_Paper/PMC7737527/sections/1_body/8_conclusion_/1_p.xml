<p>Subjects were not exposed to an undue risk in the analyzed multiple-dose FiH studies. The risk for harm was similarly low as in our single-dose FiH studies, and therefore the assumption that a higher risk for subjects after multiple dosing due to effects of accumulation cannot be supported by our data. AEs and changes in laboratory values occur to a relevant amount under placebo treatment, which should be considered and can help in the interpretation of other study results. </p>
