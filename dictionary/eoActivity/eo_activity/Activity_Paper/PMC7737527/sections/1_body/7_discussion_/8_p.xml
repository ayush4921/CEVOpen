<p>In our studies, only subjects were included without clinically relevant laboratory deviations at the time of inclusion. On this background, the observed frequent increases in the placebo group during treatment further support the commonly accepted recommendation to follow strict eligibility rules for such studies [

This improves not only subject safety but could thus also prevent the inclusion of subjects with predisposition to show further laboratory elevations during treatment and thereby impair the assessment of the placebo group as a reasonable control to detect signals of organ toxicity.
