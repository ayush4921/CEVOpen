<p>A total of 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported during the studies, none of which was considered drug related: 1 syncope (moderate) in dose step 1 of 3 in a subject on active treatment with a non-vasoactive compound with a belatedly revealed medical history finding of repetitive syncope, 1 ALT increase (moderate) 37 days after last dosing with placebo due to alcohol consumption, and 1 previously planned minor surgical intervention (severe) after placebo treatment. The reasons for seriousness were medical importance concerning the ALT increase and syncope and hospitalization for the planned surgery. Two SAEs resolved completely, the ALT increase was improving at the last contact to the investigator (subject was lost to follow-up). </p>
