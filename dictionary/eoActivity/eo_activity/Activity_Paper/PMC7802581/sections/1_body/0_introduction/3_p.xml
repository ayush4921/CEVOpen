<p>One of such underutilized multipurpose plants is 
 <italic>Heteromorpha arborescens</italic> (Spreng.) Cham. &amp; Schltdl. which belongs to the Apiaceae family. It is a large shrub‐like, medium deciduous tree widely distributed over tropical and temperate regions in Africa. The plant has gained great importance in parts of Africa especially in east and southern Africa because of its nutritional components, biological activities, and therapeutic efficiency (Maroyi, 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). The leaves and roots are used for the treatment of inflammation, abdominal pains, and as general analgesic (Mc Graw et al. 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">1997</xref>; Lundgaard et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). Other uses are for intestinal deworming, jaundice, kidney problems, diabetes (Moshi and Mbwambo, 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>; Erasto et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), to treat mental disorders (Hutchings et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>; Palmer &amp; Pitman, 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">1972</xref>; Van Wyk and Oudtshoorn, 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>), fever, and malaria (Fowler, 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>; Lundgaard et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>; Schmidt et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). As a result of its perceived great nutritional value, the leaves are eaten as vegetables in Kenya (Bussman 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) and the roots are fed to malnourished children in Botswana and Swaziland (Setshogo and Mbereki, 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). However, the leaves are not consumed as vegetable in some parts of Africa including South Africa possibly due to lack of information of its nutritional potentials. Furthermore, despite the nutritional and medicinal significance of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves, to the best of our knowledge there is no documented report on the proximate, mineral, vitamins, and antinutritional compositions of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating the nutritional profile of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves toward an informed validation of its traditional use as a vegetable, while encouraging its possible inclusion in human diets especially in South Africa.
