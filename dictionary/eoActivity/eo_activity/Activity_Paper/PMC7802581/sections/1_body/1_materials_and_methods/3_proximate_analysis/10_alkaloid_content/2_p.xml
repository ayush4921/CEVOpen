<p>Alkaloid content of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves was determined as previously described by Oyeyinka and Afolayan (
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). 0.5 g of the sample was mixed with 200 ml of 10% acetic acid in ethanol. The mixture was covered, incubated at room temperature for 4 hr, filtered, and concentrated to about a quarter of its original volume in a water bath. Thereafter, concentrated ammonium hydroxide was added drop wise to the extract till complete precipitation was attained. The solution was allowed to settle, and the precipitate formed was washed with dilute ammonium hydroxide and then filtered. The residue was oven dried at 40°C and weighed, and the alkaloid content was calculated as:
