<p>Saponin content of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves was determined as previously described by Idris et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). 0.5 g of the sample was measured into a beaker containing 50 ml of 20% ethanol. The solution was heated in a hot water bath for 4 hr at 55°C and filtered, and the residue re‐extracted with another 50 ml of 20% ethanol. The filtrates were mixed together and concentrated to 20 ml over the hot water bath at 90°C. The solution obtained was transferred into a 250 ml separating funnel containing 20 ml of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer was collected; 20 ml of n‐butanol was added to it and then washed thrice with 10 ml of 5% sodium chloride while the ether layer was thrown away. The mixture was oven dried (40°C) to constant weight, and the percentage saponin content of the sample was calculated as:
