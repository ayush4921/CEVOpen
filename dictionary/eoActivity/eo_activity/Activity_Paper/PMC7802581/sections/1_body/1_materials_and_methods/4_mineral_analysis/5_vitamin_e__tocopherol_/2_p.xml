<p>Vitamin E content of the sample was determined as previously described by Njoku et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). 1 g of the sample was soaked in 20 ml of ethanol and filtered. Thereafter, 1 ml of 0.2% ferric chloride in ethanol and 1 ml of 0.5% α ‐dipyridyl solution were added to 1 ml of the filtrate. The solution was further diluted with water to 5 ml, and the absorbance was measured at 520 nm. The vitamin E content of the sample was determined as retinol equivalent in mg/g, from the equation:
