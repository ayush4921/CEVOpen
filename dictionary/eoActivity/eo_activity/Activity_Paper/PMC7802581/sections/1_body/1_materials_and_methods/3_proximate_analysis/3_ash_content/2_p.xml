<p>The ash content was determined by as previously described (Unuofin et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31978-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). A crucible was washed, dried (105°C) for 1 hr, and left to cool in a desiccator, and the weight was measured (

 <sub>1</sub>). Then, 2 g of the dried sample was measured into the weighed crucible and the new weight was measured (
 <italic>W</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>). The crucible with its content was then put into a muffle furnace for 1 hr at 250°C and again for another 5 hr (550°C) for complete ashing. The samples were left to cool in a desiccator, and the final weight was measured (

 <sub>3</sub>). The percentage ash was calculated as:
