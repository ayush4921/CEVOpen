<p>Despite the phenomenal contribution and potential of medicinal plants, especially in the treatment of malaria, there is no scientific data to validate the claimed antimalarial activities and safety. The studied medicinal plants and their parts (
 <italic>Erythrina abyssinica</italic> (stem bark), 
 <italic>Schkuhria pinnata</italic> (whole plant) 
 <italic>Sterculia africana</italic> (stem bark), 
 <italic>Terminalia brownii</italic> (leaves),

 <italic>Carissa edulis</italic> (leaves), 
 <italic>Tithonia diversifolia</italic> (leaves and flowers), and 
 <italic>Senna didymobotrya</italic> (leaves and pods)), are commonly utilized by Embu community for the management of malaria [
