<p>For 
 <italic>L. mollissima</italic> leaves, both aqueous and dichloromethane extracts were inactive while methanol extracts exhibited low antiplasmodial activity. These findings are in concurrence with a previous study by [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] who also observed lack of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity for the water extract and low activity for the methanol extracts of the leaves collected in Kenya. However, unlike the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays that demonstrated lack of activity for the water extracts, moderate suppression (30-60%) was observed for the mice treated with these extracts. This evidently indicates the lack of concurrence between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. This phenomenon could be linked to the fact that the bioactive compounds could be prodrugs that became active upon being metabolized to active form(s) 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
