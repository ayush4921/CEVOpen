<p>Some extracts such as aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>T. brownii</italic> were inactive 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (suppression of &lt;10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) despite them demonstrating high 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). This could probably be due to the active constituents being biotransformed to an inactive form, poor transportation of the drug, or poor absorption of the active constituents 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> [
