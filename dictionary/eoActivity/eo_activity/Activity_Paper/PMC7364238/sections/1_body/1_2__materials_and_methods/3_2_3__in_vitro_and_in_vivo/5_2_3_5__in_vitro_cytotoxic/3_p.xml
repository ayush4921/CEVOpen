<p>The cells were exposed to the test extracts for 48 hours after which 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 10 mg/ml MTT assay reagent was added across all the wells and incubated for further 4 hours at the same condition. All the media were then removed from the plate, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The plates were then read on a Multiskan EX Labsystems scanning Multiwell spectrophotometer at 562 and 690 nm as reference. The results were recorded as optical density (OD) per well at each drug concentration. The data was transferred into Microsoft Excel 2016 and expressed as the percentage of the untreated controls by the use of the formula described by [
