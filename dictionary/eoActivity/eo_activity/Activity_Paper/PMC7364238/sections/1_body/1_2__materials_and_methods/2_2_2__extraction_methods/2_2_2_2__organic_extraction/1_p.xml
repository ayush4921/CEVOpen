<p>Sequential extraction using dichloromethane and methanol was adopted [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, 100 grams of the respective plant materials were macerated in 600 ml in 1000 ml capacity beakers at room temperature (25°C) for 48 hours. The mixtures were then filtered through double-layer Whatman's number one filter papers after which the filtrates were reduced 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> at 40°C using a rotary evaporator. Afterwards, the respective marcs were macerated in 600 ml volumes of methanol in 1000 ml capacity beakers in the same way as for dichloromethane extraction Thereafter, the menstruums were obtained by filtration and concentrated 
 <italic>in vacuo</italic> using a rotary evaporator set at 56°C. The resultant extracts were transferred into clean preweighed glass bottles, and their yields were determined and stored at -20°C in a freezer until use.
