<p>An 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> semiautomated microdilution assay technique was used to measure the ability of the extracts to inhibit the incorporation of [G-
 <sup>3</sup>H]-hypoxanthine into the malaria parasite [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Aliquots of the culture medium (25 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) were added to all the wells of a 96-well flat-bottomed microculture except for row B. The test solutions (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) were added in triplicate to row B, and a titertek motorized hand diluter was used to make twofolds serial dilutions of each sample over a 64-fold concentration range from 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (100%) to 3.125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (1.56%). Suspensions (200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l, 1.5% 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) of parasitized erythrocytes (0.4% parasitemia) in the culture media were added to all rows except for row R
 <sub>9</sub>-R
 <sub>12</sub> which contained nonparasitized erythrocytes. The plates were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere of 3% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 5% O
 <sub>2</sub>, and 92% N
 <sub>2</sub>. After 48 hours, each well was pulsed with 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of culture medium containing 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>Ci of [G-
 <sup>3</sup>H]-hypoxanthine and the plates were incubated for further 18 hours. The contents of each plate were harvested onto glass fiber mats, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and dried, and the radioactivity was measured using liquid scintillation.
