<p>Furthermore, we have determined the mode of inhibition of the cholinesterases by galantamine and REVERC3 using LB reciprocal plots. The extract exhibited competitive inhibition of AChE activity. The K
 <sub>m</sub> value was increased while V
 <sub>max</sub> remained unaffected in the presence of REVERC3. Previously, galantamine was found to competitively inhibit AChE activity.

 </sup> However, in this study, galantamine demonstrated mixed inhibition. This could be explained by the difference in the experimental conditions. REVERC3 showed the uncompetitive mode of inhibition of BuChE activity as the V
 <sub>max</sub> and K
 <sub>m</sub> were reduced in the presence of the extract. Galantamine appeared to exhibit competitive inhibition.
