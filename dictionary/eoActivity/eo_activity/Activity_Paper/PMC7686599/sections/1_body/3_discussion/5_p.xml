 </sup> This study unveils the improved benefits of BDMC over curcumin in inhibiting the key enzymes associated with neurodegeneration. Previously, it has been shown that BDMC is comparatively more stable than curcumin in physiological conditions.

 </sup> Findings from our study rationalize the use of a BDMC-rich turmeric extract as a functional ingredient in food and health supplements for brain health. The present investigation however is limited to the in vitro studies. Further insights into the molecular aspects related to neuronal health such as Aβ aggregation and toxicity, tau hyperphosphorylation and neurotransmission using cellular and preclinical models are required to validate the neuroprotective properties of BDMC.
