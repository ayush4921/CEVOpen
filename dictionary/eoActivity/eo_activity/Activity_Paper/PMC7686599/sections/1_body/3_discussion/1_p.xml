 </sup> In this study, we have evaluated the cholinesterase inhibitory effect of a standardized turmeric extract containing more than 70% BDMC. Conventionally regular turmeric extract contains curcumin as the major curcuminoid and the content of BDMC is only 2%â€“3%. Here, we have used a BDMC-enriched extract (REVERC3) to study the possible mechanism of cholinesterase inhibition. Initially, the cholinesterase enzyme inhibition assays were performed using different concentrations of REVERC3 and the regular turmeric extract. Interestingly, REVERC3 demonstrated higher inhibitory activity compared to the regular turmeric extract. Furthermore, the BDMC-enriched extract was found to inhibit both AChE and BuChE activities appreciably. The respective IC50 values of REVERC3 for the inhibition of AChE and BuChE were 4.8- and 5.39-fold lower relative to regular curcumin. The drastic increase in the inhibitory ability of REVERC3 could be largely attributed to the enriched content of BDMC in the extract.
