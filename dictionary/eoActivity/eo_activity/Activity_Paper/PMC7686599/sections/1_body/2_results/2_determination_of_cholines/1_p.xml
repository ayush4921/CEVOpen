<p>The cholinesterase inhibitory potentials of REVERC3 was determined and compared with regular turmeric extract. Galantamine was used as the standard inhibitor.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2050312120973499">Figure 2</xref> shows the results of the inhibition assay performed against AChE and BuChE enzymes. As expected, galantamine was far the most potent inhibitor of cholinesterases with IC50 values of 0.31 and 9.9 µg/mL for AChE and BuChE activities, respectively. REVERC3 exhibited higher AChE inhibitory activity (IC50 29.08 µg/mL) compared to regular turmeric extract (IC50 139.2 µg/mL). REVERC3 and turmeric extract showed 93.8- and 449.03-fold difference relative to galantamine, respectively. A similar trend was observed in BuChE inhibition. REVERC3 demonstrated greater potency with an IC50 value of 33.59 µg/mL compared to regular turmeric extract (180.9 µg/mL).
