 </sup> Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the key enzyme involved in ACh metabolism is a prime target in the treatment of AD.

 </sup> In addition, butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) has also been reported to play a role in the ACh metabolism at the later stages in AD pathology.

 </sup> Hence, it is of great interest to use the interventions that can act as dual inhibitors of AChE as well as BuChE in the therapeutic strategy against AD. Several drugs such as donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and tacrine function as inhibitors of AChE, thereby increasing the ACh levels.

 </sup> Rivastigmine and galantamine are known drugs for the inhibition of both AChE and BuChE.
