 </sup> AD is characterized by the progressive loss of cognitive function leading to irreversible neurodegenerative disorder.

 </sup> AD pathology includes the apoptotic death of cholinergic neurons in the neocortical and limbic regions subsequently resulting in the decline of neurotransmission.

 </sup> Presumably, the cholinergic deficits result from tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid plaque formation.
