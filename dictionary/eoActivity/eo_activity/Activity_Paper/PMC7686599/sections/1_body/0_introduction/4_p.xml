 </sup> The medicinal properties of turmeric such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidant effects are mostly attributed to the presence of the yellow pigment curcumin.

 </sup> Other curcuminoids such as bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) and demethoxycurcumin (DMC) exhibit synergistic effects with curcumin.

 </sup> have reported the preliminary findings on the inhibitory potential of BDMC against AChE. Here we have studied the kinetics of AChE and BuChE enzyme inhibition by a BDMC-rich proprietary turmeric extract (REVERC3). Furthermore, in silico docking studies were performed to predict the binding interaction of BDMC with the catalytic sites of cholinesterases. Data from this study provide valuable information on the potentials of BDMC as dual inhibitor of cholinesterases and its possible role in slowing down cognitive decline.
