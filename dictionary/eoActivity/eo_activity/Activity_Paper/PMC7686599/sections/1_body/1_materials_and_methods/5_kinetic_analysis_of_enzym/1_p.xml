<p>The kinetics of inhibition of AChE and BuChE activities at various substrate and inhibitor concentrations were studied. Two concentrations of REVERC3 and galantamine were evaluated for inhibition of enzyme activity using different ATC (0.1, 0.2, and 0.4) and BTC (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mM) substrate concentrations. The changes in reaction velocity were determined as a function of maximum velocity (V
 <sub>max</sub>) and Michaelis constant (K
 <sub>m</sub>). The pattern of inhibition was determined using Lineweaver–Burk (L-B) double reciprocal plot, where a graph of 1/change in absorbance (ΔAb/min) was plotted against 1/[substrate]. The identification of the type of inhibition was based on point of intersection of lines. The L-B plots and kinetic parameters K
 <sub>m</sub> and V
 <sub>max</sub> were obtained using GraphPad Prism.
