<p>At both study sites—Vlasina (V) and Golija (G)—individuals from three distinct populations of 
 <italic>G. asclepiadea</italic> were sampled during the flowering period (August 2019). All specimens were healthy individuals without any visible damage caused by herbivores or pathogens. Populations were positioned at the edges of forest communities dominated by beech, beech–birch (Vlasina), or spruce and beech–spruce (Golija), with the distance between them of about several kilometers. From one population, seven to eight individuals were sampled; from each individual, a mixed sample of three stems was considered as the aboveground part (A), and the common rhizome as the belowground part (B). Above- and belowground parts were divided after air-drying of whole plants and analyzed separately. The total number of samples was 2 (locations) × 3 (populations) × 7–8 (individuals) × 2 (plant parts) = 86. Representative samples are in the herbarium at the Institute for Biological Research, Belgrade (voucher codes V1, V2, V3, G1, G2, G3).
