<p>PCA separated 86 elements into 4 distinct assemblages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00140-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). The results show that the first two axes explain 68.87% of data variability (44.64% and 24.23%, respectively), and the information about well-compressed data was confirmed by their eigenvalues &gt; 1. Based on the sum of squared correlations between the variables and factors in the PC 1â€“2 plane (sum of r
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.87), it can be concluded that MGF, SWM, and GP are the best-represented properties and are likely to have the most important role in the total variability of the sample (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00140-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The formation of the first axis is mainly defined by the variability of MGF, ISOOR, SWZ, and GP, whereas the variability of SWM is the most important for the formation of the second axis. The structure of the properties and their relationships are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00140-f004">Figure 4</xref>b. The tendencies among the elements (i.e., their groupings (or separation)) are noticeable in the plane of the first two axes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00140-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Well-represented elements, with the larger square cosine of the observations for the first two axes, are displayed by larger dots.
