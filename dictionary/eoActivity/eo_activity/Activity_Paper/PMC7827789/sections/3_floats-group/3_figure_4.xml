  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Score plot. Separation of 86 individuals in regard to interactions of parts of a plant and locality according to the contents of 6 variables in the plane of the first 2 axes. Larger-dot elements are better-represented elements, with the larger square cosine of the observations for the first two axes: 1–7 = V1A; 8–14 = V1B; 15–21 = V2A; 22–28 = V2B; 29–35 = V3A; 36–42 = V3B; 43–50 = G1A; 51–57 = G1B; 58–64 = G2A; 65–72 = G2B; 73–79 = G3A; 80–86 = G3B; (
   <bold>b</bold>) Loading plot. Structure of the six variables in the plane of the first 2 axes in 86 individuals.
