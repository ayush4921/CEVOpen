<p>This study is the first report on the chemical composition and biological (in vitro and in silico) activities of 
 <italic>H. crispium</italic>. It can be concluded that the methanol extract showed consistently high total phenolic contents, a number of individual phenolic compounds with previous antioxidant propensities, as well as enzyme inhibitory potential. The RP-UHPLC-QTOF-MS screening showed the presence of important pyrrolizidine alkaloids, peptides, irodide, and phenolic compounds, which are famous for their antioxidant activities; large numbers of these were identified in this plant. Docking studies for the selected compounds have shown a high inhibition activity of lithospermic acid 
 <bold>(42)</bold> and salvianolic acid A 
 <bold>(41)</bold> against the five studied enzymes. The significant enzyme inhibition, docking results, and antioxidant activities of the 
 <italic>H. crispium</italic> plant could pave a path to further exploration of this plant for the isolation of pure compounds responsible for the observed biological properties.
