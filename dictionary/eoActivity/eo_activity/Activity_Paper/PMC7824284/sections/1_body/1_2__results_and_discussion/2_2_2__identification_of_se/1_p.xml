<p>The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>H. crispum</italic> was subjected to a UHPLC-MS (positive and negative ionization mode) screening, which resulted in the possible identification of 50 secondary metabolites (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00053-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00053-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These secondary metabolites belong to different classes such as irodide, pyrrolizidine alkaloids, peptides, pyruvic and coumaric acids, polyphenolic compounds, and long-chain fatty acids. Among the irodides identified through the negative mode, nepetaside (
 <bold>1</bold>) was found to be a known phytochemical [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], while the unknown compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was tentatively identified as a derivative of 
 <bold>1</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="biomolecules-11-00053-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>). UHPLC-MS analysis depicted the molecular formula of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> as C
 <sub>16</sub>H
 <sub>26</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> with four double bond equivalents (DBE), while the unknown compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (C
 <sub>17</sub>H
 <sub>30</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> with three DBE) was elucidated as though the carbonyl moiety of the ester function might have been reduced to an ether linkage. Further, the mass analysis showed a difference of 16 amu between 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2,</bold> which also confirmed the methylation along with a reduction of 
 <bold>1</bold> into 
 <bold>2</bold>. This kind of methylation is a common biosynthetic process found in natural products, specifically in irodide classes [
