<p>In the present investigation, the free radical scavenging assessment of 
 <italic>H. crispum</italic> extract was made through DPPH and ABTS, with values of 43.19 mg TE/g extract and 41.80 mg TE/g extract, respectively. Meanwhile, reducing power potential was achieved through FRAP and CUPRAC assays, with a potential of 63.11 mg TE/g extract and 116.11 mg TE/g extract, respectively (
 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00053-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The phosphomolybdenum assay, which measured the total antioxidant potential, exhibited 2.11 mmol TE/g extract potential by the tested extract. In addition to the above assays, the metal chelating potential was observed to be 46.72 mg EDTAE/g extract. These results offer a better understanding of the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic>H. crispum</italic>. In the previously reported data [
 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-11-00053" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the 
 <italic>H. strigosum</italic> methanolic extract also showed higher potential in the DPPH assay, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 10.45 μg/mL having higher phenolic contents (84.50 ± 0.06 µg QE/mg of plant extract). In another report, the major product of the dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>H. ovalifolium</italic> has been reported to contain heliotropamide, an alkaloid with a novel oxopyrrolidine-3-carboxamide central moiety, which exhibited radical-scavenging properties in the DPPH test [

 <italic>H. indicum</italic> presented DPPH inhibition, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 306 μg/mL [
