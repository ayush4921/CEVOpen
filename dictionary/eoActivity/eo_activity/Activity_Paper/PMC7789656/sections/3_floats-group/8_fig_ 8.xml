  <p>Effect of orlistat and plant extracts on porcine pancreatic lipase activity. Orlistat (positive control), and the 
   <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> and 
   <italic>Sophora japonica</italic> extracts were tested at 0.1 mg/mL. The negative control (uninhibited control) was normalised to 100% activity. Data represent the mean + SEM of readings from three independent experiments. Bars that do not share a letter were significantly different from each other as determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test (
   <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). Uppercase letters denote significance between treatment groups and lowercase letters denotes significance within groups. RD: raw data, BB: buffer blank (contained buffer only), SuB: substrate blank (contained substrate + buffer), and SaB: sample blank. Sample blank composition: 
   <italic>C. sinensis</italic> sample blank = 
   <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract + buffer, 
   <italic>S. japonica</italic> sample blank = 
   <italic>S. japonica</italic> extract + buffer, orlistat sample blank (positive control blank) = orlistat + buffer, and control sample blank (negative control blank) = vehicle + buffer (as the vehicle was buffer, this contained buffer only)
