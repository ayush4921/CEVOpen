  <p>Effect of acarbose and plant extracts on rat intestinal α-glucosidase activity. Acarbose (positive control), and the 
   <italic>Aegle marmelos</italic> and 
   <italic>Phyllanthus niruri</italic> leaf extracts were tested at 0.5 mg/mL. The negative control (uninhibited control) was normalised to 100% activity. Data represent the mean + SEM of triplicate readings (
   <italic>n </italic>=3). Bars that do not share a letter were significantly different from each other as determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison test (
   <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). Uppercase letters denote significance between treatment groups and lowercase letters denote significance within groups. RD: raw data, BB: buffer blank (contained buffer only), SuB: substrate blank (contained substrate + buffer), and SaB: sample blank. Sample blank composition: 
   <italic>A. marmelos</italic> sample blank = 
   <italic>A. marmelos</italic> extract + buffer, 
   <italic>P. niruri</italic> sample blank = 
   <italic>P. niruri</italic> extract + buffer, acarbose sample blank (positive control blank) = acarbose + buffer, and negative control sample blank (negative control blank) = vehicle + buffer (as the vehicle was buffer, this contained buffer only)
