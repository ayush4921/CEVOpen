<p id="Par37">A practical approach to minimise assay interference from substrate contamination and degradation is to use a reagent (substrate) blank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Some published studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] have included a substrate blank to eliminate any false signals due to colour (absorbance) or fluorescence of the substrate. However, as with the sample blanks, many studies appear to omit the use of a substrate blank. Instead, many report using either a buffer blank or a blank that is not defined in the publications.
