<p id="Par39">The aims of this study were to (1) provide comprehensive protocols for carrying out a colorimetric (absorbance) α-glucosidase inhibition assay, and fluorometric α-amylase and lipase inhibition assays in 96-well microplates; and (2) investigate whether using a buffer blank, substrate blank, sample blank, or a combination of blanks for blank-correction will affect the final, calculated enzyme inhibition results.</p>
