<p id="Par25">Alternatively, there are also fluorescence-based enzyme assays which make use of substrates linked to a fluorophore. Enzymatic cleavage releases the fluorophore which re-emits light (fluoresces) upon excitation at a specific wavelength [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. A routinely used substrate for fluorescence-based α-amylase assays is the BODIPY
 <sup>®</sup> FL-DQ™ (boron-dipyrromethene fluorescent dye quenching) starch which consists of a starch derivative (DQ™ starch) conjugated to the green fluorescent BODIPY
 <sup>®</sup> FL fluorophore. The DQ™ starch is heavily labelled with BODIPY
 <sup>®</sup> FL to such an extent that the close proximity of the fluorophores to each other results in intramolecular self-quenching and the substrate fluorescence is almost completely quenched (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). As the substrate is hydrolysed by α-amylase, the intramolecular self-quenching is disrupted causing an intense increase in green fluorescence [
