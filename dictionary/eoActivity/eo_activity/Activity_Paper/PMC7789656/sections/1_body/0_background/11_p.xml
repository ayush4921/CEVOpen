<p id="Par32">Poor solubility of some extracts and compounds in the assay buffers results in turbidity due to the presence of undissolved, suspended particles and may lead to inaccurate results. Light passing through a turbid medium is subject to multiple scattering and absorption events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Therefore, turbidity interferes with spectrophotometric measurements by increasing absorbance and can result in misleadingly high readings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Similarly, the absorbance and scattering of photons in a turbid medium can also distort fluorescence measurements [
