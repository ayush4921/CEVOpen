<p id="Par24">In-lab approaches for screening enzyme inhibitors from natural product extracts are based on spectroscopy and often determines enzyme activity using specially designed, labelled substrates which, upon enzymatic cleavage, produce a spectrometrically measurable signal either as colour (absorbance) or fluorescence of a defined wavelength [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For example, the chromogenic substrate 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-
 <italic>α</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (
 <italic>p</italic>NPG) is widely used for the determination of α-glucosidase activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 
 <italic>p</italic>NPG is a colourless molecule which contains a 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose residue linked to a 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol moiety via a glycosidic bond. Hydrolysis of this glycosidic bond by α-glucosidase releases 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol (coloured product), enabling the spectrophotometric determination of α-glucosidase activity at the absorbance maxima of 
 <italic>p</italic>NPG; λ = 405 nm [
