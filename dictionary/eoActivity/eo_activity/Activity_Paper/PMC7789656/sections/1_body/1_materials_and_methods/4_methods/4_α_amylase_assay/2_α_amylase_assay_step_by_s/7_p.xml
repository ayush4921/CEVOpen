<p id="Par89">Comment: ‘Test wells’ refer to the wells containing enzyme + substrate and a test sample or control. Note that the well volumes were adjusted to 100 µL with the addition of buffer to maintain the total reaction mixture volumes consistent across all three assays, for convenience and calculations, and to minimise the effects of evaporation during incubation. This is not strictly necessary and adjusting the volumes (and concentrations) of enzyme, substrate, and test substances to a total of 100 µL is suggested.</p>
