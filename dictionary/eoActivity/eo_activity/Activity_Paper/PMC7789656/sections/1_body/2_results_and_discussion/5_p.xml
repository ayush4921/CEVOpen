<p id="Par133">In contrast to the plant extracts, acarbose inhibited α-glucosidase significantly regardless of whether or not a sample blank was included in the blank-correction. Acarbose was colourless and dissolved completely in α-glucosidase assay buffer I to give a clear, colourless solution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Hence, any spectral interference due to the background absorbance of acarbose was negligible and not correcting this background absorbance did not affect the final results as much as the highly coloured extracts which had high background absorbances (sample blank absorbance).
