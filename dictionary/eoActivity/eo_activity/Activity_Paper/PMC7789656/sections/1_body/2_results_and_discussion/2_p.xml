<p id="Par130">Blank-correction using just the buffer blank (RD − BB) yielded high enzyme activity, and therefore low enzyme inhibition results in all three assays (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 7 and 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). In the α-glucosidase assay, RD − BB exhibited the highest enzyme activity value for acarbose, and the second highest enzyme activity values for 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> and 
 <italic>P. niruri.</italic> Similarly, in the lipase assay, RD − BB yielded the highest enzyme activity for 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. japonica,</italic> and the second highest for orlistat. In the α-amylase assay, RD − BB gave very high enzyme activity, however, these enzyme activity values were almost identical to RD − SaB and RD − (BB + SaB).
