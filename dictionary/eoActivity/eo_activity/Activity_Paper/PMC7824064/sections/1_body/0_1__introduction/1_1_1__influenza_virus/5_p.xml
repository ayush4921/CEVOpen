<p>Severe cases of influenza infection are associated with the risk of death, especially in children, the elderly, and in immunocompromised patients [

 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and their clinical efficacy is also ambiguous [

 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], although resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has remained at low levels [

 <xref rid="B18-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, efficient control of influenza outbreaks requires the discovery and development of novel antiviral drugs affecting different aspects of the viral infection pathway. For this purpose, nature might be promising as a reference for targetable pathways and modes.
