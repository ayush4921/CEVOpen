<p>ROS production is an important host defense mechanism against influenza virus infection. However, excessive superoxide production may stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-α IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), and MIP-1a, as well as inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils into the lung. This induces activation of the innate immune system, which is essential for viral clearance and resolution of inflammation, but might be harmful to the cell. Persistent trafficking of these inflammatory factors causes a cytokine storm, which may have a reverse effect on viral clearance and causes excessive damage. Suppression of superoxide production by targeting the enzymatic major source of superoxide and ROS in mammalian inflammatory cells, NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2), reduces influenza A virus-induced lung injury and virus replication [

Superoxide anion, produced by macrophages infiltrated into the virus-infected organs, is used for the development of severe influenza-associated complications. Influenza-induced oxidative stress increases vascular permeability and breakability resulting in the airway mucosa and lung tissue edema, as well as multiple hemorrhages in the alveolar area, interstitial lung cells, and all internal organs. Therefore, the combination of antioxidants with antiviral drugs could synergistically reduce the lethal effects of influenza virus infections [
