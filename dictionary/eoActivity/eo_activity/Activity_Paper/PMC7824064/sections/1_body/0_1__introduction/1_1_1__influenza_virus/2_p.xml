<p>Influenza afflicts about 5–10% of adults and 20–30% of children annually [
 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Severe disease could result in the deaths of about 290,000–650,000 people worldwide in one season [
 <xref rid="B5-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Beside deaths, influenza may cause respiratory, diabetic, cardiovascular, renal, and neurological complications as reviewed in [

 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, the estimated cost of influenza infection in the United States alone amounts to about $11.2 billion annually [

In 2019/2020, the “influenza-season” coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and the current (2020/2021) “influenza-season” is coinciding with the peak of COVID-19 epidemics in many countries, increasing the risk of coinfection with both viruses. To date, at least 13 cases of coinfection of Covid-19 and influenza have been reported in PubMed-listed articles. A larger prevalence of coinfection is suspected, though still under investigation due to the symptoms similarities, as reviewed by H. Khorramdelazad et al. (2020) [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In some of the reviewed cases, the coinfection was not more severe than infection with COVID-19 alone [
 <xref rid="B10-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. One report suggested a protective effect of influenza infection against infection with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Coinfection was also investigated in an animal model study using golden Syrian hamsters [
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The study results indicated more “clinically” severe disease in the case of coinfection with both viruses. In September 2020, a British SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) report was released concerning coinfection of COVID-19 and influenza in hospitalized patients. About 18% of hospitalized Covid-19 patients that were tested for influenza were also carrying influenza virus. Only 3.9% of all COVID-19-positive cases were also cross-tested for influenza, and only 0.7% of them were influenza positive [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The consequences of coinfections were an increased number of critical care admissions, longer hospitalization time (greater than twice the time), and a greater need for oxygen and mechanical ventilation [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As both diseases produce similar symptoms, it is highly recommended to use all possible means to prevent the infection with influenza, as the COVID-19 vaccine is still not widely available.
