<p>Quercetin, the most abundant flavonoid molecule [
 <xref rid="B75-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], is itself the aglycone form of rutin, but flavonoids are bound to sugars in their natural state, and quercetin is thus also found naturally in its glycoside forms. Glycosylation can occur at any hydroxyl group of the compound [
 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The compound possesses 2 benzene rings (ring A and B), which are linked by a 3-carbon chain that forms a closed pyran ring (C ring) with variously distributed hydroxyl and methyl groups [

 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00010-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, adapted from Gansukh et al. (2014), with some modifications, provides a summary of the structural properties of quercetin and its derivatives [
 <xref rid="B75-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. It is worth noting that Pawlikowska-PawlÄ™ga et al. [
 <xref rid="B90-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>], in their study, highlighted modifications in the phospholipid membranes of human skin fibroblasts (HSF) after exposure to quercetin, which was found to localize in the polar head regions of the membrane. It could be detected on membranes in the cytoplasm, around the nuclear envelope and inside the nucleus and nuclei by increasing the exposure time. This property affects its quality of pharmacological activities.
