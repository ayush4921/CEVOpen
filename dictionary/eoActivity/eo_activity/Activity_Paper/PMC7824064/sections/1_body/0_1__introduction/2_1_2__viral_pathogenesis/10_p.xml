<p>Valyi-Nagy et al., 2012, highlighted that oxidative damage is a mechanism activated by viral infection, which may result from direct effects of virus on cells or indirect effects of host inflammatory responses. Inflammatory responses of the host cells augmented by viral infection may cause for O
 <sub>2</sub>- and other ROS production by infiltrating phagocytic cells and XO-mediated humoral responses. Inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-Î² lead to the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) during influenza virus infection. ROS, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and secondary lipid peroxidation products like HNE and MDA may affect viral replication through modulation of the activation state of cells, regulation of host immune responses, and oxidative damage to host tissues and viral components [
