<p>Regarding the importance and efficacy of quercetin and other flavonols against influenza virus infection, flavonoids have attracted increasing attention as a potential therapeutic to combat infection with SARS-CoV-2, from human coronavirus family, which has been responsible for a rapid worldwide pandemic starting from 2020. A few in silico and computational studies have evaluated libraries of natural products and phenolic compounds against SARS-CoV-2. As a result, quercetin was found among the top 5 most potent compounds to bind strongly to the Spike Protein (S) receptor of the virus [

 <xref rid="B159-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. It should be noted that oral administration of quercetin would not achieve drug contact with viral S protein, because of its glycosylation for biotransformation in the gastrointestinal tract [

 <xref rid="B162-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. Therefore, the flavonoid quercetin appears to be the most promising natural antiviral compound on the basis of its antiviral activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections and is a noteworthy candidate for further in vivo studies.
