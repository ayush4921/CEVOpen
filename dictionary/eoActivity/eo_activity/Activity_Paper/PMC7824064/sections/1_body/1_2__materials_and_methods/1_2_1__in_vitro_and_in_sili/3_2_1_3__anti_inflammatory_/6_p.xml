 <italic>Rapanea melanophloeos</italic>, a South African medicinal plant of the family Myrsinaceae, was investigated for the first time in as a source of quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside and for its immunomodulatory properties against influenza A virus. This plant has traditionally been used to treat respiratory ailments [

 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside was purified from fraction FIII on Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography using methanol. Simultaneous, prepenetration, and postpenetration combination treatments of quercetin-3-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside (at a nontoxic concentration of 150 µg/mL) and A/PR/8/34 H1N1 virus were evaluated over 1-h incubation in MDCK cells. Using HA and qPCR assays, the virus titer and viral load targeting NP and M2 viral genes were determined, respectively. TNF-α and IL-27 levels were also determined, as major pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In summary, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside was found to decrease the viral titer by 6 log fold, reduced viral genome expression (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and affected cytokine levels significantly [
