<p>Wan et al., 2013, investigated the effect of quercetin on cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) at mRNA and protein level in A549 human lung epithelial cells infected by influenza A H1N1 (A1/Qian fang/166/85) in parallel with ribavirin. The CDKs are involved in cell division and any dysregulation in their expression by infection causes DNA damage and apoptotic process. The cells were infected with virus for 2 h, following which the maintenance media containing quercetin (10 µg/mL) and/or ribavirin (20 µg/mL) was added. The cells were then harvested after 4, 12, 24, and 48 h of culture, and total RNA and protein were extracted. The CDK4 mRNA and protein expression, measured at four time points, increased significantly in the H1N1 group (

Quercetin was not as potent as ribavirin in promoting cell survival, but it was less toxic and inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of CDK4 induced by H1N1 infection. It was suggested that quercetin possesses potential clinical antiviral application value [
