 <xref rid="B112-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] observed induction of immunomodulatory signaling molecules (IL-6, IFN-β, and TNF-α and antiviral activity of aqueous extract of

 <xref rid="B112-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Fifteen active compounds, including quercetin, psoralen, and quercitrin, were detected by UPLC-MS/MS. Pretreatment with 
 <italic>Eupatorium fortunei</italic> aqueous extract markedly reduced viral replication, as evaluated by the GFP-tagged virus. It also induced the production of type I IFN, including pro-inflammatory cytokines. This extract regulated the phosphorylation of IRF-3, STAT1, and TBK1, which are key molecules in the signaling pathway of type I IFN. This extract and its active components were introduced as immunomodulators of the innate immune response in murine macrophages as a basis for the development of prophylactic or treatments against viruses. Influenza replication was dramatically suppressed in quercetin-treated cells [
