<p>In vivo validation of anti-influenza capacity of quercetin and chlorogenic acid was tested by Liu and colleagues. The lung index and survival rate were employed to evaluate the protective effect of the compounds. BALB/c female mice were infected with influenza A H1N1 (A/PR/8/34), and then treated with the compounds in different doses through intragastric administration. The inhibition rates were dose dependent. The survival rate and lung index for quercetin treatment (80%, 0.72 ± 0.07) at 960 mg/kg/day were similar to zanamivir at 480 mg/kg/day (90%, 0.65 ± 0.10) [
