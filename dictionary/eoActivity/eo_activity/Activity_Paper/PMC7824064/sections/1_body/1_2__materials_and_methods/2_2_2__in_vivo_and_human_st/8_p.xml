<p>The protective effect of Epimedium koreanum Nakai against lethal doses of different types of highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (H1N1, H5N2, H7N3, and H9N2) was determined in BALB/c mice [
 <xref rid="B111-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. In the experimental groups, the mice were orally administered 0.1 mg/mL Epimedium koreanum Nakai at 1, 3, and 5 days before infection to confirm the prophylactic effects of the extract. Among the various components present in the extract, quercetin, in particular, was shown to have prominent antiviral properties. The mice were then intranasally infected with 5 times lethal dose (5MLD50) of each virus. The virus titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) from the lung tissues. All treated groups showed reduced viral titers. The extract-treated mice showed much lower body weight loss compared with the untreated group between 5 and 7 days postinfection (dpi) and recovered their weight loss by 8 dpi, and then returned to their normal state by 13 dpi.
