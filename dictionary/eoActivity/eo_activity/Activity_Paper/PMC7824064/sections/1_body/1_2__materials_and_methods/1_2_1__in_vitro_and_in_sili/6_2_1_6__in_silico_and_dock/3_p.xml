<p>Recently, Naïve Bayesian, recursive partitioning and CDOCKER methods have been used to construct a compound-protein interaction-prediction virtual screening system of the virus–host interaction for new drug discovery against IAV. This system was used to predict active compounds in Yizhihao, one of the common Chinese herbal formulas used to treat influenza and cold symptoms. It consists of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic>, 
 <italic>Folium isatidis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Artemisia rupestris</italic>. The effectiveness of this formula has been shown against influenza A (H1N1, H3N2, oseltamivir resistant H1N1, and amantadine-resistant H3N2) and B strains in vitro, but with no report of ingredients and mechanisms [

The results from CPE reduction assay in this study provided scientific information for its usage and showed that quercetin, along with other compounds such as acacetin, indirubin, tryptanthrin, luteolin, emodin, and apigenin, had protective effects against wild-type strains A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Minfang/151/2000 (H3N2) with lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values and stronger activities than oseltamivir and ribavirin, especially when the viruses were preincubated and treated simultaneously with the drug compounds. Quercetin supports the activity of the compounds by reducing H1N1 viral activity or impairing viral adsorption [

NA glycoprotein has been considered an important target in drug design as it has a relatively preserved active site and is important in virus distribution. In a docking study by Sadati et al., 2019, the flavonoids quercetin, vitexin, chrysin, catechin, luteolin, naringenin, kaempferol, and hispidulin were selected to evaluate their potential inhibitory effect on influenza H1N1 virus by looking for their binding energy to the NA active site structure along with oseltamivir. These compounds showed high potential and affinity for binding to the active site of NA domain N1 with lower binding energies (−6.8 kcal/mol for quercetin, −7.2 kcal/mol for catechin, −6.9 kcal/mol for naringenin, −7.1 kcal/mol for luteolin, −6.8 kcal/mol for dinatin, −7.5 kcal/mol for vitexin, −6.8 kcal/mol for chrysin, and −6.8 kcal/mol for kaempferol) than oseltamivir (−5.8 kcal/mol). They were suggested to block the NA active site effectively [
 <xref rid="B139-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. In computational modeling, strong binding of quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside with M2 transmembrane NA was observed for 2009 pandemic H1N1, N1, and H1 of PR/8/1934 and human RhoA proteins, with docking energies of −10.81, −10.47, −9.52, −9.24, and −8.78 kcal/mol, respectively, which makes quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside a potent anti-influenza candidate [
 <xref rid="B87-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Docking simulation using AutoDock Vina Software indicated a higher binding affinity of quercetin (−5.35 kcal/mol) as well as catechin hydrate (−5.48 kcal/mol) for the M2 protein than amantadine (−4.52 kcal/mol). Thus, the inhibition of autophagy induced by influenza virus infection may explain the antiviral activity of Aloe vera ethanolic extract against H1N1 or H3N2. The antiviral activity of Aloe vera ethanolic extract may go partially to catechin hydrate and quercetin [
 <xref rid="B125-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Another molecular docking study revealed higher binding activities towards influenza polymerase and surface glycoproteins for flavonol glycosides [
 <xref rid="B135-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Molecular docking studies highlighted the blockade of the cap-binding domain of polymerase basic protein subunit, showing higher binding affinity (−8.0 kcal/mal) than GTP (−7.0 kcal/mol) [
