<p>Yang et al., 2014, investigated the in vitro antiviral activity of tea polyphenol compounds against influenza A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/1940 viruses. Tea polyphenols mainly contain catechins, proanthocyanidins, and theaflavins as active compounds, as well as flavonols such as kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin, which are similar to catechins but have more planar chemical structure. The CPE inhibition assay in MDCK cells was used to evaluate the antiviral effect of the compounds in vitro. Quercetin with 42.28 Âµg/mL CC
 <sub>50</sub>, showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of more than 42.28 in both influenza A and B virus treatments. This study did not show a strong anti-influenza effect of quercetin in MDCK cells as infection model compared to the other polyphenols, which may be due to different study designs and starting points [
