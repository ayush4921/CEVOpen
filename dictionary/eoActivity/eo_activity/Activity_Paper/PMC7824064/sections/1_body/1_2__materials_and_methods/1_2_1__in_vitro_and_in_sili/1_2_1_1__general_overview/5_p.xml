<p>Several active components were identified in 
 <italic>Vaccinium oldhamii</italic>, belonging to the blueberry family, which inhibit influenza infection. Three fractions of 30%, 40%, and 50% ethanol were separated, which represented polyphenols identified by HPLC analysis. BY means of LC/MS analysis, procyanidin B2 and ferulic acid derivatives, ferulic acid 
 <italic>O</italic>-hexosides, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside, and quercetin-
 <italic>O</italic>-pentoside-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside compounds were identified. The inhibitory activity against influenza virus (A/Yamagata/165/2009/H1N1/pdm09) was calculated by a reduction in the number of plaques created by the virus. All the compounds which showed intense inhibitory activity in the early stage of flu infection were ferulic acid derivatives. However, quercetin glycosides showed weak activity in this study. Although anti-influenza activity of quercetin was reported previously [

 <xref rid="B86-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], it was suggested in this study that this activity was due to the suppression of influenza replication inside the cells and not due to the inhibition of virus infection to the host cells [
