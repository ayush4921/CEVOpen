 <italic>Measurement of Erythrocyte Carbonic Anhydrase Activity in the Prolonged Diuretic Activity</italic>. Rats were separated into four groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) and treated with AS-AT (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg) and acetazolamide (10 mg/kg). Briefly, after 7 days, blood samples were collected, and red blood cells (RBCs) were isolated. 1 mL of RBCs was added to 3 mL of distilled water and 3 ml of chloroform. This mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 8000 g to obtain supernatant which was diluted in distilled water at the ratio of 1 : 10 (v/v), forming a hemolysate at a dilution of 1/40 (v/v). Two samples of hemolysate (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were incubated with 1 ml of alpha-naphthyl acetate containing 2% dioxane. One sample was incubated at 37°C with 1 ml acetazolamide for 20 min whereas, in the 2nd sample, acetazolamide was added at the end of incubation followed by the addition of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 5-chloro-o-toluidine to both samples. The reaction mixture was kept for 15 minutes followed by measurement of absorbance at 555 nm in triplicate [
