 <italic>Effect of A. tenuifolius Extract/Fractions on Electrolyte Excretion</italic>. Effects of treatment with HCTZ (10 mg/kg), AT-Cr (100–300 mg/kg), AS-AT (100–300 mg/kg), BS-AT (100–300 mg/kg), and DS-AT (100–300 mg/kg) on the excretion of sodium and potassium are presented in Tables 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. AT-Cr, at 200 and 300 mg/kg, caused a significant increase in the urinary sodium and potassium excretion whereas BS-AT and DS-AT only enhance the urinary sodium excretion at its maximum dose (300 mg/kg), with a very slight effect on potassium excretion. In contrast, AS-AT at 200 mg/kg caused a significant increase in sodium excretion with a very low effect on potassium excretion, while, at 300 mg/kg, it caused a highly significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) increase in both sodium and potassium urinary excretion. In fact, sodium and potassium excretion induced by AS-AT was 221 ± 18 and 66 ± 11, while in the control group, it was 113.6 ± 13 and 40 ± 1.2 mL/100 g/6 h. Moreover, AS-AT-induced electrolyte excretion was not different than HCTZ-induced electrolyte excretion. These findings present notable parallelism in sodium and urine excretion. Finally, the pH values in all the groups were not different than the control group. Based upon the highly significant increase in urine output and electrolyte excretion, AS-AT (300 mg/kg) was selected for prolonged treatment and for evaluating the mechanism underlying its diuretic activity.
