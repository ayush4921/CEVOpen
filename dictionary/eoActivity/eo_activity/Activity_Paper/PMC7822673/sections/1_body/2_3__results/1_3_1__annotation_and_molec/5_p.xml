<p>The molecular network of the constituents from 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> exhibited four major node spectral families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The connections (edges) of nodes were represented by lines with thickness relative to cosine score, and the color green in nodes is relative to ion intensities from the AS-AT sample. We can observe a node cluster family of glycosylated flavonoids, but only four flavonoids were observed in AS-AT. In addition, a node cluster was observed from alkaloids.
