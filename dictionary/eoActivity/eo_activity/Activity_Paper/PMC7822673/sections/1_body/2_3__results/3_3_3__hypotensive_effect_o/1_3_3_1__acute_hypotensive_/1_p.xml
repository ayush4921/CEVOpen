<p>After 30 minutes of stabilization, the average SBP of rats was recorded as 134.68 ± 2.23 mm, and no significant change was observed in blood pressure after the administration of normal saline (vehicle). The administration of crude extract and fractions of 
 <italic>A. tenuifolius</italic> resulted in a significant and rapid reduction of SBP, DBP, and MBP (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), but no significant difference in heart rate was observed before and after extract/fractions administration. The intravenous administration of AT-Cr (1, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent decline in SBP which lasted for 48.12 ± 3.65, 58.14 ± 2.94, and 70.01 ± 2.14 mm Hg (30, 40, and 50 mg/kg, respectively). Similarly, graded doses of BS-AT (1, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mg/kg) and DS-AT (1, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg/kg) also produced a dose-dependent decline in SBP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.33), which lasted for 66.21 ± 4.19 mm Hg decreases in SBP at 50 mg/kg of BS-AT, and 55.39 ± 1.74 mm Hg decreases in SBP at 80 mg/kg of for DS-AT. In contrast, intravenous administration of AS-AT (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mg/kg) caused a highly significant decline in SBP, DBP, and MBP, which lasted for the maximum decrease in SBP for 79.61 ± 2.58 mm Hg at the dose of 25 mg/kg. Based on the most potent hypotensive action with AS-AT at 25 mg/kg dose, it was selected and further used for investigating the mechanism underlying its hypotensive effect.
