<p>This test was carried out using serial broth dilution technique [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It indicates the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits growth of a certain microorganism after 18 to 24 hours of incubation. The MIC tests were carried out for crude extracts that showed antibacterial activities based on the agar disc-diffusion test. Two-fold serial dilutions of 50 mg/mL of each crude extract were prepared to get concentrations ranging from 50 mg/mL to 0.195 mg/mL. The serially diluted extracts were added to 5 mL of liquid M-H media in test tubes. Then, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of bacterial cultures were added to the tubes and incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. MIC results were studied through visual inspection and minimum concentration of the extracts that have shown no detectable growths were recorded as MIC.
