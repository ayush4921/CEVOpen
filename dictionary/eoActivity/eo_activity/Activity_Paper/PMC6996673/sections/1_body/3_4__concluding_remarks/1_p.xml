<p>Many ethnobotanic, ethnomedicinal, and ethnoveterinary studies have reported that 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> is used in the treatment of many human and animal ailments e.g. [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The gross phytochemical study of the extracts of fruit, leaf, and stem of the plant yielded results that strengthen the findings of previous studies e.g. [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This study has also shown that aqueous and ethanol extracts of fruit, leaf, and stem of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> have varying degrees of antimicrobial activities against four bacterial strains as reported by other researchers e.g. [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Although studies on the bioactivity of the plant often consider ripe fruits, our study established that leaf and stem extracts are also good sources of bioactive ingredients. Therefore, this study not only established the preliminary antimicrobial profile but also found out that leaves and stems are sources of antimicrobial agents. Our study lays the ground for further detailed studies to elucidate the chemistry of the bioactive constituents of the plant and their modes action as well as to ascertain their efficacy on multiple bacterial strains. The conservation and sustainable use of the plant is thus timely.
