<p>Ethanol, methanol, and water are the most common polar extraction solvents for plant parts of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> yielding antibacterial and antifungal phytochemicals [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Antimicrobial activities of ethanol and aqueous crude extracts of fruit, leaf, and stem of 
 <italic>S. incanum</italic> were tested against standard strains of two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria. The crude extracts resulted in a varying degree of growth inhibition against the tested bacterial strains—ranging from no to outstanding growth inhibition. The aqueous stem extract showed no growth inhibition at all, whereas ethanol extracts of fruit, leaf, and stem yielded notable growth inhibition against the tested bacterial strain. Aqueous and ethanol leaf extracts were found to be more effective. For example, ethanol leaf extract resulted in growth inhibition of greater than 16.0 mm in diameter for 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (
