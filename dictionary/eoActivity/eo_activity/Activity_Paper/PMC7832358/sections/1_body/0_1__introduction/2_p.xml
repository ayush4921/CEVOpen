<p>Coumarin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f001">Figure 1</xref>) is found in nature in a wide variety of plants, particularly in high concentration in the tonka bean (
 <italic>Dipteryx odorata</italic>). It can also be found in sweet woodruff (
 <italic>Galium odoratum</italic>), vanilla grass (
 <italic>Anthoxanthum odoratum</italic>), and sweet grass (
 <italic>Hierochloe odorata</italic>), among others. This explains the great interest in the extraction and characterization techniques of natural coumarins, and in the synthesis of their derivatives. In addition, the simplicity of its chemical backbone is very attractive, as well as the reactivity of the benzene and pyrone rings. Conjugated double bonds are responsible for an electronic environment that plays a very important role in this family of compounds.
