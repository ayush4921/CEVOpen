<p>Analogues of 3-phenylcoumarins were also published during 2020. The discovery and optimization of 3-thiophenylcoumarins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f007">Figure 7</xref>, general structure 
 <bold>XXXVII</bold>) as novel and promising agents against Parkinson’s disease have been described [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This study explores, for the first time, the potential of these structures as in vitro and in vivo agents against this disease. The inhibitory activities of 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-A and 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-B, antioxidant profile, neurotoxicity in neurons of the motor cortex, and neuroprotection against hydrogen peroxide production were studied. The in vivo effect on locomotor activity was also evaluated by an open field test (OFT) for the most potent, selective and reversible 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-B inhibitor of the series: 3-(4′-bromothiophen-2′-yl)-7-hydroxycoumarin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 140 nM). In reserpinized mice pre-treated with levodopa and benserazide, this molecule exhibited a slightly better in vivo profile than selegiline, currently a therapeutic option for Parkinson’s disease. The results suggested that the 7-position substitution of the coumarin scaffold is interesting for enzyme inhibition. Furthermore, the presence of a catechol at positions 7 and 8 exponentially increases the antioxidant potential and the neuroprotective properties.
