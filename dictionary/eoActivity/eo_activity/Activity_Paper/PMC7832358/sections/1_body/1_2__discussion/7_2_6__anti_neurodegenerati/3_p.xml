<p>The 7-amidocoumarins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00501-f007">Figure 7</xref>, general structure 
 <bold>XXXV</bold>) have recently been published for their potential against monoamine oxidase A (
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-A), 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-B, 
 <italic>h</italic>BACE1, 
 <italic>h</italic>AChE, and butyrylcholinesterase (
 <italic>h</italic>BuChE) [
 <xref rid="B51-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The research project is based on a screening of compounds with potential activity against Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, since these multifactorial pathologies share some of their pharmacological targets. Five derivatives of the studied series were described as potent and selective 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-B inhibitors in the nanomolar range; six turned out to be 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-A inhibitors in the low micromolar range; one showed inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>h</italic>BACE1, and another one 
 <italic>h</italic>AChE inhibitory activity, both in the micromolar range. In addition to the enzymatic inhibition, all of the studied molecules proved to be non-cytotoxic to neurons in the motor cortex. As a main conclusion, results suggest that by modulating the substitution pattern at position 7 of the scaffold, selective or multitarget molecules can be achieved.
