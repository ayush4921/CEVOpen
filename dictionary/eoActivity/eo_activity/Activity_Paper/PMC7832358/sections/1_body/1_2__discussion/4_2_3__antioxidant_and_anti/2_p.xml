<p>Regarding the anti-inflammatory activity, it is worth mentioning a review on the coumarins of natural origin (simple coumarins, prenylcoumarins, furocoumarins, coumestans, and benzocoumarins) with a detailed anti-inflammatory activity due to the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2 factor) that protects cells against stress oxidative [
