<p>The affinity of the coumarin system for adenosine receptors has also been published recently. The 3-arylcoumarins (

 <sub>3</sub> receptors, showing a high affinity (in the low nanomolar range) and selectivity for this subtype [

 <sub>3</sub> antagonists in the low micromolar range [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. These works are aligned with the already known potential of these derivatives as modulators of the different adenosine receptors, published in the last decade.
