<p>The 3-arylcoumarins are a family of compounds with proven activity on different targets related to neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, the two most prevalent. In the last decade, several manuscripts described very promising activities of this scaffold, both as selective and multitarget compounds. SAR studies were performed, and important conclusions were drawn based on the substitution patterns in the main scaffold. Due to the large number of molecules based on this scaffold currently synthetized and studied as 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO inhibitors, in 2020 a theoretical work was published comparing different QSAR models and docking calculations, in order to predict the 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-B activity of the 3-arylcoumarins [

 <italic>h</italic>MAO-A and 
 <italic>h</italic>MAO-B, and the most promising models were validated. Selective activities were found in the low nanomolar range against this isoenzyme for 6 and 8 methyl-substituted 3-arylcoumarins, also presenting methoxy groups or bromine atoms in different positions of the 3-phenyl ring (
