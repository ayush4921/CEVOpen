<p>The activity of coumarin derivatives on α-glucosidase was also reviewed in 2020 [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-26-00501" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], in a study in which the influence of the substitution pattern was evaluated, and an important SAR was established. In addition to α-glucosidase, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) is another target for the treatment of diabetes and obesity, and 3-amidocoumarins have been described as inhibitors of this enzyme, with compound 
 <bold>XXII</bold> (

 <sub>50</sub> = 3.87 mM) [

 <bold>XXIII</bold> (
