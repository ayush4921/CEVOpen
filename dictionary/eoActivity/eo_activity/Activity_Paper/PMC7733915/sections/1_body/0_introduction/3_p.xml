<p>Several studies have strongly linked etiology of BPH to an imbalance in steroid hormone metabolism, remodeling in ageing prostate, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress associated with metabolic syndrome, among other factors [

 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The existing treatment options for BPH include medical therapy with α-blockers or 5α-reductase inhibitors, surgery and phytotherapy [

While α-blocker relaxes smooth muscles of the prostate and the bladder neck to relieve urinary obstruction caused by an enlarged prostate, 5α-reductase inhibitors prevent the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), thereby leading to the shrinkage of prostate. DHT is an active metabolic product from the reduction of testosterone by 5α-reductase. It plays a critical role in the growth of prostate by binding to the nuclear androgen receptor, thereby inducing synthesis of growth factors that act on prostatic epithelia and stroma, resulting in prostate enlargement [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Consequently, inhibitors of 5α-reductase that block the production of DHT ultimately slow down the development of BPH. Common inhibitors of 5α-reductase are pharmacological agents such as dutasteride and finasteride. However, there is strong evidence that some phytochemical agents are also effective inhibitors of 5α-reductase [
