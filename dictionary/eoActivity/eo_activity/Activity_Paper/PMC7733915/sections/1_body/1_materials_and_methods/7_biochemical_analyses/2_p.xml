<p>The level of PSA in the rat sera was determined following the Elabscience enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kit procedure. The prostate protein content of the rats was estimated by the method of Tiez [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substance expressed in terms of malondialdehyde (MDA) according to the method described by Wallin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The serum antioxidant activities: superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) were assayed by the methods of Arthur and Boyne [
