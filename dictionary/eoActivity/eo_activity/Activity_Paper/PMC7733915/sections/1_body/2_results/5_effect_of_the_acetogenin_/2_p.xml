<p>The effect of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> acetogenin fraction on malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were estimated as indices for oxidative stress status of the rats. Subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate significantly increased the lipid peroxidation marker (MDA) of the group that received the hormone alone and as well decreased their antioxidant activities compared to the normal control group. Administration of the acetogenin fraction (200â€…mg/kg) reversed the impact of the exogenous hormone as the MDA concentration significantly reduced (
