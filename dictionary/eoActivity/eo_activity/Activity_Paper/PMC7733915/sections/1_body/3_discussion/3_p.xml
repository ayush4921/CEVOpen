<p>In this study, BPH induction by subcutaneous administration of testosterone propionate (3 mg/kg) to the rats for 28 days was successful as evidenced in the rise of serum PSA level and prostate weights of rats that received the hormone alone. PSA is a glycoprotein that is predominately formed in the prostate gland and a reliable marker for BPH [

 <italic>A. muricata</italic> (200 mg/kg body weight) is a pointer to the ameliorative effect of the plant material on the induced BPH. Decrease of PSA level is associated with a reduction of prostatic hyperplasia as a direct consequence of 5α-reductase inhibition [

Also, persisted high level of PSA (final PSA) in the group that received the hormone alone without any treatment is an indication that the observed drop in PSA level of the treated rats was not due to self-recovery. Comparing the level of decrease in the final PSA after the 7 days treatment suggests that AFAL (200 mg/kg body weight) exhibited a similar ameliorative effect as dutasteride on the induced BPH, possibly through 5α-reductase inhibitory activity among other mechanisms.
