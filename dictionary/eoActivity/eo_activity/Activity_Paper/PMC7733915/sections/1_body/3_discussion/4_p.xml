<p>Furthermore, prostate enlargement is also an important marker for BPH [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The enlargement is due to the increase in both epithelial and stromal cell number (hyperplasia), resulting in an increase of prostate weight. Thus, the significant reduction of prostate weight of the BPH rat to near normal after treatment with the acetogenin-rich fraction (200â€…mg/kg) is also suggestive of a remedial effect of the plant material on the induced BPH. The results of the relative prostate weights are equally in agreement with the above observation; the relative prostate weight of rats that received hormone alone increased significantly in comparison with normal control, but treatment with the acetogenin fraction reduced the relative prostate weight to a near-normal weight.
