<p id="para0056">Furthermore, the evidence from published literature demonstrates that some SLns belonging to guaianolides like eremanthin (
 <bold>4</bold>) and germacranolides such as costunolide (
 <bold>5</bold>) and guaianolide dimers byrsonines A and B (
 <bold>14, 15</bold>), show multifunctional benefits due to their action on many MetSÂ´s risk factors. These observations suggest that structural specificity may be a key for understanding the mechanisms of action of SLns. Looking forward, the effects of SLns on MetS should be explained based on the molecular targets and should be related to biochemical mechanisms. MetS has become a major public health problem worldwide and represents a common clinical condition in countries with a high incidence of obesity and western dietary patterns. Natural products, such as SLns, are attractive drug candidates and more attention must be paid to their potential use in the treatment and prevention of MetS.
