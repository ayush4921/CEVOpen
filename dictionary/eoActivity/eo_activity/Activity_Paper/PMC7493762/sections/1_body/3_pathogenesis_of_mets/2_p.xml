<p id="para0008">The mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of MetS have not been completely explored, but obesity-induced adipocyte dysfunction and inflammation is associated with the progression of insulin resistance and metabolic disorders (
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Klöting and Blüher, 2014</xref>). Body fat mass accumulation in obesity depends on different factors including the relationship of energy intake to energy expenditure and body energy storage (
 <xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Hernandez et al., 2016</xref>). Adipose tissue (AT) plays an important role as an energy storage organ, as well as an endocrine organ produces adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which circulate and regulate systemic metabolism and inflammation. The cell type composition of AT includes adipocytes, fibroblasts, macrophages, stromal cells, monocytes and preadipocytes (
 <xref rid="bib0101" ref-type="bibr">Ràfols, 2014</xref>). On further AT expansion, hypertrophy of adipocytes and increased secretion of macrophage chemoattractants occurs, including the secretion of MCP-1, which recruits additional macrophages. These actions in turn result in local inflammatory state, enhanced basal lipolysis, increasing the leakage of free fatty acids (FFA) and a dysregulated secretion of several pro-inflammatory adipokines (
