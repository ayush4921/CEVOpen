<p id="para0005">Metabolic syndrome (MetS) refers to a cluster of risk factors related to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Alberti et al., 2009</xref>). This pathological condition represents a public health concern in most nations due to its association with mortality caused by the cardiovascular and metabolic complications (
 <xref rid="bib0064" ref-type="bibr">Ju et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, MetS is recognized as a risk factor that influences progression and prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019, the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">Francini-Pesenti et al., 2019</xref>). Many compounds, such as sesquiterpene lactones (SLns), have been isolated from medicinal plants and their hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties coupled with their capacity to modulate key cellular functions have been confirmed by

 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Alonso et al., 2018</xref>). Despite these effects are linked to the pathogenesis of MetS, the role of these compounds to avoid its progression is not well documented compared to many other compounds such as polyphenols into which a great deal of research has been conducted. Therefore, in order to provide relevant information regarding the potential benefits of SLns in preventing and managing MetS, this review addresses plant-derived SLns that are potentially responsible for the positive effect in improving risk factors associated with MetS.
