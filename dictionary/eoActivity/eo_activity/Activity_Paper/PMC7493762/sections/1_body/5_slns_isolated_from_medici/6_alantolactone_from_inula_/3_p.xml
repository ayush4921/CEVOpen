<p id="para0032">Alantolactone (
 <bold>6</bold>) (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) is the most known eudesmanolide present in several 
 <italic>Inula</italic> species, including 
 <italic>Inula helenium</italic> L. used for hypoglycemic and antiobesity purposes (
 <xref rid="bib0109" ref-type="bibr">Seca et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0129" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This compound has been extensively studied for its antitumor, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (
 <xref rid="bib0089" ref-type="bibr">Moujir et al., 2020</xref>). Regarding anti-inflammatory activity, the eudesmanolide 
 <bold>6</bold> suppresses NO, PGE
 <sub>2</sub> and TNF-α production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells by modulating the activity of the NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways (
 <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">Chun et al., 2012</xref>), and it also suppresses TNF-α and interferon gamma (IFN-γ)-induced production of chemokines by blocking the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation in HaCaT cells (
