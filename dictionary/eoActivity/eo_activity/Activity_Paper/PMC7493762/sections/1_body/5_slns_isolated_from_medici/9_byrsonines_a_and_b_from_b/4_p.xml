 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> makes them one of the most active guaianolides on different components of MetS reported at this time. As described above, another molecule of this family with activity on different components of MetS is eremathin. However, byrsonines A and B (
 <bold>14, 15</bold>) seems to be more effective, which could be due to their dimeric structure that provides two possible Michaels acceptors. Dimeric SLns have been found to be more potently cytotoxic than their monomers toward human cancer cells, indicating that the antitumor potential of SLns are improved by the presence of additional α-methylene-γ-lactone ring (

 <bold>14</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> for MetS treatment due to their extended activity reviewed here. Moreover, pharmacokinetics studies are needed to understand either byrsonines suffer biotransformation reactions and act as monomeric molecules or if they can show biological activity in their original dimeric forms. No
