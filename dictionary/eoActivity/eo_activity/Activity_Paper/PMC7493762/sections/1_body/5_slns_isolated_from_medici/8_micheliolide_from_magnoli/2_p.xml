<p id="para0040">The genus 
 <italic>Magnolia</italic>, previously known as 
 <italic>Michellia</italic>, reported to exert various biological effects, including anti-cancer, anti-anxiety, antidepressant, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory (
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). In later years, 
 <italic>Magnolia</italic> species and their components have been related to ameliorate characters of obesity and diabetes, such as hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and other complications (
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Since terpenoids are one of the principal substantial compounds in 
 <italic>Magnolia</italic> species, SLns may be related with its medicinal properties (
 <xref rid="bib0122" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Anticancer activity investigation lead to the isolation of the guaianolide micheliolide (

 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) from 
 <italic>M. compressa</italic> (Maxim.) Sarg. (
 <xref rid="bib0091" ref-type="bibr">Ogura et al., 1978</xref>). This compound has also been obtained in a semi-synthetic way from a BF
 <sub>3</sub>-mediated rearrangement of parthenolide (

 <xref rid="bib0138" ref-type="bibr">Zhai et al., 2012</xref>), presenting enhanced stability and remarkable anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing activation of the NF-κB through inhibition of IκBα degradation as well as for the inhibition of p65 translocation to the nucleus (
 <xref rid="bib0127" ref-type="bibr">Viennois et al., 2014</xref>). The compound also influenced the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways in LPS-stimulated BV-2 cells (
 <xref rid="bib0123" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Further, an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay has revealed that 
 <bold>13</bold> attenuate the high glucose-stimulated activation of NF-κB, the degradation of IκBα, and the expression of MCP-1 in rat mesangial cells (
