<p id="para0022">The common sunflower, 
 <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> Linn (Asteraceae), is a well-known plant with edible seeds, flower petals and tender leaf petioles. This plant was proposed to offer a variety of medical benefits (
 <xref rid="bib0078" ref-type="bibr">Lim, 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). To provide a scientific explanation for its use in Nigerian traditional medicine, 
 <xref rid="bib0092" ref-type="bibr">Onoja and Anaga (2014)</xref> reported a hypoglycemic effect on the fasting blood glucose level in alloxan-induced diabetic rats after a single dose of the methanolic extract of 
 <italic>H. annuus</italic> leaves. This study led to the recent isolation of the heliangolide 20-dehydroeucannabinolide (
 <bold>3</bold>) (

 <xref rid="bib0093" ref-type="bibr">Onoja et al., 2020</xref>). Heliangolide SLns represent an isomeric form of germacranolides with a cyclodecadiene skeleton and double bonds at C1=C10 and C4=C5, which stereochemical configurations are 
 <italic>trans, cis</italic> respectively (
 <xref rid="bib0121" ref-type="bibr">Sülsen and Martino, 2018</xref>). The heliangolide 
 <bold>3</bold> reduced the fasting blood glucose level at dose of 0.2 mmol/kg in alloxan-induced diabetic rats (
 <xref rid="bib0093" ref-type="bibr">Onoja et al., 2020</xref>). The authors suggested that this sesquiterpene lactone might have reducing effects in glucose absorption based on the heliangolide derivative structure, which presents an intact 
 <italic>exo</italic>-methylene-γ-lactone group. As mentioned above, α,β-unsaturated γ-lactone ring system has an important relation in the inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase activity, thus the heliangolide 
 <bold>3</bold> may be inhibiting this enzyme similar to enhydrin 
 <bold>(1</bold>).
