 <italic>Inula</italic> (Asteraceae) is one of the most popular herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine. This genus comprises more than one hundred species widely distributed throughout Asia, Africa, and Europe, and many of these have been used to treat a wide range of diseases such as bronchitis, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and inflammation (

 <italic>Dittrichia viscosa</italic> (L.) Greuter.], 
 <italic>Inula racemosa</italic> Hook.f.
 <italic>, Inula helenium</italic> L., etc., have been documented for their potential effects on some components of MetS, especially hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant activities (
