<p>To the best of our knowledge, this study offers for the first time a prelude about the unexplored culturable soil actinomycetes diversity associated with the typical alpine habitats on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and their bioactive capabilities. However, more in-depth investigations on extraction, purification of the bioactive compounds produced by the actinomycetes, as well as the cold adaption mechanism of actinomycetes in alpine habitats will strengthen the development and utilization of those actinomycete isolates.</p>
