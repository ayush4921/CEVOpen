<p>It is notable that the 16S rDNA sequence as the sole marker for phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis is limited. In fact, it has been reported that 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates with 97% 16S rDNA sequence identities can vary by as much as 30% in core genome divergence with average nucleotide identities ranging from 100–78.3% (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Chevrette et al., 2019</xref>). However, the 16S rDNA sequence is widely used as an indispensable gene marker in the bacterial taxonomic analysis (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Martina et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, the 128 isolates were assigned to 
 <italic>Streptomyce</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> spp. and one potential new genus based on the 16S rDNA sequences. Moreover, the 97% 16S rDNA sequence identity threshold has been extensively used as a boundary for bacterial species delineation (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Meier-Kolthoff et al., 2013</xref>), however, this threshold value has been raised to 99% for actinomycetes (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Stach et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015</xref>) based on comparative studies between 16S rDNA sequence identities, average nucleotide identity (ANI) values of whole genomes and DNA–DNA hybridization (DDH) (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we empolyed a threshold of 99–100% to assign 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates to different clusters. Surely, based on this metric, the isolates identified as potential novel isolates according to the 16S rDNA sequences deserved to be furtherly confirmed by polyphasic taxonomic approach (
