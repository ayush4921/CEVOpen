<p>In this study, almost all of the 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates from the alpine habitats produced catalase, which was consistent with the catalase-positive of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. described in Bergeyâ€™s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Ruan, 2013</xref>). Colony pigment or diffusible pigment produced by bacteria is a physiological strategy of adaption to low temperature and of resistant to environmental stress (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). For example, microorganisms in diverse cold habitats would increase carotenoid production to keep membrane stabilization at lower temperature and secrete dark pigment to absorb UV light (

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Marine actinomycetes producing diffusible pigments were able to survive longer than those with no diffusible pigment production (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Ramesh and Mathivanan, 2009</xref>). In our study, forty 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates obtained from the two alpine habitats produced diffusible pigments, which may be of significance for the isolates adapting to the alpine habitats on the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, as saprophytic inhabitants, soil actinomycetes thrive on decomposing organic materials such as lignin, chitin, cellulose, sulfocompounds etc., which is enabled by means of producing diverse extracellular hydrolytic enzymes (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Bhatnagar and Kim, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Suela Silva et al., 2013</xref>). The result of biochemical assays for the obtained actinomycetes showed that lipase 2, urease, protease, amylase and H
 <sub>2</sub>S producing strains accounted for 82.1, 70.5, 62.8, 52.6, and 48.7% of the total isolates from the Laohu Ditch, while 72, 62, 66, 46, and 60% of the total isolates from the Gaize County area, respectively. This demonstrated that most of the 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates possessed the capability of hydrolyzing activity on polyesters, urea, gelatin, amylum and sulfur-containing amino acids, reflecting that those isolates may associate with the cyclings of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur on the Tibetan Plateau (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Barka et al., 2016</xref>). However, variances in proportion of H
 <sub>2</sub>S, diffusible pigment, organic acid and enzymes producing isolates in each plant community at increasing altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau were detected, implying the differences in soil ingredient of diverse plant root habitats closely relate to distinct plant litter and/or root exudates (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bais et al., 2006</xref>). For example, the enrichment of H
 <sub>2</sub>S, diffusible pigment, organic acid and enzymes producing isolates in near-root soils of two medicinal plants, 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. and 
 <italic>R. quadrifida</italic> Fisch. &amp; C.A. Mey, was observed. Studies have shown that medicinal plant roots are rich in bioactive compounds that could affect the physiological activities of their root-associated actinomycetes (
