<p>Near-root soils were sampled from fifteen dominant plants distributing along the altitude gradients in the Laohu Ditch and five distinct dominant plants in the Gaize County area in July. The samples were aseptically processed according to the previous described (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2007a,b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Mingma et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, five soil cores, which were 4.5 cm in diameter and 10 cm deep, were collected radially up to ∼10 cm from the base of the plant with ∼20 cm distances, mixed to form one composite soil sample. All the samples were immediately placed in sterilized ice coolers and transported to the laboratory within 24 h.
