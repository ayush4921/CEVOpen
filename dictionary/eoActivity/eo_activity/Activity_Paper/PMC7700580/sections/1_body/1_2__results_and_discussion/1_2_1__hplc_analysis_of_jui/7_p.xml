<p>(−)-Catechin and (−)-epicatechin are two flavonoid stereoisomers which present a high antioxidant activity in living systems [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> and 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> have a higher amount than other juices. Animal studies have shown that the consumption of flavonoids from 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> is inversely proportional to the hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, a beneficial effect of the doses analysed without adverse reactions [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The antidiabetic properties exhibited by 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> have been linked to a number of compounds, including oleanolic acid, monodesmoside, charantin, momordin 1c [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In other studies about 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic>, the flavonoids rutin, miricetin and quercetin have been identified. The methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> peel has pharmacological properties, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic and antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Gallic acids was found to also be a major compound in 
 <italic>B. hispida</italic> which is linked with its ability to reduce Type II diabetes [
 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Phenolic compounds have been reported to exhibit antidiabetic activity [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; therefore, we consider that the antioxidant compounds present in the extracts may also play a major role in mediating the antidiabetic effects of 
 <italic>T. cucumerina.</italic>
