<p>The vast majority of species in the Cucurbitaceae family contain a large number of triterpenes and significant amounts of polyphenols and flavonoids. Upon reviewing the literature data, we did not find studies about all the species analyzed in this paper. All the juices from our studied species contain significant amounts of triterpenes and flavonoids, except 
 <italic>B. hispida,</italic> in which a lack kampferol and kampferol-3-glucosides has been observed. The richest chemical composition was found in the juice of 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> and 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic>.
