<p>The 
 <italic>C. metuliferus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. hispida</italic> fruit juices showed the highest iron binding ability (77.26 ± 0.39% and 48.93 ± 0.42%, respectively), whereas 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> showed a low iron binding ability (7.45 ± 0.28%). When combinations of fruit juices assortments were tested, the results revealed that all mixed samples had very good iron binding capacity. The 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> and 
 <italic>B. hispida</italic> mixed samples exhibited an iron binding ability of 86.95 ± 0.97%, comparable with the one of 0.1 mg/mL Na
 <sub>2</sub>EDTA positive control (88.02 ± 0.43%).
