<p>The ferrous ion was monitored by measuring the formation of a red ferrous ion-ferrozine complex at 562 nm as previously described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], adapted to the 96-well plate analysis. If the formed ferrous ion-ferrozine complex is stronger, the absorbance at 562 nm is higher, and if the ferrous iron binding strength of the chelator is weaker, the absorbance is smaller. An amount of 225 µL test sample was mixed with 10 µL ferrous sulphate (2 mM), then were stored at room temperature for 5 min at room temperature and 15 µL ferrozine (0.2 mM) was added to start the reaction. A blank was prepared by using distilled water instead of ferrozine. The resulting mixture was mixed and left to stand for 10 min at room temperature and then the absorbance was measured at 562 nm. EDTA was used as standard. Distilled water was used as control. All the experiments were done in triplicate.
