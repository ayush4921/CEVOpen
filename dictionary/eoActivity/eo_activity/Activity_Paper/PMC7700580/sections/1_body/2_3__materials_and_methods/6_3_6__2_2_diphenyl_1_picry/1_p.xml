<p>Antioxidant activity has been reported in various manners, such as the percentage of utilized reagent and the percentage of oxidation inhibition. Antioxidant compounds can be water-soluble, insoluble, or bound to the cell walls. As such, the efficiency of extraction is an important factor in quantifying a plant’s antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05468" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The antioxidative effects of the tested samples were estimated by DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2-Picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assay. The DPPH-free radical has a maximum absorption at 517 nm, which gives it a purple color. The color shifts from purple to yellow, resulting in a reduced form of DPPH. In a 96-well plate, 100 µL of test sample was mixed and homogenized with 100 µL of a 100 µg/mL DPPH methanolic solution. In this assay, two by two, mixed juices samples were subjected to this determination in equal volumes. Fresh methanolic DPPH solution served as the control [

The absorbance values at 517 nm were recorded after 15, 30 and 60 min. An amount of 100 µL methanol mixed with 100 µL of test samples were used as blank. The radical scavenging activities of three standards were assed using this protocol. Gallic acid, (−)-epicatechin and ascorbic acid were dissolved and diluted into different concentrations in methanol, and then they were used as references. All the experiments were done in triplicate.
