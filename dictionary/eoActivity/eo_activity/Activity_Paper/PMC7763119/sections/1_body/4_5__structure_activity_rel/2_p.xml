<p>The exceptionally high anticancer activity of PEGylated quinoline derivatives is suggestive of the fact that the enhanced efficacy of molecules maybe because of the high mobility of the end terminal of the tethered PEG molecules, and due to the presence of inter-repulsive forces exerted between the hydrated PEG chains. There is a strong possibility of single PEG molecule conjugation with the approaching protein.</p>
