<p>The toxicity increased with the increase in the concentration of the test solution containing new compounds, suggesting a maximum tolerated dose. Some compounds did not meet the conventional bacteriostatic standards at lower concentration levels. The variance in the efficiency of compounds in contradiction ofdiverse organisms depends on either the impenetrability of the cell microorganisms or dispersion in the ribosomes of microbial cells. The results obtained after screening the synthesized compounds against various microorganisms are shown in Table 4.</p>
