<p>The monoacid derivative of hydroxycarboxy PEG (HO-PEG200COOH) (28.0mmol) was activated with a 1:2molar equivalent of 6-amino-2-chloroquinolin-3-carbonitrile (2a) (46.0mmol) and N, N dicyclocarbidiimide (46.0mmol) dissolved in dichloromethane. The solution was stirred for 24 h at room temperature. A syrupy resin was obtained and dried under a vacuum. The syrupy resin was dissolved in 15Â mL of acetone. A white precipitate of dicyclohexylurea (DCU) appeared and was discarded, and the filtrate was collected. The final filtrate was evaporated to afford the product. TLC (methanol:ethyl acetate, 7:3) was performed to check the existence ofDCU, which exposed a negative outcome that was confirmed by the infrared spectroscopy (IR) spectra. A negative dye test indicated complete amino group capping.</p>
