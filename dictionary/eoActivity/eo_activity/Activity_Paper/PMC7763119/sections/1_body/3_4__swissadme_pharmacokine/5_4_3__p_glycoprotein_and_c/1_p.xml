<p>SwissADME, furthermore, permits the valuation for a compound to be a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) or inhibitor of the cytochrome p450 isoenzymes (CYP isoenzymes). P-gp is largely spread and linked in the intestinal epithelium where it drives xenobiotics [37]. The generations return Yes or No if the particle under assessment has a higher probability to be a substrate or nonsubstrate of P-gp or inhibitor or noninhibitor of a given CYP. The screening results were classified in Table 8.</p>
