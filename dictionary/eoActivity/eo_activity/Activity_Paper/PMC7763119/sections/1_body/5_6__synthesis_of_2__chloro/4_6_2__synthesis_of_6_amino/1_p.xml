<p>A suspension of 6-amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehyde (1 mol) in 30% aq. ammonia was stirred for 15–25 min at room temperature, to this CAN was added at 0–2 °C, andthe reaction mixture was stirred for 2–3 h at 0–2 °C (after completion of the reaction monitored by TLC, the disappearance of the reddish-brown color of the reaction mixture in 30–40 min was observed), extracted with chloroform-ethyl acetate (7:3), dried over Na2SO4,and evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the solid product of 6-amino-2-chloroquinoline-3-carbonitrile (3a). The solid product was crystallized with ethanol. m.p. 162 °C. Yield: 83%.Color: brown.</p>
