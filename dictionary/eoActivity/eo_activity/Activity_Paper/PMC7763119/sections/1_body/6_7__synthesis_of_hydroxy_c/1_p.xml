<p>Polyethylene glycol (5 mL, 0.028 mol, 200 g/mol) was dissolved in 20 mL of dry CH 
 <sub>2</sub> Cl 
 <sub>2</sub> . To this solution was added THF containing maleic anhydride (0.056 mol, 0.54 mg) and pyridine (0.056 mol, 0.46 mL). After stirring overnight at room temperature, the reaction was completed, as indicated by TLC (methanol:ethyl acetate, 7:3) (no anhydride was left and there was the detection of a single polar PEG compound). The monoacid derivative of (polyethylene glycol)200 was used without purification.
