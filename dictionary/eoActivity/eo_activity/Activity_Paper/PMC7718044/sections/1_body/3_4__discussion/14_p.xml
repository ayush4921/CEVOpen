<p>While the revealed results in the current study showed that the activities of PON1 and ARE enzymes were increased significantly in the C + TL and D + TL groups compared with the C and D groups, respectively. It is important that the PON and ARE activities increased in the C + TL and D + TL groups because this suggests that this plant has a strong antioxidant effect in increasing the synthesis of enzymes in both groups. As previously documented, the decrease in ARE activity in the diabetic condition may be due to oxidative modification of the nucleic material and/or transcription factors or due to the glycation process [
