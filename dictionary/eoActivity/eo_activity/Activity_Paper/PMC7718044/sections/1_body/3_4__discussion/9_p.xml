<p>The current study has shown a significant increase in MDA levels in blood plasma and tissues (heart, muscle, liver, and kidney) in the D group in comparison with the C group. There was a significant decrease in plasma and tissue MDA levels in the C + TL group (only muscle and liver tissues) and a decrease in the MDA levels in the heart, kidney, liver, muscle, and plasma in the diabetic group given 
 <italic>T. leucocladum</italic> (D + TL) extract compared with the C and D groups. On the other hand, the decrease in MDA levels of the blood plasma, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney tissues was not observed only in the diabetic group but also in the control group. This is an important point in terms of the protective effect of 
 <italic>T. leucocladum</italic> in healthy individuals.
