<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effects of 
 <italic>T</italic>. 
 <italic>leucocladum</italic> plant antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, and antioxidant potential in STZ-induced diabetic rats. For that, the current experimental work aims to measure the erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) and whole blood glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels and serum paraoxonase (PON) and arylesterase (ARE) activities. In addition, it aims to determine the plasma and tissue (
 <italic>Musculus gastrocnemius</italic>, heart, liver, and kidney) malondialdehyde (MDA) levels to investigate the oxidative status of the rats and also aims to assess the blood lipid profile, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels.
