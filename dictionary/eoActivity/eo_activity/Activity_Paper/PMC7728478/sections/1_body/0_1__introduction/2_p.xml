There is an increased interest for Apiaceae, especially in food science, because members of this family such as fennel, celery, dill, carrot, and caraway are commonly used. Apart from the biologically active essential oils found in this family, they contain coumarins, polyacetylenes, flavonoids, sesquiterpenes, and phthalides [
