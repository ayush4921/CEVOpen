<p>A total of 52 compounds obtained by hydrodistillation and solvent-free microwave extraction methods are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Thirty-five compounds representing 96.52% of the total essential oil present were obtained in the hydrodistillation method. More specifically, the dominant compounds present in the hydrodistilled oil were D-limonene (11.27%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-ocimene (9.09%), D-germacrene (8.92%), 
 <italic>β</italic>-myrcene (8.49%), and humulene (5.55%). The SFME method, on the other hand, gave 30 compounds which accounted for 71.15% of the total oil, while 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene (10.38%), 
 <italic>γ</italic>-elemene (6.18%), and D-germacrene (5.09%) were the major components. Thirteen (13) of the total components were common to oils extracted by both methods.
