<p>The chemical compositions of the essential oil of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves obtained by the solvent-free microwave extraction method have been compared with those which were obtained by the hydrodistillation method. Our study indicates that the essential oil yield obtained by the SFME method was slightly higher with shorter extraction time (0.35% for 30 min) when compared with that by the hydrodistillation method (0.295% for 180 min). The lower yield obtained by the hydrodistillation method may be attributed to increasing extraction time [

 <sub>2</sub> emission by about 16 times. Similar observations were made in previous studies [
