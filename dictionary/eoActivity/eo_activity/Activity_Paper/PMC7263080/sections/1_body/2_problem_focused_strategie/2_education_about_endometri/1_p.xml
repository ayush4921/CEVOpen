<p>Having a coherent understanding of endometriosis is an important step in being able to effectively self-manage this condition, as is the case with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease (

While awareness of endometriosis is building amongst the general population thanks to efforts by advocacy organizations and academics working in the field, endometriosis remains an enigmatic disease. Many patients learn of the word ‘endometriosis’ at the time of consultation with their healthcare provider as a possible explanation for their symptoms. Patients may be given a diagnosis following clinical assessment (

 </xref>) or surgery (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004
 </xref>). Depending on how they receive a diagnosis and by whom they are diagnosed, the information they receive may be inconsistent and ambiguous. Endometriosis education in schools has recently been introduced in some countries to raise awareness early and standardize messaging (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>), but this has not been successfully attempted with adults. The tangible nature of endometriosis means that education is often focused on what can be seen (i.e. endometriosis deposits, endometriomas) rather than on the invisible downstream effects like chronic pelvic pain and central sensitization.
