<p>It is too early to make formal recommendations on dietary changes that will improve the lives of those living with endometriosis. Nevertheless, simple advice like ensuring adequate fiber and fluid intake to avoid constipation and avoiding known triggers of bladder symptoms (personal to the individual but may include alcohol, acidic fruits, etc.) may be useful. The potential positive impact of dietary improvements extends far beyond endometriosis. Therefore, patients may consider experimenting as the risk of adverse events is low and there may be a potential benefit, especially during COVID-19 where spending more time eating at home may allow more opportunities to modify dietary intake. New practices that one may initiate during COVID-19 self-isolation to combat endometriosis-pain could lead to longer-lasting positive health effects.</p>
