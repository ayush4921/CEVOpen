<p>Another study by Umar 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic effect of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> leaf extracts 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Firstly, a separate experiment was performed on normal healthy male rats to investigate the toxicity of both aqueous and methanol extracts of the leaves at different concentrations. No mortality or behavioral changes were observed in the extracts-treated animals, suggesting the safety of both aqueous and methanol extracts.
