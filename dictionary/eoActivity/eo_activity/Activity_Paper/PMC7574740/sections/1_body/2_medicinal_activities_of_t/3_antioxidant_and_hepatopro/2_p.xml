<p>Animals were divided into three groups each of 10 rats. In one group, no pretreatment was performed (control group). In the second group, a single intraperitoneal injection of the hepatotoxin CCl
 <sub>4</sub> was performed (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group). In the last group, rats were pretreated with a once-daily dose of the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> leaves (orally as aqueous suspension) for seven consecutive days. After that, all animals were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and were killed 24 h later. Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured to give an indication about the hepatic function. Moreover, malondialdehyde levels (indicative of lipid peroxidation), protein carbonyl groups (marker of protein oxidation) and the antioxidant enzymes activities were measured in the liver homogenate of the killed animals to assess the damage caused by CCl
 <sub>4</sub> and the protective effects of the ethanol extract on liver tissues.[
