 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] were the first to report the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 reverse transcriptase (RTase) inhibition activity of the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic>. Treatment of HIV-1-infected MT-4 cells with 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> extract has resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of virus production with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range of 2.0–2.5 µg/mL, suggesting a significant anti-HIV activity of the plant extract. An 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> test was further performed using a RTase inhibition assay kit in order to evaluate the potential of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> extract to inhibit viral RTase as a possible underlying mechanism of its anti-HIV effect. The extract inhibited HIV-1 RTase in a concentration-dependent manner, with an estimated IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.7 µg/mL.
