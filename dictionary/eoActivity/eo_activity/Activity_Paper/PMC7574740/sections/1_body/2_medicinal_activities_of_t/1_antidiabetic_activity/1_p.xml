 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] were the first to investigate the antidiabetic potential of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> and tried to isolate the phytoconstituents responsible for its antihyperglycemic properties. A series of fractionations and purifications of the methanol extract of a branch of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> using various chromatographic techniques led eventually to the isolation of five isoflavones with previously known structures. The isolated flavonoids include genistein, 3′5′-diprenylgenistein 6, 8-diphenylgenistein, derrone, and alpinumisoflavone.[
