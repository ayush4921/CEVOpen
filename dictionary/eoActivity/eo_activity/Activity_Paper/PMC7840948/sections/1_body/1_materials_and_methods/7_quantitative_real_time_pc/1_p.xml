 </sup>. RNA from different treatment samples were extracted by TRIzol reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) and cDNA were synthesized using HiScript II 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). qRT-PCR was performed using a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA) and AceQ qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was used as internal reference and the primers were designed by Beacon Designer8. The primer sequences are shown in Table
