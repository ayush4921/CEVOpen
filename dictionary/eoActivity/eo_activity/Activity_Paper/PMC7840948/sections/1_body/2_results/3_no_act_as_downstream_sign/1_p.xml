<p id="Par18">Different exogenous addition treatment can help to verify the relationship of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO in the progress of promoting PQs yield. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, the biomass and sugar content (linear regression equation for the y = 2.6733x + 0.2083, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9938) of all different treatment groups were not significantly different from that of the control group, indicating that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, NO and their scavengers had no significant effects on mycelial growth and energy consumption. Meanwhile, both H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO significantly increased the yield of PQs (1.38-fold and 2.56-fold), while their scavengers significantly decreased the yield of PQs. On the basis of CAT and cPTIO, the yield of PQs could be restored to a level where there was no significant difference compared with the control group by adding H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and SNP, respectively. In the treatment of cPTIO + H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, cPTIO could significantly inhibit the increase of PQs induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, while in treatment of CAT + SNP, CAT could not significantly inhibit the increase of PQs content induced by SNP. These results suggest that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO are closely related in the progress of increasing PQs yield, and NO may act as the downstream signal molecule of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>.
