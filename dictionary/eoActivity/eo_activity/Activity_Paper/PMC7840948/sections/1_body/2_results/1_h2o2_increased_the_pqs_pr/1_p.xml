<p id="Par16">In order to study the effect of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on accumulation of PQs in 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> and select the appropriate concentration, different concentrations of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and CAT were added respectively to liquid culture. When 0.01 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was added, the content of PQs (the linear regression equation for the y = 0.0092x + 0.1271, R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9934) and intracellular H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> reached the maximum. When the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentration reached 0.05 mM, the content of PQs and intracellular H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> were significantly decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The promotion of PQs accumulation by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> can be inhibited by its specific scavenger CAT. Under the action of 250 U/L CAT, the accumulation of PQs content was significantly inhibited. The results showed that under the condition of 28 °C for 80 h, low H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentration can promote PQs yield whereas high H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> concentration decreases PQs yield. Therefore, the concentrations of 0.01 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 250 U/L CAT were selected for the follow-up experiments.
