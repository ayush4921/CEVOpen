<p>In this study, we have evaluated the pharmacological effects of a water-based herbal decoction, Divya-Peedantak-Kwath (DPK), in treating CIPN. DPK contains relevant parts of 28 different medicinal plants in optimized amounts. Paclitaxel (PTX)-induced mouse peripheral neuropathic model has been employed. PTX doses used to induce neuropathy were comparable to those used in humans for chemotherapy (

Therefore, in addition to evaluating the anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic properties and its capability to modulate nociception in neuropathic models through behavioral tests, antioxidant profiling of DPK-treated nerve tissues was also undertaken. Since oxidative stress is linked to axonal degeneration, histological analysis and scoring of the nerve tissue have been performed to evaluate the effect of DPK treatment in attenuating the degenerative features associated with PTX-induced neuropathy (

In addition, the anti-inflammatory profile of DPK was evaluated using human differentiated macrophage cell lines for the measurement of pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Taken together, we report that DPK is not only a potent anti-allodynic and an anti-hyperalgesic agent but also a very efficient antioxidant that can effectively attenuate the neuroinflammation associated with PTX-induced neuropathy through cytokine modulation.
