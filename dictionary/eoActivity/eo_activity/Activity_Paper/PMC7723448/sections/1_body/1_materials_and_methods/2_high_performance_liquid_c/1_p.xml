<p>Chemical composition of DPK was analyzed through high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Waters Corporation, United States); instrument equipped with a binary pump (1525), PDAD (2998) and an autosampler (2707). Separation was achieved using a Shodex C18-4E (5 μm, 4.6 * 250 mm) column through binary gradient elution. The two solvents, designated as A and B, were used for the analysis. Both A and B had 0.1% orthophosphoric acid. But in case of B, it was in a mixture of acetonitrile and water in 88:12 ratios, while it was in water for A. pH of both solvents was set to 2.5 with diethylamine. The gradient program for the solvent system used was 95–85% A for 0–10 min, 85% A for 10–15 min, 85–80% A for 15–20 min, 80–70% A for 20–30 min, 70–40% A for 30–40 min, 40–10% A for 40–45 min, 10–95% A for 45–46 min, and 95% A for 46–50 min, with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min 1.0 g of the sample was suspended in 20 ml methanol: water (10:90) mixture sonicated for 30 min, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, and filtered through a 0.45-µm nylon filter before loading on to the column. Then, 10 µl of the test solution was used for analysis. The column temperature was maintained at 35°C. Wavelengths were set to 270 nm (for gallic acid, vanillic acid, corilagin, rutin, and ellagic acid) and 325 nm (for neochlorogenic acid and cryptochlorogenic acid). Standard compounds were purchased from Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd, Sigma Aldrich, Bangalore, and ChemFaces, China, and were dissolved in methanol at recommended concentrations.</p>
