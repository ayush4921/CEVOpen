<p>The Von Frey test (Electronic Von Frey, UgoBasile, VA, Italy; model: 38,450-001) was used to assess responses to mechanical stimuli (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">Zanjani et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Donvito et al., 2016</xref>). All the animals were habituated in transparent Perspex cubicles with elevated wire mesh bottom for 45 min for 3 consecutive days before starting the experiment. On the day of assessment, each mouse was acclimatized for 10 min before the test. The Von Frey filament (0.5 mm diameter) was applied to the plantar surface of the right hind paw of each mouse, with slowly increasing pressure. Responses like lifting, licking, or shaking of the paw was recorded as the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT; g) at different days. A PWT limit of 10 g was set to avoid tissue damage. Total three readouts with a gap of 3 min in between were recorded in a blinded manner, by a researcher unaware of the treatment conditions.
