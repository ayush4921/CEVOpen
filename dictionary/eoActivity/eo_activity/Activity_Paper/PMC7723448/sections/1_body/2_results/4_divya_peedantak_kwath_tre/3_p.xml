<p>The effect of DPK treatment in ameliorating mechano-allodynia due to PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy was evaluated by using the Von Frey test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). The average paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) for all the groups was around 7.72 ± 0.08 g before PTX treatment. PWT reduced to average 3.49 ± 0.03 g by day 7 in the treatment groups once the PTX dosing was initiated. For this DC group, this was even lower at 2.99 ± 0.15 g. These were significant reductions across the experimental groups when compared to the PWT of the NC group that continued to be around 8.43 ± 0.15 g till day 12, showing a marginal increase by day 17 (8.64 ± 0.09 g). PWT increased in the GABA group to 5.49 ± 0.12 g by day 12 and 7.25 ± 0.04 g by day 17. The increase in PWT in the DPK-615 group also followed a trend similar to that of the GABA group (5.21 ± 0.26 g by day 12 and 7.53 ± 0.16 g by day 17). The PWT increase in DPK-205 was similar to that of GABA and DPK-615 groups till day 12 (5.12 ± 0.26 g), beyond which it fell behind to 6.24 ± 0.13 g by day 17. A discernible increase in PWT in the DPK-69 group was observed only by day 17 (5.08 ± 0.14 by day 17 vs. 3.47 ± 0.05 g of day 7). However, PWTs of all these groups were significantly more than those of the DC group, in which the threshold kept decreasing, albeit, marginally.
