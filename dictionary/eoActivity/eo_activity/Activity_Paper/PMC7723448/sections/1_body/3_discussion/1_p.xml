<p>A thorough understanding of the disease pathophysiology is mandatory in order to identify a better treatment for CIPN. Agents benefitting diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain are often ineffective against CIPN, implicating different disease mechanisms in case of these two peripheral neuropathies (

However, out of pregabalin and gabapentin, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the first-line treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain, gabapentin has been found to be effective against PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy in a recent randomized clinical trial (

Peripheral edema, weight gain, nausea, vertigo, asthenia, dry mouth, and ataxia are some other side effects. Nevertheless, there are reports on these side effects resolving with time or dose reduction (
