<p>DPK is a combination of several herbs conferring it the ability to target multiple pathways. The constituent herbs of DPK are enriched with phytometabolites with demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective activities. Therefore, it is capable of employing a coordinated strike approach against CIPN pathology, by ameliorating the critical causative factors. Moreover, some of the constituent herbs have anticancer property, thereby offering an added advantage against cancer. Taken together, our observations establish DPK as a potent treatment option for CIPN and warrants for further controlled clinical studies.</p>
