  <p>DPK has anti-inflammatory effects with acceptable cytosafety. Anti-inflammatory activity of DPK was evaluated through its effect on the elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, IL-1β 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and TNF-α 
   <bold>(C),</bold> in case of LPS (500 ng/ml)-induced inflammation in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. Absence of cytotoxicity and suitability of the established system for evaluating anti-inflammatory activity was confirmed through alamarblue assay 
   <bold>(D)</bold>. Differentiated THP-1 cells without any LPS treatment was taken as normal control (NC). LPS-treated cells that did not receive DPK treatment (0) served as disease control for comparing the observed anti-inflammatory effect of DPK. Cytokine levels in this group were compared with NC to confirm the credibility of the 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> inflammation model. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was done using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test and observation represented as 
   <sup>###</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, when significantly different in comparison to NC; **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, when significantly different from DPK-untreated (0) group induced with inflammation.
