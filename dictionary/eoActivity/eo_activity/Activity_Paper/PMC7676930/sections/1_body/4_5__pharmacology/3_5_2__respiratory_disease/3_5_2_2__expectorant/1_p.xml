<p>Expectorant activity is another vital function of FCB. Based on the previous data, the alkaloids extracted from FCB, mainly including imperialine, chuanbeinone, peimine, and peiminine (1.5, 3.0 mg/kg for 0.5 h), have been demonstrated achieve expectorant effects in mice by enhancing tracheal phenol red output [

 <italic>β</italic>-N-oxide (1.5–4.5 mg/kg for 0.5 h) significantly promoted tracheal phenol red output, which indicated that the expectorant effects of FCB may be related to its ability to increase tracheobronchial mucus secretion [
