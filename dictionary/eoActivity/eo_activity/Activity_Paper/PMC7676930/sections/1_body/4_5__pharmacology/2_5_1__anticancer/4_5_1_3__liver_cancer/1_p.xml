<p>An accumulating line of evidence indicates that FCB is a potential antitumor agent. In previous studies, various fractions from FCB, mainly including chloroform extracts, n-hexane extracts, water extracts, petroleum ether extracts, and TFCB, have been demonstrated to exhibit inhibitory activity on the growth of the HepG2 [

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 24 h) conducted the growth suppression effects on HepG2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. It was simultaneously observed that the number of apoptotic cells increased and the percentage of G2/M phases cells augmented. Moreover, the expression of Bax, cleaved poly-ADP-ribosyl-polymerase (PARP), and caspase-3/8/9 increased, whereas the levels of Bcl-2 and Checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) downregulated, which indicates that peiminine triggers apoptosis in HepG2 via both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways [
