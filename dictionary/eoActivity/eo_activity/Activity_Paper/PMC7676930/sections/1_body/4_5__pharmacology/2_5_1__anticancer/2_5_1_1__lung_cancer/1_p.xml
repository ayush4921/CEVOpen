<p>Currently, lung cancer as the most common cancer is attracting increasing attention [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In previous studies, FCB or its active compounds have shown significant inhibitory effects on the development of lung cancer. One in vivo study suggested that the total alkaloids of FCB (TFCB) (10–40 mg/kg/day for10 days) markedly suppressed the growth of transplantable Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) tumor in mice through inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and inducing apoptosis. The molecular mechanism was related to the downregulation of endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31) and caspase-3. Furthermore, the antitumor effects of TFCB were also confirmed by an in vitro study. It was observed that TFCB (30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 0–72 h) exhibited inhibitory effects on the proliferation activities of LLC cells, which may partly result from the apoptosis induction mediated by S-phase cell cycle arrest [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Besides, accumulated evidence pointed out that the aqueous extract of FCB (FC-AE) also has antitumor effects similar to those of TFCB. It was demonstrated that FC-AE (0.2 mL/2.5 mg/mL/2 day for 20 days) performed suppression activities on the growth of transplantable A549 tumors in a nude mice model, which was associated with the enhancement of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT4, interferon gamma (IFN
 <italic>γ</italic>), interleukin- (IL-) 12, caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X apoptosis regulator (Bax) levels, and the decrease of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) production. Moreover, FC-AE (0–100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 48 h) exhibited excellent antiproliferative effects on A549 cells, which was attributable to the accumulation of G2 phase cells and the promotion of Bax, STAT1, and STAT4 activities, as well as the downregulation of Bcl-2 proteins [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition to total extracts, some monomer chemical compositions, such as chuanbeinone and imperialine, also possess huge therapeutic potential on the treatment of lung carcinoma. For example, chuanbeinone (5–15 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 48 h) dramatically reduced the viability of LLC cells, and the positive results were accompanied with an accumulation of cells in the S phase and a decrease of the cells in the G0/G1 phase, which subsequently leads to the augmentation of apoptosis. The underlying mechanism was related to the reduction of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the enhancement of proapoptotic protein Bax and caspase-3. To better understand the role of chuanbeinone on the treatment of lung cancer, an in vivo study suggested that chuanbeinone (10–40 mg/kg/day for 10 days) significantly suppressed the growth of transplantable LLC tumors in mice. The antagonistic effects were attributed to inactivation of CD31-mediated tumor angiogenesis, as well as the promotion of caspase-3-mediated apoptosis [

A recent study showed that imperialine (200 ng/mLfor 24 h) notably inhibited the proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 via downregulating the key regulatory molecules in the nuclear factor-

 <italic>κ</italic>B) pathway, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) Class III, protein kinase B (Akt), p-Akt, nuclear factor-

 <italic>α</italic>), and decreasing the expression of Ki67 (a clinical biomarker for tumor progress evaluation), as well as upregulating the levels of caspase-3. Furthermore, imperialine (10 mg/kg for 18 days) prominently blocked the development of non-small-cell lung cancer in the mice model, which involves the downregulation of the levels of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-
 <italic>α</italic> (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), and the decrease of Ki67 [
