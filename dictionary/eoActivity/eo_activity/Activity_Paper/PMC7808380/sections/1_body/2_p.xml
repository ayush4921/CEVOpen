<p>The total plastome length of 
 <italic>S. scordifolia</italic> (MT712016) was 152,366 bp, which exhibited a typical quadripartite structural organization, consisting of a large single copy (LSC) region of 84,407 bp, two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 25,201 bp and a small single copy (SSC) region of 17,556 bp. The cp genome contained 133 complete genes, including 87 protein-coding genes (87 PCGs), 8 ribosomal RNA genes (8 rRNAs) and 37 transfer RNA genes (37 tRNAs). Most genes occurred in a single copy, while 17 genes occurred in double, including all rRNAs (4.5S, 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA), 7 tRNAs (trnA-UGC, trnI-CAU, trnI-GAU, trnL-CAA, trnN-GUU, trnR-ACC, and trnV-GAC), and 6 PCGs (rps7, ndhB, ycf2, ycf15, rpl2, and rpl23). The GC content of cp DNA was 38.3%. The corresponding values of the LSC, SSC, and IR regions were 36.3%, 32.5%, and 43.6%, respectively.
