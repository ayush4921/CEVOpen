<p>In order to further clarify the phylogenetic position of 
 <italic>S. scordifolia</italic>, plastome of 12 representative 
 <italic>scordifolia</italic> species were obtained from NCBI to reconstruct the plastome phylogeny with 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> as an outgroup. All the sequences were aligned by MAFFT v.7.313 (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses were conducted by RAxML v.8.2.11 (Stamatakis 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) under GTRCAT model with 500 bootstrap replicates. The phylogenetic tree showed that the species of genus 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> were divided into two monophyletic clades. 
 <italic>S. kingiana, S. amoena, S. baicalensis, S. altaica,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. przewalskii</italic> clustered together in one clade, while 
 <italic>S. scordifolia</italic> was identified as the basal subclade of the other clade, indicating that the divergence time of 
 <italic>S. scordifolia</italic> was earlier than that of the other species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).
