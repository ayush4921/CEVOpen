 <italic>Scutellaria scordifolia</italic> Fisch. ex Schrank Li is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant of genus 
 <italic>Scutellaria</italic> from the Labiatae family (Bruno et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). This species mainly distributes in grassland and wet meadow in the provinces of Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shanxi, and Qinghai. The dried root of 
 <italic>S. scordifolia</italic>, as a traditional herb medicine, is used to treat jaundice, liver heat, hepatomegaly, gingival abscess, etc. in China, Japan, and South Korea. It has been reported to have antiviral, antimycotic, antioxidant, nitric-oxide-inducing, and quinone-reductase-inducing activities (Shao et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Li et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Ng et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). However, due to anthropogenic over-exploitation and decreasing distributions, this species is in urgent need of protection. Knowledge of the genetic information of this species will contribute to the protection policy for this species. In this study, we assembled and characterized the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of 
 <italic>S. scordifolia,</italic> hoping to lay a foundation for further research.
