<p>Among the other medicinal plants of the family 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic>, the multipurpose plant 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> has fascinated the researchers more, owing to the traditional therapeutic applications, nutraceutical potential, and pharmaceutical attributes. Folk healers cure various ailments such as cancer, arthritis, diabetes, eyesores, asthma, pyrexia, inflammations, hemorrhoids, ulcers, hepatitis, and wounds. Results of multiple preclinical trials such as antidepressant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, anti-oxidant, antifungal, hepatoprotective, and hypoglycemic in animal models (mice, rats, and rabbits) are encouraging. The plant further requires the attention of phytochemists for the isolation of bioactives responsible for the biological activities so that new formulations are developed.
