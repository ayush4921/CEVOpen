<p>Various extracts (aqueous, alcoholic) of different parts of the plant revealed anti-carcinogenic potential with decrease in the activity of NFκβ which resulted in the suppression of intercellular tumor necrosis in cancerous cell lines. The extract also reduced tumor size and count. Mice were fed the plant before and during exposure to skin cancer inducer, 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene, for evaluation of the chemopreventive effect. A significant decrease in prevalence and count of skin lesions was observed with no change in enzymatic level and lipid profile (
