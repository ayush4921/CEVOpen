<p>Stress has been reported as a principal causative agent for impotence in males. Pre-historic studies showed

In another exploration, the effect of stress on male infertility by pre- and post-stress treatments was studied by administering root powder at a dose of 5 g/day for three months. The extract of medications improved semen quality and anti-oxidant levels in male individuals (
