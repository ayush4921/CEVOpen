 <italic>H. contortus </italic>which was comparable to the Levamisole standard anthelmintic agent, which shows 100% motility in 4 hr at 0.05 mg/ml. In comparison to all extracts, the acetonic extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> exhibits 100% anthelmintic activity in 6 hr which is comparable to standard Levamisole (

 <italic>W. somnifera,</italic> was used to improve the quality of potato chips. Potato chips were treated with 220 ppm solution of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> plant extract for 30 min, which results in the reduction of polyphenol oxidase activities and sugar content up to 40 and 25%, respectively (

Combined administration of cypermethrin and deltamethrin results in a sudden decrease in body weights of Wistar rats and the effect was improved by giving a methanolic suspension of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> (12.5 mg/kg of body weight) in 3% gum acacia solution (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> results revealed that the methanolic extract of plant roots enhanced the multiplication of lymphocytes. The extract also upgraded antibodies in dexamethasone-induced immunocompromised mice (
