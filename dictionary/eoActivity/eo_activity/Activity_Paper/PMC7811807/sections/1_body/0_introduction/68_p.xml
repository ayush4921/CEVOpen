<p>5,6β-epoxy-1-oxo-witha-2-ene-27-ethoxy-olide purified from plant roots was studied for the anti-stress, lactate dehydrogenase, serum creatine phosphokinase, serum corticosterone level, and serum lipid peroxidation (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The standardized root extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> was investigated against chronic stress, hyperglycemia, plasma corticosterone, and male sexual dysfunction in male Wistar rats. The results showed that the root extract (concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/kg) exhibits significant anti-stress and adaptogenic activities in stress-induced immunological perturbations of mice (
