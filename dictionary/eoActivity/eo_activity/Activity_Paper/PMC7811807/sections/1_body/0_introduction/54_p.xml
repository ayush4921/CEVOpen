<p>Another study revealed the protective effect of aqueous extract of the whole plant (500–1000 mg/kg of body weight) in paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity. The extract reversed the effects of hepatotoxicity by lowering the concentration of liver marker enzyme, bilirubin, with improvement in protein contents (

 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> were assessed for anti-oxidant activity using a large unilamellar vesicle model. It was disclosed that withanamides (A-I) isolated from the plant fruits retarded lipid peroxidation significantly at a concentration of 0.5-1 μg/ml. It was also noticed that withanoside V displayed prominent free radical scavenging activity at 10 μg/ml concentration (
