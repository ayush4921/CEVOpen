<p>Aqueous, methanol and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of roots and shoots (5, 10, 15, and 20% weight and volume) were evaluated againstÂ 
 <italic>Phalaris minor</italic> in crops. Results showed that aqueous sprouts and root extracts exhibited significant herbicidal activity against 
 <italic>P. minor</italic> compared with other solvent extracts (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). Methanol, aqueous, and n-hexane extracts of roots and shoots exhibited significant herbicidal activity. It was proven that foliar spray and soil applications of aqueous and methanolic extracts showed a reduction in germination and seedlings of
