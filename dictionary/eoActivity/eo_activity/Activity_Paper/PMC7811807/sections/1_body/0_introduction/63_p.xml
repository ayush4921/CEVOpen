<p>Methanolic extract of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> roots was administered to male Sprague mice at a dose rate of 200–400 µg/ml to access the morphine and ethanol ability to stimulate the ventral tegmental area dopaminergic neurons and transmission of dopamine. Results showed that morphine and ethanol significantly reduce the neural response of the ventral tegmental area and dopamine in nucleus accumbens by GABA
 <sub>A </sub>mechanism. Oral administration of 
 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> extract at 75 mg/kg of body weight helps in the reduction of morphine and ethanol elicited increase in nucleus accumbens of rats (
