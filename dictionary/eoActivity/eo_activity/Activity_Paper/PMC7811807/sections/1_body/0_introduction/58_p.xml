<p>An increase in the production of nitric oxide owing to activation of nitric oxide synthase in mouse macrophages was observed after the administration of methanolic extract of the plant roots (1–256 μg/ml) (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Evaluation of the immunomodulatory effect of purified sitoindoside IX and X from the plant on the central nervous system as anti-stress agents was studied at a dose rate of 100–400 g/mouse. It was concluded that significant activation and mobilization of peritoneal macrophages and phagocytosis enhanced the lysosomal enzymes secreted by the macrophages. It was further confirmed that sitoindosides reduced the deficits in the cerebral function of the geriatric population (

 <italic>In vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> immunomodulatory effect of plant root powder was evaluated and the potent inhibitory effect on mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation with delayed hypersensitivity in mice was explored (

Immunomodulatory effects of alcoholic extract of the plant roots were assessed in cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or prednisolone myelosuppression models in mice. The extract enhanced the number of blood cells, bone marrow cellularity, and α-esterase positive cell number count (
