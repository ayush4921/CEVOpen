 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> along with other plants such as 
 <italic>Clerodendrum inerme,</italic>
 <italic>Gliricidia sepia</italic>, 
 <italic>Cassia tora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Eupatorium odoratum </italic>were extracted with ethanol to evaluate insecticidal potential against 
 <italic>Sitophilus oryzae. </italic>It was observed that the mortality rate of insects was increased on increasing concentration (2.5 and 5%) of ethanolic extract during the 45 day study (

 <italic>W. somnifera</italic> plant was extracted with petroleum ether to assess larvicidal action against 
 <italic>C. quinquefasciatus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. stephensi, </italic>and 
 <italic>A. aegypti. </italic>It was discovered that the extract killed the larvae with an LC
 <sub>50</sub> value of less than 100 ppm (
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>). Aqueous extract of roots and shoots was investigated for the herbicidal potential against 
 <italic>Rumex dentatus</italic>. The application of extract reduced the length of roots and shoots significantly. The excerpt also decreased the biomass of seedlings of 
 <italic>R. dentatus</italic> (
