<p>Osteoarthritis is the most frequent form of arthritis [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This degenerative disease is characterized by damage to the articular cartilage of the knee, hip, and others lower extremity joints. The estimated risk for knee OA is approximately 47% in women and 40% in men, and its prevalence is projected to increase because of the ageing of the population and the growing occurrence of obesity [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A number of factors, such as genetic factors, the environment, and autoimmunity, play roles in RA pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. All these factors induce the activation of the immune system, which cause autoantigen presentation with antigen-specific T and B cells activation and aberrant inflammatory cytokines production, thus leading to synovitis and cartilage and subchondral bone destruction. Extra-articular organs, such as the skin and the cardiovascular system, can also be involved [
