 <italic>O. americanum</italic> EO significantly inhibited leukocyte migration to the articular cavity in the knee joint of zymosan-induced arthritic Balb/c mice. Moreover, at 150 mg/kg the EO was able to reduce paw edema in mice, suggesting a suppression of the release of inflammatory mediators such as PGE2 and COX-2.
