<p>Agarwal and coworkers reported the in vivo anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic activities of the EO from 
 <italic>Strobilanthus ixiocephala</italic> Benth. flowering tops [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This small straggling shrub is present in India and belongs to the Acanthaceae family [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The plant species was collected in Nashik, India, and the EO was mainly constituted by the sesquiterpene alcohols ixiocephol and Τ-cadinol, the monoterpenoid alcohols isoborneol and α-fenchol, and the sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene. Beside the dose-related anti-inflammatory potential demonstrated in both acute and chronic models of inflammation, carragenan-induced rat paw edema, and cotton pellet granuloma, 
 <italic>S. ixiocephala</italic> EO was effective in Freund’s adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. At the oral dose of 1 mL/Kg, it inhibited the rat paw edema by 35.56% after 21 days of treatment. The EO was able to suppress the increased lymphocyte count in arthritic rats and the migration of leucocytes into the inflamed area [
