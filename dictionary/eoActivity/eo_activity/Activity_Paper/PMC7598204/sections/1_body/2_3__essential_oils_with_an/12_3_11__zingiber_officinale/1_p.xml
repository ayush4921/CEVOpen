Initially, the studies concerning the antiarthritic effects of this plant species focused on its main phenolic secondary metabolites, gingerols. A potent antiarthritic effect has been demonstrated for gingerol-containing extracts using the streptococcal cell wall (SCW)-induced arthritis model [

The tested sample consisted of a lipophilic sesquiterpene-containing gingerol-free fraction of a dichloromethane extract of ginger rhizome.
