<p>Biradar and coworkers investigated the in vivo antiarthritic potential of the EOs from two 
 <italic>Cyperus</italic> species (Cyperaceae) from India, 
 <italic>C. esculenthus</italic> L. and 
 <italic>C. rotondus</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Samples were tested using the formaldehyde-induced arthritis model in Wistar albino rats. EOs were administered at the dose of 500 mg/Kg, and after 10 days of treatment they were able to inhibit paw edema by 75.54% (
 <italic>C. rotondus</italic>) and 76.58% (
 <italic>C. esculenthus</italic>).
