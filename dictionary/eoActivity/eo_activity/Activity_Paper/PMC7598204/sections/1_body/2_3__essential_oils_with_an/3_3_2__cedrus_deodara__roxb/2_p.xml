<p>Shinde and coworkers investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of 
 <italic>C. deodara</italic> wood EO in adjuvant arthritic male albino rats [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The oil (50 and 100 mg/kg) was administered orally 5 days prior to injection of FCA, and it was administered until day 30. 
 <italic>C. deodara</italic> wood EO inhibited the acute phase of adjuvant-induced response (first 7 days following the injection of FCA). Moreover, the EO showed analgesic activity against acetic-acid-induced writhing and hot plate reaction in mice.
