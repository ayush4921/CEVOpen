<p>EOs and their chemical components could also be useful in the treatment of arthritis-related pain. Various monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other essential oil constituents have been investigated for their potential antinociceptive activity and have demonstrated interesting analgesic-like activity [
 <xref rid="B90-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] and different species demonstrated antinociceptive activity in animal models of nociception [
 <xref rid="B91-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>M. spicata</italic> L. EO and its main constituents, such as menthol, carvone, and limonene, demonstrated analgesic effects in animal models, while spearmint oil was able to reduce pain in osteoarthritis patients [

 <xref rid="B96-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. It was demonstrated that a single administration of citral (at concentrations of 100 and 300 mg/kg) reversed FCA-induced mechanical allodynia in arthritic rats [
