The selected of active compounds obtained from the screening of compounds by LC-MS were docked with the targeted enzyme that involved in the mechanism of T2DM. From the results, root extracts displayed a better promising outcome in &#x003b1;-glucosidase (IC<sub>50</sub> 2.72&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.32) as compared with the fruit extracts (IC<sub>50</sub> 3.87&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.32). Besides, root extracts also displayed a better activity in the inhibition of DPP (IV), enhance insulin secretion and glucose uptake activity. Molecular docking results revealing that phlorizin binds strongly with &#x003b1;-glucosidase, DPP (IV) and Insulin receptor (IR) enzymes with achieving the lowest binding energy value. The present work suggests several of the compounds have the potential that contribute towards inhibiting &#x003b1;-glucosidase and DPP (IV) and thus effective in lowering post-prandial hyperglycaemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>&#x003b1;-glucosidase</kwd><kwd>DPP (IV)</kwd><kwd><italic>Curculigo latifolia</italic></kwd><kwd>molecular docking</kwd><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="9"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="9567"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001" disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic carbohydrate metabolism disorder that has an abnormal homeostasis of glucose leading to a high blood glucose levels.Globally, diabetes mellitus (DM) is recognised as one of the major disease in the world with the highest crisis diseases in the 21st century<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>. According to the International Diabetes Federation in the 9<sup>th</sup> edition, it has been revealed that approximately 425 million adults between ages 20&#x02013;79&#x02009;years were diagnosed with diabetes worldwide in 2019. However, if this does not recover or reduced, this figure is expected to rise around 700 million by 2045 and based on records, almost 49.7% was undiagnosed and living without knowing they had this disease<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>. Globally, based on the records, 374 million of people is at risk due to the developing in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hence these evolution is increasing awareness of people about T2DM<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus or shortly known as T2DM is a type of diabetes disease that has features of insulin resistance from the decrease in the peripheral glucose uptake in most of the targeted tissue. This is happen due to the insensitivity of insulin from the insulin resistance that may reduce the production of insulin and finally leading to excessive blood glucose level or known as hyperglycaemia<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>. Recently, the pathogenies of T2DM is intertwined with various type of mechanism such as increasing insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, increased response towards incretin hormones, decrease reabsorption of glucose through carbohydrate digestion and increased in peripheral glucose uptake<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>. One of the most potent approaches in the management of T2DM is by Dipeptidyl peptidase (IV) inhibition, where the inhibitor of these enzymes will prevent the degradation of the incretin hormone, which in turn increase the insulin secretion and lowering blood glucose level<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref>. Apart from this, the excessive amount of carbohydrates present in the diet can be considered as one of the major causes of diabetes. The delaying absorption of sugar in the bloodstream that may exert in low blood sugar level which through an inhibitory potential of &#x003b1;-glucosidase, known as the main enzyme in the carbohydrate mechanism. The inhibition of these enzymes is able to delay the absorption of monosaccharides from dietary complex carbohydrates, preventing any sudden rise in meal-induced blood glucose level, and therefore are involved in controlling the glucose level in the blood<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref>. This is well correlated with the interesting finding that reveals that the &#x003b1;-glucosidase enzyme inhibitor is capable of slowing carbohydrate digestion, resulting in less efficient glucose absorption and thus decreasing postprandial hyperglycaemia<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>.</p><p>Treatment in T2DM is mostly by consuming the oral antidiabetic drugs that act through the different mechanisms in controlling the increased blood glucose level along with changes in diet and healthy lifestyles. Clinically, there is various type of oral hyperglycaemic drugs, which has been used in controlling this disease and are classified into different classes such as biguanides, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones (TZD), meglitinides, Dipeptidyl peptidase (IV) inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT2), and &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>. Each of the classes is targeting a different type of organ and are carried out in the various mode of action. In fact, usually, combinations of different antidiabetic drugs are used to increase the efficacy of the treatment<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref>. However, despite its benefits, these drugs also have their own long-term effects that can give out adverse effects caused by chronic administration, including cardiovascular disease, lactate acidosis, hypoglycaemia, gastrointestinal complaints and others<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref>. To date, molecular docking studies have been used recently in predicting the potential inhibitor that has been compared with marketed anti-diabetic drugs as which by seeking these natural compounds as new anti-diabetic agents with little or no adverse effects for the long term effect. Molecular docking is an important computational method for predicting possible drug-protein interactions with the selected ligand that represent bioactive compound containing in the medicinal plants<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>.</p><p>Nowadays, a new approach is introduced by applying plant extracts, which may contain high therapeutic values as an alternative way of mimicking the function of antidiabetic drugs and also have been reported to contain anti-diabetic properties<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref>. Likewise, <italic>Curculigo latifolia</italic> Dryand. ex W.T.Aiton, <italic>or</italic> locally known as lemba is a rhizome geophyte that is categorised under family Hypoxidaceae. From the previous study, <italic>C. latifolia</italic> has been revealed has the ability to exhibit antidiabetic properties through cell lines and in diabetic induced rats<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>. The root extract of <italic>C. latifolia</italic> has shown to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism in experimental diabetic rats and the presence of curculigoside may have bestowed its anti-diabetic efficacy<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref>. Nonetheless, there were no previous studies have yet been revealed on the inhibition of DPP (IV), &#x003b1;-glucosidase assays, and molecular docking and this present research could be regarded as an additional confirmation of antidiabetic properties for this crop. The <italic>C latifolia</italic> root extracts were previously screened for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant activity and screening of active compounds through LCMS analysis<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>.

The protocol was followed based on the 2-NBDG uptake cell-based assay kit (Item No: 600470) Cayman Chemical (Michigan, USA). Glucose uptake activity of test drugs is determined in L6 and 3T3-L1 cells on 96-well clear bottom black fluorescence plates (Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). In brief, the 24&#x02009;h cell cultures with 70&#x02013;80% confluency are allowed to differentiate by maintaining in DMEM with 2% FBS for 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;days. The extent of differentiation is established by observing the multinucleation of cells. The differentiated cells are serum-starved overnight and at the time of the experiment, cells are washed with HEPES buffered Krebs Ringer Phosphate solution (KRP buffer) once and incubated with KRP buffer with 0.1% BSA for 30&#x02009;min at 37&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

Meanwhile, berberine and dimethylcaffeic acid formed H-bond with Gln553, Ser630 residues with a hydrophobic bond (Tyr547). Furthermore, monobenzone was forming a H-bond (Ser630) and a &#x003c0;-staking (Tyr547) while scandenin was reported with no H-bond formed but was supported with a hydrophobic bond (Trp629) along with Tyr547 residues for &#x003c0;-staking interaction.

Many earlier studies have revealed the role of plant extracts as a natural inhibitor that has a less adverse effect and is capable of reducing hyperglycaemia particularly in the inhibitory activity of the &#x003b1;-glucosidase enzyme<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref>. From the results, the inhibitory activity on both of the extracts shows explicated a remarkable inhibition on the &#x003b1;-glucosidase enzyme by revealing the percentage inhibition by root extracts is closer with the percentage of inhibition by marketed anti-diabetic drugs, acarbose. Previously, the findings of the current study are in a good agreement with other research works indicate that SWE extracts are capable of influencing &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitory capacity<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref>.</p><p>Besides, the presence of several phytochemicals such as flavonoids, phenolic with a greater number of hydroxyl groups that present in the compounds would have a significant inhibitory effect that boasts a greater inhibitory effect towards the &#x003b1;-glucosidase enzyme<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref>. Significantly, the results on the inhibitory activity increased in conjunction with the increased of the concentration of the extract<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref>. Previously, it has been reported that some studies shows a positive relationship between total polyphenol content and its ability to inhibit &#x003b1;-glucosidase<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>. Besides, the results given by using subcritical water extraction has a remarkable activity in inhibition of &#x003b1;-glucosidase. By applying hot extraction technique, the inhibition of &#x003b1;-glucosidase on <italic>Meriandra bengalensis</italic> has revealed that the inhibitory activity from water extracts achieved high inhibitory activity as compared with other organic solvents<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref>. This can be related with the principal of water under subcritical state, where the polarity of water decrease as increasing the water temperature. This will causes the decrease of dielectric constant of water originally at ambient temperature is &#x003b5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;80 significantly reduced to (&#x003b5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;27 at 250&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), which was pretty closed to the permittivity of ethanol (&#x003b5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) or methanol (&#x003b5;&#x02009;=&#x02009;33)<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>. Hence, these factors reducing the results of the gap produced between the solvent and SWE extraction methods. Therefore, the findings revealed that the extracts of <italic>C. latifolia</italic> from SWE extraction have potential in inhibiting &#x003b1;-glucosidase activity, which works as one of the natural inhibitors for &#x003b1;-glucosidase that associated with T2DM.</p><p>With insulin resistance being central in type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, a new alternative in the inhibition of DPP (IV) has proposed in order to stimulate the release of insulin. From the inhibitory activities of the extracts with DPP (IV), the results revealed that both of the extracts displayed a good inhibitory potential by having an increment in the percent of inhibition for the DPP (IV) enzyme.</p><p>Besides, it can be noticed that <italic>C. latifolia</italic> root extract acted as a better inhibitor as compared with the fruit extracts. This is possibly due to the inhibition from the bioactive compound, containing mixtures of several phenolics and flavonoids that contained in the root extracts that may acts as an inhibitor for the inhibition of the DPP (IV) enzyme<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref>. In addition, some bioactive compounds containing in crude extracts can exert their properties in DPP (IV) inhibition because previous studies reported that subclasses in phenolic, flavonoid, terpenoids, and peptides were the most predominant compound as DPP (IV) inhibitors<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref>. Whereby, the inhibition activity by the fruit extracts is probably due to the berberis compound that was present in the extract, where the activity of berberis is quite similar to DPP (IV) inhibitor, benzoquinolizines and it was demonstrated berberine significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose (FBG), lowered blood glucose level through increasing insulin receptor expression in T2DM<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref>. The viability of the cell was assessed through MTT assay and the results were employed in determining the IC<sub>20</sub> and IC<sub>50</sub> of the cell growth. Fruit extracts proposed a lower toxicity effect at IC<sub>50</sub> for 3T3&#x02013;L1, L6, and BRIN-BD11 cell lines as compared with the root extract. Moreover, less toxicity of the sample was probably by applying the optimum condition of SWE that leads to high polarity and reduced toxicity. The sample&#x02019;s concentration lower than 1&#x02009;mg/ml was considered as a safe concentration to pursue <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> assay activities in the glucose uptake and insulin secretion assays.</p><p>Medicinal plants enhance the glucose uptake by GLUT4 translocation and were proven by the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> glucose model. The L6 and 3T3-L1 cell lines are the best-characterized cellular model origin to study glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. The selection of cell line was based on the involved in the mechanism of action in the uptake of glucose where adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are now well established as a primary target site in glucose metabolism as well as regulation in whole-body glucose homeostasis and main targets for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake to control hyperglycaemia<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref>. Skeletal muscle cell acts as a major primary site that was responsible for postprandial glucose uptake. In the skeletal muscle, insulin increases glucose uptake by increasing functional glucose transport molecules in the plasma membrane<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref>. Furthermore, it is the most abundant tissue in the whole body and thus, the proper function of skeletal tissue is important to maintain normal blood glucose levels. In fact, L6 cells represent a good model for glucose uptake because they have been used extensively to elucidate the mechanisms of glucose uptake in muscle, have an intact insulin signalling pathway and express the insulin-sensitive GLUT4<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref>. Based on our findings showed that root extract displays a better activity with the increased stimulation of the 2- NBDG uptake in both of the cell lines as compared with fruit extract. We can observe that the 2- NBDG uptake increased as the dose concentration of the sample increase. This is in agreement with previous studies, which have addressed the increment of 2- NBDG uptake in 3T3-L1 and L6 cell lines along with the increase in the sample treatments<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref>. The presence of polyphenols including berberine, flavonoid glycoside (phlorizin), isoflavonoid (mundulone and scandenin) and cinnamic acid derivative (dimethyl caffeic acid) that containing in the extracts, contribute in promoting glucose absorption that can arise from their synergistic or complementary interactions with multiple targets in order to exercise their pharmacological behaviour. Firstly, berberine is shown to mediate its action by encouraging translocation of GLUT4 and increased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in L6 myotubes and mediating anti-diabetic properties<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref>. Besides, cinnamic acid derivatives precisely activate proteins phosphoinositide 3-kinase (P13K) pathway and exert its anti-diabetic effect by substantially enhance the uptake of glucose<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>. The finding from previous studies suggests that the introduction of a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring of cinnamic acid at the meta- and/or para-position increases the ability to stimulate glucose uptake in the cells<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref>.</p><p>Apparently, the active compounds regulated in the extracts also contribute to promoting the effects by improving the secretion of insulin. Relatively, the observation made on the <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> effect of the extracts on insulin secretion seen in BRIN-BD11 cell line, clearly establishes that root extracts appear to display a better activity in the secretion of insulin as compared with fruit extracts. The presence of phytochemicals in the extracts that facilitate the insulin release on pancreatic cell substantiates our observed effectiveness. With the presence of cinnamic acid derivatives, this active compounds capable in inducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell and this indicates that the stimulating insulin secretion process by cinnamic acid is due to an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> flow through the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels without causing membrane depolarisation by closing the KATP channels<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref>. The consequent depolarisation leading to the opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup> intracellular elevation mediating insulin secretory vesicle exocytosis<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref>. These findings were in well correlate with other studies that reporting the enhancement in promoting insulin release that being stimulated with the presence of cinnamic acid<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref>.</p><p>Consequently, these studies further confirmed with molecular docking, superimposition of the docked molecule to the receptor with &#x003b1;-glucosidase, DPP (IV) and insulin receptor (IR) crystal structure and related interactions. Lower binding energy is equal to better receptor binding of a ligand. Therefore, the lowest binding energy scores represent the best protein-ligand binding stability compared to the highest energy scores. It was revealed that phlorizin significantly has the lowest binding energy and the highest formation of H-bond in all the receptors involved. Practically, the conformation structure of the ligand with contains more hydroxyl groups due to the targeted protein happens to be very sensitive to the positions of hydroxyl and greatly leading to increase binding affinities with more tight binding and more potent inhibitory effects<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref>. The activity of phlorizin was also supported from theprevious studies, which demonstrated the potential of phlorizin that binds near the active site pocket of the SGL2 protein, which meant the inhibitor could block the interaction between SGLT2 and glucose, and thus absorption and resulting in the normalisation of blood glucose<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref>. In the &#x003b1;-glucosidase docking analysis, acarbose demonstrated the highest H-bond on the binding with the receptor. Indeed, acarbose is a well-known antidiabetic drug used to treat type 2 diabetes by inhibiting &#x003b1;-glucosidase, has been found to anchor &#x003b1;-glucosidase in the enzyme pocket (domain A) and to bind to residues like Phe384, Arg387, Trp391, Asp392, Arg428, Asp569, Tyr709, Glu771 resulting in a powerful inhibition of &#x003b1;-glucosidase. In the present study, we noticed that hydroxyl groups on sugar moiety of acarbose are favourable for the ligand to interact with the amino acid residues of the binding pocket. In addition, acarbose was observed to bind with the residues like Asp569 and Glu771 that was fixed at the active site of &#x003b1;-glucosidase. However, interesting findings were also be found with phlorizin that forms as the second-highest in the formation of H-bond followed by pomiferin, scandenin. mundulone that revealed the potential of phlorizin to bind at one of the pocket active sites of &#x003b1;-glucosidase, which at residue Asp569 and the binding of these bonds with the enzyme catalytic site play a major role that responsible for the inhibitory activity of &#x003b1;-glucosidase.</p><p>The binding at the active site plays a vital role in increasing the binding affinities between ligand-receptor. Phlorizin was found to form nine hydrogen bonds with DPP (IV) among the seven compounds, and its binding energy was the highest among the seven compounds. We observe that the binding of phlorizin forming two H- bonds with active site residues of DPP (IV), Arg125 contribute to the lowest binding energy formed due to the molecular shape and size of a compound that makes it easier to penetrate the binding pockets. Meanwhile, compounds such as monobenzone, mundulone, berberine and dimethylcaffeic acid were also observed with a quite high binding energy is probably due to the formation of H-bonds at the active site, residue like Ser630. We also notified that the majority of the compounds such as berberine, dimethylcaffeic acid, phlorizin, monobenzone, sandenin found to be exclusively involved in the &#x003c0;-staking interaction with one of DPP (IV) active site, Tyr547 as similar with sitagliptin. These factors claimed as one of reason on these compounds have the ability to mimic the binding interaction and found to follow the same interaction pattern as compared with sitagliptin. Theoretically, &#x003c0;-staking was analysed as the three top most binding interaction in protein-ligand binding including H-bonds, hydrophobic bonds and others that also enhance binding affinity<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref>. It is believed that &#x003c0;-staking is considered as one of the natural keys in non-covalent interaction and the presence of these bonds is significant in many biological systems as solitary effects but also their interplay omnipresent<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref>. Moreover, the docking with the insulin receptor (1IR3) was also included in these studies. Residues of amino acids, namely Ser1006, Lys1030, Asp1083, Met1079, Ala1080, and Glu1077, were the major residues of amino acids involved in internal ligand interaction and most of the active components in 1IR3. According to the molecular docking results, pomiferin and scandenin were the only compounds that were notified to interact with one of the active sites of 1IR3, which are Asp1083 and Ala1080 respectively through hydrogen bonding interaction. By interacting with the active site of IR, these compounds have the potential to act as IR activators therefore, adjust blood glucose to promote the utilisation of glucose. Besides, results also showed that for ligands with high-affinity scores were also influenced by the increase in the number of H-bond formed. The presence of H-bonds is definitely attributed to form a major interaction and regarded to be the main driving force of conformational change of the receptor upon ligand binding. To the best of our knowledge, our present studies were found to be as the first studies that revealed the molecular docking with the compounds that present in <italic>C. latifolia</italic> extracts and this works is based on continuation from our previous studies that involving with antioxidant activity and screening of compounds by LC-MS analysis<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref>. Thus, these studies have been pointed out the potential of phlorizin by inhibiting the activity of &#x003b1;-glucosidase and DPP (IV) enzyme as the new alternative for antidiabetic drugs that potentially being used in the treatment for type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005" disp-level="1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As a conclusion remarks, the results from our current study showed that the root and fruit extracts of <italic>C. latifolia</italic> likely to exert its anti-diabetic properties through inhibitory activity by &#x003b1;-glucosidase that involves in the digestion of carbohydrate mechanism and DPP (IV) enzyme in intestine that stimulating the secretion of insulin and reducing glucose level in the bloodstream. Additionally, both extracts were also observed to enhance in stimulating glucose uptake and insulin secretion. Briefly, the results also highlighted root extracts producing better antidiabetic activities as compare with fruit extracts. The effects of phytochemical compounds that enhance in antidiabetic activity were also being studied thoroughly by molecular docking that revealed the interesting findings of phlorizin compounds as the promising candidates which dock well with targeted protein and responsible in inhibitory activities. In fact, the quantification of each of the compound from the results on the screening from LCMS analysis was still in the progress. However, future studies should address the molecular mechanisms that may be related to the metabolic pathway for treating diabetes and isolation of the active constituents will be interesting to explore and can be considered for developing into a potent antidiabetic drug.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the financial support by the Putra Graduate Initiative Grant (GP-IPS) under vote number 9645100, Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM).
