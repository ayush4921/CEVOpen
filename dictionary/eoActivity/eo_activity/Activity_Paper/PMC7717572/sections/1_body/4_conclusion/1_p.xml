<p>As a conclusion remarks, the results from our current study showed that the root and fruit extracts of 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> likely to exert its anti-diabetic properties through inhibitory activity by Î±-glucosidase that involves in the digestion of carbohydrate mechanism and DPP (IV) enzyme in intestine that stimulating the secretion of insulin and reducing glucose level in the bloodstream. Additionally, both extracts were also observed to enhance in stimulating glucose uptake and insulin secretion. Briefly, the results also highlighted root extracts producing better antidiabetic activities as compare with fruit extracts. The effects of phytochemical compounds that enhance in antidiabetic activity were also being studied thoroughly by molecular docking that revealed the interesting findings of phlorizin compounds as the promising candidates which dock well with targeted protein and responsible in inhibitory activities. In fact, the quantification of each of the compound from the results on the screening from LCMS analysis was still in the progress. However, future studies should address the molecular mechanisms that may be related to the metabolic pathway for treating diabetes and isolation of the active constituents will be interesting to explore and can be considered for developing into a potent antidiabetic drug.
