<p>Insulin release was determined using the monolayer of BRIN-BD11 clonal pancreatic cells. BRIN-BD11 cells were grown in RPMI1640 tissue culture medium containing 11.1 mmol glucose/l, 10%foetal calf serum and antibiotics (50,000 IU penicillin-streptomycin/l), and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO
 <sup>2</sup> and 95% air. Then, 20 h prior to acute experiments, cells were harvested and seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. Following overnight attachment, the culture medium was removed and cells were preincubated for 40 min at 37 °C with 1 ml of Krebs ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer supplemented with 1.1 mM glucose and 1% bovine serum albumin. Samples were immediately done for subsequent insulin radioimmunoassay and were tested by using the Human Insulin Elisa Kit by Kono Biotech (Zhejiang, China).
