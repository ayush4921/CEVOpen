<p>Nowadays, a new approach is introduced by applying plant extracts, which may contain high therapeutic values as an alternative way of mimicking the function of antidiabetic drugs and also have been reported to contain anti-diabetic properties

 <italic>Curculigo latifolia</italic> Dryand. ex W.T.Aiton, 
 <italic>or</italic> locally known as lemba is a rhizome geophyte that is categorised under family Hypoxidaceae. From the previous study, 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> has been revealed has the ability to exhibit antidiabetic properties through cell lines and in diabetic induced rats

 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> has shown to modulate glucose and lipid metabolism in experimental diabetic rats and the presence of curculigoside may have bestowed its anti-diabetic efficacy

 <italic>C latifolia</italic> root extracts were previously screened for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidant activity and screening of active compounds through LCMS analysis

 </xref>. Therefore, the current studies are conducted with an objective to evaluate antidiabetic properties in the 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> root and fruits extracts with the use of environmentally extraction’s technique, which is subcritical water extraction (SWE) method through inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase and DPP (IV) enzyme along with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies by examining the glucose uptake and insulin secretion. Additionally, molecular docking simulation was also been performed in order to predict the molecular docking scores by identifying the docking score in each targeted protein involved.
