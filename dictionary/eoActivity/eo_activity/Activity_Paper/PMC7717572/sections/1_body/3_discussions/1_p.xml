<p>The coordinated function of several different tissues and organs depends on the optimal regulation of blood glucose. These include the gut, which is responsible for digestion and absorption of carbohydrates and pancreatic β-cells, which are responsible for the precise secretion of insulin. In the present study, the effect of antidiabetic activity were examined including the inhibitory potential of α-glucosidase, DPP (IV) enzyme, glucose uptake and secretion of insulin from the 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> root and fruit extracts that were collected by using subcritical water extraction (SWE) technique. This research study also completed by a computational approach through molecular docking studies that reveal the binding interaction and other bonds that formed between the proteins with the receptor involved. Many earlier studies have revealed the role of plant extracts as a natural inhibitor that has a less adverse effect and is capable of reducing hyperglycaemia particularly in the inhibitory activity of the α-glucosidase enzyme

 </xref>. From the results, the inhibitory activity on both of the extracts shows explicated a remarkable inhibition on the α-glucosidase enzyme by revealing the percentage inhibition by root extracts is closer with the percentage of inhibition by marketed anti-diabetic drugs, acarbose. Previously, the findings of the current study are in a good agreement with other research works indicate that SWE extracts are capable of influencing α-glucosidase inhibitory capacity
