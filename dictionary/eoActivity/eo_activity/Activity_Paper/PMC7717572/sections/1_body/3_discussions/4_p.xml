<p>Besides, it can be noticed that 
 <italic>C. latifolia</italic> root extract acted as a better inhibitor as compared with the fruit extracts. This is possibly due to the inhibition from the bioactive compound, containing mixtures of several phenolics and flavonoids that contained in the root extracts that may acts as an inhibitor for the inhibition of the DPP (IV) enzyme

 </xref>. In addition, some bioactive compounds containing in crude extracts can exert their properties in DPP (IV) inhibition because previous studies reported that subclasses in phenolic, flavonoid, terpenoids, and peptides were the most predominant compound as DPP (IV) inhibitors

 </xref>. Whereby, the inhibition activity by the fruit extracts is probably due to the berberis compound that was present in the extract, where the activity of berberis is quite similar to DPP (IV) inhibitor, benzoquinolizines and it was demonstrated berberine significantly reduced the fasting blood glucose (FBG), lowered blood glucose level through increasing insulin receptor expression in T2DM

 </xref>. The viability of the cell was assessed through MTT assay and the results were employed in determining the IC
 <sub>20</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the cell growth. Fruit extracts proposed a lower toxicity effect at IC
 <sub>50</sub> for 3T3–L1, L6, and BRIN-BD11 cell lines as compared with the root extract. Moreover, less toxicity of the sample was probably by applying the optimum condition of SWE that leads to high polarity and reduced toxicity. The sample’s concentration lower than 1 mg/ml was considered as a safe concentration to pursue 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay activities in the glucose uptake and insulin secretion assays.
