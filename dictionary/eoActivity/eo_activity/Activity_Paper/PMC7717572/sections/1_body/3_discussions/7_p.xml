<p>Consequently, these studies further confirmed with molecular docking, superimposition of the docked molecule to the receptor with α-glucosidase, DPP (IV) and insulin receptor (IR) crystal structure and related interactions. Lower binding energy is equal to better receptor binding of a ligand. Therefore, the lowest binding energy scores represent the best protein-ligand binding stability compared to the highest energy scores. It was revealed that phlorizin significantly has the lowest binding energy and the highest formation of H-bond in all the receptors involved. Practically, the conformation structure of the ligand with contains more hydroxyl groups due to the targeted protein happens to be very sensitive to the positions of hydroxyl and greatly leading to increase binding affinities with more tight binding and more potent inhibitory effects

 </xref>. The activity of phlorizin was also supported from theprevious studies, which demonstrated the potential of phlorizin that binds near the active site pocket of the SGL2 protein, which meant the inhibitor could block the interaction between SGLT2 and glucose, and thus absorption and resulting in the normalisation of blood glucose

 </xref>. In the α-glucosidase docking analysis, acarbose demonstrated the highest H-bond on the binding with the receptor. Indeed, acarbose is a well-known antidiabetic drug used to treat type 2 diabetes by inhibiting α-glucosidase, has been found to anchor α-glucosidase in the enzyme pocket (domain A) and to bind to residues like Phe384, Arg387, Trp391, Asp392, Arg428, Asp569, Tyr709, Glu771 resulting in a powerful inhibition of α-glucosidase. In the present study, we noticed that hydroxyl groups on sugar moiety of acarbose are favourable for the ligand to interact with the amino acid residues of the binding pocket. In addition, acarbose was observed to bind with the residues like Asp569 and Glu771 that was fixed at the active site of α-glucosidase. However, interesting findings were also be found with phlorizin that forms as the second-highest in the formation of H-bond followed by pomiferin, scandenin. mundulone that revealed the potential of phlorizin to bind at one of the pocket active sites of α-glucosidase, which at residue Asp569 and the binding of these bonds with the enzyme catalytic site play a major role that responsible for the inhibitory activity of α-glucosidase.
