<p>A total 120 of compounds including known and unknown compounds were identified by LC-MS in the negative ion mode. Based on the results, peaks were labelled according to the order of their retention time, absorption wavelengths, 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> values, and tentative identification were aided by the existing literature.In particular, these compounds were phenolic (monobenzone) and identification as phenolic from benzene derivative (hydroquinone), flavonoid glycoside (phlorizin), prenylflavonoids (pomiferin), isoflavonoid (mundulone and scandenin) and in particular cinnamic acid derivative (dimethyl caffeic acid). The representative chromatograms in the screening of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In the analysis of root extract, the compound that was detected were as follows: phlorizin (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 477), scandenin (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 433), mundulone (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 433, 867), hydroquinone (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 109), dimethylcaffeic acid (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 683), hordatine A (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 532, 549, 565). Meanwhile, the compound that was detected for the fruit extract were as follows: berberine (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 1004), pomiferin (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 447), hordatine A (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 549), monobenzone (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 399), frangulin B (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 401), and robustine (
 <italic>m/z</italic> 183, 195, 207, 217, 221, 239).
