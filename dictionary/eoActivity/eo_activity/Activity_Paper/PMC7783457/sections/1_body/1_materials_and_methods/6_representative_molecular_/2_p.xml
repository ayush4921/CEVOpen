<p id="p0055">A representative molecular docking study was performed using Auto-dock Vina wizard. Ligands (α-pinene and eugenol) were downloaded from ChemDB Chemoinformatics Portal. The SARS CoV-2 spike protein structure file (PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6xr8" id="intref0010" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6xr8</ext-link>) was accessed and downloaded from the website of protein data bank. The protein molecule was processed using AutoDock tool. Water molecules and other associated ions were selectively eliminated whereas polar hydrogens were added to the spike protein molecule. Processed file was saved in ∗.pdbqt format. Region specific docking of α-pinene as well as eugenol was performed with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. AutoDock Vina parameters for spike protein (PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6xr8" id="intref0015" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6xr8</ext-link>) were: center_x = 198.0, center_y = 198.0, center_z = 191.9, size_x = 28.0, size_y = 27.8, size_z = 28.0. The interaction was viewed in PMV viewer ver.1.5.6.
