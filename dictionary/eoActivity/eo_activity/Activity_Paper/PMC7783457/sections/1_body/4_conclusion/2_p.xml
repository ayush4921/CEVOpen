<p id="p0125">‘BhAVI-23’ comprising of 23 natural ingredients displayed 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> antiviral property against reverse transcriptase as well as infectivity of P1 (vir) phage. This infusion also displayed 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> anti-diabetic property as indicated by its anti-glycation activity. These attributes ascertain the potential broad-spectrum antiviral action of this ‘BhAVI-23’ mix besides having already reported immunomodulatory functions of the spice-herbal components comprising this infusion. GC–MS analysis confirmed the presence of many compounds of therapeutic potential that may have a role in conferring antiviral properties. The health benefiting effects including antiviral activity could potentially mitigate the severity of COVID-19 symptoms in the current pandemic. Further studies in higher systems including animal models and/or trial study in human volunteers could be proposed to be pursued upon due regulatory approvals to corroborate the initial 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> findings and affix an antiviral health claim to ‘BhAVI-23’.
