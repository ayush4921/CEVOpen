 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> where α-pinene and eugenol were used as a ligand for spike protein. α-pinene was selected as this molecule has been shown to possess anti-SARS CoV activity while eugenol was selected since it was the most abundant molecule present in BhAVI extract. As seen from the figure, the ligand is binding into the pocket formed by 3D assembly of three spike protein polypeptides. However, the binding affinity score reflects slightly weak affinity of α-pinene with the spike protein assembly. Besides, eugenol also displayed significant binding with the spike protein. Likewise, other ligands present in the spice herbal infusion can have higher binding affinities with the spike protein assembly, exerting synergism in inactivating this protein.
