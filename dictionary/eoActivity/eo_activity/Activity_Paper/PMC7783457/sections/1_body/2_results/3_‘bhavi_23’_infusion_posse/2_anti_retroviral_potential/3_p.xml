<p id="p0070">The retroviruses such as HIV, HTLV-1, HTLV-II are also implicated in several life threatening human diseases and the retroviral family member has a characteristic reverse transcriptase [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Involvement of this reverse transcriptase is a prerequisite in the initial stages of propagation including proviral DNA synthesis and thus many anti-retroviral therapeutic regimes target the reverse transcriptase enzyme.[
