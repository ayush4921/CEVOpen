 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> (A, B) shows binding pose of α-pinene and eugenol with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the predicted binding energy was found to be −6.4 &amp; −6.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Different proteins of SARS CoV-2 have been discovered that could act as potentially important targets for the management of COVID-19. Some of the key protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 are main protease (Mpro), ADP-ribose-1-phosphatase (ADRP), endoribonuclease (Nsp 15/NendoU), the binding domain of the spike protein (SARS-CoV-2rS), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and hACE2 [

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6wqf" id="intref0020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6wqf</ext-link>), Endoribonuclease (PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6x41" id="intref0025" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6x41</ext-link>) and RNA dependent RNA Polymerase (PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6m71" id="intref0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6m71</ext-link>). However, the docking score values for α pinene with Mpro, Endoribonuclease and RdRP were −1.3, −4.2 and −4.1 kcal/mol, respectively while that of eugenol were −3.7, −3.8 and −3.2 kcal/mol, respectively. In both the ligands, spike protein showed the lowest binding energy (indicating highest affinity) with the spike protein.
