<p>Gabr et al. reported the synthesis and evaluation of novel BTA scaffolds against 60 tumour cell lines at a single dose of 10 µM. The best derivatives were

 <sub>50</sub> in the low micro molar or submicromolar range. The SAR study revealed that introduction of the pyrazole moiety significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of both derivatives. Furthermore the presence of 2-hydroxy ester and 3-oxopyrazole within the pyrimidine moiety increased the anti-tumour activities of both derivatives. The simple BTA scafolds having pyrazole functionalities were more potent against different cell lines as compared to derivatives having the pyrazole ring within a pyrimidine moiety
