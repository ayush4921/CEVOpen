<p>Caleta etÂ al. synthesised cyano and amidinobenzothiazole substituted anilins which were treated with 2-bromo-6-cyanobenzothiazole under specific reaction conditions to afford compounds which have been studied for their anticancer activity against 6 cancer cell lines such as laryngeal carcinoma (Hep-2), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), cervical carcinoma (HeLa), pancreatic carcinoma (MiaPaCa-2), colon carcinoma (SW 620), lung carcinoma (H 460), and diploid fibroblasts (WI 38). Among them, the pyrimidine based carbonitrile benzothiazole derivative
