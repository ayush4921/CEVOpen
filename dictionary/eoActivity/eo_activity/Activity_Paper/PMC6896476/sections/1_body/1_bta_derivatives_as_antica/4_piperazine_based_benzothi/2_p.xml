<p>Al-Soud. et al. reported the synthesis of BTA derivatives incorporating sulphonamide, piperazino-arylsulfonamide and arylthiol scaffolds and determined their anti-proliferative potential against different cell lines, such as CCRF-SB (Human acute B-lymphoblastic leukaemia), DU-145 (human prostate cancer cell lines express androgen receptor), HepG-2 cell line (human liver cancer), WIL-2NS (Human splenic B-lymphoblastoid cells), MRC-5 (human lung fibroblast cell line), MCF-7 cell line (human breast adenocarcinoma), MT-4 (human T-cells containing an integrated HTLV-1 genome), SK-MES-1 cell line (human lung cancer) and SK-28 cell line (skin melanoma). Derivative 
 <bold>16</bold> (
 <italic>N</italic>-(2–(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-oxoethyl)-4-chloro-benzenesulfonodithioamide) showed antiproliferative activity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8 ± 3 µM) against human derived DU-145 cell line (

 <bold>17</bold> (
 <italic>N</italic>-(2–(4-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl) piperazin-1-yl)-2-oxoethyl)-2,5-dichloro benzenesulfonodithio-amide) demonstrated remarkable activities against several human derived cell lines such as HepG2 and DU-145 (with CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8 ± 2 µM, and 9 ± 2 µM, respectively) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0010">Figure 10</xref>). Derivatives 
 <bold>16</bold> and 
 <bold>17</bold> exhibited atiproliferative potential due to the introduction of chloro and dichloro phenyl groups while their replacement of with hydrogen, methoxy, nitro, triflouromethyl and methyl groups lead to a decrease in the antiproliferative potential of BTA derivatives
