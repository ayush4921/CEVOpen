<p>Oanh et al. reported the synthesis of hydroxamic acids containing benzothiazole by the reaction of 2-aminobenzothiazole with adipic acid to produce esters that were converted into the desired BTA hydroxamates, and tested for their anticancer activities against five different cell lines such MCF-7, AsPC-1, SW620, PC3 and NCI-H460. Among the synthesised derivatives, hydroxamic acids
