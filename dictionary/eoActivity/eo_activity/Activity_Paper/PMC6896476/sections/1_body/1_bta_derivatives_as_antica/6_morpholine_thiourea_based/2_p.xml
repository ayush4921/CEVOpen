<p>Saeed et al. reported the synthesis of benzothiazole moiety based thiourea derivatives. These novel derivatives were tested for anticancer potential against cancer cell lines MCF-7 and HeLa cells. The MTT assay (colorimetric assessment of cell metabolic activity) indicated that the thiophene based acetamide benzothiazole derivatives
