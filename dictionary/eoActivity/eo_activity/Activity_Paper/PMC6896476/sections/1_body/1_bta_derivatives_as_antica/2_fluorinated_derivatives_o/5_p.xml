<p>El-Damasy et al. synthesised the novel amide and urea based BTA series of 20 sorafenib analogues in which the pyridylamide privileged functionality was attached with an ether linkage at 6-position of the BTA ring. A selected group of 12 potent scaffolds were evaluated and appraised for anti-proliferative activities against sixty human cancer cell lines. These chlorotrifluoromethyl phenyl ureido picolinamide benzothiazoles

 <bold>9</bold> (

 <bold>8</bold> showed good inhibitory activities against ACHN (renal cancer cells lines) and A-498 (human kidney carcinoma cell line) with GI
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.542 µM and 1.02 µM respectively. This compound also possess efficacy against UO-31 and RXF 393 cell lines. The derivatives 
 <bold>7</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> because of 3,4-disubstitutedphenyl moiety, exhibited excellent anti-proliferative activities with low IG
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.85, 2.10 µM against RCC and ACHN cell lines respectively. The SAR study revealed the fact that sorafenib analogues possesses anti proliferative activity due to the presence of both urea spacer and phenyl disubstitution. Compound 
 <bold>8</bold> demonstrated the highest CLogP value being the most lipophilic and potent derivative, in the low µM range
