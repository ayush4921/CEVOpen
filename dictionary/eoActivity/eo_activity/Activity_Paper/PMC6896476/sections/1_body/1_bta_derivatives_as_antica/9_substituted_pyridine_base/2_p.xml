<p>Shi et al. synthesised 20 BTA-2-thiol derivatives and investigated their anti-tumour potential against different cell lines such as SW480 (colon adenocarcinoma), HeLa, A549, HCT-116, HepG2 and SKRB-3 breast cancer cell line. The substituted bromopyridine acetamide benzothiazole derivative 
 <bold>29</bold> (

 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.2 nM, 4.3 nM, 44 nM and 48 nM, respectively. Apoptosis was the mechanism of cell death and was concentration dependent in HepaG2 cells. These results indicated that BTA-2-thiols exhibit broad spectrum anti-cancer activities which are worth to be further investigated
