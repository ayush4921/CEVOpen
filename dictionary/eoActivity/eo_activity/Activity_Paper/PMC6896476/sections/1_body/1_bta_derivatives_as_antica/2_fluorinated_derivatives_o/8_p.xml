<p>Junjie et al. reported the synthesis of semicarbazone containing BTA derivatives by the reaction of 4-nitrobenzyl bromide with substituted amines under different reaction conditions and evaluated their anticancer activity against four different cancer cell line such as human colon cancer cells (HT29), human lung cancer cell (H460), non-small cell lung cancer (A549) and human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231). Among these derivatives, the indole based hydrazine carboxamide scaffold 
 <bold>12</bold> (

 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.015 µM for HT29, 0.28 µM for H460, 1.53 µM for A549 and 0.68 µM for MDA-MB-231. The structure – activity relationship explained that compound 
 <bold>12</bold> exhibited the highest antitumor activity due to the presence of electron withdrawing groups in the 4 position of benzyl ring
