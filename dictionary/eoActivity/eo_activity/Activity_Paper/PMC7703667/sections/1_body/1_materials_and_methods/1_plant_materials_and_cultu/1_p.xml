<p>Primary protocorms generated from 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> seeds were used as explants for the transformations. For sterilization, wild-type protocorms were treated with 75% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) ethanol for 30 s followed by the treatment of 0.1%(
 <italic>w/v</italic>) HgCl
 <sub>2</sub> for 5 min. Protocorms were maintained and subcultured on a solidified MS (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Murashige and Skoog, 1962</xref>) basal salt medium (Phyto Technology Laboratories
 <sup>®</sup>, Lenexa, KS) containing 30 g L
 <sup>–1</sup> of sucrose, 5 g L
 <sup>–1</sup> of plant agar (gel strength &gt;1,100 g cm
 <sup>–2</sup>) (Duchefa Biochemie, Haarlem, Netherlands), 20 g L
 <sup>–1</sup> of ground potato, 0.5 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup> of 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 1 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup> of 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA), and adjusted pH to 5.8. For the ground potato, 20 g of fresh potato tubers were pureed in a blender and then used for medium preparation without filtering. Protocorms were cultured at 25°C with cool fluorescent white light (Panasonic, Osaka, Japan) at an intensity of 70–90 μmol m
 <sup>2</sup> s
 <sup>–1</sup> and a 14 h photoperiod. These culture conditions were used for all stages of tissue culture except as described below. The co-cultivation medium was prepared by supplementing MS with sucrose, ground potato, and 100 μM acetosyringone (AS) without any plant growth regulators. Selection medium was prepared by supplementing MS medium with 30 g L
 <sup>–1</sup> of sucrose, 5 g L
 <sup>–1</sup> of agar, 20 g L
 <sup>–1</sup> of ground potato, 0.2 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup> of NAA, 1 mgL
 <sup>–1</sup> of 6-BA, 20 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup> of hygromycin B, and 500 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup> of cefotaxime, and adjusted pH to 5.8. When the medium was prepared, pH was adjusted with 10% (
 <italic>w/v</italic>) KOH, all antibiotics were added after autoclaving at 121°C for 20 min, and all growth regulators were added before autoclaving. Except for those reagents described above, all other reagents were provided by Solarbio, Beijing, China.
