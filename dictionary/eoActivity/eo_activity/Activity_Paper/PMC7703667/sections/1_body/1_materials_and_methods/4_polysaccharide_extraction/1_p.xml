<p>Three grams of shoots from fresh wild-type and two independent transgenic 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> seedlings were ground with a mortar at room temperature and suspended in 20 ml of distilled water. The suspended samples were heated in a water bath at 80°C for 2 h. Then the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and mixed with 20 ml of distilled water. The sediment was used for further polysaccharide extraction by repeating heating, suspending, and centrifugation operation steps for another two times. The crude polysaccharide solutions from three extractions were mixed well. Ethanol was added to each 5 ml of collected supernatant to the final volume of 25 ml. Then the well-mixed solution was allowed to stand for polysaccharide precipitation at 4°C for 24 h. Precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 6,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Collected precipitate was dissolved with hot water (60°C). Then the polysaccharide in the prepared solution was determined by sulfuric acid (80%)–anthrone (0.1%) colorimetry with UV spectrophotometer (UV765, Shanghai, China) at 620 nm, and glucose (0.1 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup>) was used to build the standard curves (
