<p>GTs are a very widespread group of carbohydrate-active-related enzymes, and participate in glycan and glycoside biosynthesis in higher plants (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Shen et al., 2017</xref>). Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the CSLA family plays important roles in the biosynthesis of mannan polysaccharides in many plant species. For example, 
 <italic>CSLA</italic> genes from guar (
 <italic>Cyamopsis tetragonolobus</italic>), Arabidopsis, and poplar (
 <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>) are capable of producing Î²-mannan polysaccharides (

 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, it has been revealed that increased polysaccharide content is directly correlated with the reduced sugar content in the cell, and this process is thought to be mediated by sucrose invertase and SPS. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2015</xref>). The medicinal values of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> mainly depend on the polysaccharide quality and quantity; therefore, more effort is required to elucidate the functions of these genes in
