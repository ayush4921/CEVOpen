<p>To examine the function of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, in this study, we generated 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> seedlings. The 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic>-OE construct, which is composed of a CaMV 35S-driven 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> cDNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>), was introduced into 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> genome and transformation frequency was up to 16.9%. To confirm whether the 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> was indeed overexpressed, the mRNA level of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> was determined by using qRT-PCR. Three lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) with increased mRNA expression levels from 1.35- to 2.89-fold were selected for further study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Glc-1-P and UDP-Glc are the substrate and product of DoUGPase-mediated reaction. Metabolomics data showed that Glc-1-P was slightly decreased, and UDP-Glc was significantly increased, in the transgenic plants. This result suggests that the overexpressed 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> resulted in an increased UGPase activity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). These three transgenic lines exhibited different expression levels, which could be utilized for the analysis of the overexpression of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> in 
 <italic>D. officinale.</italic>
