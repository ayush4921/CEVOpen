<p>It has been well studied that 
 <italic>UGP</italic> genes play roles in the sucrose and starch biosynthesis pathway (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kleczkowski, 1994</xref>). UGPases catalyze the production of UDP-glc and pyrophosphate from Glc-1-P and uridine triphosphate (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Kleczkowski, 1994</xref>). In some cases, increased activity of a single enzyme may have an effect on the up- and downstream enzyme activities or gene expression levels of other members of a pathway. However, in other cases, the increased enzyme activities may not affect the expression levels of the genes in the same pathway. To further investigate whether the metabolism-related genes are affected by 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression, we chose several critical genes (U1, nudix hydrolase 14; U2, phosphoglucomutase; D1, sucrose-phosphatase 2-like; D2, sucrose synthase 2-like; D3, trehalose-phosphate phosphatase A-like and D4, beta-glucosidase 2-like) through the KEGG database

 </sup>. The positions of these genes in the pathway related to 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>. qRT-PCR results showed that except D4, which was slightly decreased, the other genes were all dramatically increased in all three transgenic lines compared to the ones in the wild-type plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results imply that the overexpressed 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> alters the expression of the genes in the same pathway, thereby, overexpressed 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> affects the pathway.
