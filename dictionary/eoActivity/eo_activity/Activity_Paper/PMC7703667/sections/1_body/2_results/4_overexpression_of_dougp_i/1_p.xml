<p>Soluble polysaccharide content is an important index for judging the medicinal value of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>. As both 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> and 
 <italic>CSLAs</italic> play important roles in the polysaccharide synthesis and in the stem of transgenic plants with overexpressed 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic>, most 
 <italic>CSLA</italic>sâ€™ expression was significantly increased, and it is a reasonable hypothesis that polysaccharide content in the transgenic plants may be affected as well. To verify this hypothesis, the polysaccharide content of wild-type and transgenic plants was determined. When 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> was overexpressed, polysaccharide content was increased by 11.1% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Metabolomics data of monosaccharide composition of water-soluble polysaccharides in the stem of wild-type and transgenic 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> plants show that mannose is mainly responsible for the increased polysaccharide content in the 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression plants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). However, the glucose ratio of monosaccharide composition in the transgenic plants was less compared to the one in the wild-type plants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). These data further confirmed that 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> plays important roles in the polysaccharide synthesis network. 
 <italic>UGP</italic>s have been reported to play roles in the cellulose synthesis pathway (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). However, overexpressed 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> decreased the cellulose content in the transgenic plants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).
