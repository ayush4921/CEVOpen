<p>The reason we started with 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> is to learn about the underlying mechanisms of polysaccharide synthesis in 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> and apply this knowledge to improve the polysaccharide content in these plants. In other plants, the 
 <italic>UGP</italic>s have been reported to play roles in the cellulose synthesis pathway (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). However, in our case, instead of an increase in cellulose content, overexpressed 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> resulted in the increased total soluble polysaccharides (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). This result indicates that studies on 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> are important for 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, as the soluble polysaccharide content is critical for the medicinal use of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>. For medicinal use, 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> plants of 2–4 years old are regarded most appropriate for polysaccharide extraction, as polysaccharide content of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> varies depending on age and developmental stages (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2018</xref>). 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> plants used in this study were 1-year-old young plants, which means a much higher polysaccharide content could be expected in 2–4-years-old transgenic plants. We also noticed that the stress tolerance of transgenic plants was significantly improved possibly due to the increased polysaccharide content (
