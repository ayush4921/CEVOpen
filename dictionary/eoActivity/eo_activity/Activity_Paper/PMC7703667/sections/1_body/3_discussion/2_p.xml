<p>In this study, we also found that when 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> was overexpressed, some of the key genes in the same pathway were significantly affected. Surprisingly, among the four downstream genes, three of them were upregulated; nevertheless, beta-glucosidase 2-like gene was downregulated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result indicates that these four genes may have other functions in different ways at least when working along with 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic>. We also noticed that upregulation of these genes such as nudix hydrolase 14 gene and sucrose phosphatase 2-like gene was not consistently related to 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression levels. This phenomenon could be explained by the regulation of nudix hydrolase 14 and sucrose phosphatase 2-like genes by 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> that was in a fine tuned way. Moreover, we also noticed that in the stem, most of the 
 <italic>CSLA</italic> genes in the mannan polysaccharide synthesis pathway were upregulated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A–I</xref>), which is consistent with the increased total soluble polysaccharide content (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Besides, the increased expression of most of the 
 <italic>CSLA</italic> genes is also consistent with the promoted ratio of mannan to total soluble polysaccharide in the stem (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Although the monosaccharide composition of water-soluble polysaccharide data indicated that the relative ratio of glucose in the DoUGP-OE transgenic plants was decreased compared to the one of WT, given the increased polysaccharide content resulting by the overexpressed 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic>, the absolute glucose content in the transgenic plants was not less than the one of WT. However, in the leaves of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic>-OE transgenic plants, the expression of 
 <italic>CSLA</italic> genes was significantly downregulated, which indicates that the overexpression of 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> affected the 
 <italic>CSLA</italic> gene expression in a tissue-dependent way (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5J–R</xref>). This implies that in the 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic>, the polysaccharide metabolism network is complex and requires more effort to elucidate it.
