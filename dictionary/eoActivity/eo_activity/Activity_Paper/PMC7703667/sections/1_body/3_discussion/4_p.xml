<p>Based on the results obtained in this study, a schematic map was summarized (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). First, when 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> was overexpressed, some genes in the same synthesis pathway were promoted. As a result, the total polysaccharide content was increased in the transgenic plants. Besides these two polysaccharide synthesis pathways, the gene expression of other polysaccharide synthesis pathways remains unclear. Increased polysaccharide content, enhanced biomass accumulation, and improved stress resistance were obtained in 
 <italic>DoUGP</italic> overexpression of 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> plants. All these traits are critical features for 
 <italic>D. officinale</italic> breeding. We suppose that increased freezing and osmotic resistance resulting from increased polysaccharide content may be due to a better maintained intracellular osmotic pressure and freezing point. Besides, decreased proline content and SOD enzyme activity suggest that the relieved stress in the transgenic plants is due to the presence of additional polysaccharide content.
