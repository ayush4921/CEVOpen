<p>Moreover, acarbose is one of the therapeutic drugs used for the treatment of hyperglycaemia in T2D patients but several side effects generally occur, probably due to a more significant inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase if compared to 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibition

 </xref>. MES instead showed a better inhibition against 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase showing also a lower ratio between 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition, making this extract as a good candidate for further deeper study. Thus, MES was tested for the ThT assay.
