<p>The methanolic extract showed complete inhibition of fibrils formation at 1:5 (IAPP 40 µg/mL:MES 200 µg/mL) and 1:10 (IAPP 40 µg/mL:MES 400 µg/mL) ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>), in fact, the corresponding curves appear flat and superimposed, meaning that there is no formation of fibrils. There is also a delay at 1:1 (IAPP 40 µg/mL:MES 40 µg/mL) ratio on fibril formation, made evident by the shifting of the curve that is smaller by decreasing the concentration of the extract, highlighting that the inhibition is dose-dependent. The ThT assay was repeated three times and extended up to 150 h.
