 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows that EEG acts as a competitive inhibitor against 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. In fact, by increasing the concentration of extract, a family of straight lines with different slope, all intersecting on the 
 <italic>y</italic>-axis, was found (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1(a)</xref>). This kinetic analysis indicates that the extract binds with the free enzyme and the equilibrium constant, 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>I</sub> = 0.08 µg/mL, was obtained from the slope (
 <italic>K
  <sub>m</sub>
 </italic>/
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) versus inhibitor concentration.
