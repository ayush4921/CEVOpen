<p>The results of this study showed that 
 <italic>W. filifera</italic> extracts had significant inhibitory activities against 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. In addition to these properties, the methanolic 
 <italic>W. filifera</italic> seed extract has shown a complete inhibition of the formation of the toxic IAPP aggregates. Since such aggregates are implicate in pancreatic β-islet cell death, inhibition of IAPP aggregation is important in prevention of diabetes or of its progression.
