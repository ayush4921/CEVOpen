<p>The fruits of 
 <italic>W. filifera</italic> were collected in Tunisia in the areas of Gabès (G) and Sousse (S). The fruits of 
 <italic>W. filifera</italic>, were separated as pulp and seeds. The last were crushed separately then macerated in different solvent; precisely, 25 g of seeds were extracted in 100 mL of water (AE, aqueous extract), ethanol (EE, ethanol extract) or methanol (ME, methanol extract) for 72 h, at room temperature under continuous stirring. After filtration and centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, ethanol and methanol extracts were concentrated under vacuum using a rotary evaporator while the obtained aqueous extracts were then lyophilised for further analysis. In order to perform the characterisation of phenolic composition, fats and other non-polar compounds where removed by treating the extracts with 
 <italic>n</italic>-exane as following: 10 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane were added to 200 mg of extract, filtered under vacuum with Bruckner, and the control of filtrate on TLC.
