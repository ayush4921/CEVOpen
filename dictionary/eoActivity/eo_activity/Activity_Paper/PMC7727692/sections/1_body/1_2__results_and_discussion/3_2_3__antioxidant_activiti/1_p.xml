<p>The ORAC assay examines the peroxyl radical absorbing capacity of the flavonoid-containing extract and the purified flavonoid while the TEAC assay informs the potential of antioxidants to scavenge ABTS radical cation. The FRAP assay assesses the ability of antioxidant compounds to reduce Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> by donating electrons. These assays have been used to determine the antioxidant capacity of the compounds of interest and the capacities are presented in
