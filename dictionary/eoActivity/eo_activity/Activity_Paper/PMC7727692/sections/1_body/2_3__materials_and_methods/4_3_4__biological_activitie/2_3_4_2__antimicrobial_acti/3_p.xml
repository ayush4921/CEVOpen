<p>The methods of European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] was adapted. Microdilutions of each bacteria and samples were prepared in sterile 96-well microtitre plates in triplicates. The test strains were grown in optimal growth media as indicated previously. After 24 h of growth, the OD
 <sub>600</sub> of the culture was determined. The OD
 <sub>600</sub> was adjusted to 0.8 for this experiment. The samples and cultures were dispensed into microtiter plates and then incubated for 24 h at the optimal growth temperature of the test strains. 20 µL of 0.25% (

 <italic>v</italic>) MTT in PBS was added to each well and the plates were incubated at the optimal growth temperature of the test strains for 3 h. Then, 100 µL DMSO was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 4 h. The OD of the samples were determined at 570 nm. The levels of microbial inhibition were expressed as a percentage by comparing the OD values for the samples or the antibiotics against the negative control values, expressed as follows 
 <disp-formula>(y − z)/y × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where y = OD value for negative control; z = OD value for samples tested.
