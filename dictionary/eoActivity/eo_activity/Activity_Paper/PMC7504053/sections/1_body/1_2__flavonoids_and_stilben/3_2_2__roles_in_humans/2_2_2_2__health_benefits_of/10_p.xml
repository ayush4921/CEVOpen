<p>Some flavonoids exist as oligomers, usually as dimers or trimers, such as procyanidin C
 <sub>1</sub> derived from three epicatechin units (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f004">Figure 4</xref>. They may also be formed from structures other than the flavan-3-ols, such as the anthocyanins, which incorporate flavan-4-ols and flavan-3,4-diols. These small polymers are collectively known as condensed tannins. The biological activity of these compounds is not significantly increased in comparison to their monomeric derivatives, and they may be readily depolymerized to their precursor monomeric forms upon digestion. Condensed tannins affect the flavour of food and drink through their astringency, and some such as the procyanidins are used as dietary supplements. These compounds are usually extracted from bark of maritime pine (
 <italic>Pinus pinaster</italic>; Pinaceae) under the name Pycnogenol
 <sup>Â®</sup> and contain up to 70% procyanidins. This formulation was claimed to be useful in the treatment of an array of human diseases, with special emphasis on venous insufficiency and the related vascular conditions. As with many other flavonoid-derived dietary supplements, the evidence is insufficient to support such claims [
