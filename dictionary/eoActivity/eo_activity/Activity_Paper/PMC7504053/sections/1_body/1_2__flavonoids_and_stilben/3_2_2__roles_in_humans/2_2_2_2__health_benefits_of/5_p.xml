<p>Naringenin (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f002">Figure 2</xref>, has been quite extensively studied as a possible treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. It enhances memory and ameliorates the characteristic pathologies in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease by binding to CRMP2, collapsin response mediator protein type 2 [

Additionally, there is some evidence that naringenin can inhibit some human cytochrome P-450 enzymes, which may interfere with the metabolism of certain drugs. The consumption of citrus fruits and tomatoes that are rich in naringenin may produce adverse effects and possibly affect some medications.
