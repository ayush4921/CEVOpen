<p>Flavonolignans are an interesting class of compounds that arise from a combination of flavonoid and phenylpropanoid (usually coniferyl alcohol) structures via oxidative coupling between the two. Perhaps the best example of such compounds that have attracted significant research and medicinal interest are flavonolignans from milk thistle (
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic>; Asteraceae). It is a biennial plant found in the Euro-Mediterranean region, where it has a long usage in traditional medicine being used as a remedy for liver problems and other disorders. The seeds contain 1.5–3% of flavonolignans, collectively termed silymarin, which is composed of silybin (also known as silibinin), together with silychristin, isosilybin, and related structures (

 <xref rid="B137-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Various in vitro experiments and in vivo animal studies have demonstrated that silymarin has the potential to treat liver disease and injury, including hepatitis, cirrhosis, and jaundice. However, the results from early clinical trials returned conflicting data [

Silybin, which appears to be chiefly responsible for the pharmacological activity of silymarin, has poor water solubility and low bioavailability. Various silybin analogues with better solubility properties have been developed and are currently being tested in clinical trials for treating hepatic damage. Perhaps the most successful outcome of such effort is silybin bis-hemisuccinate (e.g., Legalon
 <sup>®</sup> SIL), which has been shown to be an antidote in acute poisoning with α-amanitin and phalloidin after the ingestion of death cap mushrooms (
 <italic>Amanita phalloides</italic>; Amanitaceae) and is now used for this purpose in medicinal practice [

 <xref rid="B140-molecules-25-03846" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. One problem with current silybin derivatives for wider clinical use was the fact that they cannot be taken orally but must be injected [
