 <italic>Dysoxylum malabaricum</italic> has a long tradition in Ayurveda as a medicinal plant used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Related species 
 <italic>D. gotadhora</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>D. binectariferum</italic>; Meliaceae) contains rohitukine, which was found to possess strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. It was initially thought that rohitukine is plant derived. However, it has now been shown that rohitukine is probably not biosynthesized by the plant itself but is the product of endophytic fungi. Rohitukine (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f007">Figure 7</xref>, belongs to the class of chromone alkaloids. While not being a flavonoid itself, structureâ€“activity studies of rohitukine analogues led to the discovery of some synthetic compounds with structures similar to those of common flavonoids. Flavopiridol (alvocidib; 
 <bold>31</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f007">Figure 7</xref>, exerts its anticancer properties by inhibiting various cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) enzymes, a relatively new target in anticancer therapy. It was successful in preclinical studies as well as phase I and II clinical trials as being effective against solid tumours, lymphomas and leukaemia [

Further studies have shown flavopiridol to have a rather narrow therapeutic index and relatively low level of selectivity, acting on non-Cdk targets. To overcome these limitations, a second generation of Cdk-inhibitors was developed. Most of these, however, no longer share the flavonoid skeleton. One such agent, dinaciclib, showed considerable promise in phase III trials, and this second generation Cdk-inhibitor seems to be far more effective than its flavonoid-like antecedent. Another flavonoid alkaloid with potent anticancer activity was P276-00 (riviciclib; 
 <bold>32</bold>), 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03846-f007">Figure 7</xref>, which has so far made it to a phase II clinical trial [
