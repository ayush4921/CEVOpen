<p>The cytotoxic activity of the plant and remedy extracts is shown in Tables 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The extracts obtained from the selected cancer remedy, TTW and TTE, were not active (IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). However, TTE exerted moderate activity against MCF-7 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 52.33 ± 2.05 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Of the 46 extracts tested, 30 (65.2%) exerted cytotoxic activity against the cancer cells with various degrees of potency. Four plant extracts exerted potent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values less than 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, including 
 <italic>A. dahurica, M. siamensis, F. albopurpurea,</italic> and 
 <italic>T. indica</italic>. The other 26 extracts exerted low to moderate cytotoxic activity. With regard to normal cells (HaCat), 15 extracts showed no cytotoxic activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values more than 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The selective index (SI) of the extracts was calculated. SI is the ratio between IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of HaCaT (normal cell) and cancer cell lines. The greater the SI value, the more selective it is. SI value more than 2 indicates that the herbal extract is toxic against cancer cells but less toxic to normal cells. SI value less than 2 indicates the general toxicity of the extract [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Based on this criterion, the extracts of
 <italic>. A. dahurica</italic>, 
 <italic>F. albopurpurea, M. siamensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. halicacalum, C. papaya</italic>, 
 <italic>K. galanga</italic>, 
 <italic>P. cablin, and T. indica</italic> were remarkably selective to breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. Plant extracts which exerted activities against all tested cancer cells were from
