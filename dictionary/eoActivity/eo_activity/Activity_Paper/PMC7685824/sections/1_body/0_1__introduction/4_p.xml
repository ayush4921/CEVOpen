<p>Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxic activity of the extracts of this TTM remedy and its 44 plant ingredients in this remedy against commonly occurring cancers in women, i.e., MCF-7 (breast cancer), SKOV3 (ovarian cancer), and HeLa (cervical cancer). The total flavonoid content of the extracts was also studied, and its correlation with cytotoxic activity was also evaluated. The statistical cluster analysis was used to visualize the cytotoxic pattern of plants and remedies. This study also evaluated an alternative method for screening the cytotoxic activity of plant ingredients in polyherbal remedies used in traditional medicines. The correlation of cytotoxic activity with total flavonoid content may be used in the search for cytotoxic compounds from flavonoids against cancers occurring in women in the future.
