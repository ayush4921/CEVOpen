<p>Each plant was washed, thinly sliced, dried in an oven at 45°C, and powdered. Dried plants (1000 g) were macerated with 3.0 L of 95% ethanol for 3 days, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The selected traditional Thai cancer remedy was prepared according to the proportion used at the JFCT foundation by combining an equal weight of each dried plant, mixed together, and powdered. The resulting remedy was extracted by two methods, maceration (as described above), and decoction. The decoction method was carried out by boiling the remedy (1000 g) with an equal amount of water for 15 minutes and the aqueous extract filtered and evaporated to dryness with a freeze drier. The ethanolic extract of TTM was named TTE and the aqueous extract obtained from decoction was named TTW. The %yield was calculated (
