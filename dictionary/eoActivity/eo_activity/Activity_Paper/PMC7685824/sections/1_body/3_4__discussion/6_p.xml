<p>Among the plants that showed high total flavonoid content, 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> extract which possessed the highest flavonoid content exerted mild cytotoxic activity while 
 <italic>A. dahurica</italic> exerted potent cytotoxicity. This indicated that the flavonoids in 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> differed from those in 
 <italic>A. dahurica,</italic> leading to the differences in their cytotoxic activity. In phytochemical reviews, the major constituent in 
 <italic>C. aromatica</italic> is terpenes, while in 
 <italic>A. dahurica</italic> are furocoumarins. These indicated that these compounds might cause overestimation of total flavonoid content, which underscores the limitation of this study. Hence, the determination of the total flavonoid content of the plants alone may be insufficient to describe the correlation with their biological activities. Therefore, more in-depth phytochemical studies should be pursued by more powerful analytical methods and instruments.
