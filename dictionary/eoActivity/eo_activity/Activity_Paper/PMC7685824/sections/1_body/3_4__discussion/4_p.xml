<p>Several flavonoids from 
 <italic>T. indica</italic> have been reported, including vitexin, isovitrexin, orientin, and iso-orientin [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A previous report showed that vitexin and orientin exhibited mild to moderate cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cell line with IC
 <sub>50</sub> more than 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Another report showed that the rhizome of 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> contained flavonoids and chalcone compounds such as alpinetin, pinocembrin, cardamonin, pinostrobin, and panduratin A [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A cyclohexenyl chalcone, panduratin A, in 
 <italic>B. rotunda</italic> showed potent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.75 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. 
 <italic>A. dahurica</italic> showed high flavonoid content and exerted potent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7. The major constituents of 
 <italic>A. dahurica</italic> were furocoumarins, imperatorin, phelloptorin, and isoimperatorin [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Imperatorin and isoimperatorin exhibited low to moderate cytotoxic activity against L1210, HL-60, K562, and B16F10 cell lines [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Components found in 
 <italic>M. siamensis</italic> are coumarins such as mammea A, mammea B, mammea E, and other derivatives. Mammea A/AA exerted potent cytotoxic activity against breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In 
 <italic>P. amarus,</italic> the major chemical components are lignans. Crude methanolic extract of 
 <italic>P. amarus</italic> exerted cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and could reduce invasion, migration, and adhesion [
