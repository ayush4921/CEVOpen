<p id="Par32">The probability of discontinuation observed in our study is low compared to the discontinuation rates reported in literature for the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). Studies have reported discontinuation rates of REMS between 57 and 75%, with an average time to REMS discontinuation of 1.7 years [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Median time to discontinuation of aRMMs in our study was 7.5 years. However, when comparing discontinuation rates of aRMMs in the EU and REMS in the USA, some key factors should be considered. First and most importantly, medication guides (paper handouts which may help patients avoid serious risks) were considered a REMS until November 2011, when the FDA released new guidance clarifying that medication guides may not always be a REMS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The high reported rate of REMS discontinuation may be partly explained by re-evaluation of these medication guide–only REMS. Second, the high discontinuation rates reported for REMS included multiple product-specific REMS programmes for both innovator and non-innovator medicines with the same active substances and REMS programmes for non-innovator medicinal products containing active substances with a long history of use. To avoid multiple counting of aRMMs, we excluded non-innovator medicines from our study, as they are expected to follow the RMP of the reference innovator medicine. The discontinuation rate of REMS as reported in the literature is therefore not directly comparable to the discontinuation rate of aRMMs in our study. Different conclusions regarding safety between different regulators have been shown to lead to differences in frequency, timing, and content of safety communications both within the EU and between the USA, Canada, and the UK [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This may also impact the decision to require or discontinue either aRMMs or REMS. Lastly, REMS requirements include mandatory assessment of the effectiveness of the measures after 18 months, 3 years, and 7 years. In contrast, timelines for evaluation of effectiveness of aRMMs are determined on a case-by-case basis, although GVP module XVI rev 2 provides guidance on time points of particular interest, namely 1 year after implementation and 5 years after MA [
