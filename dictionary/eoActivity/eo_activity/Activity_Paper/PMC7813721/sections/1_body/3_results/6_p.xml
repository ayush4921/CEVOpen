For the discontinuation of aRMMs, the sources of evidence were a non-clinical study (25%) and an observational study (25%). The observational study was a multi-database drug-utilisation study for indacaterol maleate, which was authorised only for use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and had aRMMs to reduce the risks associated with off-label use in asthma; the authors concluded that there was little to no off-label use of indacaterol in the EU [
