<p id="Par24">During the study period, aRMMs were introduced for 14 of 346 products authorised without aRMMs. All 14 aRMMs introduced post-authorisation included the provision of educational materials, which were aimed at healthcare professionals in 12 products (86%) and at patients or caregivers in seven (50%). For two products [gadoversetamide and split influenza virus inactivated, containing antigen equivalent to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)-derived strain used NYMC X-179A], controlled distribution systems were introduced in addition to the educational materials. Among the 14 medicines for which aRMMs were introduced post-authorisation, one (antithrombin alfa) was authorised under exceptional circumstances and one (velaglucerase alfa) was intended for the treatment of an orphan disease. For the 14 medicines where aRMMs were introduced post-authorisation, five (36%) targeted “Blood and blood forming organs”, three (21%) were “Antiinfectives for systemic use”, and two (14%) targeted the “Musculoskeletal system”. The remaining four belonged to the ATC groups “Alimentary tract and metabolism”, “Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory agents”, “Nervous system”, and “Various”. Of the 14 medicines with introduction of aRMMs post-authorisation, 11 were still authorised and three [gadoversetamide, ferumoxytol, and split influenza virus inactivated, containing antigen equivalent to A/California/07/2009 (H1N1)-derived strain used NYMC X-179A] were voluntarily withdrawn from the market at the time of data collection (July 2018) (Table
