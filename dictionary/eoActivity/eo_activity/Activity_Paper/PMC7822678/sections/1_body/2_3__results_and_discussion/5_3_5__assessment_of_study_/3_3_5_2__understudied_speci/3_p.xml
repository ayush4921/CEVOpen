 <italic>A. coriaria</italic> was reported to be used traditionally in 11 publications that show results of surveys conducted in Uganda, except for the one in Kenya. Forty traditional healers from the Greater Mpigi region named 
 <italic>A. coriaria</italic> as one of their priority plants for the treatment of tuberculosis [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Two more studies from Mpigi district identified the stem bark and the leaves for treatment of HIV/AIDS and related medical disorders [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. At another study site in Uganda, Katabi subcounty in Wakiso district, the leaves and the bark were used in treatment of wounds and skin rashes [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In Kakamega county, Kenya, the bark and the leaves were reported to be used in treatment of breast, uterine, and skin cancer [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Another publication assessed the ecological status and ethnobotany of 
 <italic>A. coriaria</italic> in Budondo subcounty, eastern Uganda, highlighting its use, local harvesting patterns, and local attitudes towards its conservation. Community members consider the species as being rare, and abundance is declining in the region. Among many non-medicinal uses, the root and the stem bark were used in the treatment of syphilis, skin diseases, jaundice, eye diseases, cough, sore throat, and to concentrate breast milk in humans [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Another study assessed the possibility of setting up multipurpose tree gardens to provide traditional healers with species used for medicine [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. In the county of Bulamogi in Uganda, the bark is used by traditional healers in the treatment of diarrhea, “lameness” (
 <italic>butenge</italic>), syphilis, snake bites, and amoebiasis. The roots are used for the treatment of pyomyositis and amoebiasis. The leaves were also reported to be used against snake bites [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In Kibale rainforest, an aqueous decoction of the fresh stem bark is drunk to treat cough [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. One Ugandan study assessed the domestication of medicinal tree species in the Victoria lakeshore region, including 
 <italic>A. coriaria</italic>, and their distribution by vendors on local markets [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. With regard to the DoP
 <sub>bioactivity</sub>, four publications were recorded. One article reported low antigiardial activity of a mixture of roots and bark against 
 <italic>Giardia lambia</italic> at 500 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Another study investigated the stem bark and reported moderate 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> D6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 37.83 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) and low antileishmanial activity [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. A dichloromethane extract of the stem bark displayed moderate antiplasmodial activity against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> D6 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 10.68 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) and the chloroquine-resistant 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> W2 strain (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 6.80 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Three stem bark extracts with varying solvents displayed moderate to low growth inhibitory activity against five African livestock pathogens of the genus 
 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Publications categorized under the DoP
 <sub>structure elucidation</sub> include reporting of the isolation of two new oleanane-type saponins, coriariosides A and B, along with a known saponin, gummiferaoside C, from the roots of 
 <italic>A. coriaria</italic>. As part of this study, coriarioside A and gummiferaoside C displayed cytotoxic activity against the colorectal human HCT116 and HT29 cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The same group of researchers published the isolation and structure elucidation of coriarioside C, D, and E from the roots shortly after [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].
