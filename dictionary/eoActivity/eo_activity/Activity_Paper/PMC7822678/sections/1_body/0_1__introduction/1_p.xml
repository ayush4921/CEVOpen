<p>Throughout human history and across the globe, plants were regarded as the major source of medicine and natural remedies. Traditional medicine is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, used in the maintenance of health and in the prevention, diagnosis, and improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness” [

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This is largely attributed to their ease of access, affordability, perceived fewer side effects, and cultural appropriateness, among other reasons [
