<p>Alkaloids are a class of naturally occurring nitrogen-containing compounds that have at least one nitrogen as a heteroatom, usually in a heterocyclic ring—with basic properties—and produce pronounced physiological responses. According to the biosynthetic pathway, alkaloids can be classified into, (1) true alkaloids that originate from amino acids and contain a nitrogen-based heterocyclic ring; (2) proto-alkaloids that also derive from amino acids, but do not contain a nitrogen moiety in a heterocyclic system; (3) pseudoalkaloids that do not originate from amino acids. Currently, more than 8000 natural compounds are classified as alkaloids [
