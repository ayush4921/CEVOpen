<p>SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic infectious disease resulting in COVID-19, is causing numerous health and economic problems globally. SARS-CoV-2 must bind to specific receptors on the host cell surface that allows virus entry into the host cell. SARS-CoV-2 attaches to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors—the main receptor involved with viral entry—present on the surface of host cells, by anchoring the virus’ S1 subunit of the spike protein. The S1 subunit, which contains the receptor binding domain (RBD), is responsible for the high-affinity viral binding to ACE2 receptors [
