<p>Due to the structural diversity of the alkaloids and the differences in the experimental protocols used by each research group in our selected articles, it is not easy to establish a relationship between chemical structure and anti-coronaviral activity of the alkaloids identified in our review. However, we do note that the identified alkaloids share some common chemical characteristics. Interestingly, the eleven alkaloids are highly oxygenated due to the presence of several functional groups, including methoxyls, hydroxyls, methylene dioxide, and carbonyls of ketones, esters, and amides. Also, the nitrogens found in these alkaloids are heterocyclic atoms and are sometimes in ring fusion, and most importantly, all the alkaloids are made up of polycyclic systems in their chemical structures. It is plausible that these common chemical structures contribute to the anti-coronavirus activity of these alkaloids.</p>
