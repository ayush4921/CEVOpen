 <italic>Strobilanthes cusia</italic> is a traditional medicine used in Myanmar, India, Thailand, and the southern parts of China [

 <italic>S. cusia</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In a study by Tsai and colleagues (2020), these compounds showed strong antiviral activity in reducing both the CPE and virus yield (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values are 1.52 μM and 2.60 μM for tryptanthrin and indigodole B, respectively) in HCoV-NL63-infected cells. In addition, strong viricidal activity was reported for tryptanthrin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.06 μM) and indigodole B (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.09 μM). The authors identified tryptanthrin as the key antiviral compound of 
 <italic>S. cusia</italic> leaf methanol extract with potent activity against HCoV-NL63 in a cell-type independent manner. Lastly, they reported that tryptanthrin interferes with the early and late stages of HCoV-NL63 in vitro replication, by blocking viral RNA synthesis as well as the activity of the papain-like protease 2 [
