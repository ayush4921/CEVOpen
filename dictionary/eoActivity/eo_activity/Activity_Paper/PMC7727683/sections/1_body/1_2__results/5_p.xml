<p>The bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids tetrandrine (TET), fangchinoline (FAN), and cepharanthine (CEP) are major compounds in 
 <italic>Stephania tetrandra</italic> and other related species of Menispermaceae; these alkaloids are known for their anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The antiviral activities of these alkaloids have also been widely studied. The alkaloid fangchinoline exhibits antiviral activity against HIV1 in MT-4 and PM1 cells [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Some studies using cepharanthine showed that its antiviral action against HIV1 is by inhibiting the process of virus entry into cells, reducing the fluidity of the plasma membrane [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]; through a synergic effect with a derivative tetrahydrotetramethylnaphthalene results in inhibition of the proliferation of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) [

 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], inhibits the infection of human macrophages by EV [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], and inhibits HSVI-induced keratitis in mice [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Moreover, cepharanthine hydrochloride inhibits the replication of the lamivudine-resistant HBV [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. A more recent study reported that several bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids block MERS-pseudovirus translocation through the endolysosomal system—which normally provides one pathway for cellular entry of MERS-CoV—by inhibiting NAADP-evoked Ca

 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-05496" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In addition, tetrandrine, fangchinoline, and cepharanthine inhibit HCoV-OC43-induced cell death in the early stage of infection in human lung cells and reduce virus replication by suppressing the expression of viral S and N proteins [
