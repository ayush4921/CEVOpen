<p>None of the evaluated plant extracts demonstrated concentration-dependent increase in the number of His

 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). The average TA98 revertants ranged from 6.4â€“29.0, while the TA102 revertants ranged from 109.7â€“284.3. The corresponding average number of TA98 and TA102 revertants in the negative control were 19.1 and 145.2, respectively. The evaluated extracts were therefore non-mutagenic against TA98 and TA102 tester strains [
