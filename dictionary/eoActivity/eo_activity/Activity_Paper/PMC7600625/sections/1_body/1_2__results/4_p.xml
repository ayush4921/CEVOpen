<p>The UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed that 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> contained varying quantities of both hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids (

 <xref rid="plants-09-01331-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Overall, the most abundant hydroxybenzoic (
 <italic>p</italic>-hydroxybenzoic acid, 374.55 µg/g DW) and hydroxycinnamic (caffeic acid, 266.37 µg/g DW) acids were detected in the leaves. The leaves also contained the least abundant hydroxycinnamic acids (sinapic acid, 0.08 µg/g DW), while the bark contained the least abundant hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid, 0.1 µg/g DW).
