<p>At a ratio of 10:1 (10 mL/g), dry powdered samples were mixed with different solvents (water, methanol = MeOH, dichloromethane = DCM, and petroleum ether = PE) and stirred in a rotary shaker (Edmund B체hler, T체bingen, German) for 12 h at 150 rpm at room temperature, after which they were sonicated for 1 h on ice (Julabo GMBH, Seelbach, Germany). Organic solvent extracts were filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper under vacuum and later concentrated using a rotary evaporator (Heldolph vv 2000, Germany) at 35 째C. Concentrated organic solvent extracts were transferred into glass pill vials and air-dried in front of a fan. All water extracts were freeze-dried. The resultant dried extracts were kept in closed glass pill vials in the dark at 10 째C until required for further use. </p>
