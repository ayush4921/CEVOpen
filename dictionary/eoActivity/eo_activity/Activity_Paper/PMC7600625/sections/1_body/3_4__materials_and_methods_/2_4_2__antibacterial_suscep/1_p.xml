<p>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of aqueous and organic solvent extracts obtained from the plant were determined using 96-well microplates (Greiner Bio-one, Germany) as previously described [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01331" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Dried plant extracts were re-suspended in 2% dimethylsulfoxide (DSMO, 10 mg/mL) after which they were serially diluted (2-fold) with sterile distilled water. Neomycin (1 mg/mL) was used as a positive control. Sterile distilled water and 2% DSMO were included as the negative controls for each bacterial strain (
