<p>GC-MS analysis of the four fractions was carried out at the School of Chemical and Physical Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, using a Shimadzu QP-2010 SE Gas Chromatography coupled with (an Agilent) 5973 Mass Selective detector and driven by Agilent Chemstation software. A Zebron ZB-5MSplus capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter, 0.25 µm film thickness) was used. The carrier gas was ultra-pure helium at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and a linear velocity of 37 cm/s. Three microlitres of the sample were injected into the column with the injector temperature set at 250 °C. The initial oven temperature was at 60 °C which was programmed to increase to 280 °C at the rate of 10 °C per min with a hold time of 3 min at each increment. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode at 70 eV and electron multiplier voltage at 1859 V. Other MS operating parameters were as follows: ion source temperature 230 °C, quadrupole temperature 150 °C, solvent delay 4 min and scan range 50–700 amu. The compounds were identified by direct comparison of the mass spectrum of the analyte at a particular retention time to that of reference standards found in the 2011 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library. The area percentage of each component was calculated by comparing its average peak area to the total area obtained. </p>
