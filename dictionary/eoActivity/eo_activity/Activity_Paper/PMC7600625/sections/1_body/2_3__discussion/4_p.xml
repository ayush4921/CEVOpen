<p>The antibacterial compounds present in 
 <italic>Protea caffra</italic> worked in different synergistic combinations or individually to affect the observed bacteriostatic properties. Different groups of phenolic compounds often exhibit unique antibacterial mechanisms. Gallic and ferulic acids for example, exert their bactericidal effects by binding to and rupturing bacterial cell membranes [

 <italic>P</italic>-coumaric acid also causes intracellular material leakages and interferes with bacterial DNA replication and gene expression [
