<p>The plant material was air-dried at room temperature in the shadow and ground to a fine powder, later used for extractions. In order to extract volatile compounds, 150 g of the plant powder were subjected to hydro-distillation for 3 h, after liquid-liquid extraction with hexane and chloroform, successively. The two volatile fractions VF1 (hexane) and VF2 (chloroform) were stored at 4 Â°C in sealed brown glass vials until uses.</p>
