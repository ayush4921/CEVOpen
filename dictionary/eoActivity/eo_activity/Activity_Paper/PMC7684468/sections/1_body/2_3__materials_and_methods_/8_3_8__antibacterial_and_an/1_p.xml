<p>Microorganisms used for this study were selected as follow: three yeast strains (
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> ATCC 90028, 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> ATCC 66029, and 
 <italic>Candida glabrata</italic> ATCC 64677), two Gram-positive bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococeus aureus</italic> ATCC 25923 and 
 <italic>Salmonella Typhimurium</italic> ATCC 1408) and two Gram-negative bacteria (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 35218 and 
 <italic>Enterococus feacolis</italic> ATCC 29212). Cultures for antibacterial and antifungal tests were grown on Mueller-Hinton and Sabouraud chloramphenicol plates, respectively, prepared from commercial powder, at 37 °C for 24 h. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem extracts and volatile fractions were determined in RPMI 1640 medium solution (with L-glutamine/without sodium bicarbonate) supplemented with glucose (2%), using the broth microdilution method in a 96-well and using a colorimetric assay with resazurin redox indicator for the viability testing. Each sample was dissolved in 10% DMSO to obtain a primary concentration of 200 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, and then a serial two-fold dilution of the extracts and volatile fractions was realized. Overnight cultures of strains were inoculated to yield a final concentration of 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU. Standard drugs, Amphotericine b and Gentamicin, were used as positive references. The MICs were considered as the lowest concentration giving an inhibition of the pathogen strains. The MBCs and MFCs concentrations were determined by seeding 10 µL from all MICs wells onto Muller-Hinton and Sabouraud chloramphenicol plates, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. Data from three replicates were evaluated and modal results were calculated.
