<p>The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts and volatiles fractions obtained from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem were evaluated against seven microorganisms including two Gram-negative bacteria, two Gram-positive bacteria, and three human pathogenic yeasts (
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp.). The highest antimicrobial activity was observed with the volatile fraction VF1 against the Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with a minimum bactericide concentration (MBC) at 0.75 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> followed by VF2 against 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> with MBC at 0.87 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05032-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>). Only VF1 showed an antifungal effect on all tested strains with a minimum fungicide (MFC) at 1 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>. However, a moderate anti-microbial activity observed against the Gram-positive bacteria 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with MBC at 1.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for the volatile fraction VF1. Major compounds of VF1 were Tetradecene and (E)-
 <italic>β</italic>-ionone. 
 <italic>β</italic>-ionone derived chalcones were described as potent antimicrobial agents [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Tetradecene was reported from Gynura segetum’s leaf extracts to be effective against a large panel of pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. 1,8-cineole [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], most abundant in VF2, was described to possesses an important antimicrobial effect against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>,
