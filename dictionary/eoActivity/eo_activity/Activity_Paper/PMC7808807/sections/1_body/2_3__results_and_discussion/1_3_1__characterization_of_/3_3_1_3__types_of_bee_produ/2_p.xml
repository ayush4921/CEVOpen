<p>Among the famously used hive products, honey is the one that leads the list; hence, it is known that the beekeeping sector is essentially interested in the production and marketing of honey, in the second position is the bee wax, a very high percentage of beekeepers who have been surveyed (83.30%) produce bee wax, and the majority of the production is for hive recycling purposes, in the third place, we find the fresh bee pollen, followed by propolis in fourth. Since the surveyed population has a relatively high educational level, we observed that they are very well aware of the nutritional and therapeutic values of the other hive products such as bee pollen and especially fresh bee pollen, propolis, royal jelly, bee bread, and bee venom, but these last three products are poorly produced in the Fez-Meknes region and even throughout the Moroccan territory due to the difficulties encountered in the production and harvesting of these products. For instance, the royal jelly implies the breeding of the queens and requires precise techniques to keep its therapeutic value, which is very sensitive to temperatures above 4°C [
