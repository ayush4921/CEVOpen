  <p>Pectolinarin commands ERSS(Endoplasmic Reticulum-Stress Sensors). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The cells were dealt with pectolinarin (10 and 50 μg/ml) for 24 h. The gene expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors of ATF6, PERK and IRE1 was performed by RT-PCR. (B) Western blotting was performed using anti-eIF2-α antibody/eIF2-α-P antibody, anti-ATF6 monoclonal antibody against cells treated with pectolinarin (10 and 50 μg/ml) for 24 h, respectively. The resulting bands (fragmented ATF6 and phosphorylated eIF2-α) were estimated by Image J software (version 1.48). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> RT-PCR was performed against mRNAs of XBP1. The following PCR product was moreover digested by 
   <italic>Pst</italic>I to disclose a restriction site that was lost following XBP1 splicing under endoplasmic reticulum stress. The following XBP1 cDNA products were disclosed on a 2% agarose gel. Unspliced XBP1 mRNA made the two lower bands which were indicated by arrows (upper, 290 bp and lower, 183 bp). The spliced XBP1 mRNA pointed out by a bold arrow. ATF6, activating transcription factor; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK); IRE1, inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1); eIF2-alpha-P, phosphorylated form of translation initiation factor eIF2α; XBP1, X-box tying protein 1, Tu, tunicamycin, respectively.
