<p>Following the treatment with pectolinarin, the PC12 cells were dissolute in 100 μl 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) having 10 mM EDTA and 0.5% Triton X-100. After centrifugation for 5 min at 16,000 x g, the supernatant dealt with RNase A and proteinase K (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Eventually, 20 μl of 5 M NaCl and 120 μl isopropanol were put together and preserved with ice for 1 h. Following centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 x g, the DNA pellets were dissolved in 20 μl TE buffer. The DNA samples were stuffed onto a 0.7% agarose gel and noted using a UV source after ethidium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA) staining. After treatment with pectolinarin, the PC12 cells were developed in incubator for 30 min with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) loading dye and washed in ice-cold 1X PBS. After following staining for 10 min, the stained cells were screened by employing a fluorescence microscope (Axio Scope A1; Zeiss GmbH, Germany) at 340 nm.</p>
