<p>In conclusion, pectolinarin dealings obviously caused apoptosis through the expression of ERSS(Endoplasmic Reticulum-Stress Sensors) in the PC12 cells. However, at this time, it is difficult to adequately explain the signaling through endoplasmic reticulum stress triggering several regulators connected with the apoptosis pathway for the extended endoplasmic reticulum stress. It is thought that better understanding of the biological mechanisms focusing pectolinarin-caused apoptosis may be helpful and useful in the diagnosis and treatment of apoptosis-related diseases based on new natural medicinal products.</p>
