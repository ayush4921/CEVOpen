<p>We have determined the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors under same experimental conditions as described in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>. As showed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>, dealing the PC12 cells with 50 μM pectolinarin for 24 h increased ATF6 mRNA expression up to 1.6 times, PERK expression is 1.7 times and IRE1 expression is 1.4 times compared to those of the control, respectively. This result suggests that although pectolinarin does not regulate endoplasmic reticulum chaperone expression directly, it regulates the gene expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress sensors. ATF6 fragmentation by pectolinarin treatment was increased about 2 times compared with its control, and phosphorylation of eIF2α was increased 2.5 times (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, there was a little change in the XBP1 mRNA uncleavaging that means endoplasmic reticulum stress level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). In summary, it has been shown that pectolinarin treatment on PC 12 cells actively regulates endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor activity through both the ATF6 fragmentation and eIF2α phosphorylation rather than the regulation of ER chaperone gene expression.
