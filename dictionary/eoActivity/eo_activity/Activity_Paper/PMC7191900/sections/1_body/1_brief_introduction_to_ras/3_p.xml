<p>As a precursor protein of cytoplasm, Ras protein needs some modifications including prenylation, proteolysis, carboxymethylation, and palmification to exert all biological activities

 </xref>. The prenylation of the Ras protein requires three enzymes in turn: farnesyltransferase (FTase), geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTaseI), and geranylgeranyl transferase II (GGTaseII). Farnesyltran is the first step in post-translational modification of Ras. Therefore, the search for suitable FTIs is an important research direction to inhibit Ras protein and thus inhibit the occurrence of cancer.
