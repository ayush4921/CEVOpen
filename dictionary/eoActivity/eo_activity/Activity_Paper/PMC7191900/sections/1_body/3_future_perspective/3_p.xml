<p>It is worth noting that half of the compounds listed here with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values less than 1 μM are from belong to polycarboxylic acid compounds. The importance of polycarboxylic acid compounds in the inhibition of FTase activity was demonstrated. The structural similarity of these polycarboxylic acid compounds to FPP may be the main reason for their effective FTase inhibitory activity. In this review, compounds containing chain groups are similar to FPP, which can compete with FPP to inhibit FTase. However, FPP is also substrate of other enzymes, FPP-competitive inhibitors may inhibit the physiological function of them, causing some harm to the human body. As far as the current results concerned, natural products FTIs are worthy of further research as a new class of low toxicity, safe, and effective anticancer drugs. Apart from further structural modifications based on the existing structural types to enhance the selectivity and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of FTIs, a rich library of natural compounds is also worthy of attention. In recent years, many FTIs of novel structures have been found in natural products. It is expected that FTIs will be a promising field of research for new anticancer drugs, and will provide more new options for the clinical treatment of malignant tumours.
