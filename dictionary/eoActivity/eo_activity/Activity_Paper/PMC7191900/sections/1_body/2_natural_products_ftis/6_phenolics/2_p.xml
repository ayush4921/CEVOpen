<p>The phenolic compound refers to a compound having a hydroxyl group on an aromatic hydrocarbon and is classified into monohydric phenol and polyhydric phenol. This review summarises phenolic compounds isolated from several fungi with a small IC
 <sub>50</sub> difference and similar inhibitory abilities against FTase. After observing of the structure and activity of the compounds, it was found that compounds 
 <bold>96</bold> and 
 <bold>97</bold> had more complicated structures than other phenolic compounds and were less effective in inhibiting FTase (
