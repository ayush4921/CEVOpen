 </xref> extracted two marine meroterpenoids, thiaplidiaquinones A (
 <bold>31</bold>) and thiaplidiaquinones B (
 <bold>32</bold>), which could induce the apoptosis of Jurkat cells, from the ascidian 
 <italic>Aplidium conicum</italic>. Compound 
 <bold>31</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.78 and 0.74 μM) and Compound 
 <bold>32</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.22 and 3.04 μM) have inhibitory effects against both human and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> FTase. Harper et al.

 </xref> obtained the corresponding dioxothiazine isomers (
 <bold>33</bold>) and (
 <bold>34</bold>). Compounds 
 <bold>31</bold>, 
 <bold>33</bold>, and 
 <bold>34</bold> were identified to be potent inhibitors of human and 
 <italic>T. brucei</italic> FTase, and the IC50 values are in the range of nM. Compounds 
 <bold>33</bold> and 
 <bold>34</bold> have moderate inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, and compound 
 <bold>33</bold> also has moderate antiproliferative activity against melanocyte cell lines. To further investigate the structure–activity relationship of thiaplidiaquinones (
 <bold>31</bold>–
 <bold>34</bold>), Cadelis et al. synthesised a series of derivatives (
 <bold>35</bold>–
 <bold>50</bold>), among which 17 derivatives have inhibitory activity against FTase. The test results show that the derivatives with the farnesyl side chain (
 <bold>39</bold>–
 <bold>42</bold>) have stronger FTase inhibitory activity than the derivatives with the isoprene side chain (
 <bold>35</bold>–
 <bold>38</bold>)
