 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>As one of the worldâ€™s five terminally ills, tumours can cause important genetic dysfunction. However, some current medicines for tumours usually have strong toxic side effects and are prone to drug resistance. Studies have found that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) extracted from natural materials have a good inhibiting ability on tumours with fewer side effects. This article describes several FTIs extracted from natural materials and clarifies the current research progress, which provides a new choice for the treatment of tumours.</p>

    <p>When Ras gene is activated, it becomes an oncogene with oncogenic activity. Ras protein plays a crucial role in cancer cells. FTase is the first step to activate Ras protein.</p>

    <p>FTIs not only have anti-tumour effects, but also makes great contribution to the treatment of plasmodium falciparum, parasitic diseases and progeria.</p>

    <p>There are still some problems with FTIs, but natural products FTIs are worthy of further research as a new class of low-toxic, safe and effective anticancer drugs.
