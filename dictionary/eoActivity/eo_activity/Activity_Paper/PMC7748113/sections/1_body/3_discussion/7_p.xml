<p>The RP assay of the extract, which may serve as a reflection of its antioxidant activity, was determined using a Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> reduction assay, whereby the yellow color of the test solution changes to various shades of green and blue, depending on the RP of the sample. The RP of three extracts was significantly (

 <italic>A. repens</italic> (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which resulted in the higher RP of this extract in comparison with methanol and ethanol extracts. As per this significant correlation, phenolic compounds may contribute to the RP of extracts. However, their chemical structure could influence the antioxidant activity. Polymeric polyphenols showed higher antioxidant capacity compared with simple monomeric phenols. Furthermore, the number and position of hydroxyl groups in the benzene ring affected the antioxidant potential
