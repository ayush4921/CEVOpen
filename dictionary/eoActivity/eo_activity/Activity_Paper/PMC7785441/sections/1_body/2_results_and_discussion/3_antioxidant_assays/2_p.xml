 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). It was observed that flower extracts of B. Variegata has produced strong antioxidant activities (BVM: IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 21.93 ± 0.43, 47.25 ± 0.39 and 47.88 ± 0.16 µg/ml) (DVC: IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 34.85 ± 0.33, 48.2 ± 0.61 and 59.02 ± 0.80 µg/ml) against DPPH, ABTS and hydrogen peroxide antioxidant assay. BV extracts were more active against DPPH scavenging assay. Antioxidant potential of medicinal plant is thought to be accredited by the presence of their active constituents like flavonoids and phenols. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species or insufficient antioxidant resistance induces oxidative stress in human body and cause degenerative diseases. Antioxidant activity control series of mechanisms e.g. scavenges free radicals, decomposes peroxides, reducing capacities, prevent binding of transition metal ions and inhibit chain initiation. The achieved results in the present study concord the previous findings described for the root and stem analysis of
