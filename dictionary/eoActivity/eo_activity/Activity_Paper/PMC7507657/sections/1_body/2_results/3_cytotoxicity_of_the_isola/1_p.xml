 <bold>Compound 1</bold> showed concentration-dependent toxicity to HeLa, MRC5 and MRC5-SV2 cells following 24 h exposure to varying concentrations up to 100 μg/ml (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> obtained for 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> was 71.45 μg/ml (76 μM), 52.24 μg/ml (56 μM) and 84.33 μg/ml (90 μM) in HeLa, MRC5-SV2 and MRC5 cells respectively; the selectivity index for 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold>, which is the ratio of its IC
 <sub>50</sub> in MRC5 and MRC5-SV2 cells, was calculated as 1.61. Doxorubicin, used as a standard anti-cancer drug, also demonstrated concentration-dependent toxicity to HeLa, MRC5 and MRC5-SV2 cells following 24 h exposure to it (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.65, 31.70 and 40.64 μM in HeLa, MRC5-SV2 and MRC5 cells respectively. The selectivity index for doxorubicin was 1.28.
