<p id="Par38">As shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, following 3 h and 6 h exposure of HeLa to 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> and doxorubicin, 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> demonstrated concentration- and time-dependent toxicity, which was significant at 50 and 100 μg/ml, while doxorubicin showed no toxicity at the two time points. This observation establishes a key difference in the cytotoxicity time-course profiles of 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> and doxorubicin. While 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> rapidly induced cytotoxicity, initiated from as early as 3 h following exposure of cells to it and progressively increasing up to 24 h, doxorubicin’s toxicity revealed a much-slower time-course, with significant, concentration-dependent toxicity only observed after 24 h exposure to it. For drug discovery and development purposes, this property of 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> could make it uniquely promising, as a shorter time of exposure to an anti-cancer agent could ensure less damage to normal cells and less side effects.
