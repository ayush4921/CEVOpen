<p id="Par41">It should be noted that pentagalloylglucose has been generally reported to be an antioxidant, with some reports establishing it as a potent antioxidant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and potentially useful in chemoprevention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], thus suggesting it should be relatively non-cytotoxic, which might appear to contrast with observations of its cytotoxicity and, at high concentrations, its pro-oxidant effect (induction of oxidative stress) in cancer cells reported in this paper. However, consistent with our findings, previous studies undertaken using cell cultures, as we did, have shown that pentagalloylglucose could be involved in eliciting anti-cancer effects through mechanisms including pro-apoptosis, anti-proliferation, anti-angiogenesis, anti-metastasis and inhibition of glycoprotein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Besides, Kantapan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] recently reported that extracts containing pentagalloylglucose could promote intracellular ROS production and induce apoptosis in cancer cells, although it was not demonstrated whether those effects could be solely or partly attributed to the presence of pentagalloylglucose, as two other constituents were found to be present in the extract. Lin et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], who used cultured cells (HepG2, 293T, HEp-2, MRC-5) grown and treated in conditions very similar to ours (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 24 h treatment, MTT assay), showed pentagalloylglucose lacked toxicity to the cells up to 50 μM but did not investigate higher concentrations.
