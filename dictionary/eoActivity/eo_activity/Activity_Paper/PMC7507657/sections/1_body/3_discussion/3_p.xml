<p id="Par42">It is generally recognised that some antioxidant molecules are capable of exhibiting an antioxidant-pro-oxidant switch, depending on a number of factors, including the redox state of the cellular environment or the nature of the pathology in question. We reckon that, while pentagalloylglucose is generally antioxidant in nature, it could, under certain conditions, especially in cancer cells and at high concentrations, generate ROS, consistent with a pro-oxidant effect, and induce cytotoxicity. While our work showed that pentagalloylglucose concentrations above 25 μM but below 100 μM could induce rapid cytotoxicity in cancer cells, there was no evidence that the cytotoxicity involved significant ROS, and it is thus reasonable to consider it to be independent of ROS, meaning other toxic mechanisms were involved. However, at high concentrations (100 μM and above), the toxicity is suggested to result from, or cause, substantial ROS. Overall, we suggest a dynamic and complex scenario in which cell toxicity, where it occurs, is independent of, results from, causes, or is synergistic with, elevated ROS levels.</p>
