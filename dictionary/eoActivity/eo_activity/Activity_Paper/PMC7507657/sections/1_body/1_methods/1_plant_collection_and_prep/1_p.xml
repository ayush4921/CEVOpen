<p id="Par24">Leaves of 
 <italic>A. occidentale</italic> were collected at Road 9 Junction of the Senior Staff Quarters, Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria, in July 2015. The vegetative part was identified by Mr. Ogunlowo A.A. of the Department of Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Nigeria, and a voucher specimen (Voucher no. FPI 2107) was deposited in the IFE Herbarium. The leaves were air-dried and milled to give 2.5 kg of powdered material. The powdered leaves were extracted with 96 % ethanol. The extract was filtered and concentrated 
 <italic>in-vacuo</italic> at 40
 <sup>0</sup>C to give 289 g (11.56 % w/w) of the crude ethanolic extract. The crude extract was dissolved in 200 mL of water and partitioned successively between water and 
 <italic>n-</italic>hexane (3 x 500 mL), water and ethyl acetate (8 x 250 mL) and water and 
 <italic>n-</italic>butanol (4 x 200 mL) to give 
 <italic>n-</italic>hexane (26.2 g), ethyl acetate (15.8 g), 
 <italic>n-</italic>butanol (14.6 g) and aqueous (210.4 g) fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction (previously determined to be active against some cancer cell lines) (15.1 g) was dissolved in methanol and adsorbed on silica gel and allowed to dry. The dry powder was packed into a column of silica gel (30 x 3 cm) and eluted in descending mode with varied proportions of solvent of increasing polarity from 100% hexane to 100% ethyl acetate to 50% methanol. The fraction that was eluted with 100% ethyl acetate was further subjected to repeated fractionation on silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 to give 
 <bold>Compound 1</bold> (0.188 g).
