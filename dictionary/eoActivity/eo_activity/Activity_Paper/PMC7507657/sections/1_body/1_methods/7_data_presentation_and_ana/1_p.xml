<p id="Par31">For the viability assay data, the average viability of the negative control culture was taken as 100% and the average viability for every treatment was normalised to it. Values are indicated as Mean Â± SEM (standard error of the mean). Statistical analyses were conducted with the GraphPad Prism Software (Version 8.0.1) (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA). To assess statistically significant differences between means, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by a
