<p>A solution of 6 M NaOH (5 mL) was added to a solution of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (50.0 mg, 0.130 mmol) in methanol (2 mL) and THF (2 mL) at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was brought to room temperature, the solvent was evaporated, and the residue was neutralized with 2 N HCl and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was concentrated, and the residue was dissolved in hexane and purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane/EtOAc (9.5:0.5) as an eluent, resulting in 59.0 mg of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (yield 83%). Colorless oil; 1H NMR (CDCl
