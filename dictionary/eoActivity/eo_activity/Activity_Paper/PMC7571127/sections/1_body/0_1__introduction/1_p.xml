<p>Traditional medicinal plants are promising sources of naturally occurring drugs, especially of natural products targeting membrane proteins, including membrane receptors and enzymes. Daurichromenic acid (DCA), a meroterpenoid consisting of orsellinic acid and sesquiterpene moieties, was isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Rhododendron dauricum</italic>, a plant growing in the wild in northern China, eastern Siberia, and the Japanese island of Hokkaido [

 <italic>Rhododendron</italic> has been used in traditional Chinese medicine, with the medicinal herb “Manshanfong” used as an expectorant and to treat various diseases, such as acute and chronic bronchitis [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] activity, suggesting that DCA may be a medicinal resource in the development of derivatives that can act as novel drugs to treat these conditions. Although DCA exhibits various pharmacological activities, including the induction of cell death in cultured cells [
