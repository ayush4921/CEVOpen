<p>The ability of DCA and its derivatives to inhibit the SMS isozymes SMS1 and SMS2 was evaluated using a cell lysate assay and the fluorescent substrate C6-NBD (4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-Cer. DCA (
 <bold>1</bold>) and compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, and 
 <bold>7</bold> showed relatively moderate inhibitory activities, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7, 17, 9, and 4 μM, respectively, for SMS1, and 4, 10, 7, and 5 μM, respectively, for SMS2 (

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These findings indicated that the methyl esters of DCA derivatives, compounds 
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, and 
 <bold>5</bold>, were inactive in these assays. Thus, the carboxylic acid group of DCAs are essential moieties for their inhibition of SMSs. However, the SMS has not been succeeded in its crystallization. Therefore, a direct comparison with the previously isolated SMS inhibitor ginkgolic acid [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] has been examined. The chemical similarity of ginkogolic acid to DCA, as it is a long alkyl chain and a carboxylic acid moiety in an aromatic ring, shows that these two inhibitors also have the same functional group participation to inhibit SMS. Further, a previous report [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] concerning the mode of action for Aβ aggregation inhibition for small molecules gave the insight that the crucial role of a hydrophobic-side hydrocarbon chain and an aromatic ring as well as its two hydrophilic functions causes significant interaction with the amyloid.
