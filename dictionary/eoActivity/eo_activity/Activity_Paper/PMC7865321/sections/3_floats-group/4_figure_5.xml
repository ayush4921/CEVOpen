  <p>Protective effect of GM-90432 in PTZ-induced ROS generation. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The intracellular ROS were stained with DCF-DA dye for 20 min. Fluorescence images of ROS generation in zebrafish larvae in the 4 experimental groups. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The relative fluorescence intensities of ROS levels in individual larvae were quantified. Values represent means Â± SEM of 10 samples. Significance between control and exposure groups is indicated by ***
