<p>Neurosteroids are endogenous steroids that act on the central nervous system (CNS). Neurosteroids affect neuronal function by binding to their respective intracellular receptors, which can then act as transcription factors to regulate gene expression [

 <sub>A</sub> receptor ion channels [

E2 has neuroprotective potential in neurodegenerative disease, and has been shown to contribute to the neuroprotective activity of anti-seizure drugs [
