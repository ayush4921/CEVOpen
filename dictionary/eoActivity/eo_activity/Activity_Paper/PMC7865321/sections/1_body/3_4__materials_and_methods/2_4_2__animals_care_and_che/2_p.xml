<p>Adult male fish were used in both neurotransmitter and neurosteroid analyses. Zebrafish embryos were obtained from natural mating, and healthy embryos were incubated in embryo medium refreshed daily until 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) at 28 °C. Only 5 dpf zebrafish larvae were used for survival and ROS assays. As it was previously reported that GM-90432 reached steady-state after 1 h exposure [

The experiments were conducted in 24 well plates (for larval fish) or 1 L tanks (for adult zebrafish), respectively.
