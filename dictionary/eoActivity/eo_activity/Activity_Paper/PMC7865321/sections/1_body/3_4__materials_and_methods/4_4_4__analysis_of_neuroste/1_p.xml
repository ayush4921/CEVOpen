<p>The brain samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 6) from 2 individual zebrafish were pooled to form a composite sample, and were prepared as previously described [

 <xref rid="B78-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], with some modification. Briefly, 10 µL of the ISs mixture was added to the samples to a concentration of 50 ng/mL, and then samples were homogenized in 1 mL of MeOH/acetic acid (99:1

 <italic>v</italic>). After an overnight extraction at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min, and the pellet was extracted twice with 1 mL of MeOH/acetic acid (99:1 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The organic phases were combined and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The samples were resuspended with 1 mL of MeOH/water (10:90 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The mixture was extracted with Oasis PRiME HLB SPE cartridges coupled to a peristaltic pump. After loading a sample onto a cartridge, the cartridge was washed with 1 mL of water and eluted twice with 1 mL of MeOH. The combined MeOH eluates were evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and then dissolved with 100 µL of MeOH. Finally, 5 µL of this solution was injected into the LC-MS/MS system.
