<p>For live imaging and quantification of ROS, fish were stained with H2DCFDA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 20 min, then washed twice with embryo medium. Zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in 0.016% Tricaine, and the brain regions were observed with a Lionheart FX automated microscope (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) running Gen5 Image Prime software (Ver. 3.08). The fluorescence intensities were quantified using Image J software. For measurement of survival rate, fish were visually monitored for morphology and heart beat (cardiac arrest) under a stereomicroscope (Leica Microsystems, S6E, GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).</p>
