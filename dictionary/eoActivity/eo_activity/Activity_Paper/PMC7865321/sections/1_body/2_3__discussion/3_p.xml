<p>In the present study, we focused on a neurochemical profiling-based approach to understand the anti-epileptic effects of GM-90432 in a PTZ-induced epileptic seizure zebrafish model. We examined the modulating effects of GM-90432 on a variety of neurotransmitters and neurosteroids in zebrafish brain tissue. Neurotransmitters and neuroactive amino acids are closely related to neural network and behavioral profiles, and imbalances in these neurotransmitters at the presynapse or postsynapse may contribute to neurological disorders such Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or seizure [

Therefore, five categories of neurotransmitters (amino acids, and cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic ligands) were quantitatively analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Among these molecules, we found that 5-HT, NM, and GABA levels were significantly altered, but GLN level was not significantly modulated in brain tissue of adult zebrafish by PTZ exposure, and these changes were markedly rescued by GM-90432 pretreatment (
