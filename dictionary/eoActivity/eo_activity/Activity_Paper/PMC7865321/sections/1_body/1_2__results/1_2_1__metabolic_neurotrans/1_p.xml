<p>To understand the mechanism of GM-90432-induced neuroprotection against PTZ-induced epileptic seizure, we focused on neurochemical metabolism in the brain tissue of zebrafish. First, adult zebrafish (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) were acutely exposed to 1 or 5 mM PTZ for 1 h in a 1 L tank. One micromolar PTZ was selected as the optimal concentration of PTZ that had no observable effect (NOEC) on fish’s survival and morphological alteration for 24 h compared to controls (data not shown). Next, 2 µM GM-90432 was optimized as a non-toxic concentration that did not induce any morphological malformation or death in adult zebrafish. Thereafter, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of GM-90432 against PTZ-induced neurotransmitter imbalance in adult zebrafish (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) according to experimental design (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01285">Table S1</xref>). A variety of neurotransmitter alterations in amino acid, cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic systems were quantified using LC-MS/MS in brain tissue (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijms-22-01285">Table S1</xref>). The PTZ-treated group (G3) showed various neurotransmitters alterations compared to the control group; acute exposure to PTZ for 1 h significantly decreased 5-HT (t

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005) and increased NM (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 4.323; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005) and GABA (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 4.625; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) levels in brain tissue, compared to the control group (G1). On the contrary, the GM-90432-treated group (G2) displayed increased 5-HT (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 2.790; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02) and decreased NM (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 2.350; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03) and GABA (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 2.975; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) levels compared to G1. GM-90432 pretreatment followed by exposure to PTZ for 1 h (G4) significantly alleviated PTZ-induced neurotransmitters alteration, as altered levels of 5-HT (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 4.946; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), NM (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 3.187; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005), and GABA (t
 <sub>(22)</sub> = 2.726; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.02) were significantly attenuated compared to G3 in the brain tissue of adult zebrafish. However, GM-90432-treated group and PTZ-treated group did not altered GLN level, compared to the control group (
