<p>To investigate alterations in metabolic neurosteroids induced by GM-90432, PTZ, or PTZ after pretreatment with GM-90432 compared to controls, the levels of neurosteroids in the brains of zebrafish were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (

The levels of E2, Prog, 5α-dihydroProg, and Allo-P that were reduced when exposed to PTZ were rescued by GM-90432 pretreatment (G4), and were not significantly different compared to G1. The levels of DHT increased by treatment with GM-90432 (G2) were still increased compared to the control group even after exposure to PTZ after treatment with GM-90432 (t

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.03), similar to the group exposed to PTZ. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test was performed to confirm significant differences in metabolic neurosteroid levels between groups (G1 to G4,
