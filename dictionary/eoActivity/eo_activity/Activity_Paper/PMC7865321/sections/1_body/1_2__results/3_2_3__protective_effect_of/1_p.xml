<p>We investigated the protective effect of GM-90432 against PTZ-induced ROS generation and death in zebrafish larvae. In a preliminary study, we determined the optimal concentration of PTZ in zebrafish larvae; among tested concentration, 5 mM PTZ demonstrated the highest ROS generation after 1 h exposure, and highest amount of larval death after 24 h exposure. Therefore, we performed two experiments using different exposure times, 1 h for ROS detection or 24 h for survival analysis. </p>
