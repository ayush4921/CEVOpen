<p>Prokaryotic leucyl-tRNA synthetase (pLeuRS) plays a crucial role in bacterial protein synthesis and has become one of the major targets for the development of antimicrobial therapeutics. In particular, boron-containing compounds have been investigated as LeuRS inhibitors by GlaxoSmithKline. GSK has been developing GSK3036656 (
 <bold>8</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f004">Figure 4</xref>) (other names, GSK656 and GSK070) as a pLeuRS inhibitor for the treatment of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection (MTBI), in-licensed from Anacor Pharmaceuticals. Notably, 
 <bold>8</bold> inhibited 
 <italic>Mtb</italic> LeuRS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.20 μM), showing in vitro antitubercular activity (
 <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv, MIC = 0.02 μM) with high selectivity over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic LeuRS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of &gt; 300 μM and 132 μM, respectively) [

 <bold>8</bold> exhibited remarkable PK profiles in mice (AUC
 <sup>PO</sup> [area under the curve of oral administration] = 2.94 h·μg/mL with ~100% BA [bioavailability], Cl [clearance] = 8.5 mL/min/kg, 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> = 3.6 h) and in vivo efficacy (ED
 <sub>99</sub> = 0.4 mg/kg) for MTB treatment in acute and chronic TB infection mouse models with superior tolerability (well-tolerated at 300 mg/kg). The preclinical data of 
 <bold>8</bold> showed that it had a tolerable therapeutic window based on a number of preclinical safety and risk assessment studies, as disclosed at the 26th ECCMID in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, in April 2016 [
 <xref rid="B72-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The human efficacious dose was predicted in the range of 0.5–2.7 mg/kg/day, which is lower than that of other antitubercular agents.
