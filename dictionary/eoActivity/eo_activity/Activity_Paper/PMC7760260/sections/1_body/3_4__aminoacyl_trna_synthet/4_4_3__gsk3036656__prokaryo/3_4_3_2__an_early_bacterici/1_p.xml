<p>In March 2019, an open-label, randomized, sequentially assigned, dose-escalation, phase IIa study (NCT03557281) was initiated to evaluate the bactericidal activity, safety, and tolerability of 
 <bold>8</bold> compared to RIFAFOUR e-275 (Sanofi-Aventis) in patients (expected 
 <italic>n</italic> = 80) with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis in South Africa [
 <xref rid="B74-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This study was designed to investigate the early bactericidal activity (EBA), safety, and tolerability of 
 <bold>8</bold> in four cohorts of subjects with rifampicin-susceptible tuberculosis. The primary objective of this dose-escalation study was to estimate the antituberculosis effect of 
 <bold>8</bold> by counting serial colony-forming units (CFUs) of MTB in sputum over 14 days. Subjects in each cohort will be treated with either 
 <bold>8</bold> or a standard-of-care (RIFAFOUR e-275) regimen in a 3:1 ratio. The duration of this study for an individual subject was planned to be 5 weeks: 1 week of screening, 2 weeks of treatment, and another 2 weeks of follow-up visit. The reporting of proof-of-concept data was delayed to the first half of 2021 due to the current COVID-19 outbreak [
