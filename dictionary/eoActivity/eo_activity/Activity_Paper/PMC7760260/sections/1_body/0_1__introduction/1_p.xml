<p>Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are a family of 20 essential enzymes that ligate amino acids to their corresponding tRNAs and translate the genetic code during protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The two-step catalytic reaction of ARSs involves the formation of an enzyme-bound aminoacyl-adenylate (AMP-aa) followed by the formation of an aminoacylated tRNA (tRNA-aa) by transferring the amino acid to the corresponding tRNA. This catalytic reaction of ARSs plays a pivotal role in protein synthesis, which is essential for the growth and survival of all cells (
