<p>Halofuginone (HF, 
 <bold>26</bold>), a well-known antifibrotic agent in preclinical and clinical studies, inhibits prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) activity [
 <xref rid="B10-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mechanistically, 
 <bold>26</bold> competitively binds to the proline-binding pocket of the catalytic site of ProRS and causes drug resistance due to the accumulation of proline [
 <xref rid="B33-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It is anticipated that the antifibrotic effect of 
 <bold>26</bold> would be diminished in fibrotic tissue because a higher concentration of proline is often observed in fibrotic tissue than in nonfibrotic tissue [
 <xref rid="B34-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this regard, Shibata et al. from Takeda Pharmaceuticals developed T-3833261 (
 <bold>27</bold>), a potent ATP competitive inhibitor of ProRS that does not bind to the proline-binding site [
 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The antifibrotic activity of 
 <bold>27</bold> was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. From the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-induced fibrotic assay, 
 <bold>27</bold> inhibited the expression of fibrotic markers, including α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and type I collagen (Col1a), by reducing mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3) expression in human skin fibroblasts. These results were directly correlated with the in vivo TGF-β-induced mouse model. The topical application of 
 <bold>27</bold> reduced the expression of fibrotic genes such as Col1a1, Col1a2, and α-SMA (
