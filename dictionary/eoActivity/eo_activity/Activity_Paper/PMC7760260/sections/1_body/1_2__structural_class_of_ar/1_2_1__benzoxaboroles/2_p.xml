<p>A recent example of the benzoxaborole class of inhibitors is the nitrophenyl sulfonamide-based benzoxaborole PT638; Si et al. investigated PT638 to determine its mode of action [
 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The finding that PT638 has potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) (MIC [minimum inhibitory concentration] of 0.4 μg/mL) and does not inhibit 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> LeuRS (
 <italic>Sa</italic> LeuRS) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> [the half maximal inhibitory concentration] &gt;100 μM) suggests the possibility that it has targets other than LeuRS. The selection for resistance to PT638 using MRSA and whole-genome sequencing of three colonies that showed MICs of ≥3.125 μg/mL resulted in three mutations in the LeuRS gene, including D343Y, G302S, and F233I, all of which are located within the editing domain of 
 <italic>Sa</italic> LeuRS, thereby confirming 
 <italic>Sa</italic> LeuRS as the target of PT638. A metabolism study of PT638 using MRSA cell lysate and a SAR (structure-activity relationship) study of PT638 analogs revealed that PT638 might be a prodrug that can be reduced to its amine analog PT662 mainly by nitroreductase NfsB in MRSA (
