<p>Considering the significant structural differences between cladosporin derivatives (
 <bold>11</bold>–
 <bold>19</bold>) and the newly found chromone derivatives (
 <bold>20</bold> and 
 <bold>21</bold>), Baragaña et al. analyzed the binding modes of cladosporin and 
 <bold>20</bold> by studying their X-ray co-crystal structure with 
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS1 (

 <xref rid="B29-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Cladosporin binds to 
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS1 within the ATP-binding pocket with the isocoumarin moiety occupying the same space as the adenine ring of ATP, and the tetrahydropyran system taking the same position as the ribose ring of ATP. The two phenolic hydroxy groups of cladosporin form hydrogen bonds with E332 and the NH of N339, while the carbonyl interacts with a highly coordinated conserved water molecule. Although 
 <bold>20</bold> binds with 
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS1 in the ATP-binding pocket in a similar manner to cladosporin, the bicyclic core is rotated 30° anticlockwise with respect to cladosporin. The chromone core stacks between F342, H338, and R559. The ring carbonyl forms an H-bond to the backbone NH of N339, mimicking the N1 of adenine and the O1 OH of cladosporin. The amide carbonyl H bonds to a highly conserved water molecule coordinated by the side chain of D558 and R559. The cyclohexyl moiety projects into a pocket formed by the side chains of R330, F342, and S344 and the backbone of L555 and G556. This pocket is completed by the substrate lysine and is similar to that occupied by the tetrahydropyran ring of cladosporin, except that the cyclohexyl ring probes deeper into the pocket [
