<p>Borrelidin is known as a potent inhibitor of threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) for malaria. However, its lack of selectivity against human ThrRS and high toxicity to human cells limit further development as a drug candidate. In this regard, Novoa et al. derived a series of borrelidin analogs that circumvent these potential problems by showing higher selectivity and lower cytotoxicity from minor structural changes in the carboxylic acid side chain [
 <xref rid="B30-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In particular, compound BC196 (
 <bold>23</bold>), which released rotational constraints by adopting linear carboxylic acid, and compound BC220 (
 <bold>24</bold>), which converted terminal carboxylic acid to pyridyl ethyl ester on the cylcopentane ring, showed improved selectivity against 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> over human HEK293 cells by 13,579-and 4048-fold, respectively. Considering that borrelidin exhibited 355-fold activity difference between 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and human HEK293 cells, selectivity was improved by 11â€“38-fold. From in vivo efficacy studies using a 
 <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic> 17XL-infected mouse model, 
 <bold>23</bold> and 
 <bold>24</bold> showed 100% survival over 20 days after drug treatment at 6 mg/kg per day. In particular, 
 <bold>24</bold> showed complete clearance of parasites in the blood at 6 mg/kg per day, 80% survival, and ~3% parasitemia at 0.25 mg/kg per day. It is also interesting that 
 <bold>24</bold> was not cleaved to borrelidin by esterase, as determined in time course experiments with infected red blood cells (RBCs) over 27 h, suggesting that the biological effect of 
 <bold>24</bold> is not due to its conversion to borrelidin by RBCs or plasmodial esterases (
