<p>Another medicinal chemistry campaign to develop a new antimalaria and anti-cryptosporidiosis drug targeting 
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS1 and 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum (Cp)</italic> LysRS was continued by Baragaña et al. using cladosporin as a starting point [
 <xref rid="B29-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Its low druggability due to high metabolic instability was optimized by replacing the isocoumarin core with the chromone scaffold connected to a metabolically stabilized cyclohexane ring with an amide linker, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>21</bold> was active against both 
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.015 μM, luciferase ATP consumption assay) and whole-cell bloodstream 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> [the half maximal effective concentration] = 0.27 μM) and was selective compared with 
 <italic>human (Hs)</italic> LysRS (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.8 μM). The pharmacokinetic properties were optimized by stabilizing the metabolically labile cyclohexyl ring and blocking the point of potential hydroxylation of the phenyl group in the chromone core. As a result, compound 
 <bold>21</bold> showed good systemic exposure with excellent oral bioavailability (
 <italic>F</italic> = 100%) and a moderate half-life (
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub> = 2.5 h). In vivo efficacy was evaluated using a NODscidIL2Rγnull mouse (SCID) model and doses up to 40 mg/kg (po [per os, oral administration]), and it was found that a daily oral dose of ED
 <sub>90</sub> = 1.5 mg/kg (1.0–2.3 mg/kg) (estimated daily exposure in blood AUC
 <sub>ED90</sub> [area under the curve at ED
 <sub>90</sub>] = 11,000 ng·h/mL/d (6900–14,000 ng·h/mL/d)) reduced parasitemia by 90%. A high level of sequence identity within the active site region of 
 <italic>Pf</italic> LysRS1 and 
 <italic>Cp</italic> LysRS (96% identity) and an overall sequence identity of 47.7% and similarity of 64.6% across the entire protein was observed from the evaluation of compound 
 <bold>21</bold> against 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> both in vitro and in vivo. Compounds for cryptosporidiosis treatment must also have good exposure in the gastrointestinal tract and possibly also some systemic exposure since the parasite is found predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract with some in the biliary tract. In this regard, compound 
 <bold>21</bold> was worthy of consideration for cryptosporidiosis since 17% of the oral dose was found in mouse stools, suggesting that some biliary excretion had occurred. Compound 
 <bold>21</bold> showed efficacy in vivo in two different 
 <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> mouse models, NOD SCID gamma and INF-γ-knockout, at 20 mg/kg (po). However, the toxicity concern of 
 <bold>21</bold> at 50 mg/kg in mice (po) at which the blood concentration in mice reached the EC
 <sub>50</sub> for HepG2 cells limited further development. It is presumed that the toxicity is due to the inhibition of mammalian LysRS.
