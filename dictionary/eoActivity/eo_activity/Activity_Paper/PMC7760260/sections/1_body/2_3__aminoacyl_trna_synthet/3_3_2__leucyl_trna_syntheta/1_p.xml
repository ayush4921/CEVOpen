<p>Oxford Drug Design Ltd. reported a leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) inhibitor from 2-amino-
 <italic>N</italic>-(arylsulfinyl) acetamide compounds as an antibiotic agent [
 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-10-01625" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. They prepared a series of 46 compounds and their corresponding TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) salts, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01625-f014">Figure 14</xref>, of which the dissociation constants (
 <italic>K
  <sub>d</sub>
 </italic>) were measured for 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LeuRS by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and were found to range from 1.39 nM to 9130 nM. The antibacterial activity of the 26 compounds was evaluated in seven bacterial strains (ATCC25922, EFFLUX, B1966, ATCC700603, ATCC27853, B1931, and ATCC49247) with MIC values from 0.25 to &gt;64 mg/L, and compound 
 <bold>37</bold> was the most potent compound with MIC values in all strains (0.5, 0.25, 1, 1, 32, 2, and 4 mg/L, respectively) comparable to those of controls, such as ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, meropenem, and azithromycin. No compound showed any potential cytotoxic effects against the human hepatic cell line HepG2 (ATCC HB-8065).
