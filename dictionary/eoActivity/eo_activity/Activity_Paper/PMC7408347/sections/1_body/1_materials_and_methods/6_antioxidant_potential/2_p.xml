 <italic>T. simplex</italic> extracts with various polarities at different concentrations were estimated using a DPPH method. Antioxidant activity was tested using a modified DPPH assay [

In this study, five concentrations of 200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 μg/mL were used for all the extracts. First, 200 μg/mL of each crude extract was prepared by dissolving 2 mg powder of each extract in 10 mL methanol in six different test tubes. Then, 100 μg/mL concentration was prepared by diluting the 200 μg/mL concentration by removing 5 mL from each test tube to another six tubes; concentrations of 50, 25, and 12.5 μg/mL were prepared in the same manner. We then transferred 300 μL of each concentration into different labeled test tubes and added 900 μL of methanol to each to make the volume 1.2 mL. The mixture was mixed well, and 300 μL of 2.7 mM DPPH was added. Thereafter, the test tubes were incubated in the dark for 1.5 h, and absorbance of each sample was measured using a UV spectrometer at 517 nm [
