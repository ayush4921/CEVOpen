<p id="par0105">In this study, we evaluated the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of different crude extracts from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic>. In addition, we observed no antibacterial activity in most extracts at almost every concentration. The high antioxidant activity, crude extracts from 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> can be used as a natural, safe antioxidant medication to treat different ailments or as food supplements as well. The chosen plant is an unusual and uncommon plant and it is newly detected in the Arabian countries exactly in the Gulf countries as well. Yet, there is little scientific evidence available on the biological and phytochemical properties of 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic>. Consequently, additional 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biological and pharmacological studies will be required to confirm its antibacterial and antioxidant properties. More research is also required to classify and separate the bioactive compounds in 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic>, as well as their mechanisms of action.
