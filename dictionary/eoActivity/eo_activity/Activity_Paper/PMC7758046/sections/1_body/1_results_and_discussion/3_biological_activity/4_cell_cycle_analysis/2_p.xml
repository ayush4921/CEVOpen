<p>Most of cytotoxic compounds exert their anti-proliferative effect via arresting the cell cycle at certain phase. Flow cytometric analysis is considered a valuable method for determining and analysing the cell cycle parameters

 </xref>. In this study, compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> as the most potent derivatives were selected to explore their effect on cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis in HCT-116 cell line using the standard concentration of 10 µM. The effect on the cell cycle distribution was assessed by a DNA flow cytometry analysis and the cell cycle parameters were compared to untreated control cells in HCT-116 cells which had been incubated with 10 µM of 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> compounds and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>. The results revealed that, the percentage of HCT-116 cells at G2/M phase markedly increased from 15.44% to 50.44% and 46.85% after incubation with compound 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold>, respectively. On the other hand, the percentage of HCT-116 cells at G1 phase decreased from 54.38% in control to 21.78% for compound 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 24.57% for compound 
 <bold>Ve</bold> indicating that compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> induced cell arrest at G2/M phase. The percentage of cell death at pre-G1 phase for compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> was 16.54% and 18.22%, respectively.
