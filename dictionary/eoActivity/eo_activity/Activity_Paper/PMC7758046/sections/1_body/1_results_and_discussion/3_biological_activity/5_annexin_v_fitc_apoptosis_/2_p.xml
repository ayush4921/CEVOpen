<p>Double staining assay of annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) was used to investigate the mode of induced HCT-116 cell death when treated with the tested compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold>. HCT-116 cells were treated for 24 h with 10 µM from each tested compound. The results obtained are outlined in 
 <xref rid="t0004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. The percentage of apoptosis caused by the 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> compounds respectively was (16.54 and 18.22). We can also conclude that in early stage treatment of HCT-116 cells with 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> compounds results in an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells from 0.51% for control untreated cells to be 3.92 and 4.76, respectively. In late stage, the percentage of apoptotic cells was 10.32–11.35% compared to control (0.25%). The results indicate that the tested 
 <bold>Vd</bold> and 
 <bold>Ve</bold> induced apoptosis in HCT-116 cell line.
