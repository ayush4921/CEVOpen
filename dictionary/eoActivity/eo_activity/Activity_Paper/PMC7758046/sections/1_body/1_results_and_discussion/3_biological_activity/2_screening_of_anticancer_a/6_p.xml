<p>On the other hand, pyrazole analogues 
 <bold>VIa</bold>, 
 <bold>VIb</bold>, and 
 <bold>VIc</bold> showed promising cytotoxicity towards a variety of cancer cell lines. Compound 
 <bold>VIa</bold> bearing benzonitrile moiety exhibited a weak growth inhibition against several cancer cell lines as it displayed cell growth promotion for leukaemia SR (94.43%; cell growth inhibition: 5.57%), colon cancer HT29 (87.83%; cell growth inhibition: 12.17%), colon cancer HCT-116 (85.83%; cell growth inhibition: 14.17%), and non-small cell lung cancer HOP-92 (83.18%; cell growth inhibition: 16.82%). In addition, it showed good inhibitory activity against many cancer cell lines with cell growth promotion for leukaemia K-562 (78.12%; cell growth inhibition: 21.88%), non-small cell lung cancer A549/ATCC (78.06%; cell growth inhibition: 21.94%), leukaemia CCRF-CEM (71.21%; cell growth inhibition: 28.79%), and non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H522 (69.51%; cell growth inhibition: 30.49%).
