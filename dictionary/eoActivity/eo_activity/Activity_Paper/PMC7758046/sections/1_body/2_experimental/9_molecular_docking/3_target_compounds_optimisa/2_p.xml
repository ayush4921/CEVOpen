<p>Using the MOE program builder interface, the tested compounds 
 <bold>Vd</bold>, 
 <bold>Ve</bold>, 
 <bold>Vf</bold>, 
 <bold>VIa</bold>, 
 <bold>VIb</bold>, and 
 <bold>VIc</bold> were created into a 3D model. The target structures were checked by 2D depiction and formal charges on atoms, and then a conformational search was conducted for the target compounds. All conformers were subjected to energy minimisation done with MOE until an RMSD gradient of 0.01 kcal/mol and an RMS distance of 0.1 Å with MMFF94X were automatically measured as a force-field and the partial charges. The database of target compounds was then saved as MDB file for use in the calculations for molecular docking.
