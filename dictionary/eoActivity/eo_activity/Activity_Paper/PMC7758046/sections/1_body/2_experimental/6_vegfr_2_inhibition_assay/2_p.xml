 <sup>®</sup> VEGF Receptor 2 Kinase Assay Kit). It includes active VEGFR-2 kinase (a biotinylated peptide substrate and a phospho-tyrosine antibody) for detection of the phosphorylated form of the substrate peptide. On a 96-well plate, a particular VEGFR-2 antibody was seeded and 100 µL of the normal solution or compound tested was applied, incubated at room temperature for 2.5 h and washed.
