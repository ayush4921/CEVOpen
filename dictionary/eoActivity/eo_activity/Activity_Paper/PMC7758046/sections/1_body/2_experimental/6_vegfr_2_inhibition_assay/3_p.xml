<p>Then, 100 µL of the prepared biotin antibody was added, incubated for an additional 1 h at room temperature and washed. Following, 100 µL of streptavidin solution was added at room temperature, incubated for 45 min and then, 100 µL of TMB substrate solution was applied and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, 50 µL stop solution was added and the absorption was measured at 450 nm instantly. The standard curve, the
