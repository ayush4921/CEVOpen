<p content-type="flushleft">Since 1970, global trends in nature’s contributions to people have declined for a majority of categories (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). We report global trends in nature’s contributions to people in three categories: Worse, Little Change, and Better. For each, the net global impact is reported based on available global studies and supported by the findings of the review papers assessed as part of the IPBES Global Assessment that reviewed and synthesized over 2,000 articles from scientific journals, along with reports and other authoritative sources (

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In many cases, trends differ regionally (indicated by hash marks 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Potential and realized contributions of nature, environmental condition, and impact on quality of life have different trends (columns in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>), even within any particular contribution of nature (rows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). We do not provide results across the types of contribution for habitat creation and maintenance of options; their influence on quality of life is felt through their role supporting other contributions of nature. As habitat and biodiversity decline, both habitat creation and maintenance of options also decline (
