<p>There are many distinct ways that nature contributes to quality of life, even within the relatively narrow types of contributions defined by IPBES. For example, materials used by people range from building materials to textiles, ornamental plants, and animals that serve as human companions. To synthesize this diverse information, we deliberated as a group, coming to consensus on indicators that were acceptably representative of major aspects of each category of contribution for each element of that contribution. In some cases, elements of a category of natureâ€™s contribution are so disparate, with diverging trends, that we report on multiple indicators.</p>
