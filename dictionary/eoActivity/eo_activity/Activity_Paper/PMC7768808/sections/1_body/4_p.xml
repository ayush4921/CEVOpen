<p>We find that these four related but distinct aspects of natureâ€™s contributions do not have the same trends over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). Potential contributions unambiguously declined in the majority of categories, reflecting the declines in nature itself over the past 50 y. Although realized contributions and impact on quality of life also declined for many categories, these declines are partly offset by changes in technology and in economic and social conditions. Half of the categories of contribution had unambiguous declines for impact on quality of life. We describe these trends in greater depth below.
