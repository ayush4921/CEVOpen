<p>Here, we synthesize the scientific literature to assess global trends in nature’s contribution to human quality of life over the past 50 y, a period for which global data are more readily available and over which there has been rapid economic growth with large-scale impacts on nature around the world. Our scoping review (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) was carried out as part of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Global Assessment (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). IPBES defined 18 categories of nature’s contribution to people, which include regulating, material, and nonmaterial contributions (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Although many of nature’s contributions are positive, negative impacts, such as when elephants trample crops or mosquitos spread disease, are also considered.
