<p>Generally, traditional healing is a gender-based practice, although in some communities both men and women are practitioners [

 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which was also the case in this study. Thai culture assumes that the traditional role of the man in a family is as a leader and primary breadwinner, so men are expected to provide for their families, while the woman care for the children. Traditional healers are very important in Thai society, so men always aspire for that position. Most people known to have substantial knowledge and experience with practicing traditional medicine are old [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Normally, the number of medicinal plants known by a healer increases with age and decreases with increasing number of years of formal schooling [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. What we found here is different from that general rule. The number of medicinal plant species known was not related to the age of the informant and older herbalists knew fewer medicinal plants than the younger ones. It could be that some herbalists treat only certain conditions such as cancer or postpartum conditions in women. Furthermore, some of them had experienced loss of memory because of their age, which suggests that the process of declining biocultural knowledge is a complex matter and is not only driven by young peoplesâ€™ lack of interest in learning from the older generation. As for the learning of medicinal knowledge, some healers reported that they learned about medicinal plants following their parents and grandparents when they gathered remedies in the forest when they were young, which was similar to what was found in a recent study of the Mien in northern Thailand [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01177" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The traditional knowledge of the interviewed healers had been transferred from their parents, but they also had other sources of knowledge such as friends or formal training. Apart from knowledge about plants, the traditional healers also knew about minerals and animals (snail, horn, bone) that formed part of the treatments as previously reported among other cultures [
