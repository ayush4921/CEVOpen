In countries with a GDP per capita similar to Poland, the number of people per pharmacy is much higher. For example, in Slovakia, there are approximately 3600 people, in the Czech Republic—approximately 3700 people, in Croatia—approximately 4000 people and in Hungary—approximately 4300 people per pharmacy. In eight other European countries, the number of inhabitants per pharmacy is twice or even three times higher than in Poland [
