<p>The drug reimbursement system, together with the definition of rigid margins and prices, is also strictly regulated in Poland [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-08751" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. According to the law, drugs with no over-the-counter (OTC) equivalent or drugs having an over-the-counter equivalent which must be used for 30 days, may be reimbursed. Prices of reimbursed drugs are the same throughout the country; the Reimbursement Act introduced fixed prices and fixed margins in the pharmacy channel. The reimbursement decision determines the official price and wholesale margins. Prices for full-price drugs, OTC drugs and the rest of the pharmacy assortment remain unregulated.
