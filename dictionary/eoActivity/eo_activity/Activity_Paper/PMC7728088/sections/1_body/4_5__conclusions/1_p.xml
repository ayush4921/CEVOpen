<p>Community pharmacies are one of the essential health care facilities in Poland. In recent years, changing legal regulations have resulted in the transformation of the pharmacy market. The effects of these changes were visible to both pharmacy owners and patients. Deregulation of the community pharmacy market in Poland before 2017 rapidly increased the number of pharmacies. This situation significantly reduced turnover, closed many individual pharmacies and increased the number of chain pharmacies. Also, despite the promises to improve Polesâ€™ access to pharmaceutical care services, the regulations have just contributed to the creation of new pharmacies, mainly in cities, which did not meet the assumed goal. Pharmacies began to perform mostly commercial roles, and restrictions on margins caused an increase in the sale of OTC drugs, cosmetics or dietary supplements.</p>
