 <sup>−</sup> from slow release fertilizer at different concentrations during the time is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Passing the time up to 200 h resulted in an increasing release of NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> from slow release fertilizer. Increasing the NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> concentration leads to increase of release rate over time. The highest (130 mM) amount of NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> released was observed in 150 mM slow release fertilizer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, NO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>−</sup> from the urea chemical fertilizer showed a maximum release (125 mM) within 1 to 2 h (data not shown).
