<p id="Par36">The data show the lower total concentration of heavy metals in studied soil sample than USEPA limits, which reported the 1.5, 200, 50, 200, and 400 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> for Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn respectively. So, in the present study, it can be mention that there is no risk of heavy metal pollution for
