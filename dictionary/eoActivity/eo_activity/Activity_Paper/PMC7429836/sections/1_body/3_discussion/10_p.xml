 <sup>âˆ’</sup> dosage in slow release fertilizer leads to significant increase of all anti-radical scavenging activities. Rhizomata cum radicibus extract of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> can entrap hydroxyl radicals. This antioxidant mechanism is described as elimination of free radicals and chelating metal ions
 <sup>

 </sup>. Effective compounds of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> are alkylamids, polysacharides, glicoproteins and chicoric acid. Chicoric acid is the main phenolic compound with antioxidant effect in 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic>. Phenolic compounds like caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid are the most efficient naturally occurring antioxidants. As the result of the presence of chicoric acid in leaf extraction of 
 <italic>E. purpurea</italic>, this species has the most antioxidant effect among all other

 <italic>E. purpurea</italic> extracts are echinacoside, chlorogenic acid, cynarin and caftaric acid. All of them are able affect the free radical production and lipid peroxidation
