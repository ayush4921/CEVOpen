<p id="Par37">By comparing these values with the contents of trace elements in different N fertilizer types (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>), it is apparent that the content of all heavy metals in used N fertilizers in present study are lower than their natural background in soils. Therefore, in soils receiving these fertilizers, heavy metals cannot be enriched. So, in present study, the main source of these trace elements are the soil and only the soil can supply these elements for the plant growth mainly. Inspite of micro nutrients, N content of different studied fertilizers was shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. Based on obtained results, urea (46% N) had higher NO

 <sup>−</sup> content followed by slow release fertilizer (32%). Different NO

 <sup>−</sup> fertilizers varied significantly in their N content that can affect the plant growth. However, NH

 <sup>+</sup> content in all N fertilizers changed in narrow range, so at the relatively constant NH

 <sup>−</sup> content affects the plant phytochemical properties.
