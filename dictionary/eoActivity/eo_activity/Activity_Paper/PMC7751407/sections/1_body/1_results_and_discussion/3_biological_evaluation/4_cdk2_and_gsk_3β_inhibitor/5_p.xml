<p>These results indicate the superiority of the bromo isatin 
 <bold>5d</bold> and the methoxy isatin 
 <bold>5f</bold> derivatives on both kinases (
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The methyl isatin derivative 
 <bold>5e</bold> shows a relatively less kinase inhibitory activity than its bromo 
 <bold>5d</bold> and methoxy 
 <bold>5f</bold> congeners on both kinases despite of its obvious potent cellular cytotoxicity which could be attributed to its probable further cytotoxic mechanisms besides CDK2/GSK-3Î² dual inhibition.
