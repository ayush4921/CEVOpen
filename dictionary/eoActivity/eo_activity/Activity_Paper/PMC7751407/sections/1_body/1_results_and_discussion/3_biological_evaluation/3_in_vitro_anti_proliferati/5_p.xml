<p>These results indicate the superior cytotoxic activity of the

 <sub>50</sub> range of 2.27–12.93 µM and 1.27–9.67 µM on MCF-7 and T-47D cell lines, respectively, which could be due to their better binding to the target kinases. Compounds 
 <bold>5d–f</bold> with Br, CH
 <sub>3</sub> and OCH
 <sub>3</sub> substituent on the isatin nucleus, respectively, showed the best cytotoxic activity (
