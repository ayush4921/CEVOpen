<p>Series 
 <bold>7</bold> showed moderate to weak cytotoxic activity on either or both cell lines, except for the 
 <italic>N</italic>-benzylisatin hybrid 
 <bold>7 h</bold> which showed a potent cytotoxic activity on both cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.32 and 1.72 µM on MCF-7 and T-47D, respectively. These results indicate that the 
 <italic>N</italic>-substitution at the isatin nucleus greatly affects the cytotoxic activity in the newly synthesised compounds mostly in a negative manner (
