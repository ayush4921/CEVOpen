 </xref>. The morphological markers of apoptosis in the breast cancer MCF-7 cell line were examined before and after treatment with the compounds of interest. Apoptosis assay depends on the translocation of the phosphatidylserine (PS) phospholipid to the cell surface in cells undergoing apoptosis which can be easily detected by staining with the fluorescent conjugate of annexin V followed by flow cytometry analysis. Simultaneously, MCF-7 cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) which could enter cells with damaged plasma membranes only. This enables the discrimination between early apoptotic cells (positive for PS, but negative for PI) from late apoptotic and necrotic cells (positive for both PS and PI).
