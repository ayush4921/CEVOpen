<p>Protein kinases (PKs) represent the fifth largest human protein family comprising 518 proteins

  <sup>3–5</sup>
 </xref>. PKs exert their functions through catalysing the transfer of the gamma-phosphate group of an ATP molecule onto a substrate protein hydroxyl group (substrate protein phosphorylation) accomplishing cellular signals transduction and amplification

 </xref>. According to the phosphorylated residue in the substrate protein, PKs are classified into tyrosine kinases (90 kinases) and serine/threonine kinases (385 kinases), with a small group of dual specificity kinases including MEK1 and MEK2 which could catalyse the phosphorylation of both tyrosine and threonine on target proteins
