<p>GSK-3, another serine/threonine protein kinase and an essential element of the WNT signalling pathway, contributes to several physiological processes ranging from gene expression to glycogen metabolism
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>42</sup>
 </xref>. GSK-3 has two isozymes α and β encoded by two independent GSK-3 genes
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>43–48</sup>
 </xref>. GSK-3β is known as the “multi-tasking kinase” due to its participation in several signalling pathways
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>49</sup>
 </xref>. Dysregulated activity of GSK-3β is associated with several diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, chronic inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, therefore, GSK-3β inhibition is a potential approach for the treatment of these diseases

 </xref>. GSK-3β is overexpressed in colon, pancreatic as well as breast cancers as it plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation and survival

 </xref>. The overexpression of GSK-3β correlates with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer

 </xref>, moreover, aberrant nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β in five human breast cancer cell lines and in 70% of human breast carcinomas was reported
