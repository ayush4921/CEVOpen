<p>These changes in intracellular and extracellular environments demonstrate potential physiologic distress (Bekkevold et al., 2013

One of these hormones is aldosterone, which causes a decrease in the sodium output from the proximal tubules, preserving plasma sodium and driving the maintenance of body fluid by cellular dehydration (Rowland et al., 2004
