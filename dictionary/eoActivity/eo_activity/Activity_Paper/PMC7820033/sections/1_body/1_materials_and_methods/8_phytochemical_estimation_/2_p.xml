<p id="p0075">Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and total tannin content (TTC) of the date extracts were determined using Folin–Ciocalteu's reagent using gallic acid, quercetin and tannic acid as standards, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].’ The results of TPC, TFC and TTC contents were calculated from standard curves and expressed as gallic acid equivalent (mg GAE/g), quercetin equivalent (mg QE/g) and tannic acid equivalent (mg TAE/g) respectively.
