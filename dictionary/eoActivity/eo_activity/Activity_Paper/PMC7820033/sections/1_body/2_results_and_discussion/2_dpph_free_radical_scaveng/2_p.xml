<p id="p0090">Oxidative stress, one of the main reasons behind different pathological conditions of human body, is originated from an imbalance between body's intrinsic defense and generation of free radicals [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These unstable free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) originate either from normal metabolic processes in human body or from external sources (X-rays, industrial chemicals, cigarette smoking, air pollutants etc.) [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and damage cellular macromolecules like protein, lipid and DNA through electron pairing [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] resulting in a number of pathological conditions including degenerative diseases, cancer and inflammatory diseases [
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the free radical scavenging activity of the date palms by DPPH free radical scavenging assay. DPPH based free radical scavenging method is on of the most sensitive and easy way to examine the antioxidant activity of the natural products with the advantage of being unaffected by side reactions [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This N-centered radical possesses an unpaired valence electron on its nitrogen bridge that shows absorbance within the range between 515 and 517 nm and reduction in this absorbance due to radical neutralization by antioxidant species is the basis of this assay [
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The results of DPPH free radical scavenging assay are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Among the three date cultivars, Safawy was found to be the strongest scavenger of DPPH free radical. The order of activity stands as Safawy &gt; Ajwah &gt; Sukkari (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 104, 125 and 177 μg/mL, respectively) and all the three extracts showing good scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 1 mg/mL) when compared to the positive control, i.e., ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 12.09 μg/mL). It can be postulated from the results that the extracts have good proton donating capacity and can be classified as primary antioxidants. In our previous study the phenolic profile of Safawy and Ajwah dates were found to be superior to that of Sukkari which is in accordance with our present finding [
