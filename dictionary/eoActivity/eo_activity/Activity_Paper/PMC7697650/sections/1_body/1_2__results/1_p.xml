<p>Each 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strain was confirmed to species level based on culture, PCR products (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antibiotics-09-00790-f001">Figure 1</xref>), and sequencing. A basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) analysis showed a 99% similarity between 
 <italic>C. coli</italic> from chicken (CC–CI) and 
 <italic>C. coli</italic> YH502 (CP018900.1) isolated from retail chicken. The BLAST also showed a 100% similarity between 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> from chicken (CJ–CI) and 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> (CP047481.1) isolated from patients with gastrointestinal disease in Chile. The detection rates and species distribution related to fecal samples collected from the poultry farm are not presented in this manuscript.
