<p>To improve the current trend, natural products (NPs) are good candidates in food preservation and/or drug development due to their rich composition [

 <xref rid="B21-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Herbal medicines, generally recognized as safe, are more widely used and more affordable than synthetic ones [
 <xref rid="B22-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. NPs are also known to work in synergy with existing drugs to combat AMR pathogens [
 <xref rid="B24-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Although the literature on the anti-
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> activity of natural products is scanty, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum</italic> cassia (L.) J.Presl is a known traditional Chinese medicine for treating various diseases, while 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic> Georgi is effective against 
 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> [

 <xref rid="B26-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which is phylogenetically closely related to 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> [
 <xref rid="B2-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies have shown that cinnamon oil works well against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> species and several other pathogens [
 <xref rid="B27-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,

 <italic>Mentha canadensis</italic> L. proved to inhibit both 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and 
 <italic>H. pylori</italic> [

 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and it is also effective in the treatment of dysentery [
 <xref rid="B31-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>Meehania urticifolia</italic> (Miq.) Makino is known for its phenolic compounds but its antimicrobial activity is still poorly reported [
 <xref rid="B32-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Clove oil and its major phytochemical eugenol are known for their antimicrobial and virulence-modulating activities against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> species [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Emodin has been found to inhibit 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], while kuraridin had activity against different pathogenic bacteria [
 <xref rid="B35-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and reoviruses [
 <xref rid="B36-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Cinnamaldehyde has been reported to possess antimicrobial properties against various pathogens [
 <xref rid="B37-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, NPs could become potential sources for ensuring the safety of food items during this period when resistance to antimicrobials and tolerance to methods used in food industries are escalating [
