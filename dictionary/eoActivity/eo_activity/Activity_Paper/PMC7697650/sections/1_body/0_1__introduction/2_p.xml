<p>There have been increased reports about high-level resistance to frontline and alternative antimicrobials, including macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines, among 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among pathogens has been associated with many factors, including the unrestricted use of antimicrobials in various fields [
 <xref rid="B9-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The main mechanisms of AMR include mutations in specific genes and acquiring efflux pumps [
 <xref rid="B11-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, the main resistance mechanism to ciprofloxacin is through target mutation in the DNA 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A gene, along with the 
 <italic>CmeABC</italic> efflux pump [
 <xref rid="B4-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; the majority (75â€“90%) of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> isolates worldwide have developed resistance to this important category of antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B13-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The resistance to tetracycline is known to be either on a plasmid or bacterial chromosome [
 <xref rid="B14-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is estimated that by the year 2050, if no adequate actions are taken, the annual death rate due to AMR would reach 10 million people worldwide and cost USD 100 trillion [
 <xref rid="B17-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Poultry has been recognized as the primary reservoir of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains that are resistant to fluoroquinolones associated with human diseases [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The progressive end of the traditional antimicrobial drug era as a result of the increasing number of AMR pathogens requires the development of new approaches to deal with AMR pathogens [
