<p>The sequence of the 
 <italic>tet</italic>(O) gene (MT967269 and MT967270) was similar to other 
 <italic>tet</italic>(O) genes from the Genbank strains (81-176, NG_048260.1, CP044175.1). The high-level resistance to tetracycline is common in 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains isolated from humans and broilers [
 <xref rid="B6-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and it has been attributed to the 
 <italic>tet</italic>(O) gene found either on plasmids or bacterial chromosome [
 <xref rid="B15-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The used NPs inhibited all the strains, including those resistant to tested quinolones and tetracycline.
