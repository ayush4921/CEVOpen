<p>A considerable number of plants have been used traditionally for the treatment for diabetes and its complications but only a limited number have been subjected to scientific scrutiny and fewer still scrutinized for the mechanisms responsible for their anti-diabetic effects [

 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) to assess whether part of their mode of action relates to an ability to inhibit DPP-IV. Hot water extracts of every plant studied exhibited some degree of DPP-IV inhibition

 <italic>A. latifolia</italic> (bark), 
 <italic>A. marmelos</italic> (leaves), 
 <italic>M. indica</italic> (seeds), 
 <italic>T. foenum-graecum</italic> (seeds), 
 <italic>C. cochinchinensis</italic> (bark), and 
 <italic>A indica</italic> (seeds). These plants inhibited DPP-IV by 27–96% with IC
 <sub>25</sub> values of 446–4720 μg/ml. Although considerably less effective than pure preparations of sitagliptin and vildagliptin, these observations suggest that a component of the anti-diabetic actions of these plants may be due to inhibition of DPP-IV. This adds to the results of previous studies which have highlighted gastrointestinal effects of anti-diabetic plants and their ability to enhance insulin secretion and/or action [
