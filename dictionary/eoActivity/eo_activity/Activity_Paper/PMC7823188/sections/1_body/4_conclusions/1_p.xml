<p>In conclusion, these findings indicate that a substantial proportion of plants used traditionally for the treatment of diabetes exhibit DPP-IV inhibitory activity which may contribute to their multiple glucose lowering actions. Such medicinal plants could provide an accessible therapy for diabetes particularly in populations without easy access to the recognized drugs. More work is required for isolation, identification and characterization of agents responsible for inhibition of DPP-IV but there is a good chance that multiple phytochemicals are involved in mediating such effects [
