<p>Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Nonetheless, the high cost of cancer treatment implies a major constraint for patients from low-income countries to have a good access to high quality healthcare. These populations often turn towards the use of relatively more affordable traditional complementary medicine. In 2018, Chassagne et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] employed a bibliographic scoring approach to select traditional plants frequently used in the treatment of liver disorders in Southeast Asia and tested their anti-cancer activities on liver cancer (HepG2 cell line). There were 10 plants tested in the study, including 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Andrographis paniculata</italic> (Burm.f.) Nees, 
 <italic>Willughbeia edulis</italic> Roxb, 
 <italic>Senna alata</italic> (L.) Roxb., 
 <italic>Cananga latifolia</italic> (Hook.f. &amp; Thomson) Finet &amp; Gagnep., 
 <italic>Salacia chinensis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Orthosiphon aristatus</italic> (Blume) Miq., 
 <italic>Boerhavia diffusa</italic> L., 
 <italic>Gomphrena celosioides</italic> Mart. and 
 <italic>Melastoma saigonense</italic> (Kuntze) Merr. Interestingly, when compared to the other plants evaluated in the study, the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> showed the highest anti-proliferative effect on the HepG2 model (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 64.1 Î¼g/mL). It was speculated that its anti-proliferative effect could be attributed to the presence of flavonoids including baicalein which had been previously reported to exert anti-proliferative effects on liver cancer. This study is supported by several other studies on the anti-cancer properties of baicalein extracted from 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> against several other types of human cancer cells in vitro.
