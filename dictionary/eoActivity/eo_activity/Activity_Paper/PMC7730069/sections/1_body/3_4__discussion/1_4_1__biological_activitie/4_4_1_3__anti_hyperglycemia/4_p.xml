<p>Last but not least, in diabetes patients, the total antioxidant defenses are reduced due to the generation of oxygen free radical from glycosylation, auto-oxidation of glycation products and impairment of the endogenous antioxidant defense system [

Therefore, another possible mechanism of anti-hyperglycemia exerted by baicalein could be via its high antioxidant capacity which could eliminate the deleterious effects of oxidative stress accumulated in diabetes patients. This was reported by Sun et al. whose research indicated that therapeutic approaches using
