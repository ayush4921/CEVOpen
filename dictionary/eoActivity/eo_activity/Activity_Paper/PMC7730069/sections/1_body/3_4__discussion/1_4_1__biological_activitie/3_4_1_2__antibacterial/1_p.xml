<p>Emerging evidence has shown that that the extracts from 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> promoted moderate to intermediate antibacterial activities against clinically isolated bacteria such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus intermedius</italic> in a dose-dependent manner. In a study done by Sithisarn et al. [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-05677" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], 
 <italic>O. indicum</italic> fruits were collected from different provinces in Thailand and the bioactive compounds were extracted using 95% ethanol and distilled water, respectively. Both extracts were determined for their in vitro antibacterial effects on two clinically isolated bacteria, 
 <italic>S. suis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. intermedius</italic>, using disc diffusion assay. They found that the extracts prepared by maceration with ethanol promoted higher antibacterial activities than those prepared with water. Phytochemical characterization analysis of both extracts detected a chromatographic band that could correspond to flavonoid baicalein. A further in vitro DPPH scavenging assay also confirmed that both extracts exhibited high antioxidant effects due to the high total flavonoid contents in both extracts.
