<p>Last but not least, there was a study that reported that baicalein exhibited the most potent inhibitory effects on growth and metastasis of human colorectal cancer cells compared to other flavonoids isolated from the same

The study also described the role of baicalein as an inhibitor of kexin-type proteases of superfamily proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexins 3 (PCSK3) which is also known as furin. Furin has been well documented to cleave and convert inactive growth factors into their matured forms that promote tumor growth. The role of furin in cancer progression renders it an attractive target for cancer treatment. There are many on-going efforts to identify furin inhibitors to inhibit cancer progression to a significant extent. There were reports in the literature which showed that PCSK inhibitors could significantly decrease the proliferation, tumorigenesis and metastasis of skin cancer cells [
