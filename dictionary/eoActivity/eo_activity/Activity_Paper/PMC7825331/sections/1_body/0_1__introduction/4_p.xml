<p>To review and answer the above questions, we performed literature search on the following database; Google Scholar, Science Direct, and PubMed. Some of the key search terms used included “medicinal mushrooms from North America”, “North American mushrooms”, “bioactive compounds from North American mushrooms”, “small molecules from mushrooms”, “large molecular weight compounds from medicinal mushrooms”, “medicinal mushrooms of British Columbia”, “medicinal mushrooms of Canada”, “medicinal mushrooms and United States”, and “medicinal mushrooms and Greenland”. The search was limited to the period from 2005–2020 and articles that have irrelevant topic such as morphology, taxonomy and ecological aspects of mushrooms were excluded. Research articles that involved biological activity and chemical characterization were included.</p>
