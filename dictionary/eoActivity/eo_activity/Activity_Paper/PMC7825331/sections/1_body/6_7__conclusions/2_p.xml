<p>In summary, to date only 79 mushroom species in North America that have been studied and reported to possess medicinal properties. Of these, 48 species (60%) exhibited bioactivities that have never been previously reported (

Out of this limited number of studies, already 10 new small molecules, 6 new polysaccharides and a new protein with medicinal properties have been discovered (
