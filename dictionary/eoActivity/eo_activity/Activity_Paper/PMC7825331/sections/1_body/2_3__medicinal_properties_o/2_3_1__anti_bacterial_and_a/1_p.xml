<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a major healthcare problem worldwide. A recent landmark report indicated that bacterial infections resistant to treatment are likely to grow from 26% in 2018 to 40% By 2050, and such increases are expected to cost thousands of lives, billions of dollars in hospital expenses and gross domestic product and have a negative social impact on people worldwide [

 <italic>O</italic>-methyl ether isolated from 
 <italic>Cortinarius</italic> species were effective against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> [

 <italic>Lentinus edodes</italic> (Shiitake mushroom) have also shown antibacterial effects against 
 <italic>S. aureus, Streptococcus faecalis</italic> and
