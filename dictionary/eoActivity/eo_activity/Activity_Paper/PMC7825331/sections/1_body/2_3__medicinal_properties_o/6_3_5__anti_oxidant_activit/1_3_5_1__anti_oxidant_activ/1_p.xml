<p>There has been relatively less study on anti-oxidant activity of mushrooms native to North America. One study reported ethanolic extracts from 11 species of mushrooms collected from Idaho, Oregon, and New Jersey, to have moderate to weak anti-oxidant activity. In the study, 70–95% ethanolic extracts of various mushrooms were assessed and Vitamin C was used as a positive control [
