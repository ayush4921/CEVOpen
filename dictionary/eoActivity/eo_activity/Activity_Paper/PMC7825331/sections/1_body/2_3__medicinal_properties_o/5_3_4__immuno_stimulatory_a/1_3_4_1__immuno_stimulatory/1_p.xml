<p>Mushroom species are known to have immunotherapeutic properties and over 270 species had been recognized for such medicinal potential [
 <xref rid="B75-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Mushrooms are natural immune modulators that can enhance the host immune system by activating dendritic cells, T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and cytokines. Mushroom native to North America have also been explored for immuno-stimulatory activity. Out of 29 species of mushrooms examined from north-central BC [
