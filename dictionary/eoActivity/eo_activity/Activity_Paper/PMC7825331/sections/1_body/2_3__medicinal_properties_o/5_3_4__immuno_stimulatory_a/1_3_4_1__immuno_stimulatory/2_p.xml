<p>To date, most of the immuno-stimulatory compounds from mushrooms are polysaccharides or polysaccharide-protein complexes [

 <xref rid="B77-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Due to problems such as: (i) high variability of polysaccharides that is further exacerbated during extraction and purification, (ii) impurities and contaminants, and (iii) difficulty in defining the structure and chemical fingerprint to understand structure-function relationships [
 <xref rid="B78-molecules-26-00251" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], there has been little interest amongst scientists in North America to study and isolate immuno-stimulatory polysaccharides from mushrooms native to North America.
