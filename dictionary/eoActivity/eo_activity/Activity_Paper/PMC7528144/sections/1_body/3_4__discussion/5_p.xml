<p>The present study also demonstrated that the extract is tolerable since no treatment-related signs of toxicity were noticed in the animals throughout the observation period. Per oral administration of the hydromethanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> root extract produced neither significant toxic signs nor death during the observation period of 14 days after a single administration of 2000 mg/kg with oral median lethal dose greater than 2000 mg/kg in mice. Another study showed that the hydromethanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. kebericho</italic> roots (up to a dose of 5,000 mg/kg) did not produce a sign of toxicity [
