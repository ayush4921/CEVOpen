<p id="p0030">The bulb of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> was separated, washed severally with tap water followed by rinsing with double-distilled water and air-dried for two weeks. Thereafter, the dried samples were pulverized into powder with an electric blender. One hundred grams (100 g) of plant parts were each extracted in separate flasks containing 500 mL of organic solvents (acetone, chloroform, and ethanol); the mixtures were incubated in a shaker for 24 h at 25 °C, 200 rpm. The plant extracts were filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and thereafter concentrated using IKA rotary evaporator and subsequently dried at room temperature to get the crude extracts, which were stored at 4 °C for use.
