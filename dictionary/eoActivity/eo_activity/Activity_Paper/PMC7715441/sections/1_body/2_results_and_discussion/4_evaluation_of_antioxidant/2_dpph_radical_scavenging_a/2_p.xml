<p id="p0090">The DPPH scavenging potential of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> extracts was evaluated and the results are represented in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. the ethanolic extract exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging of 75.47% at 0.25Â mg/mL followed by acetone and chloroform extracts with inhibition of 67.412% and 60.872%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of ethanolic extract surpassed even that of the standard (ascorbic acid), which is a clear indication of its high scavenging activity. This finding also implies that the ethanol was effective in extracting bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties against the DPPH radical. In a study conducted by 
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Adewusi et al. (2012)</xref>, they found that out the ethyl acetate and methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb and root studied, the methanolic extract of the bulb did not show any scavenging activity whereas methanolic extract of the root demonstrated good scavenging potential against DPPH radical. However, results from this present study demonstrate a different perception that the 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb plant part does possess a scavenging activity against DPPH radical. The dose-dependent increase in DPPH radical scavenging activity is directly proportional to the antioxidant capacity of a plant extract. A slightly similar findings were documented by 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Aremu et al. (2011)</xref> on the DPPH scavenging activity of leaf and stem petroleum ether (PE), dichloromethane (DCM) and 50% aqueous methanol (MeOH) extracts of 
 <italic>Leucosidea sericea</italic> (
 <italic>L. sericea</italic>), a plant that is used for the treatment of neurological disorders in South Africa. When a plant possesses an efficient radical scavenging activity of DPPH, there is a high possibility that it may also contain antiradical activity against highly reactive molecules implicated in the pathology of various diseases.
