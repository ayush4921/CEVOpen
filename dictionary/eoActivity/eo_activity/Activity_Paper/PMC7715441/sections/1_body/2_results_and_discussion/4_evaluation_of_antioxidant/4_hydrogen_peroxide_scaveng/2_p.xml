<p id="p0100">ROS have been recognized for their dual functions that include destructive and constructive species. ROS are involved in several redox-related activities in the cells for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (

 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Sena and Chandel 2012</xref>). For the cells to survive during this process, hydrogen peroxide will activate a transcription factor calledÂ hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) that will initiate metabolic adaptation of cells under low oxygen (

 <xref rid="b0220" ref-type="bibr">Sena and Chandel, 2012</xref>). However, as much as hydrogen peroxide has physiological functions, it is also regarded as one of the reactive radicals that can cause serious damage to the cells when its amounts are beyond the normal physiological range. Hydrogen peroxide is also thought to be a source of hydroxyl ion when it encounters metals such as iron through the Fenton reaction (
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Bolisetty and Jaines, 2013</xref>). Therefore, hydrogen peroxide abundance leads to oxidative stress and an effective antioxidant activity against hydrogen peroxide from plant extracts can simultaneously lead to less production of hydroxyl ions. In the present study, all plant extracts of
