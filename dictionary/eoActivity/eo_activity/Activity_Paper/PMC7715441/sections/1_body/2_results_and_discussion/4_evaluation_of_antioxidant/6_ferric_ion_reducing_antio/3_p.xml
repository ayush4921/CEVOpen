<p id="p0125">In this present study, 
 <italic>B. disticha</italic> bulb extracts have been shown to possess excellent reducing power. As depicted in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, the ethanolic extract exhibited high reducing power compared to the other extracts and ascorbic acid across the concentration range with lower reducing power attributed to acetone and chloroform extracts, respectively. These results can be attributed to the ability of the tested extracts to donate electrons, which then suggests that they can act as free radical scavengers (
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). This is yet another observation in support of the ability of ethanolic solvent in extracting compounds with antioxidant properties. Furthermore, the reducing ability of these plant extracts demonstrated in this study is an indication of the potential medicinal value this plant holds, in terms of antioxidant power, and this makes it a good reference source for future research in drug development. The report of 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Masoko and Masiphephethu (2019)</xref> buttressed our findings in which the organic solvents of 
 <italic>Schkuhria pinnata</italic> showed high ferric reducing power.
