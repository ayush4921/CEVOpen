  <italic>Boophone disticha</italic> (
  <italic>B. disticha</italic>) is a bulbous tropical and subtropical flowering plant widespread in Africa, which is frequently used to treat several human ailments. Until the present, there is no scientific validation on the biological activity of this plant from the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and as a result, this study aimed to assess the bioactive compounds, free radicals scavenging and anticancer potentials of crude bulb extracts (chloroform, acetone, and ethanol) of 
  <italic>Boophone disticha</italic> obtained from this geographical location. Standard biochemical techniques and Gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis were used to pinpoint the bioactive compounds in the crude extracts sequel to their antioxidant potentials against radicals such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide as well as their ferric ion reducing power. In addition, their cytotoxicity effects against Human cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells were assessed as an in vitro model for anticancer. The phytochemical evaluation of the crude extracts showed the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, and alkaloids. GCMS profiles confirmed the presence of some bioactive compounds in the crude extracts of 
  <italic>B. disticha</italic> that could be responsible for their biological activities. The plant extracts possessed considerable antioxidant activity and exhibited dose-dependent radicals’ inhibition from all assays carried out. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity effects against HeLa cells recorded inhibition concentration (IC
  <sub>50</sub>) of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.9 µg/mL for acetone, chloroform, and ethanolic extracts of 
  <italic>B. disticha</italic>, respectively. Findings from the present study suggest that 
  <italic>B. disticha</italic> could be a good prospective source of antioxidant and anticancer agents. Therefore, further research on the isolation and purification of compounds from these extracts are indispensable.
