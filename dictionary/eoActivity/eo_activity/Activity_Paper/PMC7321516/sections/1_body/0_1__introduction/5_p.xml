<p>Currently used anti-inflammatory medications are associated with disadvantages such as drug toxicity, adverse effects, and iatrogenic reactions, thereby complicating the treatment process [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Dzoyem et al. [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] further stated that both steroidal and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs used in the treatment of severe inflammation have not been thoroughly effective, since most of these drugs increase the risk of blood clots and may result in stroke and heart attack. Some of these synthetic molecules, such as anticytokine agents, block the activity of several kinases and result in severe impairment of the immunity of an individual against infections [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The adverse effects related to the use of these conventional synthetic drugs have been the driving force behind consideration of natural remedies and the development of powerful anti-inflammatory drugs based on natural extracts. In this context, research should explore the properties of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> for the possible development of drugs, considering its long history of use as a traditional medicine for effective management of inflammatory diseases across Africa for centuries. The review is therefore important in that it provides valuable information on the ethnopharmacological potential of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic>, thus offering a basis for extensive exploration of this important plant for developing new therapeutic anti-inflammatory drugs.
