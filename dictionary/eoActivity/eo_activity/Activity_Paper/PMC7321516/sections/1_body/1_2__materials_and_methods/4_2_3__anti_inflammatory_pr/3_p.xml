<p>Saponins are a bioactive group of compounds present in abundance in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Saponins derived from several plants demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activity in a number of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments on rat and mouse models [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Anti-inflammatory mechanisms of saponins include indirect and direct corticomimetic activity, inhibition of glucocorticoid degradation, inhibition of enzyme formation, and release of inflammatory mediators [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Tatiya et al. [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] observed that saponins obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic>Sesbania sesban</italic> showed significant anti-inflammatory activity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) in the experimental models used, through the inhibition of rat paw edema induced by carrageenan and histamine. The results indicated that saponins play a crucial role in the acute inflammatory phase, with its action partly linked to histamine [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The significant ameliorative activity observed in the study could be a result of inhibition of inflammatory mediators by saponins, including histamine, prostaglandins, and serotonin [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In a different study, Mazumder et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] indicated that crude saponins had a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) effect on granulomatous inflammation. The presence of large amounts of saponins in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> may play a significant role in its anti-inflammatory effects.
