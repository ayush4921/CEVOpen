 <italic>A. africana</italic> is a perennial shrub that grows to a height between 60 cm and 2 m, depending on the availability of water and nutrition in the soil [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The stems are rough to touch, highly branched, and stiff from their bases (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>). The leaves are simple, oppositely arranged, ovate-lanceolate, creased accordion-style, and rough because the surfaces are covered with trichomes (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>). The lamina have prominent midveins and are rounded at their bases but with pointed apices (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>); the leaves range from 6 to 25 cm in length and 3 to 7 cm in width and are attached to the plant stems by rough petioles measuring approximately 1 cm in length. Each hairy stalk of 4–10 cm length holds an inflorescence of solitary terminal capitulum. The inflorescence consists of numerous bright yellow florets that make the flowers conspicuous (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(e)</xref>). Bristly and finely hairy 4-angled achenes, approximately half a centimeter in length with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 2 mm, develop from each floret.
