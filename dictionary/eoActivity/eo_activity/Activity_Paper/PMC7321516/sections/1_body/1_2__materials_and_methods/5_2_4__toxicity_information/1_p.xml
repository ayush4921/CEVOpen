 <italic>A. africana</italic> is generally considered a valuable medicinal plant with low toxicity [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The degree of toxicity of the plant leaf extract depended on factors such as exposure route, dose, and the extractant [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For ethanolic, aqueous, and chloroform leaf extracts of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic>, the oral LD
 <sub>50</sub> were 10,000 mg/kg, 12,589.3 mg/kg, and 1,995.3 mg/kg, respectively [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In mice, Oko et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] discovered that behavioral toxicity signs included respiratory disorder, nervousness, and piloerection. In a study by Oluyemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], intraperitoneal administration of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> leaf methanolic extract in Wistar rats caused damage to the uterine wall and significantly delayed their estrus cycles. In another 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, oral administration of aqueous leaf extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> in female Wistar rats distorted the histology of their ovaries, impairing fertilization [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further, 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic> aqueous leaf extract could be deforming to the developing placenta in Wistar rats in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A significant decrease in the weight of the testis, seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and epididymis was recorded in male Wistar rats on administration of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>A</italic>.
