<p>Flavonoids are a group of natural substances occurring in fruits, vegetables, grains, bark, roots, flowers, stems, wine, and tea with varying phenolic structures [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Flavonoids were known to be immensely beneficial to health, long before their isolation as effective therapeutic compounds [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. There are over 4,000 flavonoid varieties, conferring bright colors to parts of plants, occurring as glycosides, methylated derivatives, and aglycones [

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is therefore no surprise that they are abundantly present in 
 <italic>A. africana</italic> flowers (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Flavonoids exist in several forms such as flavonols, flavanones, flavones, isoflavonoids, catechins, and anthocyanidins [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Ukwueze et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that flavonoids were dominant phytochemicals in addition to being the main anti-inflammatory agent in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>africana</italic>. Under varying inflammatory conditions, flavonoids have been demonstrated to be phospholipase inhibitors, while some are tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Depending on their structure, flavonoids are also known to be inhibitors of both lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Komakech et al. [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] stated that flavonoids inhibit 5-lipoxygenase enzyme, thus playing an important role in suppressing leukotriene biosynthesis and reducing inflammatory reactions in the body. Rathee et al. [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported that flavonoids possess significant anti-inflammatory properties, despite their relatively unknown mechanism of action. The most predominant mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoids is the inhibition of enzymes that generate eicosanoids such as phospholipase A2, lipoxygenases, and COX, thus causing a reduction in leukotriene and prostanoid concentrations. Other postulated mechanisms include inhibition of the release of histamine, protein kinases, phosphodiesterase, and transcriptase activation [
