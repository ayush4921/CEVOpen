<p>Retention indices of the volatile components of 
 <italic>Soo</italic> were determined by the Kovats method using 
 <italic>n</italic> -alkanes (C 
 <sub>6</sub> –C 
 <sub>32</sub> ) as standards [23–27].Volatile compounds were identified by comparison with literature RI [28–36]and MS, compared to existing analytical standards, and by matching mass spectral libraries (NIST, Wiley7NL, FFNSC1.2, and W9N11).
