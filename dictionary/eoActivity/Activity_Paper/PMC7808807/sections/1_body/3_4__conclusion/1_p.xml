<p>The consensus of melliferous plants in the Fez-Meknes region made it possible to draw up an inventory of these plants and classify them according to the ingredients that they provide to the bee (nectar, pollen, resin, and honeydew) and the realization of a beekeeping calendar according to the flowering rhythms of each plant. The Fez-Meknes region offers great beekeeping potential, mainly due to the diversity of melliferous plants, allowing transhumance practices. An accompanying beekeeping policy is necessary to allow the optimal use of natural resources and a revitalization of this sector in order to improve the standards of living of the local population. This study contributes to the promotion of the field of beekeeping and to the valorization of the melliferous plants in the Fez-Meknes region.</p>
