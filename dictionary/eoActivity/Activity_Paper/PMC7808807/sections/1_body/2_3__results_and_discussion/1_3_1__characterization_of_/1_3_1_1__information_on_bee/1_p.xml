 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> show that all interviewees are professional beekeepers and beekeeping is their main source of economic income. The bee hive products especially honey is marketed through traditional circuits (localized souks in production areas and others local outlets, urban markets, and roadsides in the production areas) and modern circuits (supermarkets, hotels and tourist camps, and electronic services). In addition, the household income of the surveyed beekeepers increases positively during the International Exhibition of Agriculture organized annually in Meknes, which gives a valuable opportunity for the marketing of their products. Concerning the beekeepers gender, 98.48% is male and 1.52% is female, thus confirming a male predominance, which agrees with the results of Khabbach et al. [

According to the opinion of the surveyed women in our study, the difficulty of beekeeping profession manifests mainly in the transhumance activity, which is done only at night and requires a high physical effort. The age range of the beekeepers questioned is the following: 50% of beekeepers are between 40 and 60 years old, 39.39% between 20 and 40 years, and 10.61% older than 60 years.
