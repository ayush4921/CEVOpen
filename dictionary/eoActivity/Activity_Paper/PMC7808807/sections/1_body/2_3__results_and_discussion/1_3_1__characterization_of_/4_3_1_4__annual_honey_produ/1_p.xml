<p>Annual honey production per hive in Fez-Meknes is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; the results indicate that 89.39% of apiaries produce less than 20 kg of honey per hive, 7.58% of apiaries produce between 20 kg and 40 kg of honey per hive, and 3.03% of apiaries produce between 40 kg and 60 kg of honey per hive. These findings show low honey production in the region; this may be due to 
 <italic>Varroa</italic> mites' infection and bee poisoning by insecticides and climatic changes [
