<p>The information obtained by the beekeepers from the bee's foraging observations around the apiary made it possible to identify 102 melliferous plants belonging to 32 families (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The most represented families in the established list of melliferous plants is the Asteraceae family with a percentage of 13.73% and Lamiaceae 13.73%, Rosaceae 8.82%, Apiaceae 7.84%, Rutaceae 6.86%, Fabaceae 5.88%, Cupressaceae 4.90%, Boraginaceae 4.90%, Cistaceae 2.94%, Fagaceae 2.94%, Moraceae 2.94%, Geraniaceae 1.96%, Papaveraceae 1.96%, and Pinaceae 1.96%. In a study published by Ennabili et al. (2000), the inventory of honey plants from the Mokrisset region (NW of Morocco) showed the presence of 78 species belonging to 35 families, and 48.7% of them corresponded to five families: Labiatae, Compositae, Rosaceae, Leguminosae, and Ericaceae [
