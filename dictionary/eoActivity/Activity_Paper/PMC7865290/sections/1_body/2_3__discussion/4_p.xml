<p>The anti-inflammatory activity of

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many literature studies reported that ferulic acid, quercetin, myricetin, gallic acid, and hesperetin were found to possess potent anti-inflammatory properties that act through different biological pathways [
