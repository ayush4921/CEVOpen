<p>One milligram of each fraction (hydroethanol, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fraction) was extracted with 0.5 mL of dichloromethane. Afterward, 200 µL of 
 <italic>N</italic>-Trimethylsilyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) was added to the mixture before being incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 0.1 μL of each final extract was injected into the GC-MS apparatus equipped with a capillary column model number (Agilent 19091S-433; Diameter: 0.25 mm, Length: 30 m, Film thickness: 0.25 µm) [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The oven temperature program was set to 60–300 °C for 10 min and then maintained at 300 °C for 20 min. The injector temperature was set to 260 °C, and the detector temperature to 250 °C. Helium was used as a carrier gas with a total flow of 31.4 mL/min and the split ratio was set to 30:1. The identification of the silylated compounds was conducted by comparing the retention times with those of the standards obtained from the database of the GC-MS Wiley 7n.l.
