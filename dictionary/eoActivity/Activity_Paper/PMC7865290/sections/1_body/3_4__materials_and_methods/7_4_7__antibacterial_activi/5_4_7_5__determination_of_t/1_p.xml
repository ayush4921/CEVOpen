<p>The MIC (the minimum concentration that inhibits microbial growth) was performed using a micro-dilution assay in 96-well plates [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-26-00636" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. First, the ET CE, But CE, Poly CE, AMP, STR, FLU, and the microbial suspensions in 0.5 McFarland were diluted in the broth culture medium. Afterward, 50 μL of the culture medium was deposited into a microplate well previously filled with 100 μL of the test fraction except wells dedicated to growth control (positive growth control). Next, micro-dilutions were made by transferring 50 μL from the first well to the second successively (½ dilution factor ½). The inoculation was carried out by putting 50 μL into wells of the microbial suspension whose turbidity was adjusted to 0.5 McFarland and then were diluted in the broth culture medium. Subsequently, the microplate was incubated under agitation for 24 h at 37 °C for the bacteria and 30 °C for the yeasts. Then, twenty microliters of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC), BIOKAR company mixed with an aqueous solution (1%) was added to all wells for reading. Finally, a pinkish coloration appeared when there is growth after incubation for 2 h. MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that does not produce a pink color, while the well without bacterial growth remained colorless [
