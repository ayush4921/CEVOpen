<p>The chemical study of hydroethanol, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions from 
 <italic>Caralluma europaea</italic> aerial parts revealed the presence of many potentially active compounds that are involved in antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory activities shown in this research work. This study can serve patient wellbeing as it provides potentially bioactive compounds contained in 
 <italic>C. europaea</italic>, which can be used as alternative agents to fight inflammatory diseases and nosocomial antibiotic-resistant microbes.
