<p>Screening of the cytotoxicity effect of the four studied plant extracts was performed using MTT viability assay. Seven cancer cell lines were incubated with the four extracts for 24, 48 and 72 h and the status of cell growth was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The results showed that all of the aforementioned extracts expressed concentration dependent cytotoxic effects against the treated cell lines. Results confirmed that DP showed the most potent antitumor activity against cervical cancer (HeLa) cancer after 72 h, among the four studied extracts, with average half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 17.93, 21.61 and 28.27 µg/mL over 72, 48 and 24 h, respectively and 37.19 µg/mL. While IC expressed a higher cytotoxic activity against breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) after 72 h with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 27.30 µg/mL. EG expressed the most potent activity in growth inhibition of leukemia (HL60), while XA against glioblastoma brain cancer (U-87) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 41.05 and 35.45 µg/mL, respectively. In lung cancer cells (A549), DP and XA were shown the most potent effect of growth inhibition after 72 h with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 39.96 and 40.79 µg/mL respectively. While the inhibitory effect of the studied plant extracts after 48 h against ovarian cancer (Sk-OV-3) cells was shown that DP and EG were more potent among the four extracts with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 43.86, 44.38 µg/mL, respectively. The four extracts have possessed closely antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) with a range from 32.99 to 53.21 µg/mL over 72 h.
