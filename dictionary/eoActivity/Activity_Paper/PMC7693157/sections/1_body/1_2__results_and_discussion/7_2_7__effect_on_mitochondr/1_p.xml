<p>As the disruption of the MMP is one of the sequential events exhibited during the apoptotic pathway, the effect of the four studied plant extracts in this alteration after 24 h of treatment against HeLa cells was compared to the positive control FCCP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f008">Figure 8</xref>A) with untreated cells representing the negative control. After the cells were treated with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of XA and EG, the MMP closely dropped to 19.70% and 20.84%, respectively. As well, DP and IC disrupted the MMP to 23.02% and 26.90%, while FCCP, the positive control for the MMP breakdown, altered the MMP to 30.20% compared to the control cells which represent the 100%. The results were analyzed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f008">Figure 8</xref>B to assess the fold change in MMP after the treatment of different studied plant extracts. The data showed that all plant extracts expressed a significant alteration of the MMP. XA revealed a significant alteration decrease by 5.09 ± 0.21-fold, followed by EG, DP and IC with 4.80 ± 0.12, 4.37 ± 0.43 and 3.77 ± 0.63-fold, respectively. Comparatively, FCCP altered the MMP with a 3.35-fold decrease. Further analysis using fluorescence microscopy (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f008">Figure 8</xref>C) was performed to visualize the breakdown of MPP after treatment of HeLa cells with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the four studied plant extracts, followed by staining with 500 nM of tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE.) The results represent the significant depletion of MMP after cells were treated with the four plant extracts, compared to the positive control (FCCP) and the untreated cells, as the remaining living cells obviously showed a depolarization of MMP which induced the apoptotic pathway and cell death.
