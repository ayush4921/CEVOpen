<p>The anti-proliferation effect is the first indication to be assessed when investigation novel antitumor agents, thus the cell growth inhibitory activity of the four plant extracts was initially assessed on the HeLa (cervical cancer) cell line 48 h after treatment with different concentrations of the crude methanol extracts. A dose dependent decrease in cell viability was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f001">Figure 1</xref>). At a concentration of 50 µg/mL of each crude extract, DP and EG inhibited the cell growth by more than 99%, followed by XA with &gt; 90% and IC with &gt; 80%. The comparative IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of XA, IC, EG and DP for HeLa cells were shown in (

 <sub>50</sub> value of 19.35 µg/mL, followed by XA with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 24.94 µg/mL. EG and IC showed a quite similar inhibitory effect on cell growth with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 33.65 and 38.14 µg/mL, respectively.
