<p>A live/dead assay was performed to confirm the cytotoxic activity of the four plant extracts against HeLa cell line. Cells were treated with a concentration of 30 µg/mL of each crude extract over 24, 48 and 72 h. Then, dual staining with fluorescence dyes was performed using calcein-AM and propidium iodide. The results showed a significant decrease in viable cells after being with the extracts (

As the percentage of viable cells of untreated cells was 97.10 ± 0.8% after 72 h, while the percentage of viable cells decreased to 75.36 ± 5.5%, 60.36 ± 4.3% and 49.46 ± 3.8% after cell treatment with XA over 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. After treatment of cells with IC, viable cells decreased to 85 ± 2.4%, 75.25 ± 5.7% and 56.79 ± 4.9% over 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The percentage of viable cells dramatically decreased, upon treatment of cells with EG to 59.77 ± 5.9%, 48.28 ± 3.1% and 41.35 ± 2.4% over 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. The results confirmed that DP was shown a potent cytotoxic activity towards HeLa cells, as the percentage of viable cells significantly decreased to 49.30 ± 4.1%, 34.72 ± 3.5% and 23.64 ± 1.2% over 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively (
