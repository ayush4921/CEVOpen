<p>Plant extracts exert their cytotoxic effects through common mechanisms including cell cycle arrest and cell death by apoptosis. The potential of anticancer agents is evaluated by the ability to initiate cell cycle arrest in cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Production of apoptotic cells, which are resulting from DNA fragmentation, display a broad hypo-diploid sub-G0/G1 peak which is easily detected with sufficient loss of cellular DNA and can be discriminated by flow cytometry [
 <xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Corresponding to these findings, in the present study, the four studied extracts have the potential to cause sufficient DNA loss to induce apoptosis, as the accumulation of hypodiploid cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase is an indication of apoptotic cell death. Several intracellular cascades, such as the activation of caspases and the disruption of MMP would be a confirmation for apoptosis.
