<p>Assessment of the inhibitory effect of the four studied plant extracts on the progression and migration was performed against HeLa cells over 24 and 48 h. the negative control is represented by un-treated cells and cells treated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO). The treatment of cells with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the studied plant extracts resulted in a significant blocking the progression and wound healing of the scratch area compared to the untreated cells and control cells treated with the solvent (0.1% DMSO) as a control (

Data analysis of the percentage of the wound closure was performed and data showed that the percentage decreased at 24 h from 96% and 81% for untreated cells and DMSO, respectively to 38%, 36%, 27% and 11.5% for IC, XA, EG and DP. After 36 h, the scratch area for the untreated cells was totally covered by cells with a percentage of 100% and for cells treated with DMSO by 95%. However, the significant effect on the scratch area, which continued up to 36 h, was observed in cells treated with DP where the percentage of wound closure was only 16.5% followed by 39.5% for cells treated with EG. While the coverage area of the scratch increased to 64.5% and 66% for cells treated with IC and XA, respectively (
