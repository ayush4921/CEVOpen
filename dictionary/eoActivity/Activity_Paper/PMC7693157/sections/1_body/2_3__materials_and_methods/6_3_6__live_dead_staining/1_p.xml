<p>Assessment of cell viability of HeLa cells upon treatment with the four studied extracts was conducted using the LIVE/DEAD
 <sup>®</sup> Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit. A total of 2.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well were plated on the surface of a sterile glass coverslip placed in a twelve-well plate and incubated overnight before treatment with a concentration of 30 µg/mL of the crude extracts. Cells were washed with 1× PBS solution before staining using a dual-fluorescence of calcein-AM (2.0 µM) and propidium iodide (20 µg/mL). Cell washed twice after 15 min with 1 × PBS solution, then visualization of samples was carried out using a fluorescence microscope (CKX-53 Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Viable cells stained with green fluorescence and dead cells labelled with red fluorescence correlating to calcein-AM and Propidium iodide, respectively. Four random fields of view for each sample were captured and were analyzed using ImageJ software for three independent experiments. The percentages of viable cells were calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula>Viable cells (%) = [live cells/(live cells + dead cells)] × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
