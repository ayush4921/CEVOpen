<p>For the quantitative analysis, the cells were harvested with trypsin and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min after treatment. Cells were then washed twice with 1 × PBS buffer and further incubated with 100 µL of the binding buffer containing annexin V-FITC and PI in the dark for 15 min. After that the samples were mixed with 400.0 µL binding buffer before being analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences LSR II FACS). Results for three independent experiments expressed in a scatter plot as four different quadrants representing viable cells, necrosis, early and late apoptosis.</p>
