<p>A total of 3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells were seeded into a well of a 12-well plate and incubated with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained from the MTT assay of the four studied plant extracts and untreated cells as a control for 24 h. Following incubation, cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS and resuspended in 100 µL of ice-cold PBS. Cells transferred to a 2 mL sample tube and shaking at 800 rpm while adding 900 µL of ice-cold 70% ethanol drop-wise then incubated at −20 °C for 2 h. Cells were further centrifuged for 5 min at 8000 rpm, 4 °C, cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold PBS and the centrifugation was repeated then pellets were re-suspended in 1 mL of staining solution (PBS, 0.01% tween 80, 20 µg/mL PI, 1 µL/mL RNase [100 mg/mL]) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min [

After washing and centrifugation, the cell suspension was vortexed and filtered using a polystyrene round bottom tube equipped with a cell strainer cap. The cell cycle distribution was then analysed using PE-A channel with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences LSR II FACS, San Francisco, CA, USA) and 10,000 events per sample were acquired. The percentages of cells in the different cell cycle phases were analyzed in triplicate by the ModFit LT software (version 5.0).
