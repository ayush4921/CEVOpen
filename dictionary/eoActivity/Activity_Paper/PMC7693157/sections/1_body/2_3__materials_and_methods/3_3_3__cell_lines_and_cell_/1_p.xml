<p>The HEK293 cell line (human embryonic kidney) and the human cancer cell lines: HeLa (cervical), MDA-MB-231 (breast), A549 (lung), HepG2 (liver), U-87 (glioblastoma, brain), SK-OV-3 (ovarian) and HL60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were grown in recommended culture media supplemented with 10% FBS and MEM-non-essential amino- acids (Gibco
 <sup>TM</sup> Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA), 50 µg/mL gentamicin and 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin B in a 5–7% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. The cells were grown as a monolayer for no more than 15 passages.
