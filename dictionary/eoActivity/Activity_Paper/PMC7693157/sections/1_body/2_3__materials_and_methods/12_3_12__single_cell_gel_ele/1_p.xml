<p>The assessment of the DNA damage and genotoxicity induced by the studied plant extracts was performed by the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Alkaline Comet Assay). All the procedures were performed in dark [

 <sup>5</sup> HeLa cells per well were seeded into a six-well plate and were allowed to adhere overnight. Then cells were treated with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the different plant extracts obtained from the MTT assay and 0.1% DMSO (solvent control) for 24 h. Then the cells were trypsinized and centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm to get the cell pellet. The obtained cell suspension was washed twice using sterile PBS (pH 7.4) and cell density was adjusted accordingly. After that, 80,000 cells (25 µL) of the treated and untreated cell suspension was mixed with 75 µL of 1% of pre-warm low melting agarose (LMA) (Carl Roth GmbH). The mixture was applied on the super frost glass slide previously pre-coated with 1% standard normal melting agarose (NMA) and was immediately covered with coverslips. The glass slides were then placed on an ice block for 10 min until solidified and the coverslips were gently removed. The cell membrane lysis was done by submerging the slides overnight into the staining jar containing cold lysis solution (300 mM NaOH, 1.2 M NaCl, 2% DMSO and 1% Triton X-100) [

The slides were then transferred to the electrophoresis tank containing alkaline electrophoresis buffer (300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA) and were left in the buffer for 30 min to allow the unwinding of DNA. Electrophoresis was performed for 30 min at 250 mA current and 25 V, resulting in the DNA unwinding and exposing the alkali labile sites. After the electrophoresis, the slides were neutralized by washing the slides with double distilled water. The cell fixation was then done by submerging the slides into the 70% ethanol for 20 min. After fixation, cells were stained with SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> safe DNA staining dye (1:10,000 in PBS) for 20 min. Finally, the slides were washed with double distilled water to remove any unbound stains. The comet analysis was done under a fluorescence microscope (CKX-53 Olympus). Fifty individual comets were scored for each sample and analyzed using Comet Assay IV
 <sup>®</sup> software.
