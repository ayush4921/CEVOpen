<p>The mitochondrial membrane potential assay was performed by using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) to label active mitochondria. Simply, HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates (4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) cells per well), after incubation overnight, cells were treated with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the four plant extracts obtained from the MTT assay and untreated cells worked as negative control. 24 h later, 50 µM of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP) was added to one sample replicate as a positive control for 20 min, then cells were treated with 500 nM of TMRE and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)
