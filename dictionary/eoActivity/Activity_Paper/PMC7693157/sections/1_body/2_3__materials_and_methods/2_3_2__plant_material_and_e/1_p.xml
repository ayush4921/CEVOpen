<p>Extraction of the four studied plants: 
 <italic>Xylopia aethiopica</italic> (XA), 
 <italic>Imperata cylindrica</italic> (IC), 
 <italic>Echinops giganteus</italic> (EG) and 
 <italic>Dorstenia psilurus</italic> (DP) (collected in Cameroon) were performed at our partner laboratory at the University of Dschang, Cameroon. Plant materials were purchased from Dschang local market, West Region of Cameroon in August 2018. They were identified at the Cameroonian National Herbarium where voucher specimens were deposited under the flowing reference number (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f011">Figure 11</xref>). The extraction was done by maceration of 100 g of the plant material in 500 mL methanol for 48 h, then, the methanolic extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure to obtain the crude extracts. The extracts were then conserved at 4 Â°C until further use.
