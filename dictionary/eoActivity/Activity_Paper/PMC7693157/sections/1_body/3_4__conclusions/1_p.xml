<p>In this study, the cytotoxic activity of extracts from four Cameroonian plants—XA, IC, EG and DP—was examined. These extracts could represent potential antitumor agents against the examined cancer cells in a concentration dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis showed the accumulation of hypodiploid cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase which is considered to be a marker for apoptotic cell death. As well, apoptosis was induced, by all of these extracts, with an increase in the caspase 3/7 activity and significant MMP disruption. These extracts introduce a promising option for inhibition of cancer cell metastasis. Further studies are warranted to identify the active constituents which are responsible for the anticancer properties and assessment of the dose-response relationship in vitro and in vivo.</p>
