  <p>Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry for HeLa cells treated with IC
   <sub>50</sub> of the different studied plant extracts for 48 h: (
   <bold>A</bold>) Control, (
   <bold>B</bold>) XA, (
   <bold>C</bold>) IC, (

   <bold>E</bold>) DP. While, (
   <bold>F</bold>) Comparative analysis among different plant extracts for Sub-G0/G1, G0/G1, S and G2/M Phases. The cell cycle distribution was analyzed by ModFit LT software. All results are expressed in the histogram as total percentages of cells from four different groups with mean Â± SD of three independent determinations. All data collected from experiments were performed in three replicates and analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a significance level of 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and indicated by **.
