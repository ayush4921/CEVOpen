The studied extracts inhibited the cell proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines with concentration dependent effect over time. All of these extracts mainly induced apoptosis of HeLa cells by the accumulation of hypodiploid cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase and increasing the activity of caspase 3/7, as well they showed potential MMP disturbance and expressed a marked inhibitory effect on cell migration. Assessment of probable genetic toxicity by these extracts revealed no or minimum incidence of genetic toxicity.

Introduction</title><p>Cancer is the most serious disease worldwide that is expected to increase due to the adoption of behaviors and lifestyle factors known to cause cancer [<xref rid="B1-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Toxicity and tumor resistance are currently the main limitations in using chemotherapeutic agents in cancer treatment. So, the discovery of new and safe treatment options is considered a big challenge [<xref rid="B2-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Natural products represent a great source for screening new and safe anti-cancer products [<xref rid="B3-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Plant extracts are rich in bioactive molecules based on the variety of their chemical constituents such as flavonoids, polyphenols and alkaloids which play a highly significant role in drug discovery and development process [<xref rid="B4-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>As medicinal plants represent a good alternative, especially in developing countries, many of them are used in Africa for treatment of various diseases. <italic>Xylopia aethiopica</italic> (XA) which is a member of the family Annonaceae, is used as a spice in Western and Central Africa, as well as to treat bronchitis, headache and ulceration [<xref rid="B5-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition to its anti-diabetic effect [<xref rid="B6-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], anti-anaphylactic and anti-inflammatory activities [<xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], several studies have shown that XA extracts possess antibacterial and antifungal activities [<xref rid="B8-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic>Imperata cylindrica</italic> (IC) (family Poaceae) also known as spear grass in West Africa, has diuretic, anti- inflammatory and antibacterial activities [<xref rid="B12-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

As well, an assessment of in vitro toxicity of these plant extracts was performed in non-cancerous HEK-293 cells. HeLa cells showed a higher sensitivity in cell proliferation assay upon treatment with these extracts, so further studies of the alteration and induction of cell death were investigated in HeLa cell line, by comparing the treated cells with these extracts to the untreated cells, using different assays involving cell cycle analysis, the caspase 3/7 activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). The effect of the studied medicinal plants on the inhibition of cell progression and metastasis was assessed using the wound healing assay. Furthermore, a single cell gel electrophoresis assay was performed to exclude any probable genetic toxicity upon using of these extracts in cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-pharmaceuticals-13-00357"><title>2.

A dose dependent decrease in cell viability was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f001">Figure 1</xref>). At a concentration of 50 &#x000b5;g/mL of each crude extract, DP and EG inhibited the cell growth by more than 99%, followed by XA with &#x0003e; 90% and IC with &#x0003e; 80%. The comparative IC<sub>50</sub> values of XA, IC, EG and DP for HeLa cells were shown in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f001">Figure 1</xref>E).

The results showed that all of the aforementioned extracts expressed concentration dependent cytotoxic effects against the treated cell lines. Results confirmed that DP showed the most potent antitumor activity against cervical cancer (HeLa) cancer after 72 h, among the four studied extracts, with average half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values of 17.93, 21.61 and 28.27 &#x000b5;g/mL over 72, 48 and 24 h, respectively and 37.19 &#x000b5;g/mL. While IC expressed a higher cytotoxic activity against breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) after 72 h with IC<sub>50</sub> of 27.30 &#x000b5;g/mL. EG expressed the most potent activity in growth inhibition of leukemia (HL60), while XA against glioblastoma brain cancer (U-87) with IC<sub>50</sub> of 41.05 and 35.45 &#x000b5;g/mL, respectively. In lung cancer cells (A549), DP and XA were shown the most potent effect of growth inhibition after 72 h with IC<sub>50</sub> of 39.96 and 40.79 &#x000b5;g/mL respectively. While the inhibitory effect of the studied plant extracts after 48 h against ovarian cancer (Sk-OV-3) cells was shown that DP and EG were more potent among the four extracts with IC<sub>50</sub> value of 43.86, 44.38 &#x000b5;g/mL, respectively. The four extracts have possessed closely antitumor activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) with a range from 32.99 to 53.21 &#x000b5;g/mL over 72 h. </p><p>In comparison with previous studies on a variety of Cameroonian plant extracts [<xref rid="B25-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], these findings confirm the potential anticancer activity of these four extracts in these seven cancer cell lines with concentration dependent effect over time. However, the most potent cytotoxic activity was against HeLa, HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p>According to the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) plant screening program, a crude plant extract is generally considered to have acceptable in vitro cytotoxic activity if the IC<sub>50</sub> value is less than 20 &#x000b5;g/mL after incubation 48 and 72 h treatment of cancer cell lines [<xref rid="B31-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

Live/Dead Staining</title><p>A live/dead assay was performed to confirm the cytotoxic activity of the four plant extracts against HeLa cell line. Cells were treated with a concentration of 30 &#x000b5;g/mL of each crude extract over 24, 48 and 72 h. Then, dual staining with fluorescence dyes was performed using calcein-AM and propidium iodide. The results showed a significant decrease in viable cells after being with the extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Data confirmed the cytotoxic activity of these extracts with time dependent manners. As the percentage of viable cells of untreated cells was 97.10 &#x000b1; 0.8% after 72 h, while the percentage of viable cells decreased to 75.36 &#x000b1; 5.5%, 60.36 &#x000b1; 4.3% and 49.46 &#x000b1; 3.8% after cell treatment with XA over 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively. After treatment of cells with IC, viable cells decreased to 85 &#x000b1; 2.4%, 75.25 &#x000b1; 5.7% and 56.79 &#x000b1; 4.9% over 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively.

Cell Cycle Analysis</title><p>To investigate the mechanism of growth inhibition, the effect of the four studied crude extract on the cell cycle distribution of HeLa cells were analyzed after 48 h of the treatment of cells with the concentration of IC<sub>50</sub> obtained from the MTT assay, followed by fixation and PI staining. The cell cycle arrest was analyzed using flow cytometry. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f005">Figure 5</xref> show an obvious alteration of the distribution of different phases. The cell population was seen to be increasingly accumulated at the SubG0/G1 phase upon treatment with the studied extracts. Compared to the untreated cells that showed a percentage of 6.02 &#x000b1; 1.94% in this phase, XA and IC showed a considerable increase with percentages of 18.03 &#x000b1; 1.94% and 14.91 &#x000b1; 1.16%, respectively, while EG and DP significantly increased the accumulation of hypodiploid cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase with percentages of 38.88 &#x000b1; 2.84% and 44.51 &#x000b1; 1.73%, respectively. The data showed that there was no significant change in cell arrest in all other phases. The results suggest that HeLa cells underwent apoptosis upon treatment with the studied plant extracts.</p><p>Plant extracts exert their cytotoxic effects through common mechanisms including cell cycle arrest and cell death by apoptosis. The potential of anticancer agents is evaluated by the ability to initiate cell cycle arrest in cancer cells [<xref rid="B32-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Production of apoptotic cells, which are resulting from DNA fragmentation, display a broad hypo-diploid sub-G0/G1 peak which is easily detected with sufficient loss of cellular DNA and can be discriminated by flow cytometry [<xref rid="B33-pharmaceuticals-13-00357" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Corresponding to these findings, in the present study, the four studied extracts have the potential to cause sufficient DNA loss to induce apoptosis, as the accumulation of hypodiploid cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase is an indication of apoptotic cell death. Several intracellular cascades, such as the activation of caspases and the disruption of MMP would be a confirmation for apoptosis. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-pharmaceuticals-13-00357"><title>2.5. Annexin V-FITC/PI for Apoptosis Detection</title><p>In order to verify that the effect of the studied extracts on the growth inhibition of HeLa cells was related to apoptosis, analysis of the apoptotic and necrotic cells was performed using Annexin V. After 48 h of the treatment with the IC<sub>50</sub> of the four extracts, a double labelling was done with PI that staining the necrotic cells with red fluorescence and Annexin V-FITC which produce cytoplasmic green labelling for apoptotic cells. Images from fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00357-f006">Figure 6</xref>A), showed that viable cells were negative for both PI and Annexin V.

As well, apoptosis was induced, by all of these extracts, with an increase in the caspase 3/7 activity and significant MMP disruption. These extracts introduce a promising option for inhibition of cancer cell metastasis. Further studies are warranted to identify the active constituents which are responsible for the anticancer properties and assessment of the dose-response relationship in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Authors would like to extend thanks to Yousef Jameel Foundation for providing the Scholarship funding and C.
