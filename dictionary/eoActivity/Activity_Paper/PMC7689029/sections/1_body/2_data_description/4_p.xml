<p id="para0011">The Tibetan plateau and the wider transregional Himalayas alone comprise a diverse range of ecosystems from tropical zones at the bases of mountain subranges to permanent ice, snow and stark, glaciated terrain at the highest elevations. These wide-ranging climates as well as varied rainfall, altitude, geologies and soils, also support an extensive and diverse range of flora and fauna, including highly distinct forms of plant and animal communities. The Himalayan region contains almost 10,000 plant species comprising 2.5% of the world's angiosperm diversity from which 4000 species are endemics 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Ongoing research is interested in how Himalayan flora achieved such high endemic plant diversity from the initial immigrant taxa that populated the region, with initial hypotheses investigating the role of major periodic geophysical upheavals that disrupted ecosystem stability and injected biological diversification
