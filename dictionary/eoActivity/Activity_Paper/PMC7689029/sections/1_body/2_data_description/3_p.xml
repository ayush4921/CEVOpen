<p id="para0010">This dataset provides the most rigorously analyzed identifications and classifications of Sowa Rigpa materia medica botanicals used in Tibet to date, following Gawé Dorjé’s 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> classification system (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>). The data update his most recent identifications 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; re-analyze them according to databases cataloging research on regional herbarium botanical specimens, geographic distributions and regional plant chemistry studies; confirm the most current accepted names; and re-categorize them by ethnobotanical class. This dataset results from an investigation of the proper identifications for 700 of the most commonly used specimens in the Tibetan materia medica. This botanical knowledge provides the foundational medicinal plant resource for Tibetan medicine as applied across the three regions of Tibet—Central Tibet and the two eastern regions of Kham and Amdo that stretch across present-day Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, as well as the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR). It also provides a cross-reference to other compilations in Tibet and those focused on Sowa Rigpa botanicals used in India, Nepal, Bhutan and Mongolia (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>), facilitating rich comparisons of the tradition's botanical plasticity 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The geography represented by this medical flora encompasses a land mass spanning about 2.5 million km
 <sup>2</sup>, equivalent to the size of central Europe. Historic trade along the Silk Route provided a major resource for some of the most potent materia medica principally used in Sowa Rigpa and facilitated access to these important medicinal materials across the various regions of its scope on the Tibetan plateau, north India, Nepal, Bhutan, Mongolia, and areas of Russia, such as Buryatia, Kalmykia and Tuva. Likewise, representations from these various regions also provide significant contributions to the materia medica herein due to these rich systems of exchange. However, the principal regions from which the greatest specimen numbers of Sowa Rigpa materia medica derive are the Tibetan plateau itself, followed by the Indian subcontinent, subtropical areas of mainland China, and eastern parts of central Asia.
