 <italic>Gso ba rig pa</italic>) 
 <xref rid="bib0004a" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, which is one of Asia's great scholarly traditional medical systems alongside Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda and Unani 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Emergent between the seventh and twelfth centuries CE, it spread most significantly in the thirteenth and seventeenth centuries CE, transmitting across the Tibetan plateau, Mongolia and the Himalayas. Today, it still provides a central healthcare resource for populations across a large region of Asia, including Tibetan regions of China, Mongolia, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and culturally-related areas of Russia. Though influenced significantly by indigenously Tibetan foundational contributions, it integrates medical knowledge from Indian, Chinese, Persian, and Central Asian sources. The pharmacology of Sowa Rigpa comprises complex multi-compound, rigorously processed formulas of a wide range of herbs, minerals, metals and animal product ingredients 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Formulas can range from several ingredients to upward of 140 ingredients in a single pill.
