<p id="para0024">WFO is also an open-access, online database of the world's plant species built out of the updated Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010. It includes existing knowledge and published floras, checklists and revisions. The Plant List (TPL) 
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> was built out of the 2002â€“2010 GSPC to provide a working list of all known plant species produced by the botanical community. It was developed to provide the currently accepted name used in preference to refer to the species, subspecies, variety or form; the author or authors credited with publishing that name; the place and date of the original publication in which the name was supplied; a reference to the source database supplying the name record that recorded the opinion that it is an accepted name with, where possible, a link to that record in the source database; and other names (synonyms) considered to refer to that species. TPL provided the taxonomic backbone for the WFO but has been static since 2013. WFO now provides the most updated source.
