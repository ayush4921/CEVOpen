<p id="para0023">Kew-MPNS is an online database managed by Kew Royal Botanical Gardens of medicinal plant data and medical citations of literature published under available pharmaceutical, drug, common and scientific plant names that are continuously validated and updated through embedded persistent digital identifiers that also correct for spelling, reconcile detected ambiguities and duplications. Kew-MPNS provides a global database of modern plant taxonomy for medicinal plants. WCSP is a live and daily updated compiled database of peer reviewed data on all accepted taxa of plant families by the Kew Royal Botanic Gardens. Newly published names are automatically added from the International Plant Names Index (IPNI)
