<p id="para0021">It is in the endeavor of consultation with the current authors that Gawé Dorjé requested an official dataset of identifications be developed in accordance with the most recent ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological research as well as the currently accepted names of Latin binomial nomenclature. With the founding of a new research department at the Ethnic Medicine College of Chengdu University of Traditional Medicine, the current authors were able to draw upon a comprehensive database called the Northwest Minority Medical Database (

With Gawé Dorjé’s rigorous methodology in traditional identification and confirmation of the materia medica with scholars across Tibet and initial Latin botanical identifications, the research team was able to reanalyze the data using keyword phrases across 410 ancient Tibetan medical texts, over 1500 compounded formulas and more than 3000 medicinal compounds to confirm the proper Latin botanical identifications. The research team also drew upon a database that catalogues proper identifications through regional herbarium botanical specimens (as recommended for identification and authentication studies

Such methodology has provided extensive new investigation possibilities in the field of Tibetan medical informatics
