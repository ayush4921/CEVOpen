<p id="para0022">The coauthors identified 690 materia medica specimens that represent the most commonly used specimens in Tibetan medicinal formulas. This assessment was done through frequency analysis of ingredients of formulas primarily used in Qinghai, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and the hospitals and clinics of Lhasa and other centers in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. These specimens were confirmed with Latin botanical identifications to species level. The updated Latin botanical names for the dataset were provided for each materia medica specimen using Kew's Medicinal Plant Names Services (Kew-MPNS)
