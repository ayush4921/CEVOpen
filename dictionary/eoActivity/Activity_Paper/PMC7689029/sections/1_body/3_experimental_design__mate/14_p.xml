<p id="para0027">MPNS and WFO draw from IPNI for the published recognized botanical name, while additionally incorporating current opinions from experts on the relevant taxonomic groups. Taxonomic revisions of entire groups that occur because of previous errors in published names, misidentified specimens and propagation of old names. Thus, this dataset represents the dynamic nature of botanical taxonomy that includes constant developments and updates from newfound sequencing data. However, since botanical taxonomy still prioritizes the oldest accurately published name or specimen, this list also represents the conservatism of the field.</p>
