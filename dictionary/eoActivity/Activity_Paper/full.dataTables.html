Based on NMR results, the compound's structure is identical to that of vanicoside A, comprising four phenylpropanoid ester units and a sucrose unit. The structure differences were located at C-3″″'. The cytotoxic activity of polygonumins A was evaluated on several cancer cell lines by a cell viability assay using tetrazolium dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). The compound showed the highest antiproliferative (p &lt; 0.05) activities against K562 (Human Leukaemia Cell Line), MCF7 (Human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), and HCT116 (Colorectal cancer cells) cells. Cytotoxic studies against V79-4 cells were carried out and showed that polygonumins A was toxic at 50 µg/ml, suggesting that this compound may be used as an anticancer drug without affecting normal cells. Polygonumins A also showed promising activity as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor with 56% relative inhibition. Molecular docking results indicated that the compound possesses high binding affinity towards the HIV protease over the low binding free energy range of -10.5 to -11.3 kcal/mol. P. minus is used in Malaysian traditional medicine for the treatment of tumour cells. This is the first report on the use of P. minus as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor.">

The BTA scaffolds showed a crucial role in the inhibition of the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). In this review an extensive literature survey over the last decade discloses the role of BTA derivatives mainly as anticancer agents. Such compounds are effective against various types of cancer cell lines through a multitude of mechanisms, some of which are poorly studied or understood. The inhibition of tumour associated CAs by BTA derivatives is on the other hand better investigated and such compounds may serve as anticancer leads for the development of agents effective against hypoxic tumours.">

Few compounds belonging to the proposed series were reported as CSF1R/DAPK1 inhibitors as anti-tauopathies. However, the correlation between CSF1R/DAPK1 signalling pathways and cancer progression provides motives to reprofile them against cancer therapy. The compounds were synthesised, characterized, and evaluated against M-NFS-60 cells and a kinase panel which bolstered predictions of their antiproliferative activity and suggested the involvement of diverse molecular targets. Compound &lt;b&gt;6e&lt;/b&gt;, the most potent in the series, showed prominent broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity inhibiting the growth of hematological, NSCLC, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, prostate and breast cancers by 84.1, 52.79, 72.15, 66.34, 66.48, 51.55, 55.95, 61.85, and 60.87%, respectively. Additionally, it elicited an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 1.97 µM against M-NFS-60 cells and good GIT absorption with P&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; value of 19.0 ± 1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-6 &lt;/sup&gt;cm/s (PAMPA-GIT). Molecular docking study for &lt;b&gt;6e&lt;/b&gt; with CSF1R and DAPK1 was done to help to understand the binding mode with both kinases.

Its activity was higher than fluconazole and similar to voriconazole on &lt;i&gt;C. glabrata&lt;/i&gt; (MIC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.25, 64 and 1 µg/mL, respectively), &lt;i&gt;C. krusei&lt;/i&gt; (MIC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.125, 64 and 0.125 µg/mL, respectively) and &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; (MIC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.5, 8 and 0.25 µg/mL, respectively). The action mechanisms of &lt;b&gt;8 g&lt;/b&gt; were also identified as inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis and phospholipase A2-like activity. At concentration as low as 4 ng/mL, 8g inhibited ergosterol production by 82% and induced production of 14a-methyl sterols, that is comparable to the results obtained with fluconazole at higher concentration. &lt;b&gt;8 g&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated moderate inhibitory effect on phospholipase A2-like activity being a putative virulence factor. Due to a low MRC5 cytotoxicity, this compound presents a high therapeutic index. These results pointed out that &lt;b&gt;8 g&lt;/b&gt; is a new lead antifungal candidate with potent ergosterol biosynthesis inhibition.">

        <span class="abst" title="Medicinal plants and plant remedies have been in use in Ethiopia for centuries. Studies on ethnobotany, ethnomedicine, and ethnoveterinary estimate that nearly 80% of Ethiopians use some type of medicinal plants and plant remedies. Medicinal plants are regarded as the most important and sometimes the only source of therapeutics in the country. Some 800 plant species are used as sources of medicine to treat about 300 physical and mental disorders. However, because these plant species are not adequately studied, there is a big limitation in their documentation, profiling, and management. Moreover, there is a continuous loss of knowledge about medicinal plants because the communities and people are adopting new lifestyles. Hence, this article reports the finding of a study aimed at providing the gross phytochemical characteristics and antimicrobial activities of ethanol and aqueous extracts of fruit, leaf, and stem of Solanum incanum L. against two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi) and two Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria for developing gross antimicrobial profile of the plant. Phytochemical screening of fruit, leaf, and stem extracts of S. incanum has shown that it is the source of alkaloids, saponins, flavonoids, glycosides, terpenoids, and steroids. According to agar disc-diffusion tests, 100 mg/mL extracts of the plant produced bacterial growth inhibition zones of 0.00 to 16.06 mm. Ethanol and aqueous leaf extracts produced inhibition zones ranging from 11.34 to 16.06 mm against all bacterial species. The greatest inhibition zone of 16.06 mm was recorded in E. coli subjected to ethanol leaf extract. The same extract resulted in a growth inhibition zone of 16.04 mm in S. aureus. The greatest growth inhibition zones in B. subtilis (13.34 mm) and S. typhi (11.56 mm) were observed with ethanol leaf and fruit extracts, respectively. Aqueous leaf extracts produced growth inhibition zones ranging from 10.45 mm (for S. typhi) to 14.02 mm (for E. coli). Ethanol leaf extracts resulted in the lowest Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) of 1.56 mg/mL in E. coli and S. aureus. Therefore, fruits, leaves, and stems of S. incanum can be regarded as good sources of some bioactive compounds. The findings are important for taking measures for conservation and sustainable use of the plant as well as for further elucidation of its phytochemistry and antimicrobial efficacy of its constituents.">

Boerhaavia diffusa Linn. (Nyctaginaceae), Rheum emodi Wall. Ex. Meissn. (Polygonaceae), Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. (Nelumbonaceae) and Crataeva nurvala Buch-Ham. (Capparidaceae) are well-recognized medicinal plants of Indian traditional system of medicine used for kidney disorders.Objectives: The present investigation was undertaken to develop a chromatographically characterized polyherbal combination and to evaluate its nephroprotective activity.Materials and methods: Roots of B. diffusa and R. emodi, flowers of N. nucifera and stem bark of C. nurvala were extracted by decoction using 70% ethanol. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used for the optimization of extraction parameters. Polyherbal combinations with different doses (150-300 mg/kg) were tested against methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity in Wistar rats.Results: The optimized extract contained 27% phenols and 15% flavonoids, which showed 75% 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging potential. Based on the retention time of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, 17 out of 122 constituents were found common in all extracts and combinations. Two combinations showed significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) DPPH scavenging potential and xanthine oxidase inhibition. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the best combination for DPPH scavenging and xanthine oxidase inhibition were 80 and 74 µg/mL, respectively. Treatment of methotrexate-induced nephrotoxic rats with polyherbal combination significantly (p ≤ 0.05) improved the kidney function markers, oxidative stress markers and histological parameters.Discussion and conclusion: The developed combination was found to be effective in nephrotoxicity; it can be explored further for the management of drug-induced nephrotoxicity and other chronic kidney diseases.">

Strains were isolated by special pretreatment of plant tissues and identified based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences, and their antimicrobial activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated. A total of 126 endophytic actinobacteria belonging to two classes, eight orders, 14 families, and 24 genera were isolated from different organs at the Ili and Tacheng sites. In addition, the diversity of culturable endophytic actinobacteria genera was higher at Tacheng site (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 71, 56.35%) than the Ili site (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 55, 43.65%). A neighbor-joining tree of 126 isolated actinobacteria showing the phylogenetic relationships based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and the genus &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; was the most dominant isolate. The number of endophytic actinobacteria genera obtained from root tissues (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 54, 42.86%) was higher compared to stem (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35, 27.78%) and leaf tissue (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 37, 29.36%). Among 126 endophytic actinobacteria, 54 strains were antagonistic against at least one or more indicator organisms &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Notably, most strains of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; proved antagonistic activities. For example, strain T4SB028, namely &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces polyantibioticus&lt;/i&gt;, showed the highest inhibition ratio reached 67.06, 64.20, and 70.55% against &lt;i&gt;Alternaria solani&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Valsa malicola&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Valsa mali&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The results demonstrate that about 30.95%, 23.01% of the tested endophytic actinobacteria were capable of producing siderophores and chitinase, respectively. Additionally, the results of the amplification of biosynthetic genes polyketide synthetase (&lt;i&gt;PKS-I&lt;/i&gt;) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (&lt;i&gt;NRPS&lt;/i&gt;) indicated that at least one antibiotic biosynthetic gene was detected in 27 (50%) of the tested strains. Our result emphasizes that the endophytic actinobacteria communities are different based on the plant tissues and the geographical environment of the sampled area. Thus, we conclude that &lt;i&gt;T. roseus&lt;/i&gt; Schipcz. provided a rich source of endophytic actinobacteria that exhibited a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent.">

        <span class="abst" title="The burden of neoplastic diseases is a significant global health challenge accounting for thousands of deaths. In Uganda, about 32,617 cancer cases were reported in 2018, accompanied by 21,829 deaths. In a view to identify some potential anticancer plant candidates for possible drug development, the current study was designed to compile the inventory of plants with reported anticancer activity used in rural Uganda and the evidences supporting their use in cancer therapy. An electronic survey in multidisciplinary databases revealed that 29 plant species belonging to 28 genera distributed among 24 families have been reported to be used in the management of cancer in Uganda. Anticancer plants were majorly from the families Bignoniaceae (7%), Caricaceae (7%), Fabaceae (7%), Moraceae (7%), and Rutaceae (7%). Most species occur in the wild (52%), though some are cultivated (48%). The growth habit of the plants is as trees (55%) or herbs (45%). Anticancer extracts are usually prepared from leaves (29%), bark (24%), roots (21%), and fruits (13%) through decoctions (53%), as food spices (23%) or pounded to produce ointments that are applied topically (10%). Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman, Opuntia species, Albizia coriaria (Welw. ex Oliver), Daucus carota L., Cyperus alatus (Nees) F. Muell., Markhamia lutea (Benth.) K. Schum., and Oxalis corniculata L. were the most frequently encountered species. As per global reports, Allium sativum L., Annona muricata L., Carica papaya L., Moringa oleifera Lam., Opuntia species, Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman, and Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don. are the most studied species, with the latter having vincristine and vinblastine anticancer drugs developed from it. Prostate, cervical, breast, and skin cancers are the top traditionally treated malignancies. There is a need to isolate and evaluate the anticancer potential of the bioactive compounds in the unstudied claimed plants, such as Cyperus alatus (Nees) F. Muell., Ficus dawei Hutch., Ficus natalensis Hochst., and Lovoa trichilioides Harms, and elucidate their mechanism of anticancer activity.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV) results in economic losses in the swine industry globally. Several studies have investigated the use of plant extracts in the prevention and control of PRRS outbreaks. Thai medicinal plants may be useful for treating PRRSV infection in pigs. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro anti-PRRSV and antioxidant properties of seven Thai medicinal plants: Caesalpinia sappan Linn., Garcinia mangostana Linn., Houttuynia cordata, Perilla frutescens, Clinacanthus nutans, Phyllanthus emblica, and Tiliacora triandra.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Using antiviral screening, we observed that T. triandra extract strongly inhibited PRRSV infectivity in MARC-145 cells [virus titer 3.5 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;)/ml (log10)] at 24 h post-infection, whereas C. sappan extract strongly inhibited PRRSV replication [virus titer 2.5 TCID&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;/ml (log10)] at 72 h post-infection. C. sappan extract had the highest total phenolic content [220.52 mM gallic acid equivalent/g] and lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration [1.17 mg/ml in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2.58 mg/ml in 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt].&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;T. triandra extract could inhibit PRRSV infectivity, whereas C. sappan extract was the most effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. This study elucidates the antiviral activities of Thai medicinal plant extracts in vivo. The results promise that Thai medicinal plant extracts, particularly T. triandra and C. sappan extracts, can be developed into pharmaceutical drugs for the prevention of PRRS in pigs.">

The present work was aimed at identifying the chemical composition and the antioxidant and antiproliferative activities of hydroethanolic and bioactive compound classes of C. europaea) is a medicinal plant used in Moroccan popular medicine. Materials and Methods. The chemical composition was analyzed using HPLC. The antioxidant power was determined using both DPPH and FRAP assays. The antiproliferative activity was effectuated against cancerous cells using WST-1. Results:The chemical analysis showed the presence of bioactive constituents such as quercetin, myricetin, and hesperetin. The polyphenol and flavonoid contents were estimated at 51.42 mg GA/g and 20.06 mg EQ/g, respectively. The EC50 values of FRAP assay of hydroethanolic, flavonoid, saponin, and mucilage extracts were 5.196 mg/ml, 4.537 mg/ml, 3.05 mg/ml, and 6.02 mg/ml, respectively. The obtained IC50 values with the DPPH test were 1.628 mg/ml, 1.05 mg/ml, 1.94 mg/ml, and 9.674 mg/ml, respectively. Regarding MDA-MB-231, saponins were highly effective even with the lowest concentration (15.62 μg/ml). The flavonoids decreased the cell viability with IC50 values of 43.62 ± 0.06 μg/ml). The flavonoids decreased the cell viability with IC50 values of 43.62 ± 0.06 μg/ml). The flavonoids decreased the cell viability with IC50 values of 43.62 ± 0.06 . Conclusion:The present results suggest that C. europaea) is a medicinal plant used in Moroccan popular medicine.">

        <span class="abst" title="In the current medical era, spirooxindole motif stands out as a privileged heterospirocyclic scaffold that represents the core for a wide range of bioactive naturally isolated products (such as Strychnofoline and spirotryprostatins A and B) and synthetic compounds. Interestingly, no much attention has been paid to develop spirooxindole derivatives with dual antioxidant and anticancer activities. In this context, a series of spirooxindoles 6a-p was examined for their anticancer effect towards HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines. Spirooxindole 6a was found to be an efficient anti-proliferative agent towards both HepG2 and PC-3 cells (IC50 = 6.9 and 11.8 µM, respectively). Afterwards, spirooxindole 6a was assessed for its apoptosis induction potential in HepG2 cells, where its pro-apoptotic impact was approved via the significant elevation in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the expression levels of caspase-3.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Fomitopsis pinicola&lt;/i&gt; (Sw. Karst) is a common bracket fungus, with a woody texture. It is found predominantly in coniferous forests in temperate regions throughout Europe and Asia. &lt;i&gt;Fomitopsis pinicola&lt;/i&gt; has been extensively used for medicinal purposes, particularly in Chinese and Korean traditional medicine. In this mini-review, the anti-cancer characteristics of F. pinicola extracts were investigated. In vitro experiments revealed the pro-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of extracts, whilst two of three in vivo studies reported an inhibition of tumour growth and prolonged survival. Only studies wherein fungal specimens were sourced from Europe or Asia were included in this review, as samples sourced as &lt;i&gt;F. pinicola&lt;/i&gt; from North America were probably not &lt;i&gt;F. pinicola&lt;/i&gt;, but a different species. Although not one of the most revered fungal species, F. pinicola has been used as a medicinal fungus for centuries, as well as consumed as a health food supplement. To date, the results from only three in vivo studies, investigating anti-cancer properties, have been published. Further studies, using comprehensively identified specimens, are required to fully elucidate the anti-cancer properties of F. pinicola extracts.">

Thus, this study evaluated the phytochemical and antioxidant properties of wild and cultivated Alepidea amatymbica. Acetone, methanol, and water extracts of the rhizome of wild and cultivated A. amatymbica were evaluated for total phenol, flavonol, flavonoid, tannin, proanthocyanidin, saponin, and alkaloid contents using spectrophotometric methods. In vitro antioxidant activity was measured using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrogen peroxide assays. The wild extracts had higher phytochemical contents in most of the assays than cultivated extracts. Total phenol in the wild extracts ranged from 32.30 to 117.8 mg GAE/g with the acetone extracts having the highest content while the water extracts were the least. The range in the total phenol of the cultivated species was 66.46 to 98.44 mg GAE/g with the methanol extracts having the highest content while water extracts was the least. The flavonoid content ranged from 55.01 to 99.09 mg QE/g and from 48.65 to 67.32 mg QE/g for the wild and cultivated plants, respectively. The alkaloid contents ranged from 14.70 to 17.80% in the wild species while it ranged from 11.98 to 13.21% in the cultivated species. The wild species also showed higher antioxidant activities in most of the assays evaluated. This study has implications for both pharmacological and conservation purposes.">

Among these, &lt;i&gt;Ruta chalepensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vernonia amygdalina&lt;/i&gt; were claimed to have antidiarrheal activity in Ethiopian folklore medicine. Hence, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the antidiarrheal activity of the crude extracts of &lt;i&gt;Ruta chalepensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vernonia amygdalina&lt;/i&gt; in mice.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The crude extracts were obtained by cold maceration with 80% methanol, and its antidiarrheal activities were evaluated using a castor oil-induced diarrheal model. The test groups were treated with 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg body weight (bw) of the crude extract of each plant, while the positive controls and negative controls were given loperamide (3 mg/kg.bw) and 2% Tween 80 (10 ml/kg.bw), respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In the castor oil-induced model, the crude extract of &lt;i&gt;Ruta chalepensis&lt;/i&gt; (200 and 400 mg/kg.bw) significantly prolonged the onset of diarrhea in mice. Besides, it also showed a significant reduction in the frequency of stooling and weight of feces. Contrastingly, the crude extract of &lt;i&gt;Vernonia amygdalina&lt;/i&gt; had a significant effect in delaying the onset of time of diarrhea and reduction of the frequency of stool and the weight of feces only at the maximum tested dose (400 mg/kg.bw).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The present study demonstrated that the crude leaves extract of &lt;i&gt;Ruta chalepensis&lt;/i&gt; (200 and 400 mg/kg.bw) and &lt;i&gt;Vernonia amygdalina&lt;/i&gt; (400 mg/kg.bw) possessed significant antidiarrheal activity in the castor oil-induced diarrheal model.">

The antifungal effects of extracts were evaluated against &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani&lt;/i&gt; K &lt;b&gt;(&lt;/b&gt;FsK).&lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The highest RA contents of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; plants were 50 mg/L MeJA (140.99 mg/g DW) and 250 mg/L MWCNTs (140.49 mg/g DW). The highest &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; were 24 h MWCNTs (7.13 mg/g DW) and 72 h SA (9.12 mg/g DW). The maximum POD and APX activities were at 100 mg/L MeJA (5 and 4 mg protein, respectively). CAT had the highest activities at 50 mg/L MeJA (2 mg protein). DPPH and β-carotene showed 50% and 80% inhibition, respectively. The FsK aggregation was the lowest for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; extract in number of conidia [1.82 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;], fresh weight (6.51 g) and dry weight (0.21 g) that proved RA inhibitory effects. The callus reduces FsK growth diameter to 2.75 on the 5th day.&lt;b&gt;Discussion and conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Application of MeJA, SA, and MWCNTSs could increase RA in &lt;i&gt;S. khuzistanica&lt;/i&gt; and highlighted potential characteristics in pharmaceutical and antifungal effects.">

Methods:In this research, the antimicrobial activities of chloroformic and methanolic extracts of Sophora flavescens, Rhaponticum repens, Alhagi maurorum, Melia azedarach, Peganum harmala, and Juncus conglomeratus were evaluated against 8 bacteria (S. aureus, B. subtilis, R. toxicus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, P. syringae, X. campestris, P. viridiflava) and 3 fungi (Pyricularia oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum and Botrytis cinerea), through disc diffusion method. Furthermore, the essential oils of plants with the highest antibacterial activity were analyzed utilizing GC/MS. Moreover, the tested plants were exposed to screening for possible antioxidant effect utilizing DPPH test, guaiacol peroxidas, and catalase enzymes. Besides, the amount of total phenol and flavonoid of these plants was measured. Results:Among the tested plants, methanolic and chloroformic extracts of P. harmala fruits showed the highest antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria. Besides, the investigation of free radical scavenging effects of the tested plants indicated the highest DPPH, protein, guaiacol peroxidase, and catalase in P. harmala, M. azedarach, J. conglomeratus fruits, and J. conglomeratus fruits, respectively. In addition, the phytochemical analysis demonstrated the greatest amounts of total phenolic and flavonoid compositions in J. conglomeratus and P. harmala, respectively. Conclusion:The results indicated that these plants could act as a promising antimicrobial agent, due to their short killing time.">

        <span class="abst" title="There is no ethnobotanical study conducted specifically on medicinal plants traditionally used to treat cancer in Ethiopia. Yet, traditional herbalists in different parts of the country claim that they have been treating cancer-like symptoms using herbal remedies. The objective of this study was to document medicinal plants traditionally used to treat cancer-like symptoms in eleven districts, Ethiopia. Traditional herbalists were interviewed using semistructured questionnaires, and field visits were also carried out to collect claimed plants for identification purpose. Seventy-four traditional herbalists, who claimed that they knew about and/or had used medicinal plants to treat cancer-like symptoms, were selected using the snowball method and interviewed. Herbalists used their intuition and relied on the chronicity, growth of external mass, and spreading of the disease to other parts of the body, as a means to characterize cancer symptoms. Furthermore, in some of the study districts, herbalists reported that they treat patients who had already been diagnosed in modern healthcare institutions prior to seeking help from them. The inventory of medicinal plants is summarized in a synoptic table, which contains the scientific and vernacular names of the plants, their geographical location, the parts of the plants, and the methods used to prepare the remedies. A total of 53 traditionally used anticancer plants, belonging to 30 families, were identified during the survey. The most frequently reported anticancer plants were Acmella caulirhiza Del (Asteraceae), Clematis simensis Fresen. (Ranunculaceae), Croton macrostachyus Del. (Euphorbiaceae), and Dorstenia barnimiana Schweinf. (Moraceae). Organizing traditional healers, documenting their indigenous knowledge, and scientifically validating it for the development of better cancer therapeutic agents constitute an urgent and important task for policymakers and scientists.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Infections by microbes (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) and parasites can cause serious diseases in both humans and animals. Heavy use of antimicrobials has created selective pressure and caused resistance to currently available antibiotics, hence the need for finding new and better antibiotics. Natural products, especially from plants, are known for their medicinal properties, including antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities. Geoclimatic variation, together with diversity in ethnomedicinal traditions, has made the Himalayas of Nepal an invaluable repository of traditional medicinal plants. We studied antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic activities of medicinal plants, selected based upon ethnobotanical evidence. Methods:Ethanolic and methanolic extracts were tested (1) on a panel of microbes: two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria innocua), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica, and Shigella sonnei), and one fungal species: Candida albicans; (2) against three different viruses: yellow fever, chikungunya, and enterovirus; and (3) on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Also, cytotoxicity was assessed on human hepatoma (Huh), rhabdosarcoma (RD), and Vero (VC) cell lines. Results:Of 18 plants studied, Ampelocissus tomentosa and Aleuritopteris anceps inhibited S. aureus (MIC 35 μg/mL and 649 μg/mL, respectively) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 15 μg/mL and 38 μg/mL, respectively). Rhododendron arboreum and Adhatoda vasica inhibited S. enterica (MIC 285 μg/mL and 326 μg/mL, respectively). Kalanchoe pinnata, Ampelocissus tomentosa, and Paris polyphylla were active against chikungunya virus, and Clerodendrum serratum was active against yellow fever virus (EC50 15.9 μg/mL); Terminalia chebula was active against enterovirus (EC50 10.6 μg/mL). Ampelocissus tomentosa, Boenninghausenia albiflora, Dichrocephala integrifolia, and Kalanchoe pinnata significantly reduced C. elegans motility, comparable to levamisole. Conclusions:In countries like Nepal, with a high burden of infectious and parasitic diseases, and a current health system unable to combat the burden of diseases, evaluation of local plants as a treatment or potential source of drugs can help expand treatment options. Screening plants against a broad range of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) will support bioprospecting in Nepal, which may eventually lead to new drug development.">

        <span class="abst" title="Isoetes sinensis Palmer is a critically endangered, first-class protected plant in China. Until now, researchers have primarily focused on the ultrastructure, phylogeny, and transcriptomes of the plant. However, flavonoid profiles and bioactivity of I. sinensis have not been extensively investigated. To develop the endangered I. sinensis for edible and medicinal purposes, flavonoid content, chemical constitution, and antioxidant activities were investigated in this study. Results revealed the following. 1) The total flavonoid content was determined as 10.74 ± 0.25 mg/g., 2) Antioxidant activities were stronger than most ferns, especially ABTS free radical scavenging activities. 3) Four flavones, containing apigenin, apigenin-7-glucuronide, acacetin-7-O-glcopyranoside, and homoplantageninisoetin; four flavonols, namely, isoetin, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-[6&quot;-O-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl)-β-D-glucopyranoside], and limocitrin-Neo; one prodelphinidin (procyanidins;) and one nothofagin (dihydrochalcone) were tentatively identified in the mass spectrometry-DAD (254nm) chromatograms. This study was the first to report on flavonoid content and antioxidant activities of I. sinensis. Stronger antioxidant activity and flavonoid content suggests that the endangered I. sinensis is an important and potentially edible and medicinal plant.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Ethnoveterinary medicine is crucial in many rural areas of the world since people living in remote and marginal areas rely significantly on traditional herbal therapies to treat their domestic animals. In Pakistan, communities residing in remote areas, and especially those still attached to pastoralist traditions, have considerable ethnoveterinary herbal knowledge and they sometimes use this knowledge for treating their animals. The main aim of the study was to review the literature about ethnoveterinary herbals being used in Pakistan in order to articulate potential applications in modern veterinary medicine. Moreover, the review aimed to analyze possible cross-cultural and cross regional differences. METHODS:We considered the ethnobotanical data of Pakistan published in different scientific journals from 2004 to 2018. A total of 35 studies were found on ethnoveterinary herbal medicines in the country. Due to the low number of field studies, we considered all peer-reviewed articles on ethnoveterinary herbal practices in the current review. All the ethnobotanical information included in these studies derived from interviews which were conducted with shepherds/animals breeders as well as healers. RESULTS:Data from the reviewed studies showed that 474 plant species corresponding to 2386 remedies have been used for treating domestic animals in Pakistan. The majority of these plants belong to Poaceae (41 species) followed by the Asteraceae (32 species) and Fabaceae (29 species) botanical families, thus indicating a possible prevalence of horticultural-driven gathering patterns. Digestive problems were the most commonly treated diseases (25%; 606 remedies used), revealing the preference that locals have for treating mainly minor animal ailments with herbs. The least known veterinary plants recorded in Pakistan were Abutilon theophrasti, Agrostis gigantea, Allardia tomentosa, Aristida adscensionis, Bothriochloa bladhii, Buddleja asiatica, Cocculus hirsutus, Cochlospermum religiosum, Cynanchum viminale, Dactylis glomerata, Debregeasia saeneb, Dichanthium annulatum, Dracocephalum nuristanicum, Flueggea leucopyrus, Launaea nudicaulis, Litsea monopetala, Sibbaldianthe bifurca, Spiraea altaica, and Thalictrum foetidum. More importantly, cross-cultural comparative analysis of Pathan and non-Pathan ethnic communities showed that 28% of the veterinary plants were mentioned by both communities. Cross-regional comparison demonstrated that only 10% of the plant species were used in both mountain and plain areas. Reviewed data confirm therefore that both ecological and cultural factors play a crucial role in shaping traditional plant uses. CONCLUSION:The herbal ethnoveterinary heritage of Pakistan is remarkable, possibly because of the pastoral origins of most of its peoples. The integration of the analyzed complex bio-cultural heritage into daily veterinary practices should be urgently fostered by governmental and non-governmental institutions dealing with rural development policies in order to promote the use of local biodiversity for improving animal well-being and possibly the quality of animal food products as well.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;African Traditional Medicine (ATM) is used for the healthcare of about 80% of the rural populations of the continent of Africa. The practices of ATM make use of plant-products, which are known to contain plant-based secondary metabolites or natural products (NPs), likely to play key roles in drug discovery, particularly as lead compounds. For various reasons, including resistance of strains of Plasmodium to known anti-malarial drugs, local African populations often resort to plant-based treatments and/or a combination of this and standard anti-malarial regimens. Emphasis has been laid in this review to present the anti-malarial virtue of the most recently published phytochemicals or natural products, which have been tested by in vitro and in vivo assays.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The data was based on the current version of the African Compound Libraries, which are constantly being updated based on inputs from journal articles and student theses (M.Sc/Ph.D) from African University libraries. Emphasis was laid on data published after 2012. In order to carry out the original data collection, currently being included in the African Compounds Database, individual journal websites were queried using the country names in Africa as search terms. Over 40,000 articles &quot;hits&quot; were originally retrieved, then reduced to about 9000 articles. The retained articles/theses was further queried with the search terms &quot;malaria&quot;, &quot;malarial&quot;, &quot;plasmodium&quot;, &quot;plasmodial&quot; and a combination of them, resulting in over 500 articles. Those including compounds with anti-malarial activities for which the measured activities fell within the established cut off values numbered 55, which were all cited in the review as relevant references.&lt;h4&gt;Results and discussion&lt;/h4&gt;Pure compounds derived from African medicinal plants with demonstrated anti-malarial/antiplasmodial properties with activities ranging from &quot;very active&quot; to &quot;weakly active&quot; have been discussed. The majority of the 187 natural products were terpenoids (30%), followed by flavonoids (22%), alkaloids (19%) and quinones (15%), with each of the other compound classes being less than 5% of the entire compound collection. It was also observed that most of the plant species from which the compounds were identified were of the families Rubiaceae, Meliaceae and Asphodelaceae. The review is intended to continue laying the groundwork for an African-based anti-malarial drug discovery project.">

The most cited plants are Azadirachta indica (42), Mangifera indica (38), Carica papaya (28), Cymbopogon citratus (27), Cassia fistula (15), Morinda lucida (14), Anacardium occidentale and Vernonia amygdalina (13 each), Helianthus annuus (11), Enantia chlorantha (10), and Moringa oleifera (9) A total of 105 citations were recorded for the plant parts used (leaf (46), bark (17), fruits (9), root (9), latex (11), stem (11), and inflorescence (2)) while decoction (59%), maceration (25%), infusion (9%), and exudation (7%) were the methods of preparation. Use Values (UVs) of 0.47 to 0.11 were recorded for the frequently used antimalarial plants. The Efficiency Levels (ELs) of 11 different medicinal plants stated by the respondents were Azadirachta indica, Cassia fistula and Morinda lucida (12), Chromolaena odorata (10), Mangifera indica, Enantia chlorantha and Helianthus annuus (8), Cymbopogon citratus (7), Gossypium arboretum (4), Landolphia dulcis (3), and Aloe vera (2) Cocos nucifera, Curcuma longa, Forkia biglobosa, and Musa acuminate are mentioned for the first time in the study area with little or no reported antiplasmodial activities. Conclusion:The study appraised the commonly used antimalarial plants in the study areas. Therefore, commitment to scientifically explore the bioactive compounds, antimalarial potential and toxicological profile of these plants is inevitable as they could lead to novel natural products for effective malaria therapy.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Iranian traditional medicine (ITM) is a holistic medical system that uses a wide range of medicinal substances to treat disease. Reorganization and standardization of the data on ITM concepts is a necessity for optimal use of this rich source. In an initial step towards this goal, we created a database of ITM materia medica. Main Body. Primarily based on Makhzan al-Advieh, which is the most recent encyclopedia of materia medica in ITM with the largest number of monographs, a database of natural medicinal substances was created using both text mining methods and manual editing. UNaProd, a Universal Natural Product database for materia medica of ITM, is currently host to 2696 monographs, from herbal to animal to mineral compounds in 16 diverse attributes such as origin and scientific name. Currently, systems biology, and more precisely systems medicine and pharmacology, can be an aid in providing rationalizations for many traditional medicines and elucidating a great deal of knowledge they can offer to guide future research in medicine. Conclusions:A database of materia medica is a stepping stone in creating a systems pharmacology platform of ITM that encompasses the relationships between the drugs, their targets, and diseases. UNaProd is hyperlinked to IrGO and CMAUP databases for Mizaj and molecular features, respectively, and it is freely available at http://jafarilab.com/unaprod/.">

Despite the availability of a variety of anti-obesogenic drugs, including therapies under clinical development, these treatments are often indicated for patients with severe obesity, making them unsuitable for patients with mild obesity or for preventative use. In Thailand, traditional remedies employing medicinal plants are widely used to maintain health and treat disease. These treatments are generally inexpensive and readily available at markets, making them good treatment options for preventing obesity. To evaluate the anti-obesogenic potential of Thai medicinal plants, we employed three in vitro methods: pancreatic lipase inhibition, lipolysis enhancement, and lipid accumulation reduction assays. Among 70 Thai medicinal plants, &lt;i&gt;Eurycoma longifolia&lt;/i&gt; Jack, &lt;i&gt;Tiliacora triandra&lt;/i&gt; Diels, and &lt;i&gt;Acacia concinna&lt;/i&gt; (Willd.) DC. were selected as the most favorable candidates because they exhibited anti-obesogenic activity in all three assays. These medicinal plants are expected to have efficient anti-obesogenic effects, making them promising candidates for further study.">

This study aimed to evaluate DPPH-scavenging capacities and antimicrobial activities of nine Asteraceae species collected from Southern Vietnam. Antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were determined by standard protocols. Essential oils from &lt;i&gt;Ageratum conyzoides, Helianthus annuus,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Artemisia vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; indicated significant inhibitory effects on &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; spp. Crude extracts and fractions from &lt;i&gt;Taraxacum officinale, Chrysanthemum morifolium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. conyzoides,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tagetes erecta&lt;/i&gt; showed inhibitory ability on at least one testing bacterial strains including &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;.

Resistance to antibiotics is an increasing concern in the Sub-Saharan Africa; thus, search for alternatives such as plant-based active ingredients is important in order to develop new drugs.&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;To present a systematic review of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of the antibacterial activity of medicinal plants from Sub-Saharan Africa against &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. &lt;i&gt;Methodology&lt;/i&gt;. Studies published until March 2020 on medicinal plants used against &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. from each country of Sub-Saharan Africa were searched on PubMed, Science Direct, AJOL, and Google Scholar. Articles were selected based on the existence of information regarding &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity of medicinal plants against &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 47 medicinal plants belonging to 28 families were studied for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; activity against &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. No plant was studied &lt;i&gt;in vivo.&lt;/i&gt; Plants from Fabaceae family were the most commonly studied. The plants with the strongest antimicrobial activities were &lt;i&gt;Cryptolepis sanguinolenta&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Terminalia macroptera&lt;/i&gt;. The root extracts from these plants were effective, and both had a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. Seven pure compounds were isolated and analyzed for activity against &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. The compound cryptolepine from &lt;i&gt;C. sanguinolenta&lt;/i&gt; was the most effective with MIC values ranging between 6.25 and 25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Several native plants from the Sub-Saharan Africa region were studied for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; activity against &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; spp. Some plants seemed very effective against the bacteria. Chemical compounds from three plants have been isolated and analyzed, but further studies are needed in order to produce new and effective drugs.">

Plants such as, Vetiveria zizanioides, Trichosanthes cucumerina, and Mollugo cerviana were collected from Western Ghats, Tamilnadu, India. Phytochemicals were extracted from these plants using various organic solvents and tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The phytochemicals such as, carbohydrate, alkaloids, steroids, saponins, flavonoids and tannin were detected from these medicinal plants. Among the extracts, methanol showed potent activity and this solvent was used to extract polyherbal medicinal plants. Methanol extract of V. zizanioides was found to be highly active against E. coli (27 ± 2 mm), P. mirabilis (19 ± 3 mm) and B. subtilis (18 ± 2 mm). Ethyl acetate extract showed high activity against E. coli (24 ± 2 mm), P. mirabilis (22 ± 3 mm) and B. subtilis (20 ± 1 mm). These three plants were taken at 1:1:1 ratio and extracted with methanol at 1:10 ratio and synergistic activity was tested against bacterial pathogens. Synergistic activity of polyherbal extract was analyzed. The extracted crude herbal medicine was found to be effective against Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Enterbacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus mirabilis. The zone of inhibition was 33 ± 3 mm, 17 ± 2 mm, 22 ± 2 mm, 40 ± 2 mm, 33 ± 1 mm and 38 ± 2 mm zone of inhibition against E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, B. subtilis and Enterobacter sp. Polyherbal extract was found to be highly effective against P. mirabilis and Enterobacter sp. MIC values of polyherbal extract ranged from 29 ± 2.5 µg/ml to 34 ± 2.5 µg/ml. MIC value was found to be less against P. mirabilis and was high against S. aureus. Antioxidant property varied between 49 ± 3% and 95.3 ± 2%. At 20 µg/ml antioxidant activity was reported as 49 ± 3% and it was increased at higher concentrations of polyherbal extract. Two cell lines (HeLa and MCF cell lines) were selected to analyze cytotoxic activity of polyherbal extract. The methanol extract of polyherbal fraction showed cytotoxicity against these two cell lines. The LC50 value was 467 ± 2.9 µg/ml against HeLa cell line and &gt;800 µg/ml against MCF-7 cell lines. The polyherbal extract showed antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activities.">

Herbal products with extended treatment regimens and inadequate dosing information are widely used to treat malaria in Ghana. This study set out to determine the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; activity of selected herbal extracts on the development of asexual and sexual stage malaria parasites.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The 72-hour SYBR Green 1-based &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; drug assay was used to determine the asexual parasite growth inhibitory effects exhibited by aqueous extracts of &lt;i&gt;Alchornea cordifolia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Polyalthia longifolia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Mangifera indica&lt;/i&gt; on the NF54, CamWT_C580Y, and IPC 4912 strains of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;. The effects of exposure of asexual and early-stage NF54 gametocytes to varying concentrations of the aqueous herbal extracts were assessed by microscopy after 7 days of continuous culturing in the presence of the herbal extract. Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical screening were also performed on the herbal extracts.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In the SYBR Green 1 assay, aqueous extracts of &lt;i&gt;Alchornea cordifolia&lt;/i&gt; exhibited moderate (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 5.8, 17.4, and 15.8 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml) and &lt;i&gt;Mangifera indica&lt;/i&gt; exhibited low (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 65.4, 96.7, and 81.7 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml) activities against the NF54, Cam WT_C580Y, and IPC 4912 parasites, respectively, whilst &lt;i&gt;Polyalthia longifolia&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; were inactive. Long-term treatment of NF54 parasites with 1 mg/ml of &lt;i&gt;Polyalthia longifolia&lt;/i&gt; produced the highest densities of gametocytes and the least (56%) inhibition of asexual parasites on Day 7. Long-term treatment of NF54 parasites with 10 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml &lt;i&gt;Alchornea cordifolia&lt;/i&gt; resulted in complete parasite (asexual and gametocyte) clearance on Day 7. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions. Alchornea cordifolia&lt;/i&gt; exhibited a 'moderate' activity against the three parasites tested in the 72-hour SYBR Green 1 assay and also effectively cleared both asexual parasites and gametocytes. Long-term treatment of malaria parasites with herbal extracts mimics a treatment regimen and should be used to determine the antimalarial properties of herbal extracts.">

Here we describe the functional analysis of natural and synthetic variants of HLF3 and HLF4. Whereas the natural variants display only very low or no detectable anti-coagulatory activities, modifications within the N-termini in combination with an exchange of the central globular domain have the potency to greatly enhance the inhibitory effects of respective HLF3 and HLF4 variants on blood coagulation. Our results support previous observations on the crucial importance of all parts (both the N- and C-termini as well as the central globular domains) of hirudin and HLF molecules for thrombin inhibition.">

        <span class="abst" title="The care of patients with endometriosis has been complicated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Medical and allied healthcare appointments and surgeries are being temporarily postponed. Mandatory self-isolation has created new obstacles for individuals with endometriosis seeking pain relief and improvement in their quality of life. Anxieties may be heightened by concerns over whether endometriosis may be an underlying condition that could predispose to severe COVID-19 infection and what constitutes an appropriate indication for presentation for urgent treatment in the epidemic. Furthermore, the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 can impose negative psychological effects, which patients with endometriosis may be more prone to already. In combination with medical therapies, or as an alternative, we encourage patients to consider self-management strategies to combat endometriosis symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These self-management strategies are divided into problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies, with the former aiming to change the environment to alleviate pain, and the latter address the psychology of living with endometriosis. We put forward this guidance, which is based on evidence and expert opinion, for healthcare providers to utilize during their consultations with patients via telephone or video. Patients may also independently use this article as an educational resource. The strategies discussed are not exclusively restricted to consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most have been researched before this period of time and all will continue to be a part of the biopsychological approach to endometriosis long after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.">

This study aimed to isolate bioactive compounds from &lt;i&gt;D. littoralis&lt;/i&gt; using bioguided fractionation method. The bioactivity measured were antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antiplasmodial activity. &lt;i&gt;Alpha&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase and &lt;i&gt;alpha&lt;/i&gt;-amylase assays were applied to estimate the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antidiabetic activity of &lt;i&gt;D. littoralis&lt;/i&gt;. The antioxidant activities were determined by using the free radical scavenging assays 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2-2″-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS). Analysis of total flavonoid and phenolic contents were expressed as Quercetin Equivalent (QE) and Gallic Acid Equivalent (GAE), respectively. The i&lt;i&gt;n vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activity test of methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;D. littoralis&lt;/i&gt; was also conducted against &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; strain 3D7. Purification of the ethyl acetate fraction of the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;D. littoralis&lt;/i&gt; resulted in an oligostilbenes namely α-viniferin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;). The structure of the α-viniferin was characterized by comprehensive spectral analysis including IR, 1D and 2D NMR, and in comparison with the literature data. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; showed an &lt;i&gt;alph&lt;/i&gt;a-glucosidase and &lt;i&gt;alpha&lt;/i&gt;-amylase inhibitory activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 256.17 and 212.79 μg/mL, respectively. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activity test against &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; strain 3D7 at a concentration of 100 μg/mL revealed a strong antiplasmodial inhibitory activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 2.76 μg/mL. Our findings indicated that α-viniferin (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) which is isolated from &lt;i&gt;D. littoralis&lt;/i&gt; extract could be regarded as potential antidiabetic and antiplasmodial resources in the future.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Birds have been among the most important element in lives of humans around the world, due to their presence and abundance in practically all ecosystems. Zapotitlán Salinas, a community of the Tehuacán Valley, has been a site of interest for studying ecology of bird communities, but no previous studies addressing the relationship between humans and birds have been conducted in the area. Based on their local knowledge, people of the area shape the use and conservation of local bird fauna diversity, which is being maintained or lost under the influence of factors like commerce, tourism, agriculture intensification or abandonment, public policies for conservation, environmental changes, among others. This study aims to analyze the patterns of interactions between humans and birds in a context of high biocultural diversity with a long history and facing the environmental and social challenges of semiarid areas. METHODS:Ecological sampling for documenting bird species richness was conducted from November 2015 to May 2017 in three transects that included agroforestry systems, forests, and fallow agricultural land. The method of counting by fixed radius points at 16 points within the study systems was used. Thirty in-depth interviews were conducted with local people who own land in the study areas by random sampling and choosing experts of Zapotitlán Salinas, Puebla, a semiarid natural protected area and, since 2019, recognized as Mixed World Heritage. Some visitor guides of the Helia Bravo Hollis Botanical Garden who are member of the community and local people who dedicated part of their time to catching birds were considered as local experts. They have experience in identifying birds through bird watching and listening to bird songs, as well as their knowledge on behavior and habits of the bird species occurring in their locality. We in addition conducted free listing of bird species recognized by people and interviews on ecological aspects, forms of use, and management of birds using a photographic catalog as visual stimulus. The following aspects were addressed with local people: (i) the bird species of Zapotitlán recognized by them; (ii) the biological, ecological, and behavioral knowledge about these species; (iii) the description of practices of use and management of these animals; (iv) the perceived changes regarding presence and abundance of the wild birds recognized; and (v) the regulations of these practices and uses. RESULTS:Through the ecological sampling, we identified 89 bird species, a number representing nearly 68% of all species reported for the Zapotitlán Valley. The species recorded belong to 61 genera, 26 families, and 11 orders. Local people interviewed recognized 62 morphospecies occurring in their territory, and designated them with 50 local names. The interactions of local people with birds and the knowledge related to habitats and habits varied according to people's daily life activities and the ways of inter-generational transmission of knowledge. The interactions identified respond to several motivations. The most intense are those of utilitarian nature (three types of use are recognized: nutritional, medicinal, and ornamental), while other less notorious but equally relevant are those related to the awareness and conservation of biological diversity, and aesthetic appreciation of nature. Also relevant are those interactions shaped by the people's worldview since some species are interpreted as climatic environmental predictors, amulets, or omens. CONCLUSIONS:To understand the various human-bird environmental interactions, it is necessary not only to address the utilitarian assessment that species have in a specific place but also those associated with cultural expressions and the connection between these aspects. Lifestyles, traditions, and beliefs model intangible forms of use, such as the interpretation of climate predictors. Ancient roles of birds in local culture are ongoing, and new demand of ornamental birds from cities influences catching activities but local and regional regulations have contributed to maintain them below a critical level.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;This study has focused on the Garrigues district, one of the most arid regions in Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula), which, in general terms, has remained unexplored from the ethnobotanical point of view. This area, of 22,243 inhabitants, comprises 33 municipalities distributed across 1123.12 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The natural vegetation is dominated by holm oak forests and maquis called 'garriga', the latter giving its name to the district. During the last few decades, this landscape has been transformed by agricultural activities, nowadays in recession. The main aim of this work was to collect and analyse the ethnoflora of this area in order to fill a gap in the ethnobotanical knowledge in Catalonia.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The followed methodology was based on semi-structured interviews. The obtained data have been qualitatively and quantitatively analysed and compared with other available ones.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Data were gathered from 68 interviews involving 101 informants, whose ages range from 24 to 94, the mean being 73.07. The number of taxa reported in this study was 420, belonging to 99 botanical families. The interviewed informants referred 4715 use reports (UR) of 346 useful taxa, 1741 (36.93) of them corresponding to medicinal uses, 1705 (36.16%) to food uses, and 1269 (26.91%) to other uses. This study has inventoried, apart from individual plant uses, 260 plant mixtures, of which 98 are medicinal and 162 food. In the present study, 849 vernacular names with 116 phonetic variants have been collected, as well, for 410 taxa. The informant consensus factor (F&lt;sub&gt;IC&lt;/sub&gt;) obtained for our interviewees is 0.93, and the ethnobotanicity index is 23.47% for the studied area. Apart from plants belonging to the typical Catalan, Iberian or European ethnofloras, the present work contributes information on some plants from semiarid or arid regions, such as Artemisia herba-alba and Plantago albicans, much rarer in the ethnobotany of the quoted areas.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The results of this study reveal the persistence of ethnobotanical knowledge in the prospected area and the importance of filling the existing gaps in the ethnofloristic sampling of the Catalan territories. The almost complete dataset, now including some arid territories, will allow us to carry out a global analysis and to provide an accurate overview.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Due to the development of superbugs as a result of unprescribed and frequent use of antibiotics in recent years, an alternate form of medicine had to be introduced. In light of this global threat, researchers all over the world have been gravitating towards herbal medicines. In order to find out new ways of saving the planet using medicinal plants, ethnobotanical studies must be carried out. Concerning this, an ethnobotanical study has been done in this paper to identify potential medicinal plants in Rangamati, Bangladesh.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;For the ethnobotanical survey, randomized 104 people were interviewed and 62 different plant species were found to treat 19 different kinds of diseases and 84% of people reported to be completely recovered. Furthermore, among the 19 diseases found, the majority of them were common cold, abdominal pain or gastric, diarrhea, and dysentery. From the 62 different plant species, Heptapleurum hypoleucum, used for the treatment of diarrhea, was selected for conducting further studies due to its heavy use as reported by the tribal people. In this study, the aqueous, ethanol, and methanol extracts of Heptapleurum hypoleucum were subjected to microbial susceptibility assays using the agar well diffusion method. The test microorganisms were Salmonella typhi, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri, and Escherichia coli. Among these, the most susceptible organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (21 mm) and Salmonella typhi (19 mm) in the ethanolic extract. Also, the methanolic extract showed an inhibition zone of 13 mm against E. coli, which was more than that of the antibiotic's (11 mm). Phytochemical screening of the plant revealed that it contains alkaloids, phenols, steroids, and flavonoids, but lacks saponins and tannins.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;To combat the rising threat of antibiotic resistance, ethnoscience needs to be consolidated with modern biotechnological techniques to make the most use of the vast amount of natural resources. The findings of this study indicate that Heptapleurum hypoleucum, an ethnobotanical medicinal plant, has shown comparable antimicrobial activity with commercial antibiotics against several diarrhea-causing pathogens and also contains several medically important phytochemicals.">

        <span class="abst" title="Neglected tropical diseases are major health hazards in developing countries. Annually, up to 30 million people are affected by either Chagas disease, African trypansomiasis or leishmaniasis, and more than 200 million by malaria. Most of the currently available drugs have drawbacks in terms of toxicity, limited oral availability, development of resistance, or non-affordability. Tropical plants of the arid zones are a treasure chest for the discovery of bioactive secondary metabolites. This study aims to compile Sudanese medicinal plants, validate their antiprotozoal activities, and identify active molecules. We have performed a survey of medicinal plants of Sudan and selected 62 that are being used in Sudanese traditional medicine. From these, we collected materials such as leaves, stem, bark, or fruit. The plant materials were extracted in 70% ethanol and further fractionated by liquid-liquid partitioning using solvents of increasing polarity. This resulted in a library of 235 fractions. The library was tested &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; against &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; (erythrocytic stages), &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense&lt;/i&gt; (bloodstream forms), &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; (intracellular amastigotes), and &lt;i&gt;Leishmania donovani&lt;/i&gt; (axenic amastigotes). Active fractions were also tested for cytotoxicity. Of the 235 fractions, 125 showed growth inhibitory activity &gt;80% at 10 μg/ml, and &gt;50% at 2 μg/ml against at least one of the protozoan parasites. &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; was the most sensitive of the parasites, followed by &lt;i&gt;T. b. rhodesiense&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt;. Only few hits were identified for &lt;i&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/i&gt;, and these were not selective. Contrary to expectation based on phylogeny, but in agreement with previous results, a large number of extracts displayed mutual activity against &lt;i&gt;T. brucei&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt;. HPLC-based activity profiling for selected active extracts was performed to identify the bioactive principles. Active compounds identified by dereplication were guieranone A from &lt;i&gt;Guiera senegalensis&lt;/i&gt; J.F.Gmel.; pseudosemiglabrin from &lt;i&gt;Tephrosia apollinea&lt;/i&gt; (Delile) DC; ellagic acid and quercetin from &lt;i&gt;Terminalia leiocarpa&lt;/i&gt; (DC.) Baill.; and catechin, ethyl gallate, and epicatechin gallate from &lt;i&gt;Vachellia nilotica&lt;/i&gt; (L.) P.J.H.Hurter &amp; Mabb. Also the extracts of &lt;i&gt;Croton gratissimus&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;gratissimus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cuscuta hyalina&lt;/i&gt; Roth ex Schult. exhibited promising antitrypanosomatid activity. This assessment provides a comprehensive overview of Sudanese medicinal plants and supports the notion that they are a potential source of bioactive molecules against protozoan parasites.">

The results showed that all tested plants have various antimicrobial and wound healing activities. Out of these plants, &lt;i&gt;L. acacia&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the best result; it revealed a significant result for antimicrobial activities counter to all Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and wound healing activities in comparing with the reference drug. Thus, it is essential to consider &lt;i&gt;L. acacia&lt;/i&gt; as a prospective source in progress in the synthesis of a new antimicrobial drug for the treatment of infectious diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;In Europe and the Mediterranean, over-exploitation and destructive harvesting techniques have been identified as two critical threats affecting the sustainable harvesting of wild medicinal plant (WMP) species. However, unsustainable harvesting is not an issue everywhere and localized assessments are needed. Local knowledge has been praised for its potential for local short-term assessments. In this study, we aimed to register the known, harvested, and locally utilized WMP species and understand local knowledge of harvesters about the ecological sustainability of WMP harvesting and the perceived changes of WMP availability.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;This study was conducted on Lemnos island, Greece, in July and August 2018. Sixteen harvesters knowledgeable about gathering and using WMP were chosen through purposeful and snowball sampling. Successive free-lists provided insights on the taxa known, harvested, and utilized by harvesters and subsequent semi-structured interviews served to understand harvesting practices and perceived changes of WMP availability. Participant observation during seven harvesting walks allowed for additional insights and facilitated the collection of voucher specimens.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In total, 144 different plant taxa were listed as useful and 81 had been harvested in the prior 4 years. Medicinal applications were mainly related to digestive and respiratory system issues. A number of favorable harvesting practices suggested a high potential towards an ecologically sustainable harvest. Although, a decreased availability for certain plant taxa and harvesting sites was reported and mainly attributed to external factors such as pollution, unusually dry weather, intentional pastureland burning or chemicals in agriculture, but also destructive harvesting by less knowledgeable harvesters.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Knowledgeable harvesters of Lemnos gather and use a considerable number of WMP taxa and possess local knowledge that supports an ecologically sustainable harvest. However, certain plant taxa and areas of the island were indicated to be under pressure from harvesting, unusual climatic conditions, and agricultural practices. Our approach confirmed that local knowledge should be taken into account for assessing the sustainability of WMP harvesting.">

        <span class="abst" title="Malaria is one of the serious health problems in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Its treatment has been met with chronic failure due to pathogenic resistance to the currently available drugs. This review attempts to compile phytotherapeutical information on antimalarial plants in Kenya based on electronic data. A comprehensive web search was conducted in multidisciplinary databases, and a total of 286 plant species from 75 families, distributed among 192 genera, were retrieved. Globally, about 139 (48.6%) of the species have been investigated for antiplasmodial (18%) or antimalarial activities (97.1%) with promising results. However, there is no record on the antimalarial activity of about 51.4% of the species used although they could be potential sources of antimalarial remedies. Analysis of ethnomedicinal recipes indicated that mainly leaves (27.7%) and roots (19.4%) of shrubs (33.2%), trees (30.1%), and herbs (29.7%) are used for preparation of antimalarial decoctions (70.5%) and infusions (5.4%) in Kenya. The study highlighted a rich diversity of indigenous antimalarial plants with equally divergent herbal remedy preparation and use pattern. Further research is required to validate the therapeutic potential of antimalarial compounds from the unstudied claimed species. Although some species were investigated for their antimalarial efficacies, their toxicity and safety aspects need to be further investigated.">

The aim of this study is to determine the acute toxicity of the methanolic extract on vital organs and its associated biochemical parameters. Fifteen female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups. Group I served as normal control, groups II, III, IV, and V were orally administered single dose of crude extract dissolved in distilled water at 5 mg/kg BW, 50 mg/kg BW, 300 mg/kg BW and 2,000 mg/kg BW. Rats were observed for 14 days and body weights were recorded. On day 15, the rats were sacrificed and blood samples were collected for biochemical and haematological analyses, while the liver and kidneys were sampled for histopathological examination. Body weight and haematology parameters results showed significance difference (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) among means of HGB, RDW, RBC, and MCHC; likewise, (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) for WBC and platelet among treated groups. Histopathology result showed that kidneys appeared normal while livers were congested with mildly swollen hepatocytes and occasional binucleation. Focal lobular hepatitis was observed in all treated animals. However, hepatic enzymes were not significantly affected and no histopathological harmful effects were observed in kidney&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In conclusion, methanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;A. africanus&lt;/i&gt; are safe up to 2,000 mg/kg BW. The obtained results could be used as a justification for the traditional application of the plant for treatment of various ailments.">

The aim of this study was to evaluate antioxidant and α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, and cholinesterases inhibition potential of Bergenia pacumbis of Nepali origin collected from the Karnali region of Nepal.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The sequential crude extracts were made in hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water. Antioxidant activities were analyzed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assay. The α-amylase, α-glucosidase, lipase, tyrosinase, elastase, acetylcholinesterase, and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition were analyzed by the 3,5-Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA), p-Nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (p-NPG), 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB), l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), N-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide (AAAPVN), acetylthiocholine, and butyrylcholine as a respective substrate. The major metabolites were identified by high performance liquid chromatography with electron spray ionization- quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) profiling.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Our results revealed the great antioxidant ability of crude extract of B. pacumbis in ethyl acetate extract against both DPPH (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 30.14 ± 0.14 μg/mL) and ABTS (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 17.38 ± 1.12 μg/mL). However, the crude methanol extract of B. pacumbis showed the comparable enzymes inhibitions with standard drugs; α-amylase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.03 ± 0.04 μg/mL), α-glucosidase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.29 ± 0.00 μg/mL), lipase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 67.26 ± 0.17 μg/mL), tyrosinase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 58.25 ± 1.63 μg/mL), elastase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 74.00 ± 3.03 μg/mL), acetylcholinesterase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 31.52 ± 0.58 μg/mL), and butyrylcholinesterase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 11.69 ± 0.14 μg/mL). On the basis of HPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS profiling of metabolites, we identified major compounds such as Bergenin, Catechin, Arbutin, Gallic acid, Protocatechuic acid, Syringic acid, Hyperoside, Afzelechin, Methyl gallate, Paashaanolactone, Astilbin, Quercetin, Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, Diosmetin, Phloretin, and Morin in methanol extract which has reported beneficial bioactivities.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our study provides a plethora of scientific evidence that the crude extracts of B. pacumbis from Nepalese origin in different extracting solvents have shown significant potential on inhibiting free radicals as well as enzymes involved in digestion, skin related problems, and neurological disorders compared with the commercially available drugs.">

The present regulatory landscape for medicinal and medical products for human use has been shaped by nearly 12 decades of statutory history that followed in reaction to disasters and tragedies. Five distinct, closely woven threads of statutory history have led to the regulatory infrastructure we have in place: (1) standardized processes for routine development of medicinal and medical device products for human use; (2) processes for expedited development to shorten time frames and expand patient populations; (3) mechanisms of Expanded Access to make medicinal products available to patients prior to approval of the US Food and Drug Administration; (4) Emergency Use Authorization during public health emergencies; and (5) the development of pathways for bringing generic drugs and biosimilar biologics to market. These mechanisms are being brought to bear to facilitate the defeat of infection with SARS-CoV-2.">

        <span class="abst" title="Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a prevalent, multifactorial and complex disease that is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes and other major cardiovascular complications. The rise in the global prevalence of MetS has been attributed to genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. The adoption of sedentary lifestyles that are characterized by low physical activity and the consumption of high-energy diets contributes to MetS development. Current management criteria for MetS risk factors involve changes in lifestyle and the use of pharmacological agents that target specific biochemical pathways involved in the metabolism of nutrients. Pharmaceutical drugs are usually expensive and are associated with several undesirable side effects. Alternative management strategies of MetS risk factors involve the use of medicinal plants that are considered to have multiple therapeutic targets and are easily accessible. Medicinal plants contain several different biologically active compounds that provide health benefits. The impact of phytochemicals present in local medicinal plants on sustainable health and well-being of individuals has been studied for many years and found to involve a plethora of complex biochemical, metabolic, and physiological mechanisms. While some of these phytochemicals are the basis of mainstream prescribed drugs (e.g., metformin, reserpine, quinine, and salicin), there is a need to identify more medicinal plants that can be used for the management of components of MetS and to describe their possible mechanisms of action. In this review, we assess the potential health benefits of South African ethnomedicinal plants in protecting against the development of health outcomes associated with MetS. We aim to provide the state of the current knowledge on the use of medicinal plants and their therapeutically important phytochemicals by discussing the current trends, with critical examples from recent primary references of how medicinal plants are being used in South African rural and urban communities.">

        <span class="abst" title="Inflammatory diseases are major health concerns affecting millions of people worldwide. &lt;i&gt;Aspilia africana&lt;/i&gt; has been used for centuries by many African communities in the treatment of a wide range of health conditions, including inflammatory diseases, osteoporosis, rheumatic pains, and wounds. Analysis of the phytochemical composition of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;africana&lt;/i&gt; indicated that the plant is rich in a broad range of secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, sterols, phenolic compounds, and glycosides. This explains the efficacy of the plant in treating inflammation-related diseases, as well as several other health conditions affecting different African communities. The mechanisms of action of the anti-inflammatory phytochemical compounds in &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;africana&lt;/i&gt; include inhibition of a number of physiological processes involved in the inflammatory process and synthesis or action of proinflammatory enzymes. The phytochemicals enhance anti-inflammatory biological responses such as inhibition of a number of chemical mediators including histamine, prostanoids and kinins, 5-lipoxygenase. and cyclooxygenase and activation of phosphodiesterase and transcriptase. Currently used anti-inflammatory medications are associated with several disadvantages such as drug toxicity and iatrogenic reactions, thereby complicating the treatment process. The adverse effects related to the use of these conventional synthetic drugs have been the driving force behind consideration of natural remedies, and efforts are being made toward the development of anti-inflammatory agents based on natural extracts. &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;africana&lt;/i&gt; is rich in secondary metabolites, and its use as a traditional medicine for treating inflammatory diseases has been validated through &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies. Therefore, the plant could be further explored for potential development of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics.">

Nanotechnology, however, represents a new approach to fighting and eradicating biofilm-forming microorganisms. In the present study, the sustainable synthesis and characterization of biocompatible silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from leaf extracts of &lt;i&gt;Semecarpus anacardium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Glochidion lanceolarium&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Bridelia retusa&lt;/i&gt; was explored. Continuous synthesis was observed in a UV-vis spectroscopic analysis and the participating phytoconstituents, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, phytosterols, and glycosides, were characterized by Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The size and surface charge of the particles were also measured by dynamic light scattering spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy study was employed to examine the morphology of the nanoparticles. The spectroscopic and microscopic study confirmed the successful synthesis of AgNPs by plant extracts acting as strong reducing agents. The synthesized AgNPs were screened for antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against human pathogens &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. Results of the study demonstrate the potential of phyto-synthesized AgNPs to act as anti-biofilm agents and for other biomedical applications.">

Brucea antidysenterica is one of the several medicinal plants used traditionally for the treatment of diarrhoea in Ethiopia. Hence, the present study was undertaken to investigate the antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activities of the root extract of B. antidysenterica.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Plant material was extracted by maceration technique using 80% methanol. The antidiarrhoeal activity was tested using castor oil-induced diarrhoea, castor oil-induced charcoal meal test, and castor oil-induced enteropooling models in mice. Whilst, the antibacterial activity of the crude extract was evaluated using agar well diffusion and broth microdilution methods.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The 80% methanolic crude extract significantly delayed the diarrhoeal onset at the two higher doses (p &lt; 0.001) and it has also inhibited the number and weight of faecal output at all tested doses as compared with the negative control. Moreover, it showed a significant anti-motility effect (p &lt; 0.001) at all tested doses. Whereas it displayed a significant reduction in the weight and volume of intestinal contents at the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg (p &lt; 0.01). The highest concentration (800 mg/mL) of test extract showed maximum zone of inhibition in all tested standard strains of bacteria (18.3 mm-22 mm). While MIC and MBC values (0.39 mg/mL and 1.56 mg/mL) showed that S. flexneri was the most susceptible pathogen for test extract.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The study revealed that the root extract of B. antidysenterica has antidiarrhoeal and antibacterial activities.">

        <span class="abst" title="Herbal tea, a beverage prepared from a variety of plant materials excluding the leaves of the tea plant &lt;i&gt;Camellia sinensis&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Kuntze of the family Theaceae, for a long time, has been consumed by most Chinese people for preventive and/or therapeutic health care. Usually, it is brewed or prepared as a decoction of local plants in water. The qīng-căo-chá tea, a commercial herbal tea, is the most common among many differently formulated herbal teas in Taiwan. For hundreds of years, qīng-căo-chá tea has played an important role in the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with the environmental conditions in Taiwan. However, research studies in this field have been insufficient. The raw material formulas of qīng-căo-chá tea have always been passed down from &quot;masters&quot; to &quot;apprentices.&quot; Hence, there is no systematic collation or record, and, therefore, there is a need to assess and confirm the composition, safety, and effectiveness of the raw materials. This study aimed to document the uses of Taiwan's qīng-căo-chá tea through a semi-structured interview survey and investigate the background of traditional practitioners, tea compositions, and plant origins and uses. This will improve our understanding of the knowledge inherited by the practitioners and the theoretical basis of the medicinal uses of these teas. In our field investigation, we visited 86 shops and assessed 71 raw ingredients of qīng-căo-chá tea. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to conduct the interviews. During the interviews, in addition to written records, audio and video recordings were made, and photographs were taken with the permission of the interviewees. The qīng-căo-chá raw materials have long been used as herbal teas, although more research should clarify their efficacy and safety. Traditional sellers of qīng-căo-chá tea were mainly males, and most shops have been in operation for more than 71 years. Some of the raw materials were derived from multiple sources, including different plants, and were often mixed without any safety concerns. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic ethnobotanical study on qīng-căo-chá tea that assesses and confirms its herbal ingredients. Our study represents a reference for herbal teas in Taiwan that can be used by the public and regulatory agencies.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; Medicinal plants are a source of phytochemicals and they are used for the treatment of several oxidative stress-related or other diseases for their effectiveness, low toxicity and easy availability. Five traditionally used and less characterized herbaceous weeds of West Bengal, India, namely, &lt;i&gt;Heliotropium indicum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tridax procumbens&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cleome rutidosperma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Commelina benghalensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia hirta&lt;/i&gt;, were investigated for the current research study. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts of the leaves were analyzed for estimation of essential phytochemicals and to evaluate their &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant status, medicinal properties and cytotoxic effects. To the best of our knowledge, several assays and comparative evaluations using these herbs are reported for the first time. For quantitative study, UV-vis spectrophotometry and high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector HPLC-DAD techniques were used. Antibacterial properties were investigated using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. For &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; anti-lithiatic study, a titration method was used. The cell viability assay was done using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The aqueous extract exhibits higher content of polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins and inhibition percentage values for free radical scavenging assays, whereas the 70% ethanolic extract exhibits higher content of alkaloids and cardiac glycosides. HPLC-DAD analysis of 70% ethanolic extracts led us to identify 10 predominant phenolic constituents. &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia hirta&lt;/i&gt; extracts showed minimum cytotoxicity (cell death &lt;i&gt;~2.5% and 4&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;%&lt;/i&gt; in water and 70% ethanolic extract, respectively &lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, whereas &lt;i&gt;Cleome rutidosperma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tridax procumbens'&lt;/i&gt; 70% ethanolic extracts showed higher cell death (~13% and 28%, respectively), compared with the control (cell death ~10-12%). &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; The study concluded that of all the medicinal weeds selected for the current study, &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia hirta&lt;/i&gt; possesses the highest amount of bioactive compounds and hence exhibits the highest &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant activity and promising &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; medicinal properties.">

        <span class="abst" title="In the present study, we have explored the interaction of the active components from 10 different medicinal plants of Indian origin that are commonly used for treating cold and respiratory-related disorders, through molecular docking analysis. In the current scenario, COVID-19 patients experience severe respiratory syndromes, hence it is envisaged from our study that these traditional medicines are very likely to provide a favourable effect on COVID-19 infections. The active ingredients identified from these natural products are previously reported for antiviral activities against large group of viruses. Totally 47 bioactives identified from the medicinal plants were investigated against the structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro and spike protein) and human ACE2 receptor. The top leads were identified based on interaction energies, number of hydrogen bond and other parameters that explain their potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The bioactive ligands such as Cucurbitacin E, Orientin, Bis-andrographolide, Cucurbitacin B, Isocucurbitacin B, Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid, Piperine and Magnoflorine targeted the hotspot residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In fact, this protease enzyme has an essential role in mediating the viral replication and therefore compounds targeting this key enzyme are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. The top scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further demonstrated with molecular dynamics simulation. Besides, the stability of the conformation was studied in detail by investigating the binding free energy using MM-PBSA method. Overall, the study emphasized that the proposed hit Cucurbitacin E and orientin could serve as a promising scaffold for developing anti-COVID-19 drug.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cordyceps coffee, containing Cordycepin and β-glucan, was developed to improve quality and functionality of coffee. We evaluated its biological activities and quality characteristics. We treated green coffee beans with mixed extracts from three medicinal mushrooms, Cordyceps mushroom (&lt;i&gt;Cordyceps militaris&lt;/i&gt;), Phellinus mushroom (&lt;i&gt;Phellinus linteus&lt;/i&gt;), and Chaga mushroom (&lt;i&gt;Inonotus obliquus&lt;/i&gt;). Both control [27.00 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g] and Cordyceps coffee (37.34 mg GAE/g) had higher contents of polyphenol than the Cordyceps mushroom raw materials (23.17 mg GAE/g). 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity was higher for both the control and Cordyceps coffee (80.56% and 82.21 %, respectively) compared with Cordyceps mushrooms (62.89%). β-Glucan content was determined by the enzyme method; the raw Cordyceps, Phellinus, and Chaga mushrooms contained 3.79%, 7.06%, and 8.57% β-glucan, respectively. However, β-glucan and total glucan contents were much lower in Cordyceps coffee (2.03% and 3.11%, respectively) than in the raw mushrooms. The amount of Cordycepin, as determined by high performance liquid chromatograph, was 2,274.70 mg/kg for the Cordyceps coffee and 11,533.22 mg/kg for the Cordyceps mushrooms. Through flavor pattern analysis using the electronic nose system, we showed Cordyceps coffee kept the original coffee aroma (similar as the control), and this was not obstructed by the off-flavor of the Cordyceps mushrooms. In conclusion, this study suggests that Cordyceps coffee may be a novel functional coffee containing the functional components Cordycepin and β-glucan.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Despite improvements in medical care, patients with advanced cancer still experience substantial symptom distress. There is increasing interest in the use of medicinal cannabinoids but little high-quality evidence to guide clinicians. This study aims to define the role of a 1:1 delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol/cannabidiol (THC/CBD) cannabinoid preparation in the management of symptom burden in patients with advanced cancer undergoing standard palliative care. METHODS AND DESIGN:One hundred fifty participants will be recruited from five sites within the Queensland Palliative Care Research Group (QPCRG) and randomly assigned to an active treatment or placebo group. This study is a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial of escalating doses of an oral 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation. It will compare efficacy and safety outcomes of a titrated dose (10 mg/10 mg/mL oral solution formulation, dose range 2.5 mg/2.5 mg-30 mg/30 mg/day) against placebo. There is a 2-week patient-determined titration phase, using escalating doses of 1:1 THC/CBD or placebo, to reach a dose that achieves symptom relief with tolerable side effects. This is then followed by a further 2-week assessment period on the stable dose determined in collaboration with clinicians. The primary objective is to assess the effect of escalating doses of a 1:1 THC/CBD cannabinoid preparation against placebo on change in total symptom score, with secondary objectives including establishing a patient-determined effective dose, the change in total physical and emotional sores, global impression of change, anxiety and depression, opioid use, quality of life and adverse effects. DISCUSSION:This will be the first placebo-controlled clinical trial to rigorously evaluate the efficacy, safety and acceptability of 1:1 THC/CBD for symptom relief in advanced cancer patients. This study will allow the medical community to have some evidence to present to patients wishing to access cannabis for their symptoms caused by advanced malignancy.

        <span class="abst" title="Skin ensures that a constant internal environment can be maintained in an ever-changing external environment. When a wound occurs on the skin, the inflammatory and proliferative phases are initiated in response to injury. Thai traditional medicine (TTM), using medicinal plants and ancient knowledge, has been used to treat wounds. Eight Thai medicinal plants, most commonly used to treat wounds, were evaluated for their &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; biological activities such as antioxidation by NBT assay, anti-inflammation by production inhibition of NO, promoting fibroblast cell proliferation, and wound closure activities. Plant materials were extracted with 95% ethanol or distilled water and then concentrated and dried. Statistical analysis of data was done using one-way ANOVA at &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value of 0.05. The ethanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;Garcinia mangostana&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Glycyrrhiza glabra&lt;/i&gt; L., and &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L. could inhibit the production of superoxide anion with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 13.97 ± 0.38, 28.62 ± 1.91, and 71.54 ± 3.22 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml and nitric oxide with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 23.97 ± 0.91, 46.35 ± 0.43, and 78.48 ± 4.46 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. These extracts could promote cell proliferation and accelerate wound recovery at the rate of 2.02 ± 0.03, 2.12 ± 0.03, and 2.65 ± 0.05% per hour, respectively. Three established markers from these three plants were selected according to the selection criteria. Alpha-mangostin, glycyrrhizin, and thymoquinone were found to be the active markers for wound closure activities. The ethanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mangostana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;glabra&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sativa&lt;/i&gt; could scavenge superoxide anion and inhibit the production of nitric oxide; therefore these extracts could assist in surpassing the inflammatory phase and protected the cells surrounding the wound area. Most importantly, these extracts also increased the proliferation and accelerated wound closure, indicating that these plant extracts could be promoting wound healing processes and support the use of TTM.">

All extracts were initially screened &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; against the chloroquine-resistant strain W2 of &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; to confirm its &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; activity, and the most potent one was assessed in malaria mouse model at three concentrations (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg/bw). Biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters were also determined.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Overall, 7 extracts showed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ranging from 0.809 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL to 5.886 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. The aqueous extract from the stem bark of &lt;i&gt;T. mantaly&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Tm&lt;/i&gt;sb&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;) was the most potent (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.809 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) and was further assessed for acute toxicity and efficacy in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium berghei&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice. &lt;i&gt;Tm&lt;/i&gt;sb&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt; was safe in mice with a median lethal dose (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) higher than 2000 mg/kg of body weight. It also exerted a good antimalarial efficacy &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; with ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 69.50 mg/kg and had no significant effect on biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The results suggest that the stem bark extract of &lt;i&gt;T. mantaly&lt;/i&gt; possesses antimalarial activity.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pharmacology has developed many drugs to treat infections, but many people, especially in developing countries, cannot afford to purchase them, and still depend on traditional knowledge and local medicinal plants to fight off infections. In addition, numerous microbes have developed resistance to the pharmaceutical drugs developed to fight them, and for many, such as Covid-19, effective drugs remain to be found. Ethnomedicinal knowledge is useful, not only for local people as a source of medicine for primary health care, but also for new pharmacological discoveries. This study aimed to identify the plants that the Karen, the largest hill-tribe ethnic minority in northern and western Thailand, use for treatments of infectious diseases. We present a meta-analysis of data from 16 ethnobotanical studies of 25 Karen villages with the aim of understanding traditional knowledge and treatments and point to potential plants for further pharmacological development. The Karen used 127 plant species from 59 plant families to treat infections and infectious diseases. The Cultural Important Index (CI) showed that the Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, Asteraceae, Lauraceae, Apocynaceae, Menispermaceae, and Lamiaceae were the most commonly used families. As for species, Cleidion javanicum, Tinospora crispa, Litsea cubeba, Aesculus assamica, Tadehagi triquetrum, Senna alata, Tithonia diversifolia, Embelia sessiliflora, and Combretum indicum were the most commonly used in treatments of infectious diseases. We suggest that these plant species should be the first to be pharmacologically tested for possible development of medicines, and the remaining species registered should subsequently undergo testing.">

        <span class="abst" title="Bacterial infections are responsible for a large number of deaths every year worldwide. On average, 80% of the African population cannot afford conventional drugs. Moreover, many synthetic antibiotics are associated with side effects and progressive increase in antimicrobial resistance. Currently, there is growing interest in discovering new antibacterial agents from ethnomedicinal plants. About 60% of the population living in developing countries depends on herbal drugs for healthcare needs. This study involved the screening of &lt;i&gt;Centella asiatica&lt;/i&gt; commonly used by herbal medicine practitioners in Kisii County to treat symptoms related to bacterial infections. Standard bioassay methods were applied throughout the study. They included preliminary screening of dichloromethane: methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Centella asiatica&lt;/i&gt; against human pathogenic bacteria including &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhi&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 19430, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25922, &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25931, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 21332, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25923 using agar disc diffusion, broth microdilution method, and time-kill kinetics with tetracycline as a positive control. Phytochemical screening was carried out to determine the different classes of compounds in the crude extracts. Data were analyzed using one way ANOVA and means separated by Tukey's test. Dichloromethane: methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Centella asiatica&lt;/i&gt; was screened against the selected bacterial strains. Time-kill kinetic studies of the extracts showed dose- and time-dependent kinetics of antibacterial properties. Phytochemical screening of the DCM-MeOH extract revealed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, terpenoids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, steroids, and tannins. The present study indicates that the tested plant can be an important source of antibacterial agents and recommends that the active phytoconstituents be isolated, identified, and screened individually for activities and also subjected further for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and toxicological studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Neurodegenerative diseases represent nowadays one of the major health problems. Despite the efforts made to unveil the mechanism leading to neurodegeneration, it is still not entirely clear what triggers this phenomenon and what allows its progression. Nevertheless, it is accepted that neurodegeneration is a consequence of several detrimental processes, such as protein aggregation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, finally resulting in the loss of neuronal functions. Starting from these evidences, there has been a wide search for novel agents able to address more than a single event at the same time, the so-called multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs). These compounds originated from the combination of different pharmacophoric elements which endowed them with the ability to interfere with different enzymatic and/or receptor systems, or to exert neuroprotective effects by modulating proteins and metal homeostasis. MTDLs have been the focus of the latest strategies to discover a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is considered the most common form of dementia characterized by neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunctions. This review is aimed at collecting the latest and most interesting target combinations for the treatment of AD, with a detailed discussion on new agents with favorable &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; properties and on optimized structures that have already been assessed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in animal models of dementia.">

It contains marrubiin, a labdane diterpene that is characteristic for this genus, as well as a complex mixture of phenolic compounds. According to numerous studies, &lt;i&gt;M. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; acts as a good antioxidant agent, and due to this, it could potentially be useful in treatments of cancer, diabetes mellitus, and liver diseases. In addition, its anti-inflammatory, wound-healing, antihypertensive, hypolipidemic, and sedative potential are discussed. Apart from that, its antimicrobial activity, especially against Gram+ bacteria, fungi, herpes simplex virus, and parasites such as &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trichomonas vaginalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium berghei-berghei&lt;/i&gt; was recorded. Additionally, it could be used as a chicken lice repellent, herbicide, and natural insecticide against mosquito larvae and natural molluscicide. In veterinary medicine, &lt;i&gt;M. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; can be used as an anthelmintic against the eggs and larvae of bovine strongyles parasites, and as an antibiotic against bovine mastitis caused by resistant bacterial strains. Due to the mentioned benefits, there is a tendency for the cultivation of &lt;i&gt;M. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; in order to ensure high-quality raw material, but more firm scientific evidence and well-designed clinical trials are necessary for the well-established use of &lt;i&gt;M. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; herb and its preparations.">

This study concerns an ethnobotanical survey of the Kavrepalanchok District, reporting some unusual uses of medicinal plants and original recipes. A total of 32 informants were interviewed, 24 of them being key informants. Ethnobotanical uses concerned 116 taxa, of which 101 were medicinal plants, with the most representative species belonging to Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, and Zingiberaceae. Ethnobotanical indexes were used to evaluate the ethnopharmacological importance of each plant species and the degree of agreement among the informants' knowledge. Informant consensus factor (Fic) showed that the fever category had the greatest agreement. Highest fidelity level (FL) values were found for &lt;i&gt;Calotropis gigantea&lt;/i&gt; used for dermatological diseases, &lt;i&gt;Drymaria cordata&lt;/i&gt; for fever, &lt;i&gt;Mangifera indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wrightia arborea&lt;/i&gt; for gastrointestinal disorders. Data document the richness of the local flora and the traditional knowledge on medicinal plant species used by ethnic communities in rural areas. The active involvement of local populations in the conservation and management of medicinal plant species will encourage future projects for the sustainable development of the biological and cultural diversity of these rural areas of Nepal.">

The &quot;sandwich method&quot; was adopted and used for the screening for allelopathic potential among these plant species. Further phytotoxic evaluation of the candidate species was conducted by applying plant extracts to crops and weed species. The results of this study indicated that among the 50 medicinal plant species evaluated, the fruits of Illicium verum Hook. f. (star anise) showed the most significant allelopathic potential through the leaf leachates. Shikimic acid was identified to be the main bioactive compound (about 7% dry weight) in star anise by reversed-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) analysis. The phytotoxic bioassay indicated that both the crude extract of the Chinese star anise and the synthetic shikimic acid showed strong inhibitory activity on the radicle and hypocotyl growth of lettuce. The radicle growth inhibition of lettuce caused by the crude extract of star anise could be explained by the contribution of the biological activity of shikimic acid. In conclusion, shikimic acid could be a putative allelochemical in the fruits of Illicium verum and could be utilized in sustainable weed management.">

        <span class="abst" title="Stingless bees are a type of honey producers that commonly live in tropical countries. Their use for honey is being abandoned due to its limited production. However, the recent improvements in stingless bee honey production, particularly in South East Asia, have brought stingless bee products back into the picture. Although there are many stingless bee species that produce a wide spread of products, known since old eras in traditional medicine, the modern medical community is still missing more investigational studies on stingless bee products. Whereas comprehensive studies in the current era attest to the biological and medicinal properties of honeybee (&lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt;) products, the properties of stingless bee products are less known. This review highlights for the first time the medicinal benefits of stingless bee products (honey, propolis, pollen and cerumen), recent investigations and promising future directions. This review emphasizes the potential antioxidant properties of these products that in turn play a vital role in preventing and treating diseases associated with oxidative stress, microbial infections and inflammatory disorders. Summarizing all these data and insights in one manuscript may increase the commercial value of stingless bee products as a food ingredient. This review will also highlight the utility of stingless bee products in the context of medicinal and therapeutic properties, some of which are yet to be discovered.">

Moreover, the structure similarity of cordycepin with adenosine makes it an important bioactive component, with difference of only hydroxyl group, lacking in the 3' position of its ribose moiety. Cordycepin is known for various nutraceutical and therapeutic potential, such as anti-diabetic, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-aging, anticancer, antiviral, hepato-protective, hypo-sexuality, cardiovascular diseases, antimalarial, anti-osteoporotic, anti-arthritic, cosmeceutical etc. which makes it a most valuable medicinal mushroom for helping in maintaining good health. In this review, effort has been made to bring altogether the possible wide range of cordycepin's nutraceutical potential along with its pharmacological actions and possible mechanism. Additionally, it also summarizes the details of cordycepin based nutraceuticals predominantly available in the market with expected global value. Moreover, this review will attract the attention of food scientists, nutritionists, pharmaceutical and food industries to improve the use of bioactive molecule cordycepin for nutraceutical purposes with commercialization to aid and promote healthy lifestyle, wellness and wellbeing&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;">

Twenty-seven and twenty-eight compounds were identified from HD and MAE extracted EOs of &lt;i&gt;T. polium&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. The oxygenated sesquiterpenes (57.68%) were characterized as the main components of the hydrodistilled EO with a prominence of 6-epi-shyobunol (33.00%), while sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (54.48%) were the main components of the MAE method, with a prominence of delta-cadinene (25.13%). Eighteen and nineteen compounds, were characterized in &lt;i&gt;T. decussatus&lt;/i&gt; EOs extracted using HD and MAE methods, respectively, and oxygenated monoterpenes represented the main components of both EOs with carvacrol (94.40% and 75.91%, respectively) as the main compound. The EOs extracted using the MAE method were slightly more phytotoxic than those extracted using the HD method. The &lt;i&gt;T. decussatus&lt;/i&gt; EO extracted using the MAE method showed a higher inhibitory effect than &lt;i&gt;T. polium&lt;/i&gt; by 16-, 32-, and 24-fold, regarding seed germination, shoot, and root growth of lettuce, respectively. Moreover, EOs extracted by HD method showed a similar pattern with 16-, 28-, and 14-fold effects. Both &lt;i&gt;T. decussatus&lt;/i&gt; EOs exhibited potent inhibitory effect against all tested bacteria with an inhibition zone of 34-39 mm and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.49, 0.98, and 1.95 μg/mL against &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. However, the EOs of &lt;i&gt;T. polium&lt;/i&gt; showed weak antibacterial activity and no antifungal effect. Further studies are needed for the characterization of bioactive major compounds, either singular or synergistic, at field scale and to determine their modes of action and safety.">

        <span class="abst" title="Malaria is a deadly disease caused by a protozoan parasite whose mode of transmission is through a female Anopheles mosquito. It affects persons of all ages; however, pregnant mothers, young children, and the elderly suffer the most due to their dwindled immune state. The currently prescribed antimalarial drugs have been associated with adverse side effects ranging from intolerance to toxicity. Furthermore, the costs associated with conventional approach of managing malaria are arguably high especially for persons living in low-income countries, hence the need for alternative and complementary approaches. Medicinal plants offer a viable alternative because of their few associated side effects, are arguably cheaper, and are easily accessible. Based on the fact that studies involving antimalarial medicinal plants as potential sources of efficacious and cost-effective pharmacotherapies are far between, this research was designed to investigate antiplasmodial and cytotoxic activities of organic and aqueous extracts of selected plants used by Embu traditional medicine practitioners to treat malaria. The studied plants included &lt;i&gt;Erythrina abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; (stem bark), &lt;i&gt;Schkuhria pinnata&lt;/i&gt; (whole plant), &lt;i&gt;Sterculia africana&lt;/i&gt; (stem bark), &lt;i&gt;Terminalia brownii&lt;/i&gt; (leaves), &lt;i&gt;Zanthoxylum chalybeum&lt;/i&gt; (leaves), &lt;i&gt;Leonotis mollissima&lt;/i&gt; (leaves), &lt;i&gt;Carissa edulis&lt;/i&gt; (leaves), &lt;i&gt;Tithonia diversifolia&lt;/i&gt; (leaves and flowers), and &lt;i&gt;Senna didymobotrya&lt;/i&gt; (leaves and pods). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activity studies of organic and water extracts were carried out against chloroquine-sensitive (D6) and chloroquine-resistance (W2) strains of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial studies were done by Peter's four-day suppression test to test for their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; antimalarial activity against &lt;i&gt;P. berghei&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, cytotoxic effects and safety of the studied plant extracts were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) rapid calorimetric assay technique. The water and methanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;T. brownii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. africana&lt;/i&gt; and dichloromethane extracts of &lt;i&gt;E. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. pinnata&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;T. diversifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaves revealed high &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activities (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 10 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml). Further, moderate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; antimalarial activities were observed for water and methanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;L. mollissima&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. africana&lt;/i&gt; and for dichloromethane extracts of &lt;i&gt;E. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;T. diversifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaves. In this study, aqueous extracts of &lt;i&gt;T. brownii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. africana&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated high antiplasmodial activity and high selectivity indices values (SI ≥ 10) and were found to be safe. It was concluded that &lt;i&gt;T. brownii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. africana&lt;/i&gt; aqueous extracts were potent antiplasmodial agents. Further focused studies geared towards isolation of active constituents and determination of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; toxicities to ascertain their safety are warranted.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recently, Rho GTPases substrates include Rac (Rac1 and Rac2) and Cdc42 that have been reported to exert multiple cellular functions in osteoclasts, the most prominent of which includes regulating the dynamic actin cytoskeleton rearrangements. In addition, natural products and their molecular frameworks have a long tradition as valuable starting points for medicinal chemistry and drug discovery. Although currently, there are reports about the natural product, which could play a therapeutic role in bone loss diseases (osteoporosis and osteolysis) through the regulation of Rac1/2 and Cdc42 during osteoclasts cytoskeletal structuring. There have been several excellent studies for exploring the therapeutic potentials of various natural products for their role in inhibiting cancer cells migration and function via regulating the Rac1/2 and Cdc42. Herein in this review, we try to focus on recent advancement studies for extensively understanding the role of Rho GTPases substrates Rac1, Rac2 and Cdc42 in osteoclastogenesis, as well as therapeutic potentials of natural medicinal products for their properties on the regulation of Rac1, and/or Rac2 and Cdc42, which is in order to inspire drug discovery in regulating osteoclastogenesis.">

        <span class="abst" title="The present &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to determine the efficacy and safety of nine Mediterranean antiacne medicinal plants. The antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts were evaluated in cells from the immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human monocytic cell line (THP-1) as well as in a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial. Most of the extracts showed no significant cytotoxic effects on HaCaT cells up to 250 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. &lt;i&gt;Inula helenium&lt;/i&gt; (IH) and &lt;i&gt;Saponaria officinalis&lt;/i&gt; (SO) inhibited sebum production at 90 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml and 30 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. The inhibition effect of SO on the growth of &lt;i&gt;Cutibacterium acnes&lt;/i&gt; was 1.2 times higher than that of chloramphenicol. IH and SO extracts significantly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced IL-6 and TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; production in THP-1 cells reaching the control levels of untreated cells at a concentration of 250 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. SO, IH, and &lt;i&gt;Solanum nigrum&lt;/i&gt; (SN) extracts inhibited the nitric oxide (NO) production in a dose-dependent manner. Based on these results, an antiacne herbal cream (AHC) was prepared from different portions of extracts from SO, IH, and SN, and its efficacy was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, and controlled efficacy study with 41 acne patients, ages 18-24, who were asked to apply AHC (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 27) or a placebo (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 14) two to three times daily for six weeks. Results obtained indicate that the AHC has unique synergistic effects that halt sebum production, combined with highly antiseptic and anti-inflammatory activity, in which 54.95% (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 19.37 &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) of acne inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions disappeared after two weeks, 85.3%, after five weeks (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 14.19 &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001), and 91.4%, at the end of the sixth week of application (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = 5.7 &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, SO, IH, and SN as single extracts and in combination as AHC showed significant antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in a double-blind, randomized, and controlled antiacne efficacy. Therefore, AHC represents an interesting alternative treatment for acne.">

In Kenya, a water concoction of the plant is used to treat breast and prostate cancers. Laboratory data on its anti-cancer activity and active principles is limited, hence no scientific rationale for its medicinal use. This study reports on &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; toxic activities of dichloromethane and methanol extracts of the plant against human breast cancer cells and phytochemical screening of the two extracts.&lt;h4&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;Plant extracts were obtained by sequential solvent extraction of dry plant material (stem bark) using analytical grade dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) and methanol (Sigma Aldrich). &lt;i&gt;In-vitro&lt;/i&gt; anti-cancer activities of the extracts were determined using the suphorhodamine (SRB) assay against a human breast cancer cell line (HCC 1937). Preliminary Thin layer chromatography of plant extracts was done using POLYGRAM® SIL G/UV&lt;sub&gt;254&lt;/sub&gt; plates (Merck) to establish presence of different classes of secondary metabolites.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;In-vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxic activities of the two extracts were significantly different (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.05). The methanol extract exhibited higher activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 26.02 μg/ml) compared to that of dichloromethane: methanol (1:1) (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 55.01 μg/ml). Phyto-chemical screening of the two extracts revealed the presence of terpenoids, phenols, steroids and flavonoids.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The high &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; anti-cancer activities of solvent extracts of &lt;i&gt;Kigelia africana&lt;/i&gt; justify its use in traditional medicine to manage breast cancer. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts reveal similar profiles hence the differences in their anti-cancer activities can be attributed to quantitative variations of various classes of secondary metabolites.">

On the basis of increasing order of polarity, different organic solvents were used to obtain different fractions. Enzymatic studies were performed on crude methanolic extract of the plant. All the assays were performed under standard &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; conditions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The phytochemical analysis shows the presence of alkaloids, phenols, triterpenoids, phytosterols, and flavonoids. Phenolic compounds and flavonoids are the major constituents of the plant. In anticholinesterase assay, the percent inhibition of standard drug (eserine) was 91.27 ± 1.17 and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) was 0.04 ± 0.0001. For α-glucosidase inhibition, the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value for Dichloromethane fraction was 8.45 ± 0.13, for Methanol fraction it was 64.24 ± 0.15, and for aqueous fraction it was 42.62 ± 0.17 as compared with standard IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; that is 37.42 (acarbose). Furthermore, results show that all fractions have potential against anti-urease enzyme, but DCM fraction of crude aqueous extract has significant IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value (45.26 ± 0.13) than other fractions.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Keeping in view all the results, it is evident that the plant can be used in future for formulating effective drugs against many ailments. Secondary metabolites and their derivatives possess different biological activities, for example, .g. flavonoids in cancer, asthma, and Alzheimer. Furthermore, the extracts of this plant can be used in their crude form, which is an addition to the complementary and alternative treatment strategies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) is a major cause of hospital- and community-acquired infections worldwide. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore the antibacterial activity of the two medicinal plants &lt;i&gt;Epaltes divaricata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vetiveria zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; against strains of MRSA which were isolated from patients with skin and soft tissue infections. Hexane, ethanol, and water extracts of &lt;i&gt;E. divaricata&lt;/i&gt; (whole plant) and &lt;i&gt;V. zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; (roots) were prepared. Clinical isolates of MRSA strains (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20) were used for the study. Bacterial susceptibility was tested using a disc diffusion assay. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by a broth microdilution method. Vancomycin was used as the positive control. Hexane, ethanol, and water extracts of &lt;i&gt;E. divaricata&lt;/i&gt; showed inhibitory zones against MRSA. Except for water extract, both hexane and ethanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;V. zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; showed inhibitory zones. MIC ranges of hexane, ethanol, and water extracts in &lt;i&gt;E. divaricata&lt;/i&gt; were 0.012-0.32 mg/mL, 0.019-2.4 mg/mL, and 0.019-0.48 mg/mL, respectively. Respective MIC ranges of hexane and ethanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;V. zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; were 0.003-0.032 mg/mL and 0.019-2.4 mg/mL. The hexane extract of &lt;i&gt;V. zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; inhibited 55% of the selected MRSA strains at a relatively low MIC value of 0.012 mg/mL. The hexane extract of both plants demonstrated inhibition of 75% of MRSA strains at a MIC value of 0.064 mg/mL. Ethanol extract of &lt;i&gt;V. zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E. divaricata,&lt;/i&gt; respectively, inhibited 70% and 45% of MRSA strains at the MIC of 0.096 mg/mL, whereas water extract of &lt;i&gt;E. divaricata&lt;/i&gt; inhibited 80% of MRSA strains at the same MIC. Both &lt;i&gt;E. divaricata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;V. zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; were equally effective against MRSA at a MIC of 0.064 mg/mL. But &lt;i&gt;V. zizanioides&lt;/i&gt; was more effective since the hexane extract inhibited more than 50% of MRSA strains at significantly a lower MIC value of 0.012 mg/mL. Fractionation, purification, and identification of active compounds will warrant further evaluation of the therapeutic potential of both plant extracts.">

Assessment of antifungal activity was achieved using the agar dilution method.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Screening the biological activity of plant extracts revealed that the sample from Ramallah (middle region) possessed the most potent antioxidant activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.45 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. The three samples exhibited broad antimicrobial activity and showed potential antifungal activity. The sample from the southern region showed the highest potency against &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; with the lowest reported MIC; the sample from the northern region demonstrated the least potency against clinical isolate of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &quot;methicillin&quot;-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The study showed that &lt;i&gt;Micromeria fruticosa serpyllifolia&lt;/i&gt; volatile oil samples from different regions in Palestine possess different potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activities that were in line with traditional uses of the plant extracts.">

The search for new drugs and repurposing of existing drugs are being performed; however, at the same time, research on plants to identify novel therapeutic compounds or testing the existing ones is progressing at a slower phase. In this context, genomics and biotechnology offer various tools and strategies to manipulate plants for producing those complex biopharmaceutical products. This review enumerates the scope for research on plant-based molecules for their potential application in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strategies to edit gene and genome, overexpression and silencing approaches, and molecular breeding for producing target biomolecules in the plant system are discussed in detail. Altogether, the present review provides a roadmap for expediting research on using plants as a novel source of active biomolecules having therapeutic applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;In Sri Lanka, a Polyherbal Ayurvedic Formulation (PHAF), which consists of powders of seven medicinal plants, is being trialed for use as an anti-inflammatory drug. In general, anti-inflammatory drugs have good antioxidant properties. Therefore, in the present study, an attempt was made to assess the quality and evaluate the antioxidant potential of PHAF.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Physicochemical parameters such as ash content, extractable matter, phytochemical screening for secondary metabolites, levels of heavy metals, and microbes were determined according to standard protocols. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using five in vitro assays: total polyphenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity), DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl), and ABTS (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;PHAF contained 5.6 ± 0.2% of moisture, 6.5 ± 0.1% of total ash, 1.4 ± 0.1% of water soluble ash, 0.9 ± 0.0% of acid insoluble ash, 7.7 ± 0.2% of hot water extractable matter, 3.9 ± 0.1% of cold water extractable matter, 10.5 ± 4.1% of hot-ethanol extractable matter, and 8.4 ± 0.2% of cold-ethanol extractable matter. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of phenolic compounds, tannins, flavonoids, coumarins, and saponins in both aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the drug. TPC, TFC, ORAC, DPPH, and ABTS of aqueous and ethanol extracts of PHAF were 103.65 ± 4.94 and 327.07 ± 9.65 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract, 76.6 ± 5.83 and 224.6 ± 8.42 mg quercetin equivalents/g of extract, 481.11 ± 17.30 and 1481.44 ± 30.20 mg trolox equivalents/g of extract, 79.50 ± 4.42 and 227.17 ± 6.16 mg trolox equivalents/g of extract, and 198.20 ± 4.55 and 577.08 ± 5.48 mg trolox equivalents/g of extract, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Ethanolic extract of PHAF is better than aqueous extract in terms of antioxidant properties.">

Cosmetics exploiting traditional Korean medicine lead this trend; thus, the traditional medicinal literature has been invaluable in terms of cosmetic development. We sought candidate medicinal herbs for skincare.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We used data mining to investigate associations between medicinal herbs and skin-related keywords (SRKs) in a classical text. We selected 26 SRKs used in the Donguibogam text; these referred to 626 medicinal herbs. Using a term frequency-inverse document frequency approach, we extracted data on herbal characteristics by assessing the co-occurrence frequencies of 52 medicinal herbs and the 26 SRKs.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We extracted the characteristics of the 52 herbs, each of which exhibited a distinct skin-related action profile. For example Ginseng Radix was associated at a high-level with tonification and anti-aging, but Rehmanniae Radix exhibited a stronger association with anti-aging. Of the 52 herbs, 46 had been subjected to at least one modern study on skincare-related efficacy.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We made a comprehensive list of candidate medicinal herbs for skincare &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; data mining a classical medical text. This enhances our understanding of such herbs and will help with discovering new candidate herbs.">

The aim of this study was to evaluate the methanol crude extract and various fractions of increasing polarity of J. mimosifolia leaves for bioactive metabolites, as well as antimicrobial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. The anti-inflammatory potential of the various fractions of J. mimosifolia leaf extract was studied via the lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory assay. Methanol crude extract (ME), derived fractions extracted with chloroform (CF) and ethyl acetate (EAF), and residual aqueous extract (AE) of dried J. mimosifolia leaves were assayed for polyphenolic compounds, their antioxidant, antimicrobial and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitory activities, and anticancer properties. Polyphenolic compounds were determined via HPLC while phytochemicals (total phenolics, flavonoids, tannins and ortho-diphenol contents), antioxidant activities (DPPH, hydrogen peroxideperoxide, hydroxyl and superoxide radical anions) and LOX were measured via spectrophotometry. Methanol extracts and various fractions were evaluated for antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antifungal potential of the fractions was tested against three species: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium oxysporum. The highest values for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), flavonols, tannins and ortho-diphenols were in the ME, followed by CF &gt; EAF &gt; AE. ME also had the highest antioxidant activity with EC50 values 48±1.3, 45±2.4, 42±1.3 and 46±1.3 μg/mL based on the DPPH, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and superoxide radical assays, respectively. TPC and TFC showed a significant, strong and positive correlation with the values for each of these antioxidant activities. ME exhibited anti-inflammatory potential based on its LOX inhibitory activity (IC50 = 1.3 μg/mL). ME also had the maximum antibacterial and antifungal potential, followed by EAF &gt; CF &gt; AE. Furthermore, ME showed the strongest cytotoxic effect (EC50 = 10.7 and 17.3 μg/mL) against human hormone-dependent prostate carcinoma (LnCaP) and human lung carcinoma (LU-1) cell lines, respectively. Bioactive compounds present in leaf methanol extracts of J. mimosifolia were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fifteen compounds were identified including phenolic and alcoholic compounds, as well as fatty acids. Our results suggest that J. mimosifolia leaves are a good source of natural products with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties for potential therapeutic, nutraceutical and functional food applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="Medicinal plants have been the main focus of natural product research. However, recent research has revealed that lower plants including bryophytes are also a major resource of biologically active compounds with novel structures. Sri Lanka is considered as a biodiversity hotspot with a higher degree of endemism flora including bryophytes. In this study, different species of bryophytes were investigated for their antimicrobial and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities. The air-dried plant materials of 6 different bryophyte species, &lt;i&gt;Marchantia&lt;/i&gt; sp., &lt;i&gt;Fissidens&lt;/i&gt; sp., &lt;i&gt;Plagiochila&lt;/i&gt; sp., &lt;i&gt;Sematophyllum demissum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hypnum cupressiforme&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Calymperes motley&lt;/i&gt;, were subjected to sequential cold extraction with 3 different organic solvents. All three types of organic crude extracts were subjected to screening of antimicrobial bioassays using the disc-diffusion method against 3 bacterial strains and 1 fungal strain. According to the results obtained, 6 extracts out of 18 showed antibacterial activity for tested Gram-positive bacteria and 1 active against Gram-negative bacteria. Two extracts showed activity against the pathogenic fungus strain. Extracts from some plants were active against tested bacterial as well as fungal species. TLC-based bioautographic study was carried out to identify the corresponding active bands which is useful for active compound isolation. Furthermore, the ethyl acetate extracts were subjected to evaluate alpha-amylase inhibitory activity where three extracts out of six extracts showed moderate inhibitory activity for alpha-amylase with IC50 ranging 8-30%.">

        <span class="abst" title="Blood-brain barrier endothelial cells are the main targets of diabetes-related hyperglycemia that alters endothelial functions and brain homeostasis. Hyperglycemia-mediated oxidative stress may play a causal role. This study evaluated the protective effects of characterized polyphenol-rich medicinal plant extracts on redox, inflammatory and vasoactive markers on murine bEnd3 cerebral endothelial cells exposed to high glucose concentration. The results show that hyperglycemic condition promoted oxidative stress through increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, deregulated antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and altered expression of genes encoding Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) redox factors. Cell preconditioning with inhibitors of signaling pathways highlights a causal role of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), while a protective action of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) on redox changes. The hyperglycemic condition induced a pro-inflammatory response by elevating NFκB gene expression and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion, and deregulated the production of endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and nitric oxide (NO) vasoactive markers. Importantly, polyphenolic extracts from Antirhea borbonica, Ayapana triplinervis, Dodonaea viscosa, and Terminalia bentzoe French medicinal plants, counteracted high glucose deleterious effects by exhibiting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In an innovative way, quercetin, caffeic, chlorogenic and gallic acids identified as predominant plant polyphenols, and six related circulating metabolites were found to exert similar benefits. Collectively, these findings demonstrate polyphenol protective action on cerebral endothelial cells during hyperglycemic condition.">

Phytochemical screening of bioactives was performed using an integrated LC-MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and high resolution MS (Mass Spectrometry) approach. Forty-three compounds were tentatively identified, mainly aglyconic and glycosilated flavonoids and phenolic acids, as well as other bioactives such as coumarins and terpenes were detected. Furthermore, the NF-κB and AP-1 inhibitory activity of &lt;i&gt;C. oppositifolia&lt;/i&gt; extract were evaluated, as well as its cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells, in order to assess the potential use of this herb as a source of anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic compounds. The results so far obtained indicate that &lt;i&gt;C. oppositifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaves extract could significantly reduce the viability of THP-1 cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.2 ± 1.2 µg/mL), as well as the activation of both NF-κB and AP-1 at the concentration of 2 μg/mL. Our results indicate that Nepalese &lt;i&gt;C. oppositifolia&lt;/i&gt; is a valuable source of anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic compounds. The phytochemical composition reported here can partially justify the traditional uses of &lt;i&gt;C. oppositifolia&lt;/i&gt; in Nepal, especially in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, although further research will be needed to assess the full potential of this species.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance&lt;/h4&gt;The subtribe Hyptidinae contains approximately 400 accepted species distributed in 19 genera (Hyptis, Eriope, Condea, Cantinoa, Mesosphaerum, Cyanocephalus, Hypenia, Hyptidendron, Oocephalus, Medusantha, Gymneia, Marsypianthes, Leptohyptis, Martianthus, Asterohyptis, Eplingiella, Physominthe, Eriopidion and Rhaphiodon). This is the Lamiaceae clade with the largest number of species in Brazil and high rates of endemism. Some species have been used in different parts of the world mainly as insecticides/pest repellents, wound healing and pain-relief agents, as well as for the treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders.&lt;h4&gt;Aim of the review&lt;/h4&gt;This review aims to discuss the current status concerning the taxonomy, ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry and biological properties of species which compose the subtribe Hyptidinae.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The available information was collected from scientific databases (ScienceDirect, Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, ChemSpider, SciFinder ACS Publications, Wiley Online Library), as well as other literature sources (e.g. books, theses).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The phytochemical investigations of plants of this subtribe have led to the identification of almost 300 chemical constituents of different classes such as diterpenes, triterpenes, lignans, α-pyrones, flavonoids, phenolic acids and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, as components of essential oils. Extracts, essential oils and isolated compounds showed a series of biological activities such as insecticide/repellent, antimicrobial and antinociceptive, justifying some of the popular uses of the plants. In addition, a very relevant fact is that several species produce podophyllotoxin and related lignans.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Several species of Hyptidinae are used in folk medicine for treating many diseases but only a small fraction of the species has been explored and most of the traditional uses have not been validated by current investigations. In addition, the species of the subtribe appear to be very promising as alternative sources of podophyllotoxin-like lignans which are the lead compounds for the semi-synthesis of teniposide and etoposide, important antineoplastic agents. Thus, there is a wide-open door for future studies, both to support the popular uses of the plants and to find new biologically active compounds in this large number of species not yet explored.">

Natural products (NPs) such as plant and fungal metabolites have emerged as leads in drug discovery during recent years due to their efficacy, safety and selectivity. The current review summarizes natural sources as well as pharmacological potential of hispolon which is a major constituent of traditional medicinal mushroom Phellinus linteus. The study aims to update the scientific community about recent developments of hispolon in the arena of natural drugs by providing insights into its present status in therapeutic pursuits. Hispolon, a polyphenol has been reported to possess anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. It fights against cancer via induction of apoptosis, halting cell cycle and inhibition of metastasis by targeting various cellular signaling pathways including PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-κB. The current review proposes that hispolon provides a novel opportunity for pharmacological applications and its styrylpyrone carbon skeleton might serve as an attractive scaffold for drug development. However, future researches are recommended to assess bioavailability, toxicological limits, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of hispolon, in order to establish its potential as a potent multi-targeted drug in the near future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (SNPs) have great potential for biomedical applications, due to their distinctive optical, chemical, and catalytic properties. In this study, we aimed to develop green-synthesized SNPs from extracts of &lt;i&gt;Cudrania tricuspidata&lt;/i&gt; (CT) roots (CTR), stems (CTS), leaves (CTL), and fruit (CTF) and to evaluate their physicochemical, photocatalytic, and biological properties. CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts were evaluated and compared for their total phenol and flavonoid content, reducing capacity, and antioxidant activity. The results revealed that CTR, CTS, CTL, and CTF extracts have high phenol and flavonoid content, as well as a powerful antioxidant and reducing capacity. CTR and CTS extracts showed the strongest effects. The results from UV-Vis spectra analysis, dynamic light scattering, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed the successful formation of CT-SNPs with surface morphology, crystallinity, reduction capacity, capsulation, and stabilization. Synthesized CT-SNPs successfully photocatalyzed methylene blue, methyl orange, rhodamine B, and Reactive Black 5 within 20 min. The CTR- and CTS-SNPs showed better antibacterial properties against different pathogenic microbes (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enteritidis&lt;/i&gt;) than the CTL- and CTF-SNPs. CTS- and CTR-SNPs showed the most effective cytotoxicity and antiapoptosis properties in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2 and SK-Hep-1). CT-SNPs also seemed to be more biologically active than the CT extracts. The results of this study provide evidence of the establishment of CT extract SNPs and their physicochemical, photocatalytic, and biological properties.">

Tetraena simplex, a new species (synonym) that is mainly grown in Oman, has traditionally been used as a medicine for asthma. This study aimed to assess antioxidant and antibacterial activities of T. simplex extracts of various polarities using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and agar gel diffusion assays. Among the six extracts prepared, ethyl acetate extract showed the highest antioxidant activity and hexane extract showed the lowest antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activity of the extracts decreased in the order of ethyl acetate &gt; dichloromethane &gt; water &gt; butanol &gt; methanol &gt; hexane. Similarly, antibacterial activities, indicated as inhibition zones, of the six extracts at four concentrations were assessed against two gram-positive bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus) and three gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus bacilli). No extract showed antibacterial activity against the tested bacteria at any concentration. Therefore, the ethyl acetate extract of T. simplex may be used as an antioxidant or a food supplement as an alternative to synthetic drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="The quality of health care in Mesoamerica is influenced by its rich cultural diversity and characterized by social inequalities. Especially indigenous and rural communities confront diverse barriers to accessing formal health services, leading to often conflicting plurimedical systems. Fostering integrative medicine is a fundamental pillar for achieving universal health coverage (UHC) for marginalized populations. Recent developments toward health sovereignty in the region are concerned with assessing the role of traditional medicines, and particularly herbal medicines, to foster accessible and culturally pertinent healthcare provision models. In Mesoamerica, as in most regions of the world, a wealth of information on traditional and complementary medicine has been recorded. Yet these data are often scattered, making it difficult for policy makers to regulate and integrate traditionally used botanical products into primary health care. This critical review is based on a quantitative analysis of 28 survey papers focusing on the traditional use of botanical drugs in Mesoamerica used for the compilation of the &quot;Mesoamerican Medicinal Plant Database&quot; (MAMPDB), which includes a total of 12,537 use-records for 2188 plant taxa. Our approach presents a fundamental step toward UHC by presenting a pharmacological and toxicological review of the cross-culturally salient plant taxa and associated botanical drugs used in traditional medicine in Mesoamerica. Especially for native herbal drugs, data about safety and effectiveness are limited. Commonly used cross-culturally salient botanical drugs, which are considered safe but for which data on effectiveness is lacking constitute ideal candidates for treatment outcome studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Hepatobiliary disease currently serves as an important public health issue due to the fact that it is one of the major causes of death among economically active individuals and can easily progress to chronic diseases. Despite the development of vaccines and numerous drugs, a definite treatment remains lacking owing to different stages of the disease itself, its intricate pathogenesis, an effect uncertainty for long-term use, resistance, and side effects. Curcuma longa (C. longa), which belongs to the family Zingiberaceae and the genus Curcuma, has long been used not only as spice for curry or dye but also as a constituent of herbal formula for the treatment of different diseases due to its bioactive activities. Recently, many studies on the experimental results of C. longa have been published relative to hepatobiliary diseases such as fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and tumors. Therefore, in this review, we aimed to summarize the pharmacological effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of C. longa and its four compounds, β-elemene, germacrone, ar-turmerone, and bisacurone, against hepatobiliary diseases. C. longa exhibited antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antisteatotic, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, antitumor, and cholagogic effects by regulating apoptosis, CYP2E1, Nrf, lipid metabolism-related factors, TGF-β, NF-κB, CYP7A1, and so on. In particular, β-elemene could be an attractive compound owing to its remarkable hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antitumor activities. Altogether, the present review provides a preclinical basis for the efficacy of C. longa as an effective therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of hepatobiliary diseases, despite the need for further studies to establish the extraction conditions and separation of active constituents with high bioavailability, and warrants further evaluation in clinical trials.">

However, this standard classifies ethnomedicinal uses into categories based on local peoples' perception. It is difficult to apply in pharmacological research. The International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), now updated to ICPC-2, is more related to medical terms, but is rarely used among ethnobotanists. This study aims to apply the ICPC-2 to classify metadata of the ethnomedicinal uses of Zingiberaceae plants in Thailand, in order to identify important medicinal taxa for future research. Data on the ethnomedicinal uses of Thai gingers were collected from 62 theses, journal articles, scientific reports and a book, published between 1990 and 2019. Scientific plant names were updated using The World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) website. Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) was used to identify the medicinal issues commonly treated with gingers, and the Cultural Importance Index (CI) was used to identify species that might have pharmacological potential. We found records of 76 ginger species with ethnomedicinal uses, and together they had 771 use reports. The gingers were commonly used for treatments related to digestive system conditions, particularly abdominal pain and flatulence. Gingers remain exceedingly important in Thai ethnomedicine, with a high number of useful species. They are used to treat a variety of health conditions, but most commonly such ones that are related to the digestive system. Apart from the popular studied ginger, &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;, we identified a number of other useful gingers in Thailand.">

We used the Utilitarian Equivalence Model (transposing the concept of ecological equivalence, proposed by Odum, for ethnobotany) to test the hypothesis that species that have the same taxonomic affiliation tend to have the same therapeutic applications in different environments (utilitarian equivalence). In addition, we used the Utilitarian Redundancy Model to verify whether, within the same medical system, plants of the same taxonomic affiliation tend to be redundant (treating the same diseases).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We found that a pair of plants of the same genus were 9.25 times more likely to be equivalent than a different genus pair (OR = 9.25, CI [1.68-51.02], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). When we analyzed the species used by the same population, the chances of a pair having similar therapeutic uses (utilitarian redundancy) increased when they were species of the same family (OR = 1.94, CI [1.06-3.53]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;These findings confirm the hypothesis that there is an influence of taxonomic affiliation, in terms of genera and family, on the selection of medicinal plants in semi-arid and humid areas in Northeast Brazil. In addition, our Utilitarian Equivalence Model can be an important tool in the search for more common selection criteria, in order to identify the shared characteristics among the equivalent pairs and consequently the main types of perceptions or stimuli that led to the inclusion of such species in local pharmacopoeias.">

The &lt;i&gt;L. tigris&lt;/i&gt; cultivar sclerotia (Ligno TG-K) was found to contain numerous bioactive compounds with beneficial biomedicinal properties and the sclerotial extract exhibited potent antioxidant activity. However, the anticancer property of the Ligno TG-K including in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects as well as its anticancer active compounds and the mechanisms has yet to be investigated.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The cytotoxicity of the Ligno TG-K against human breast (MCF7), prostate (PC3) and lung (A549) adenocarcinoma cell lines was evaluated using MTT cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxic mechanisms of the active high molecular weight proteins (HMWp) fraction were investigated through detection of caspases activity and apoptotic-related proteins expression by Western blotting. The in vivo antitumor activity of the isolated HMWp was examined using MCF7 mouse xenograft model. Shotgun LC-MS/MS analysis was performed to identify the proteins in the HMWp.&lt;h4&gt;Results and discussion&lt;/h4&gt;Cold water extract of the sclerotia inhibited proliferation of MCF7, A549 and PC3 cells with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ranged from 28.9 to 95.0 µg/mL. Bioassay guided fractionation of the extract revealed that HMWp exhibited selective cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells via induction of cellular apoptosis by the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic signaling pathways. HMWp activated expression of caspase-8 and -9 enzymes, and pro-apoptotic Bax protein whilst inhibiting expression of tumor survivor protein, Bcl-2. HMWp induced tumor-cell apoptosis and suppressed growth of tumor in MCF-7 xenograft mice. Lectins, serine proteases, RNase Gf29 and a 230NA deoxyribonuclease are the major cytotoxic proteins that accounted for 55.93% of the HMWp.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The findings from this study provided scientific evidences to support the traditional use of the &lt;i&gt;L. tigris&lt;/i&gt; sclerotia for treatment of breast cancer. Several cytotoxic proteins with high abundance have been identified in the HMWp of the sclerotial extract and these proteins have potential to be developed into new anticancer agents or as adjunct cancer therapy.">

Sennoside A capped silver nanoparticles (Ag/sennoside A) were synthesized at room temperature for the first time by using sennoside A as reducing and capping agent. UV-visible spectroscopic data reveals that the absorption peaks of pure sennoside A was appeared at 266, and 340 nm, which red shifted to 304, and 354 nm at higher sennoside A concentration. Upon addition of the Ag+ ions, an additional peak also observed at 398 nm, indicating the formation of spherical sennoside A capped silver nanoparticles (Ag/sennoside A). Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was used a stabilizing agent to determine the role of cationic micelles on the nucleation and growth processes of Ag/sennoside A NPs formation. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl nitrogen radical (DPPH · ), two bacteria strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) and two yeast strains (Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019) were used to determine the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of Ag/sennoside A NPs. In addition, Rhein-9-anthrone (4,5-dihydroxy-10-oxo-9H-anthracene-2-carboxylate) was isolated from the acidic hydrolysis of glycoside linkage of sennoside A and characterized.

Many of its members have been used in traditional medicine to treat and prevent various human disorders such as asthma, hemorrhoid, diarrhea, gastric ulcers, and wound healing. The multiple biological activities including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, anticancer, gastroprotective, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities have been ascribed to the presence of bioactive compounds such as triterpenoids, phenolic acids, and flavonoids. This paper aimed to provide available information on the medicinal uses, phytochemicals, and pharmacology of species from Quercus.

Additionally, we determined the ability of these extracts to inhibit the activity of PknB protein, an essential M. tuberculosis serine/threonine kinase, using a high-throughput luminescent assay. Of the 118 extracts tested, 14 inhibited bacterial growth with a minimum inhibitory concentration ≤500 μg/ml, and 36 inhibited the kinase activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration &lt;200 μg/ml. Five extracts inhibited M. tuberculosis growth and inhibited the activity of the kinase protein, suggesting that this could be the basis of their growth inhibition.">

An important element of this is herbal medicine, which requires both theoretical and practical knowledge. A field trip programme was adopted to provide students with direct experience of medicinal plants studied in lectures. However, problems with the current programme were identified in learning outcome assessment and long-term knowledge management. To improve the teaching quality, a Moodle e-learning module was designed for augmentation. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the Moodle module in supplementing the current field trip programme.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Prospective quasi-experiment. Participants were 49 year-2 students in the Bachelor of Chinese Medicine programme. A Moodle module including five online activities regarding two groups of herbal plants was integrated before and after the field trip. Fill-in-the-blank questions were used to assess the learning outcome. Also, a questionnaire was developed to collect student feedback as the secondary outcome.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;For herbal plants in Group A, the assessment score was higher in Moodle group (29.65 ± 5.0) than for the control group (21.65 ± 6.5) (P &lt;  0.01). For herbal plants in Group B, the assessment score was higher for the Moodle group (28.68 ± 4.7) than for the control group (24.26 ± 7.7) (P &lt;  0.01). The questionnaire results showed that students were satisfied with the Moodle platform.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;A specially designed Moodle module may be effective in augmenting the field trip for Chinese herbal medicine education.">

However, little is known about the diversity of medicinal plant endophytes (ME) or their capability to produce specialised metabolites that may contribute to therapeutic properties. We isolated 75 bacterial ME from 24 plant species of the Western Ghats, India. Molecular identification by 16S rRNA gene sequencing grouped MEs into 13 bacterial genera, with members of Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes being the most abundant. To improve taxonomic identification, 26 selected MEs were genome sequenced and average nucleotide identity (ANI) used to identify them to the species-level. This identified multiple species in the most common genus as Bacillus. Similarly, identity of the Enterobacterales was also distinguished within Enterobacter and Serratia by ANI and core-gene analysis. AntiSMASH identified non-ribosomal peptide synthase, lantipeptide and bacteriocin biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) as the most common BGCs found in the ME genomes. A total of five of the ME isolates belonging to Bacillus, Serratia and Enterobacter showed antimicrobial activity against the plant pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum. Using molecular and genomic approaches we have characterised a unique collection of endophytic bacteria from medicinal plants. Their genomes encode multiple specialised metabolite gene clusters and the collection can now be screened for novel bioactive and medicinal metabolites.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Signals of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) form the basis of some regulatory risk-minimization actions in pharmacovigilance. Reviews of limited scope have highlighted that such signals are mostly supported by reports of ADRs or multiple types of evidence. The time that elapses between a report of a suspected ADR and the communication of a signal has not been systematically characterized. Neither has the features of reports of suspected ADRs that authors used to support putative causal relationships, although difficulties with establishing causal relationships between medicinal products and adverse events have been highlighted. The objectives of this study will be to describe the evidence underpinning signals in pharmacovigilance, the features of reports of ADRs supporting signals, and the time that it takes to communicate a signal. METHODS:We shall retrieve records from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (from inception onwards), without language/design restrictions, and apply backward citation screening. We shall hand-search the websites of 35 regulatory agencies/authorities, restricted publications from the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, and drug bulletins. Signals will be requested from the competent stakeholder, if absent from websites. We shall use VigiBase, the World Health Organization's Global Individual Case Safety Report database, to determine the dates on which ADRs were reported. We shall manage records using EndNote (v. 8.2); one reviewer will screen titles/abstracts and full texts, a second will cross-validate the findings, and a third will arbitrate disagreements. Data will be charted via the Systematic Reviews Data Repository, following the same procedures as for data retrieval. Evidence will be categorized according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Features of reports of ADRs will be coded. Tables will display frequencies of types of evidence and features of reports of ADRs. We shall use plots or pictograms (if appropriate) to represent the time from the first report of a suspected ADR to a signal. DISCUSSION:We expect the findings from this review will allow a better understanding of global patterns of similarities or differences in terms of supporting evidence and timing of communications and identify relevant research questions for future systematic reviews.

        <span class="abst" title="The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has been declared world pandemic causing a worrisome number of deaths, especially among vulnerable citizens, in 209 countries around the world. Although several therapeutic molecules are being tested, no effective vaccines or specific treatments have been developed. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, different traditional herbal medicines with promising results have been used alone or in combination with conventional drugs to treat infected patients. Here, we review the recent findings regarding the use of natural products to prevent or treat COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the mechanisms responsible for this preventive or therapeutic effect are discussed. We conducted literature research using PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and WHO website. Dissertations and theses were not considered. Only the situation reports edited by the WHO were included. The different herbal products (extracts) and purified molecules may exert their anti-SARS-CoV-2 actions by direct inhibition of the virus replication or entry. Interestingly, some products may block the ACE-2 receptor or the serine protease TMPRRS2 required by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. In addition, natural products were shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 life-cycle related proteins such as papain-like or chymotrypsin-like proteases. In conclusion, we suggest that natural products could be used alone or in combination as alternative medicines to treat/prevent COVID-19 infection. Moreover, their structures may offer clues for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Mining activities have environmental impacts due to sediment movement and contamination of areas and may also pose risks to people's food security. In Brazil, the majority of coal mining activities are in the south, in the Santa Catarina carboniferous region. In this region, previously mined areas contaminated with heavy metals frequently occur nearby inhabited zones. Mining is part of the daily lives of local communities, and its environmental impacts are visible in the landscape; however, plants with medicinal and food use from these areas can be still consumed. Heavy metals are contaminants that do not have odor, color, or taste, and are therefore difficult to detect. We aimed to verify whether people use plants from contaminated mine areas, and understand which factors can influence the use of these resources, even from areas visibly impacted. METHODS:We conducted 195 semi-structured interviews with residents from 14 areas nearby abandoned mines in the main municipalities of the Santa Catarina carboniferous region. We asked each interviewee about the length of time they lived in the region, their perception of the quality of the environment, and what plant species were used and for what purpose. We constructed generalized multivariate linear models to verify which variables can affect the group of species mentioned and generalized linear models to verify which variables can affect the total number of citations. We estimated the frequency of citing species collected using the Smith index. RESULTS:From all interviewees, 127 (65%) reported collecting plants for medicinal and food use, directly from contaminated mine areas. Long-term residents, as well as those who noticed more environmental changes (positive and negative), cited more plants used and had more detailed knowledge of plant use in their communities. When asked if they were aware of the possible contamination of mined areas, 85% said they knew about it. However, only 10% associated negative health effects with the use of plant species collected in contaminated mined areas. CONCLUSIONS:Our study demonstrates that people living nearby contaminated areas use and consume locally sourced plants, e.g., people know little about the danger of this contamination in their food and the risk of these contaminants to their health. These results also reveal a lack of information about contamination, as well as a lack of actions that include local communities in contaminated area restoration strategies. This situation poses a risk to the food security of the people living nearby former coal mining areas.">

The antiglycation activity was analyzed based on the inhibition of AGEs, fructosamine, and thiol groups level followed by the inhibition of protein carbonyl formation. The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power assay) and total phenolic contents were evaluated. After 28 days of induction, all varieties of &lt;i&gt;Ficus deltoidea&lt;/i&gt; extracts significantly restrained the formation of fluorescence AGEs by 4.55-5.14 fold. The extracts also reduced the fructosamine levels by 47.0-86.5%, increased the thiol group levels by 64.3-83.7%, and inhibited the formation of protein carbonyl by 1.36-1.76 fold. DPPH radical scavenging activity showed an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 66.81-288.04 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml and reducing power activity depicted at 0.02-0.24 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. The extent of phenolic compounds present in the extracts ranged from 70.90 to 299.78 mg·GAE/g. Apart from that, correlation studies between the activities were observed. This study revealed that seven varieties of &lt;i&gt;Ficus deltoidea&lt;/i&gt; have the potential to inhibit AGEs formation and possess antioxidant activity that might be attributed to the presence of phenolic compounds.">

        <span class="abst" title="Secondary metabolites and their biological activity have pharmacological relevance in the prevention and therapeutic management of disease, including the facilitation of normal physiological processes through biochemical mechanisms. In this study, phytochemical constituents and antioxidant activity were evaluated quantitatively on the acetone, ethanol, and aqueous extracts of the flesh, and peel, as well as the boiled peel extract compartments of &lt;i&gt;Musa sinensis&lt;/i&gt; L. and &lt;i&gt;Musa paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt; L. fruits. Total phenol, proanthocyanidin, and flavonoid contents were estimated and measured spectrophotometrically. The free radical scavenging antioxidant capacity of the extracts was tested on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ethanol), ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) assay models. Correlation between phytoconstituents and antioxidant activity was analysed using Pearson's coefficient. The results showed varying amounts of phytochemicals in the solvent extracts of the flesh and peel, including the boiled peel extract of &lt;i&gt;M. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt;. All acetone extracts of &lt;i&gt;M. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; flesh, &lt;i&gt;M. paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt; flesh, and &lt;i&gt;M. paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt; peel had the highest phytochemical contents, with the exception of the ethanol extract of &lt;i&gt;M. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; peel which had the highest phenol content; just as on the overall scale, the peel compartments had generally higher phytochemical profiles than the soft flesh in both fruits. The boiled peel extracts of &lt;i&gt;M. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt; had the highest ABTS (0.03 mg/mL) and DPPH (0.03 mg/mL) activity. Ferric reducing power (FRAP) was the highest in the ethanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;M. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; flesh and peel, and &lt;i&gt;M. paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt; flesh, while it was the highest in the acetone extract of &lt;i&gt;M. paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt; at the peak concentration used (0.1 mg/mL). There was a significant negative correlation between the total phenol and flavonoid contents of &lt;i&gt;M. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; flesh with its DPPH radical scavenging activity and proanthocyanidin content of &lt;i&gt;M. paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt; flesh with its DPPH radical scavenging activity. The correlation outcomes indicate that none of the phytochemical constituents solely affected antioxidant activity; instead, a combination of the polyphenolic constituents contributed to antioxidant activity. This study shows the therapeutic potentials of the flesh and, importantly, the peel of &lt;i&gt;M. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. paradisiaca&lt;/i&gt; fruits on the basis of the polyphenolic constitution against free radicals and oxidative stress.">

        <span class="abst" title="Inflammation and pain are devastating conditions characterizing many diseases. Their manifestation ranges from mild body discomfort, to a debilitating experience, which may culminate in organ failure or death. In conventional medicine, corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, and adjuvants are utilized to manage symptoms related to pain and inflammation. Despite their reported successes, these agents are only palliative, debatably inaccessible, unaffordable, and cause many undesirable side effects. As a result, the search for alternative and complementary therapies is warranted. Medicinal plants have been intensively utilized by humans for a long time to treat various ailments. In spite of their reported efficacies, empirical scientific data supporting their healing claims is scanty. &lt;i&gt;P. thonningii&lt;/i&gt; (Schumach.) has been used in African traditional medicine, especially by traditional herbalists in Nigeria and Kenya, to treat conditions associated with inflammation. Even though analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and toxicity studies have been performed on leaf extracts, and some of their isolated compounds in Nigeria, there is scanty data supporting the use of stem bark extracts, which are commonly utilized in Kenya for pain, and inflammation management. Moreover, scientific data regarding safety and toxicity of the stem bark extracts of &lt;i&gt;P. thonningii&lt;/i&gt; utilized in Kenya by traditional herbalists are inadequate. Based on this background, acute oral toxicity evaluation of the aqueous and methanolic stem bark extracts of &lt;i&gt;P. thonningii&lt;/i&gt;, in Swiss albino mice, was performed according to the OECD/OCDE (2008) guidelines. Anti-inflammatory activities were investigated using the xylene-induced ear oedema in mice, whereas analgesic activities were examined following the acetic acid-induced writhing technique. The acute oral toxicity data was analyzed, and interpreted according to the OECDE (2008) guidelines. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities data were tabulated on MS Excel, and exported to GraphPad Prism (v8.3). Descriptive statistics were computed, and expressed as mean ± SEM. Thereafter, One-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test was performed. &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All the studied plant extracts had LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values &gt; 2000 mg/kg bw, and were hence deemed to be nontoxic according to OECD/OCDE document no. 425. The results showed that the acetic acid-induced writhing frequency in mice administered the aqueous stem bark extract of &lt;i&gt;P. thonningii&lt;/i&gt;, at a dose of 500 mg/kg bw, was not significantly different from that recorded for mice which received the reference drug (acetylsalicylic acid 75 mg) (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05). Additionally, at all the studied extract doses, significantly lower acetic acid-induced writhing frequencies were recorded in mice that received the aqueous stem bark extract of &lt;i&gt;P. thonningii&lt;/i&gt;, compared with the writhing frequencies in mice that received the methanolic extract of the same plant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). On the other hand, the aqueous stem bark extract of &lt;i&gt;P. thonningii,&lt;/i&gt; at doses of 100 mg/kg bw and 500 mg/kg bw, and the methanolic stem bark extract of the same plant, at a dose level of 500 mg/kg bw, exhibited significantly higher percentage inhibitions of xylene-induced oedema than the percentage inhibitions shown by the reference drug (dexamethasone 1 mg/kg bw) (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Generally, the aqueous stem bark extract of &lt;i&gt;P. thonningii&lt;/i&gt;, at all the studied dose levels, caused significantly higher inhibitions of xylene-induced ear oedema in mice, compared with the percentage inhibitions shown by methanolic stem bark (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Therefore, the aqueous, and methanolic stem bark extracts of &lt;i&gt;P. thonningii&lt;/i&gt;, grown in Kenya, possess peripheral analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities in Swiss albino mice. Hence, they have a potential of offering safe analgesic, and anti-inflammatory compounds. Further studies aimed at isolating, elucidating, and characterizing bioactive components from the studied extracts are recommended. Moreover, specific mode(s) through which these extracts exert the reported bioactivities should be established. Further toxicological investigations involving the studied plant extracts are encouraged to fully establish their safety.">

The NHE exhibited no antibacterial activity. The DME showed higher antibacterial activity than the NDME against the different isolates. At the highest concentration of 10 mg/mL in agar diffusion, NDME produced inhibition zones ranging from 11 to 29 mm against the microorganisms while DME produced inhibition zones ranging from 20 to 40 mm with the concentration of 10 mg/mL against the microorganisms. 0.1 mg/mL of the DME produced inhibition zones ranging between 12 and 14 mm in &lt;i&gt;Aeromonas hydrophila&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 35654 and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 15442, respectively, while none of the isolates were inhibited by the NDME at a concentration of 1 mg/mL or less. In the agar dilution assay, the MICs of the NDME and DME ranged between 0.31 and 10 mg/mL, but more isolates were inhibited at 0.31 mg/mL of DME than those in NDME. In macrobroth assay, the MICs of the NDME ranged between 0.15 and 5.0 mg/mL and the MBCs ranged between 0.63 and 5.0 mg/mL, and the MICs of the DME ranged between 0.08 and 5.0 mg/mL and the MBCs were between 0.31 and 5.0 mg/mL. This study indicated that DME was more active with higher antibacterial activity than the NDME of this plant, and extracting the fatty portion of plant materials prior susceptibility testing would allow plant extracts to be more effective as well as justifying the use of &lt;i&gt;Aframomum melegueta&lt;/i&gt; in traditional medicine for the treatment of bacterial infections.">

Paying attention to plant nutrition requirement is so important. In order to assess the effect of nitrate (NO3-) dosage supplies from two types of fertilizers on growth and phytochemical properties of Echinacea purpurea rhizomata cum radicibus, an experiment with completely simple design was carried out under greenhouse conditions. Two types of fertilizers (new invented nitrogen (N) slow release fertilizer and urea chemical fertilizer) at three dosages (50, 100, and 150 mM) were applied. Plant growth parameters and total phenolic (TPC), total flavonoids (TFC), polysaccarides content, essential oil content, caffeic acid derivatives, and anti-radical scavenging activities of E. purpurea were assessed. The results showed the significant (p ≤ 0.01) differences among treatments, both in growth and phytochemical properties. Using of N slow release, especially in 150 mM dosage, significantly increased all the plant growth and phytochemical properties. The dried E. purpurea rhizomata cum radicibus contained more caftaric acid (max 12.56 mg g-1 DW) and chicoric acid (max 7.56 mg g-1 DW) than other derivatives. Despite the impact of heavy metals on yield and growth of E. purpurea, the concentration of all heavy metals and micronutrients (boron (B), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn)) in studied soil and fertilizer samples was less than United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) limits of contamination. Based on the results, using of N slow release fertilizers can improve phytochemical properties of the plant due to its polymeric structure and can be a suitable substitution of chemical fertilizers, especially in medicinal plants growth.">

So far, relevant reports on the toxicity of Peganum harmala L. seeds (PHS) are hardly available. Especially, we still know little about the in vivo mechanism for PHS toxicity. This study aims to evaluate the toxicity effects of PHS in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), investigate the possible mechanism of the toxicity effects of PHS, and provide reference for the pharmacological research of PHS.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In the present study, the C. elegans was exposed to 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 mg/mL of PHS in nematode growth medium (NGM) at 22 °C in the presence of food. Lethality, lifespan, growth, reproduction, and locomotion behavior assays were performed to evaluate the toxicity effects of PHS in C. elegans. We then determined the mechanism of the toxicity effect of PHS by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity assay, and oxidative stress resistance assays. The main components of PHS were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Compared with the control group, the lethality of C. elegans was significantly increased when they were exposed to the ethanol extract of PHS at 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 mg/mL (P &lt; 0.01), and the mean lifespan was significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.01). We also observed that PHS exposure could induce the toxicity on body length, brood size, and locomotion behavior.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our study shows that the ethanol extract of PHS exerts obvious toxic effects on C. elegans, which would provide new ideas and methods for the biological evaluation of the toxicity of Chinese medicinal materials.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The Buyi (Bouyei) people in Qianxinan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Southwest Guizhou, China, have used medicinal plants and traditional remedies for ethnoveterinary practices, such as treating domestic animals during livestock breeding, since ancient times. However, the unique ethnoveterinary practices of the Buyi have rarely been recorded. This study aimed to identify the plants used in their traditional ethnoveterinary practices, and to propose suggestions for future conservation and sustainable use of this knowledge. METHODS:Ethnobotanical fieldwork was conducted in 19 villages/townships in Qianxinan Prefecture between 2017 and 2018. Data were collected from the local Buyi people through semi-structured interviews and participatory observations. The informant consensus factor (FIC) and use reports (URs) were utilized to evaluate the consent of the current ethnoveterinary practices among the local communities, and 83 informants were interviewed during the field investigations. Plant samples and voucher specimens were collected for taxonomic identification. RESULTS:A total of 122 plant species, belonging to 60 families and 114 genera, were recorded as being used in ethnoveterinary practices by the Buyi people. The most used ethnoveterinary medicinal plant (EMP) parts included the roots, whole plant, and bulb, and the most common preparation methods included decoction, crushing, and boiling. Some EMPs, such as Quisqualis indica and Paris polyphylla, have special preparation methods. The informant consensus factor (FIC) and use reports (URs) of the EMP species were analyzed. Twenty EMP species with the highest URs were noted as having particular importance in the daily lives of Buyi people in Qianxinan Prefecture. CONCLUSION:In this study, we identified traditional ethnoveterinary knowledge of the medicinal plants among the Buyi communities in Qianxinan Prefecture. This knowledge has previously been limited to local vets, herders, and aged community members. Plants with important medicinal uses need to be validated phytochemically and pharmacologically in the future, to develop new alternative drugs for veterinary purposes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and the most cause of dementia in elderly adults. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an important beneficial target for AD to control cholinergic signaling deficit. &lt;i&gt;Centella asiatica&lt;/i&gt; (CA) has proven to be rich with active ingredients for memory enhancement. In the present study, the chemical profiling of three accession extracts of CA namely SECA-K017, SECA-K018, and, SECA-K019 were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four biomarker triterpene compounds were detected in all CA accessions. Quantitative analysis reveals that madecassoside was the highest triterpene in all the CA accessions. The biomarker compounds and the ethanolic extracts of three accessions were investigated for their acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity using Ellman's spectrophotometer method. The inhibitory activity of the triterpenes and accession extracts was compared with the standard AChE inhibitor eserine. The results from the in vitro study showed that the triterpene compounds exhibited an AChE inhibitory activity with the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values between 15.05 ± 0.05 and 59.13 ± 0.18 µg/mL. Asiatic acid was found to possess strong AChE inhibitory activity followed by madecassic acid. Among the CA accession extracts, SECA-K017 and SECA-K018 demonstrated a moderate AChE inhibitory activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 481.5 ± 0.13 and 763.5 ± 0.16 µg/mL, respectively from the in silico docking studies, it is observed that asiatic acid and madecassic acid showed very good interactions with the active sites and fulfilled docking parameters against AChE. The present study suggested that asiatic acid and madecassic acid in the CA accessions could be responsible for the AChE inhibitory action and could be used as markers to guide further studies on CA as potential natural products for the treatment of AD.">

        <span class="abst" title="The COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a worldwide pandemic and caused huge damage to the lives and economy of more than hundred countries. As on May 10, 2020, more than 4,153,300 people stand infected from the virus due to an unprecedented rate of transmission and 282,700 have lost their lives because of the disease. In this context, medicinal plants may provide a way to treat the disease by targeting specific essential proteins of the virus. We screened about 51 medicinal plants and found that Tea (Camellia sinensis) and Haritaki (Terminalia chebula) has potential against SARS-COV-2 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; , with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for Green Tea as 8.9 ± 0.5 μg/ml and Haritaki 8.8 ± 0.5 μg/ml. The in-silico studies suggested that Tea component Thearubigins binds to the cysteine 145 of protease active site and could be a pharmacoactive molecule. We predict that the inhibition in protease activity may be able to halt the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle and therefore, we propose Green Tea, Black Tea, and Haritaki plant extracts as potential therapeutic candidates for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation on role of bioactive constituents of extracts is needed to establish the molecular basis of inhibition and towards expedited drug discovery.">

The targeted therapeutics of small molecules helps the scientific community to fight against SARS-CoV-2. In this article, some oxazine substituted 9-anilinoacridines (&lt;b&gt;A1-A48&lt;/b&gt;) was designed by docking, MM-GBSA and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies for their COVID-19 inhibitory activity. The docking of ligands &lt;b&gt;A1-A48&lt;/b&gt; against SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 5R82) are performed by using Glide module, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; ADMET screening by QikProp module, binding energy using Prime MM-GB/SA module, MD simulation by Desmond module and atomic charges were derived by Jaguar module of Schrodinger suit 2019-4. Compound &lt;b&gt;A38&lt;/b&gt; has the highest G-score (-7.83) when compared to all the standard compounds which are proposed for COVID-19 treatment such as ritonavir (-7.48), lopinavir (-6.94), nelfinavir (-5.93), hydroxychloroquine (-5.47) and mataquine (-5.37).

        <span class="abst" title="Yunnan is a multiethnic province in southwest China, rich in Materia medica resources, and is popularly known as the kingdom of plants. Biomedicine and public health industry have been the industrial pillars of Yunnan since 2016, which is the important pharmaceutical industrial base for Dai and Yi medicine in China. This review of the Yunnan ethnic medicine industry describes some of the problems to be solved in the development of sustainable ethnomedicine in China. We investigated Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) declared as ethnomedicine on the drug instructions and identified 28 Dai patent medicines (DPMs) and 73 Yi patent medicines (YPMs) that were approved for clinical use in China. In further research, the clinical indications of these CPMs were determined, and the quality standard of medicinal materials and their usage frequencies in DPMs and YPMs were investigated. We also collected and analyzed the data on use of botanical and animal sources of medicines, the rare and endangered medicinal materials, and toxic medicines in DPMs and YPMs. The application of zootherapy in Yi traditional medicine was introduced from its abundant ancient documents and records; based on the &quot;YaGei&quot; theory in Dai traditional medicine, toxic medicines can be relatively safe in DPMs. However, for promoting the Yunnan traditional medicine industry, it is necessary to strengthen medical research to expand evidence-based clinical practice and balance ethnomedicine production and sustainable utilization of Materia medica resources, especially the animal sources of medicines, toxic medicines, and the protected wild resources reported in this survey. Only in this way can industrialization of ethnomedicine promote the improvement of human health.">

Only a small proportion of them have been scientifically analyzed. Therefore the present investigation explores the biochemical and bioactive potential of different plant parts. Superoxide dismutase was detected maximum in Fagonia indica, (184.7±5.17 units/g), ascorbate peroxidase in Tribulus pentandrus (947.5±12.5 units/g), catalase and peroxidase were higher in Peganum harmala (555.0±5.0 and 2597.8±0.4 units/g, respectively). Maximum esterase and α-amylase activity was found in Zygophyllum fabago (14.3±0.44 and 140±18.8 mg/g, respectively). Flavonoid content was high in T. pentandrus (666.1±49 μg/ml). The highest total phenolic content and tannin was revealed in F. olivieri (72125±425 and 37050±1900 μM/g, respectively). The highest value of ascorbic acid was depicted in F. bruguieri (F.b.N) (448±1.5 μg/g). Total soluble proteins and reducing sugars were detected higher in P. harmala (372.3±54 and 5.9±0.1 mg/g, respectively). The maximum total antioxidant capacity was depicted in Tetraena simplex (16.9±0.01 μM/g). The highest value of lycopene and total carotenoids exhibited in T. terrestris (7.44±0.2 and 35.5±0.0 mg/g, respectively). Chlorophyll contents were found maximum in T. pentandrus var. pterophorus (549.1±9.9, 154.3±10, and 703.4±20.2 ug/g, respectively). All taxa exhibited anti-inflammatory activity and anti-diabetic potential. Z. eurypterum seeds exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory potential (96%), along with other taxa indicated (96-76%) activity when compared with the standard drug diclofenac sodium (79%). Seeds of T. pentandrus (85%) exhibited the highest anti-diabetic activity. The other taxa also exhibited inhibitory activity of α-amylase ranging from (85-69%) compared with Metformin (67%) standard drug. Phytochemical screening revealed that selected taxa proved to be the potential source of natural antioxidants and could further be explored for in-vivo studies and utilized in pharmaceutical industries as potent therapeutic agents validating their ethno-pharmacological uses.">

        <span class="abst" title="Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by a rapid loss of renal function. Drug-induced AKI accounts for up to 60% of all cases, resulting in a severe threat particularly to hospitalized patients, but there are no effective treatments. Four polyherbal formulas, &lt;i&gt;Bojungikki-tang&lt;/i&gt; (BJ), &lt;i&gt;Palmijihwang-tang&lt;/i&gt; (PJ), &lt;i&gt;Oryeong-san&lt;/i&gt; (OR), and &lt;i&gt;Wiryeong-tang&lt;/i&gt; (WR), have long been used for treatments of symptoms of kidney disease in traditional Korean medicine. Even though they are commercially available, evidences supporting the efficacy on AKI are still lacking. Therefore, the effectiveness of polyherbs on AKI and the underlying mechanisms were examined. Renal cell damage was induced by cisplatin at 20 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M and 16 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M in proximal tubular epithelial cell lines of rat NRK-52E and human HK-2, respectively. The cells were treated with the polyherbal formals for 3 days, and the cell viability, antioxidant activities, and apoptosis were examined. In addition, the proliferative effects were assessed under serum-free conditions. The results were compared with those of the vehicle-treated cells as a control. Three polyherbs BJ, PJ, and WR but not OR showed strong free radical scavenging activities in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The treatments of BJ, PJ, OR, and WR significantly increased the cell viabilities under cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Consistent with the results of the DPPH assay, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities were increased in the cisplatin-induced cell model treated with BJ, PJ, and WR but not with OR. However, annexin-V-positive cells and cleaved caspase 3 expression were significantly reduced in the cell model treated with all of the polyherbs. Cell proliferation was observed in treatment with all of the polyherbs, which was particularly evident in the OR-treated cells. This provides effective complementary evidences to promote the development of traditional herbal formulas to treat AKI.">

        <span class="abst" title="Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that affects one-third of the world's population. Although currently available TB drugs have many side effects, such as nausea, headache and gastrointestinal discomfort, no new anti-TB drugs have been produced in the past 30 years. Therefore, the discovery of a new anti-TB agent with minimal or no side effects is urgently needed. Many previous works have reported the effects of medicinal plants against &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (MTB). However, none have focused on medicinal plants from the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) region. This review highlights the effects of medicinal plants from the MENA region on TB. Medicinal plants from the MENA region have been successfully used as traditional medicine and first aid against TB related problems. A total of 184 plants species representing 73 families were studied. Amongst these species, 93 species contained more active compounds with strong anti-MTB activity (crude extracts and/or bioactive compounds with activities of 0-100 µg/ml). The extract of &lt;i&gt;Inula helenium, Khaya senegalensis, Premna odorata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt; presented the strongest anti-MTB activity. In addition, &lt;i&gt;Boswellia papyrifera&lt;/i&gt; (Del) Hochst olibanum, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&lt;/i&gt; Dehnh leaves (river red gum), &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; (black cumin) seeds and genus &lt;i&gt;Cymbopogon&lt;/i&gt; exhibited anti-TB activity. The most potent bioactive compounds included alantolactone, octyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, thymoquinone, piperitone, α- verbenol, citral b and α-pinene. These compounds affect the permeability of microbial plasma membranes, thus kill the mycobacterium spp. As a conclusion, plant species collected from the MENA region are potential sources of novel drugs against TB.">

Solvent methanol and aqueous were used for extraction of crudes by means of maceration. Susceptibility testing was determined by using disc diffusion method and Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by broth dilution method. Heat treated plant material activity against test pathogen was aimed to identify resistance capacity of plant material at different interval of time and temperature. All plant extracts under study was active against all tested pathogen after exposure to 45 °C for 30 min. The antibacterial activities of the non-heat-treated extracts of &lt;i&gt;Azadirachta indica&lt;/i&gt; were relatively low; the results of this study show that extracts of &lt;i&gt;Azadirachta indica&lt;/i&gt; have better residual antibacterial activities. Methanol extracts of all plant leaves showed highest activity as compared to the aqueous extracts. This is probably assigning the choice of extraction solvent for extracting desired active phytochemical from plants. Many of the people in the study area were illiterate and they did not have awareness about the ways use of medicinal plants. They use the medicinal plants by cooking and frying for different purposes. In the main, plant material can be affected as the temperature of treatment is increases with respect to various times of exposures.">

The purpose of the current work was to investigate the physico-chemical and antimicrobial qualities of some mono-floral honeys from Ethiopia against some human pathogen bacteria and fungi. In the study, seven different botanical origin honeys were used of which some were from plants known for their medicinal properties. The samples were tested for their major physico-chemical properties (sugar profiles, total free acids, pH, color, electric conductivity and total soluble substances) and their medicinal values as total antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content and antimicrobial properties as minimum inhibitory concentration against some human pathogens, following standard protocols. Generally, the average values of the physico-chemical properties of the samples were within the acceptable ranges of world honey quality values. The average total antioxidant value of the samples was 320.3 ± 15.1 with range of 225.4 ± 12.8-465.7 ± 21.8 μM Fe(II)/100g. Relatively higher values 421.5 ± 23.4 and 465.7 ± 21.8μM Fe(II)/100g recorded for Croton macrostachyus and Vernonia amygalina honeys respectively. The average phenolic contents of the samples varied from 233.3 ± 24.0 to 693.3 ± 26.8 mgGAE/kg and relatively higher values recorded for C. macrostachys and V. amygdalina honeys. The significant proportion of the tested samples showed strong antimicrobial qualities inhibiting the growth of tested pathogens at concentration of 10.5%-28.6% of MIC (% v/v). Honeys from medicinal plants (C. macrostachys and V. amygdalina) relatively showed more antimicrobial properties which could be due to the presence of plant specific phytochemicals which require further investigations.">

However, APAP overdose is a major cause of acute liver injury. &lt;i&gt;Gamisoyo-san&lt;/i&gt; (GMSYS; &lt;i&gt;Jiaweixiaoyao-san&lt;/i&gt; in Chinese, &lt;i&gt;Kamishoyo-san&lt;/i&gt; in Japanese), a traditional herbal formula, is used to treat phlegm and cough in Korea. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of GMSYS against APAP-induced liver injury &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We evaluated the effect of GMSYS on APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by measuring cell viability in murine BNL CL.2 liver cells. Additionally, BALB/c mice were orally administered with GMSYS once daily for 7 days. Eighteen hours after the last administration, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 200 mg/kg APAP. Plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, hepatic antioxidants, and histological changes were examined.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Pretreatment with GMSYS attenuated the decrease in cell viability induced by APAP in BNL CL.2 cells. In mice, pre-administration with GMSYS alleviated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing plasma ALT and AST activities and hepatic malondialdehyde, and by increasing the total glutathione (GSH)/reduced GSH ratio and the activities of several antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, GSH peroxidase, GSH reductase, GSH-S-transferase, and heme oxygenase-1.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;GMSYS has a protective effect against APAP-induced acute liver injury by decreasing plasma transaminases and increasing antioxidants. GMSYS may be an effective candidate for the prevention of acute liver injury.">

Prior studies indicated that polyphenols-rich extracts as effective redox mediators (RMs) could exhibit significant electrochemical activities to enhance power generation in MFCs. However, the supplementation of &lt;i&gt;Camellia&lt;/i&gt; GT extract obtained at room temperature with significant redox capabilities into MFCs unexpectedly exhibited obvious inhibitory effect towards power generation. This systematic study indicated that the presence of antimicrobial components (especially catechins) in GT extract might significantly alter the distribution of microbial community, in particular a decrease of microbial diversity and evenness. For practical applications to different microbial systems, pre-screening criteria of selecting biocompatible RMs should not only consider their promising redox capabilities (abiotic), but also possible inhibitory potency (biotic) to receptor microbes. Although &lt;i&gt;Camellia&lt;/i&gt; tea extract was well-characterized as GRAS energy drink, some contents (e.g., catechins) may still express inhibition towards organisms and further assessment upon biotoxicity may be inevitably required for practice.">

        <span class="abst" title="With regard to regenerative medicine, the expectations generated over the last two decades and the time involved in developing this type of therapies, together with the availability of devices that allow point-of-care treatments through the rapid isolation of cellular or plasma products from patients in the operating theater, represent the perfect breeding ground for the offering of unproven or unregulated therapies on a global scale. A multidisciplinary approach-one based on the collaboration of institutions that, from the perspective of their area of competence, can contribute to reversing this worrying situation-to this problem is essential. It is a priority for local health authorities to take measures that are adapted to the particular situation and regulatory framework of their respective territory. In this article, the authors present the regenerative medicine action plan promoted by the Andalusian Transplant Coordination (i.e., the action plan for the largest region in Spain), highlighting the aspects the authors believe are fundamental to its success. The authors describe, in summary form, the methodology, phases of the plan, actions designed, key collaborators, important milestones achieved and main lessons they have drawn from their experience so that this can serve as an example for other institutions interested in promoting the ethical use of this type of therapy.">

        <span class="abst" title="Our health and wealth are highly influenced by a number of viruses. Dengue is one of them having a global influence in absence of vaccines and antiviral. WHO suggested that the morbidity of dengue is increasing more than 6 times from 0.5 million in 2010 to over 3.34 million in 2016, following a sharp increase in 2019. The aim of the present study is to check the in vitro and in silico anti-dengue activity of &lt;i&gt;Cyamopsis tetragonoloba&lt;/i&gt; supercritical extract in cell lines. The optimum yield of supercritical extract was obtained 0.13 g/10 g (1.3% w/w) at 40 °C temp and 15 MPa pressure and further characterized by GC-MS. The antiviral assay was performed on C6/36 cell lines with 100 copies of dengue-2 virus and maximum non-toxic dose (31.25 µg/ml) of supercritical extract and their effect was detected by real-time RT-PCR. This study revealed that &lt;i&gt;C. tetragonoloba&lt;/i&gt; supercritical extract inhibited the dengue-2 virus (99.9%). GC-MS analysis of &lt;i&gt;C. tetragonoloba&lt;/i&gt; supercritical extract showed the presence of 10 compounds. The major compounds identified were Hexadecanoic acid, 15-methyl-methyl ester (24.498%); 9,12-octadecadienoyl chloride, (&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;)- (23.718%); methyl dodecanoic acid (13.228%); methyl-stearate (8.696%); Tridecanoic acid, 12-methyl-, methyl-ester (8.426%), dodecanoic acid (6.102%). The study reveals that &lt;i&gt;C. tetragonoloba&lt;/i&gt; can be exploited to develop an effective, inexpensive, and specific anti-dengue. The molecular docking study demonstrated the binding energy of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-methylpropyl) ester (- 4.1 kcal/mol), 9,12-octadecadienoyl chloride (&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;) (- 4.0 kcal/mol) ligands were higher than others. It is concluded that &lt;i&gt;C. tetragonoloba&lt;/i&gt; can play a major role to inhibit dengue-2 virus.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Ethnopharmacological relevance&lt;/h4&gt;Due to the outbreaks such as SARS, bird flu and swine flu, which we frequently encounter in our century, we need fast solutions with no side effects today more than ever. Due to having vast ethnomedical experience and the richest flora (34% endemic) of Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has a high potential for research on this topic. Plants that locals have been using for centuries for the prevention and treatment of influenza can offer effective alternatives to combat this problem. In this context, 224 herbal taxa belonging to 45 families were identified among the selected 81 studies conducted in the seven regions of Turkey. However, only 35 (15.6%) of them were found to be subjected to worldwide in vitro and in vivo research conducted on anti-influenza activity. Quercetin and chlorogenic acid, the effectiveness of which has been proven many times in this context, have been recorded as the most common (7.1%) active ingredients among the other 56 active substances identified.&lt;h4&gt;Aim of the study&lt;/h4&gt;This study has been carried out to reveal the inventory of plant species that have been used in flu treatment for centuries in Turkish folk medicine, which could be used in the treatment of flu or flu-like pandemics, such as COVID 19, that humanity has been suffering with, and also compare them with experimental studies in the literature.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The investigation was conducted in two stages on the subject above by using electronic databases, such as Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Medline, Cochrane Library, EBSCO, HighWire Press, PubMed and Google Scholar. The results of both scans are presented in separate tables, together with their regional comparative analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Data obtained on taxa are presented in a table, including anti-influenza mechanism of actions and the active substances. Rosa canina (58.7%) and Mentha x piperita (22.2%) were identified as the most common plants used in Turkey. Also, Sambucus nigra (11.6%), Olea europaea (9.3%), Eucalyptus spp., Melissa officinalis, and Origanum vulgare (7.0%) emerged as the most investigated taxa.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This is the first nationwide ethnomedical screening work conducted on flu treatment with plants in Turkey. Thirty-nine plants have been confirmed in the recent experimental anti-influenza research, which strongly shows that these plants are a rich pharmacological source. Also, with 189 (84.4%) taxa, detections that have not been investigated yet, they are an essential resource for both national and international pharmacological researchers in terms of new natural medicine searches. Considering that the production of antimalarial drugs and their successful use against COVID-19 has begun, this correlation was actually a positive and remarkable piece of data, since there are 15 plants, including Centaurea drabifolia subsp. Phlocosa (an endemic taxon), that were found to be used in the treatment of both flu and malaria.">

The ACSS questionnaire was used to assess severity and course of symptoms.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; analysis included 325 patients treated with BNO 1045 and 332 patients treated with FT (total of 657 patients). The mean sum-scores of the ACSS-typical domain were comparable between groups on day 1 (BNO 1045: 10.2; FT: 10.1), and then decreased on day 4 (BNO 1045: 5.1; FT: 4.5), at end of treatment on day 8 (BNO 1045: 2.1; FT: 2.1), and at late follow-up on day 38 (BNO 1045: 0.8; FT: 0.9). Predefined thresholds using the scoring system of the ACSS could be established and validated to define &quot;clinical cure.&quot;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Evaluating not only antibacterial but also nonantibacterial agents indicated for the treatment of AC in women, clinical criteria for diagnostics, and measures of patient-reported outcomes are more important as main objectives than microbiological criteria. In this &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; evaluation, we showed that the ACSS questionnaire, validated in several languages, has the potential to be used as a suitable instrument for diagnostics and patient-reported outcomes in well-designed, international, clinical studies investigating different treatment modalities of uncomplicated urinary tract infections.">

Therefore, in this study, the endophytic diversity of &lt;i&gt;Angelica&lt;/i&gt; seeds was studied and compared with endophytes isolated from healthy leaves, stems, roots, and seeds of &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;sinensis&lt;/i&gt; using 20 different media. The metabolites of endophytic strains were evaluated with six different methods for their antioxidant activity and the paper disc diffusion method for antimicrobial activities. As a result, 226 endophytes were isolated. Compared with the biodiversity and abundance of uncultured fungi from &lt;i&gt;Angelica&lt;/i&gt; seed, the result showed that the most frequent endophytic fungi were &lt;i&gt;Alternaria&lt;/i&gt; sp. as seen in artificial media; moreover, compared with artificial media, the pathogenic fungi, including &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; sp. and &lt;i&gt;Pseudallescheria&lt;/i&gt; sp., were not found from the &lt;i&gt;Angelica&lt;/i&gt; seed, the results suggested it may not be inherent endophytes in plants. In addition, bacteria from seven phyla were identified by high-throughput sequencing, while five phyla of endophytic bacteria were not isolated on artificial media including &lt;i&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Microgenomates&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Saccharibacteria&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, the sample JH-4 mycelium displayed the best antioxidant activity, and the active constituent may be a flavonoid as determined by total phenol and flavonoid content. Moreover, YH-12-1 mycelium had strong inhibitory activity against the five tested strains and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; was found to be 25 μg/mL. Our results confirm that plant endophytes are rich in biodiversity and contain important resource of many uncultured microorganisms.">

This study aimed to illustrate the inhibitory activities of tricin in colon cancer cells and in a metastatic CRC mouse model. BALB/c mice injected with mouse Colon26-Luc cells into the rectum wall were treated with tricin (37.5 mg/kg) daily for 18 days. Orthotopic colon tumor growth and metastasis to lungs were assessed by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Results showed that tricin suppressed Colon-Luc cells motility and downregulated phosphorylated Akt, Erk1/2 and NF-κB expressions of human colon cancer HT-29 cells. While tricin treatment suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis as well as altered the populations of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells in spleens. In summary, the tumor microenvironment modulatory and anti-metastatic effects of tricin in colon cancer mouse model were shown for the first time, suggesting the potential development of tricin-containing food supplements for CRC patients.">

Due to its high pharmacological properties, the species has been overexploited to meet the demands of the pharmaceutical industry. The present study was conducted to establish a suitable in vitro culture procedure for the mass propagation of &lt;i&gt;C. nutans.&lt;/i&gt; Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium, supplemented with different types of cytokinins, auxins, basal medium strength and sucrose concentrations, were tested. Based on the results, a full-strength MS basal medium supplemented with 12 µM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 30 g/L sucrose was recorded as the best outcome for all the parameters measured including the regeneration percentage, number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves. In the analysis of the phenolics content and antioxidant activities, tissue-cultured leaf extracts assayed at 100 °C exhibited the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activities. The propagation of &lt;i&gt;C. nutans&lt;/i&gt; via a plant tissue culture technique was recorded to be able to produce high phenolic contents as well as exhibit high antioxidant activities.">

The goal was to collect, interpret, and evaluate data on the application of medicinal plants. Along with comprehensive notes on individual plants species, we calculated Use Value (UV), Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC), Use Report (UR), Fidelity Level (FL), Informant Consensus Factor (FCI), as well as Family Importance Value (FIV). During the current study, a total of 109 species belonging to 64 families were reported to be used in the treatment of various ailments. It included three families (four species) of Pteridophytes, 58 families (99 species) of angiosperm, one family (three species) of Gymnosperms, and two families (three species) of fungi. The article highlights the significance of domestic consumption of plant resources to treat human ailments. The UV varied from 0.2 (Acorus calamus L.) to 0.89 (Acacia modesta Wall.). The RFC ranged from 0.059 (Acorus calamus L. and Convolvulus arvensis L.) to 0.285 (Acacia modesta Wall.). The species with 100% FL were Acacia modesta Wall. and the fungus Morchella esculenta Fr., while the FCI was documented from 0 to 0.45 for gastro-intestinal disorders. The conservation ranks of the medicinal plant species revealed that 28 plant species were vulnerable, followed by rare (25 spp.), infrequent (17 spp.), dominant (16 spp.), and 10 species endangered. The traditional use of plants needs conservation strategies and further investigation for better utilization of natural resources.">

In this sense, the present paper was aimed to explore the biological properties and chemical profiles of different parts (aerial parts, leaves, flowers, stems, and roots) of &lt;i&gt;A. macrocephalus&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;finitimus&lt;/i&gt;. Antioxidant (radical quenching, reducing power, and metal chelating) and enzyme inhibitory (α-amylase and tyrosinase) effects were investigated for biological properties. Regarding chemical profiles, individual phenolic compounds were detected by LC-MS, as well as total amounts. The leaves extract exhibited the strongest antioxidant abilities when compared with other parts. However, flowers extract had the best metal chelating ability. Hyperoside, apigenin, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids were identified as main compounds in the tested parts. Regarding enzyme inhibitory properties, tyrosinase inhibitory effects varied from IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 1.02 to 1.41 mg/mL. In addition, the best amylase inhibition effect was observed by leaves (3.36 mg/mL), followed by aerial parts, roots, stems, and flowers. As a result, from multivariate analysis, the tested parts were classified in three cluster. Summing up the results, it can be concluded that &lt;i&gt;A. macrocephalus&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;finitimus&lt;/i&gt; could be a precious source of natural bioactive agents in pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmeceutical applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Terminalia sericea&lt;/i&gt; Burch. ex. DC. (Combretaceae) is a popular remedy for the treatment of infectious diseases. It is widely prescribed by traditional healers and sold at informal markets and may be a good candidate for commercialisation. For this to be realised, a thorough phytochemical and bioactivity profile is required to identify constituents that may be associated with the antibacterial activity and hence the quality of raw materials and consumer products. The aim of this study was to explore the phytochemistry and identify the antibacterial constituents of &lt;i&gt;T. sericea&lt;/i&gt; root bark, using a metabolomic approach. The chemical profiles and antibacterial activities of 42 root bark samples collected from three districts in the Limpopo Province, South Africa, were evaluated. Dichloromethane:methanol (1:1) extracts were analysed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-mass spectrometry (MS), and chemometric models were constructed from the aligned data. The extracts were tested against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 11778), &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus epidermidis&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 12223), &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 25923), &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 8739), &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 13883), &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 27853), &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 9292) and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 14028), using the minimum inhibition microdilution assay. Nine compounds; sericic acid, sericoside, resveratrol-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-rutinoside, ellagic acid, flavogallonic acid dilactone, methyl-flavogallonate, quercetin-3-(2''-galloylrhamnoside), resveratrol-3-(6''-galloyl)-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-d-glucopyranoside and arjunetin, were isolated from the root bark. All the compounds, with the exception of sericic acid, sericoside and resveratrol-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-rutinoside, were isolated for the first time from the root bark of &lt;i&gt;T. sericea.&lt;/i&gt; Chemometric analysis revealed clustering that was not population specific, and the presence of three groupings within the samples, characterised by sericic acid, sericoside and an unidentified compound (&lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; 682/4.66 min), respectively. The crude extracts from different populations displayed varied antibacterial activities against &lt;i&gt;S. typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; (minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 0.25-1.0 mg/mL), but similar activity towards &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; (1.0 mg/mL). Several compounds present in the root bark were highly active towards all or most of the pathogens tested, but this activity was not reflected by the chemical profiles of extracts prepared from the individual samples. Among the pure compounds tested, only flavogallonic acid dilactone and methyl-flavogallonate exhibited broad-spectrum activity. A biochemometric analysis indicated that there was no consistent association between the levels of phytochemicals and the activity of the active or non-active extracts. Although it was deduced that the major constituents of &lt;i&gt;T. sericea&lt;/i&gt; root bark contributed to the chemotypic variation, further investigation of the interactions of compounds present in the root bark may provide antibacterial efficacies not evident when examining compounds singularly. The data reported herein will provide information that is fundamentally important for the development of quality control protocols.">

As part of a bioprospecting program aimed at the discovery of new bioactive compounds from Korean medicinal plants, a phytochemical study of &lt;i&gt;S. hexaphylla&lt;/i&gt; leaves was carried out leading to isolation of two oleanane-type triterpene saponins, 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-d-glucopyranosyl (1→2)-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-l-arabinopyranosyl] oleanolic acid-28-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-d-glucopyranosyl (1→6)-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-d-glucopyranosyl] ester (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) and 3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-l-arabinopyranosyl oleanolic acid-28-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-[&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-d-glucopyranosyl (1→6)-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-d-glucopyranosyl] ester (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;). Their structures were established unambiguously by spectroscopic methods such as one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopies, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and chemical reactions. Their anti-inflammatory activities were examined for the first time with an animal model for the macrophage-mediated inflammatory response as well as a cell-based assay using an established macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) in vitro. Together, it was concluded that the saponin constituents, when they were orally administered, exerted much more potent activities in vivo than their sapogenin core even though both the saponins and the sapogenin molecule inhibited the RAW 264.7 cell activation comparably well in vitro. These results imply that saponins from &lt;i&gt;S. hexaphylla&lt;/i&gt; leaves have a definite advantage in the development of oral medications for the control of inflammatory responses.">

The intracellular polysaccharide yield of &lt;i&gt;S. sanghuang&lt;/i&gt; was enhanced by the strain A130 which was screened from mutant strains via atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of ARTP mutagenesis on structural characteristics and biological activities of intracellular polysaccharides from &lt;i&gt;S. sanghuang&lt;/i&gt;. Six intracellular polysaccharide components were obtained from &lt;i&gt;S. sanghuang&lt;/i&gt; mycelia cultivated by the mutagenic strain (A130) and original strain (SH1), respectively. The results revealed that the yields of polysaccharide fractions A130-20, A130-50 and A130-70 isolated from the mutagenic strain fermentation mycelia were significantly higher than those of the original ones by 1.5-, 1.3- and 1.2-fold, and the clear physicochemical differences were found in polysaccharide fractions precipitated by 20% ethanol. A130-20 showed a relatively expanded branching chain with higher molecular weight and better in vitro macrophage activation activities and the IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α production activities of macrophages were improved by stimulation of A130-20 from the mutagenic strain. This study demonstrates that ARTP is a novel and powerful tool to breed a high polysaccharide yield strain of &lt;i&gt;S. sanghuang&lt;/i&gt; and may, therefore, contribute to the large-scale utilization of rare medicinal fungi.">

        <span class="abst" title="Mushroom irradiation has been considered a sustainable process to generate high amounts of vitamin D2 due to the role of this vitamin for human health and of the global concerns regarding its deficient or inadequate intake. Mushrooms are also receiving increasing interest due to their nutritional and medicinal properties. However, there is still a knowledge gap regarding the effect of UV irradiation on mushroom bioactive compounds. In this study, two of the most cultivated mushroom species worldwide, Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus ostreatus, were irradiated with UV-B, and the effect of processing was investigated on the contents of vitamin D2 as well as on antioxidant and antiglycation activities. UV irradiation increased vitamin D2 up to 57 µg/g d.w, which is an adequate level for the fortification of a number of target foods. UV irradiation decreased the antioxidant activity when measured by the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6 trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl radical assay and the ferric ion-reducing antioxidant power assay, but did not decrease the mushroom's ability to inhibit glycation of a target protein. These results open up a new area of investigation aimed at selecting mushroom species with high nutraceutical benefits for irradiation in order to maintain their potential properties to inhibit oxidative and glycation processes responsible for human diseases.">

Anti-inflammatory drugs can interfere in the pathophysiological process of inflammation, to minimize tissue damage and provide greater comfort to the patient. Therefore, it is important to note that due to the existence of a large number of species available for research, the successful development of new naturally occurring anti-inflammatory drugs depends mainly on a multidisciplinary effort to find new molecules. Although many review articles have been published in this regard, the majority presented the subject from a limited regional perspective. Thus, the current article presents highlights from the published literature on plants as sources of anti-inflammatory agents.">

Nevertheless, only limited papers report specifically on the phytochemistry of this genus. Furthermore, the potential of utilising extracts from Echium species as natural antioxidant preparations has been significantly neglected. For the first time, this review comprehensively describes and discusses the presence of recorded Echium species with ethnomedicinal uses, their antioxidative properties in vitro and in vivo when available, and major phytochemical components recognised as potent antioxidants, as well as the possibilities and opportunities for future research.">

The negative control groups were administered with cyclophosphamide alone (200 mg/kg, i.p.). The crude extracts were administered at three dose levels (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg), while aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions were given at two dose levels (100 and 200 mg/kg). Excepting the normal control, all groups were subjected to cyclophosphamide toxicity on the first day.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Treatment with crude extract 100 mg/kg and ethyl acetate fraction significantly decreased kidney-to-body weight ratio (P &lt; 0.001). In addition, treatment with &lt;i&gt;Croton macrostachyus&lt;/i&gt; crude extract and solvent fractions significantly decreased serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level (P &lt; 0.001). Treatment with 100 and 200 mg/kg of ethyl acetate fraction significantly decreased serum creatinine level. Histopathological results confirmed the protective effect of the crude extract and solvent fractions of &lt;i&gt;Croton macrostachyus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Croton macrostachyus possesses nephroprotective activities and it could be a possible source of treatment for cyclophosphamide-induced nephrotoxicity.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The alarming spread of parasite resistance to current antimalarial agents is threatening malaria controlling efforts. This, consequently, urged the scientific community to discover novel antimalarial drugs. Successful and most potent antimalarial drugs were obtained from medicinal plants. &lt;i&gt;Capsicum frutescens&lt;/i&gt; is claimed to possess an antiplasmodial activity in Ethiopian and Ugandan folkloric medicine. However, there is a lack of pharmacological evidence for its antiplasmodial activity. This study, hence, was aimed at evaluating the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activity of &lt;i&gt;C. frutescens&lt;/i&gt; in a mouse model.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The dried fruits of the plant were extracted with 80% methanol using cold maceration. A 4-day suppressive test was employed to ascertain the claimed antiplasmodial effect of the plant. Following inoculation with &lt;i&gt;P. berghei&lt;/i&gt;, mice in treatment groups were provided with three dose levels (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) of the extract, while 2% Tween 80 and chloroquine served as the negative and positive controls, respectively. Weight, temperature, packed cell volume, parasitemia, and survival time were then monitored.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The acute oral toxicity study revealed that the crude extract caused no mortality and revealed no overt sign of toxicity. In the 4-day suppressive test, all dose levels of the extract were found to exhibit a significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) inhibition of parasitemia compared to those of the negative control. Maximum parasite suppression (93.28%) was exerted by the highest dose (400 mg/kg/day) of extract. Also, the extract significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) prolonged survival time and prevented body weight loss and reduction in temperature and anemia compared to the vehicle-treated group.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This investigation found strong evidence that the fruit extract of &lt;i&gt;C. frutescens&lt;/i&gt; is endowed with promising antiplasmodial activity. Hence, the plant could serve as a potential source of a newer antimalarial agent.">

However, there has been no scientific evidences about its wound healing activity. This study is aimed at evaluating the wound healing activity of &lt;i&gt;Crassocephalum crepidioides&lt;/i&gt; hydroethanolic extract via its antioxidant and anti-inflammation activities and healing capability on a mouse excision wound model. &lt;i&gt;Crassocephalum crepidioides&lt;/i&gt; hydroethanolic extract (CCLE) at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day reduced the wound closure time about 3.5 days, compared to vehicle treatment. The granulation tissue on day 7 after surgery from the treated group showed a 2.8-fold decrease in the density of inflammatory cells, 1.9-fold increase in the fibroblast density, and a higher number of blood vessels. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the mRNA expression level of NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B1 and TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in CCLE-treated wounds decreased by 4.6 and 3.3 times, respectively, while TGF-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;1 and VEGF were found to increase by 3.3 and 2.4 times, respectively. Our experimental data provided proofs of &lt;i&gt;Crassocephalum crepidioides&lt;/i&gt; leaf wound healing activity due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, wound contraction, and angiogenesis effects.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Poor access to healthcare in rural communities causes many people to seek herbalists who use medicinal plants for the treatment of various disease conditions. Most knowledge of traditional herbal medicine makes use of indigenous remedies which are often undocumented and are at risk of being lost. The preservation of this knowledge may facilitate scientific inquiry into promising new therapeutic molecules.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect the sociodemographic information of 30 herbalists in Kisumu East Sub County. The local names of medicinal plants used in managing illnesses of the respiratory system, their habit, active parts, indications, methods of preparation, routes of administration, scientific identity, and conservation status were also recorded. Other reported traditional uses, pharmacological activities, and toxicological data were identified via a literature search.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Most herbalists were female (86.7%), aged between 61 and 70 years (43.3%) with no formal education (56.7%), and had 21-30 years of practice (30%). 44 plant species, belonging to 43 genera and 28 families were identified. Leguminosae and Rutaceae plant families were predominant, leaves were frequently used (33%), and trees were the most common habit (44.4%). Most plants were collected in the wild (79.2%), preparation was mainly by decoction (68.8%), and the administration was mainly orally. The main indication was cough and 79.5% of all documented plant species had previously been reported to have a pharmacological activity relevant to the mitigation of respiratory illnesses. Toxicological data was available for 84.1% of the plant species identified.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The predominant use of roots, root barks, and root tubers by herbalists in Kisumu East Sub County threatens to negatively impact the ecological survival of some plant species. The preservation of herbalists' knowledge of medicinal plants in the study area is a pressing concern considering their advanced age and little formal education. There is a need to conserve some of the medicinal plants documented in this study. The medicinal claims made by herbalists also warrant scientific scrutiny.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Gynostemma pentaphyllum&lt;/i&gt; (the immortal herb) has been an important component of Chinese Traditional Medicine for millennia. Recent clinical studies have revealed that the plant exhibits numerous beneficial biological activities, making it of interest to the pharmaceutical industry. An extract of the herb contains over 200 individual secondary metabolites including flavonol glycosides and dammarane saponins. To focus attention on the compounds most likely to be responsible for the biological activities, this study predicts the potential oral bioavailability of nine dammarane saponins and five flavonol glycosides from &lt;i&gt;G. pentaphyllum&lt;/i&gt; using the Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability model. Two flavonoids, &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;, and four saponins, &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;, exhibited high permeability across the monolayers. The results indicated that a higher degree of glycosylation-facilitated permeability, suggestive of active transport. This study demonstrates the utility of the Caco-2 permeability assay as a method of identifying possible bioavailable compounds from medicinal herbal extracts.">

        <span class="abst" title="Human health in the current medical era is facing numerous challenges, especially cancer. So, the therapeutic arsenal for cancer should be unremittingly enriched with novel small molecules that selectively target tumour cells with minimal toxicity towards normal cells. In this context, herein a new series of 3,6-disubstituted pyridazines &lt;b&gt;11a-r&lt;/b&gt; has been synthesised and evaluated for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; anticancer activity. They possessed good anti-proliferative action towards human breast cancer T-47D (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; range: 0.43 ± 0.01 - 35.9 ± 1.18 µM) and MDA-MB-231 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; range: 0.99 ± 0.03 - 34.59 ± 1.13 µM) cell lines, whereas they displayed weak activity against the tested ovarian cancer cell line SKOV-3. Among the studied compounds, the methyltetrahydropyran-bearing pyridazine &lt;b&gt;11m&lt;/b&gt; emerged as the unique submicromolar growth inhibitor herein reported towards both T-47D (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.43 ± 0.01 µM) and MDA-MB-231 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.99 ± 0.03 µM) cell lines. In addition, the biological results indicated that pyridazines &lt;b&gt;11l&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;11m&lt;/b&gt; exerted an efficient alteration within the cell cycle progression as well as induction of apoptosis in both T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, pyridazines &lt;b&gt;11l&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;11m&lt;/b&gt; displayed good mean tumour S. I. values of 13.7 and 16.1 upon assessment of their cytotoxicity towards non-tumorigenic breast MCF-10A cells. Furthermore, an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; study proposed CDK2 as a probable enzymatic target for pyridazines &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;, and explored their binding interactions within the vicinity of CDK2 binding site. Subsequently, pyridazines &lt;b&gt;11e&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;11h&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;11l&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;11m&lt;/b&gt; were selected to be evaluated for their ability to inhibit CDK2, where they exerted good inhibitory activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 151, 43.8, 55.6 and 20.1 nM, respectively). Finally, the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; study implied that target pyridazines &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt; exhibited not only an efficient anticancer activity but also an acceptable ADME, physicochemical and druglikeness properties, specifically pyridazines &lt;b&gt;11l&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;11m&lt;/b&gt;. Overall the obtained results from this study quite sustained our strategy and gave us a robust opportunity for further development and optimisation of 3,6-disubstituted pyridazine scaffold to enrich therapeutic arsenal with efficient and safe anticancer CDK inhibitors.">

Compound &lt;b&gt;12a&lt;/b&gt; with a free amino group at the 2-position, carboxylic acid moiety at the 4-position, and a phenyl ring at the 5-position of the scaffold was found to be the most potent CA-III inhibitor (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/i&gt; = 0.5 μM). The presence of a carboxylic acid group at the 4-position of the scaffold was found to be crucial for the CA-III inhibitory activity. Furthermore, replacement of the free amino group with an amide and urea group resulted in a significant reduction of activity (compounds &lt;b&gt;13c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;14c&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 174.1 and 186.2 μM, respectively). Thus, compound &lt;b&gt;12a&lt;/b&gt; (2-amino-5-phenylthiazole-4-carboxylic acid) can be considered as the lead molecule for further modification and development of more potent CA-III inhibitors.">

        <span class="abst" title="CONTEXT:Salvia semiatrata Zucc. (Lamiaceae) is a species used as a tranquilizer and to relieve pain in folk medicine in Santiago Huauclilla, Oaxaca, Mexico. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the antinociceptive and anxiolytic-like effects of S. semiatrata extracts and identify a bioactive metabolite. MATERIALS AND METHODS:The extracts were obtained by maceration of S. semiatrata aerial parts using solvents in increasing polarity (hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol). A neo-clerodane diterpene was extracted from the ethyl acetate fraction using open column chromatography. Identification of this metabolite was performed by crystallography, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, ATR-IR, ECD, MS and elemental analysis. The antinociceptive activity was explored using the writhing and formalin tests. Whereas, the anxiolytic-like responses were analysed in the open-field, hole-board and plus-maze tests. All the treatments were administered using oral gavage in male CD1 mice and explored 30 min after administration of the individual extracts (300 mg/kg) or the compound 1 (0.1, 1 or 10 mg/kg). RESULTS:All the extracts produced significant reduction in the nociceptive and anxiety-like behaviour compared to mice treated with the vehicle (0.5% tween 80 in saline solution). The spectroscopic analysis corroborated the presence of the neo-clerodane diterpene 7-keto-neoclerodan-3,13-dien-18,19:15,16-diolide (1), as partial responsible of the antinociceptive and anxiolytic-like effects, which produced a dose-dependent response in the writhing test with an ED50=4.15 mg/kg. Discussion and conclusions: These results reinforce the medicinal properties of S. semiatrata in folk medicine, where participation of a neo-clerodane diterpene was evidenced in the inhibitory central nervous system activity of this species.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cancer is a debilitating disease that is on the increase in both developed and developing countries. Anticancer drugs are often expensive, have narrow spectrum of activities, and are associated with toxicities and side effects such as myelosuppression, immunosuppression, gastrointestinal disturbance, alopecia, skin toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. Plants have been the major source of anticancer drugs both in orthodox and traditional medicine. Many of the plants claimed by the traditional medicine practitioners (TMPs) to be effective in the treatment of cancer are yet to be evaluated scientifically. In this work, five medicinal plants used by TMPs in Borno State, Nigeria, were tested against two brain tumor cell lines. Ethanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;Securidaca longepedunculata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Andira inermis&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;rooseveltii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Annona senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carissa edulis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Parinari polyandra&lt;/i&gt; were used. U87 and U231 brain tumor cell lines were used for proliferation assay, U251 cell line was used for the invasion assay in collagen V coated inserts, and U87 cell line was used for the western blot detection of cleaved Poly-ADP-Ribose-Polymerase (PARP). The result revealed that all tested extracts significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) inhibited the proliferation of U87 and U231 cell lines with the respective IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging between 8 and 20 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml for &lt;i&gt;S. longepedunculata&lt;/i&gt; and 100 and 90 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml for &lt;i&gt;P. polyandra&lt;/i&gt;. The five extracts significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) inhibited the invasion of U251 cell line at the concentration of 10 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml (&lt;i&gt;S. longepedunculata&lt;/i&gt;), 20 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml (&lt;i&gt;A. inermis&lt;/i&gt;), 50 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml (&lt;i&gt;A. senegalensis&lt;/i&gt;), 50 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml (&lt;i&gt;C. edulis&lt;/i&gt;), and 50 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml (&lt;i&gt;P. polyandra&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;Securidaca longepedunculata&lt;/i&gt; extract induced the cleavage of PARP. It was concluded that these medicinal plants have antiproliferative and anti-invasive activities and possess good prospects as source of anticancer agents especially &lt;i&gt;S. longepedunculata&lt;/i&gt; which induced apoptosis in U87 cell line.">

The current study was designed to inspect five medicinally important species (such as &lt;i&gt;Mentha longifolia&lt;/i&gt; (L.)

Biological spectra expressed that therophytes (60%) were the dominant life-form class, while nanophyll (60%) was the leading class among leaf size. The ethnobotanical profile showed that all the species were medicinal and ornamental (100%) each, while 60% were used in spices. Quantitative analysis for the macro- and microminerals confirmed the presence of 13 elements (C, N, O, Mg, K, P, S, Ca, Al, Si, Fe, Cl, and Na), which were present in varying amounts from species to species. The methanol extract of leaf samples was used for the analysis of phytochemical constituents such as saponins, flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, phlobatannins, steroids, and anthraquinones. The medicinal potential of these plants was correlated with the presence of these phytochemicals. Due to the presence of active constituents, the plants had high potential in antifungal, antidiuretic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Sideritis raeseri&lt;/i&gt; Boiss. and Heldr. (Lamiaceae), known as &quot;mountain tea,&quot; is a native plant from the Mediterranean region, which is widely used in traditional medicine. This study evaluates the effects of the ethanol extract of &lt;i&gt;Sideritis raeseri&lt;/i&gt; (SR) on airway smooth muscle activity and identifies the underlying mechanism. The &lt;i&gt;S. raeseri&lt;/i&gt; extract (SRE) was extracted from air-dried parts of the shoot system of SR. The SRE (0.3-2 mg/mL) was tested in isolated rabbit tracheal rings, suspended in the organ bath, filled with Krebs solution, and bubbled with the carbogen mixture (95% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) under a resting tension of 1 g in 37°C. In &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments, the SRE relaxed against acetylcholine-induced constriction in tracheal rings. Furthermore, SRE inhibited Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-induced contractions in carbachol (CCh, 1 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M) as well as in the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-depolarized trachea (80 mM). Our findings showed the NO/cGMP involvement in tracheorelaxant effects of SR. To this end, the effect of the SRE was potentiated by bradykinin (nitric oxide (NO) synthase activator, 100 nM), whereas it was inhibited by ODQ (inhibitor of NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase, 10 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M) and L-NAME (NO synthase inhibitor, 100 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M), as well as indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 10 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M). These data suggest that the tracheorelaxant effect of the SRE is mediated at least partly by NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate and cyclooxygenase-1-prostaglandin E2-dependent signaling. These findings indicate that the SRE may be used in various respiratory disorders.">

        <span class="abst" title="This study was designed to explore and record various medicinal plants integrated into the traditional system of medicine for the treatment of cancer. The traditional system of medicine is a routine practiced among the indigenous ethnic groups of Sokoto state. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed and used for data collection around the selected Local Government Areas. A substantial number of plant species were identified, recorded, and collected for preservation. Data collected for each specie was analysed to assess its frequent use among the medicinal plants. A total of 67 species belonging to 31 families have been identified and recorded. Out of the 473 frequency of citation (FC), &lt;i&gt;Acacia nilotica&lt;/i&gt; was the most frequently cited specie (32 FC, 64% FC, 0.6 RFC), followed by &lt;i&gt;Guiera senegalensis&lt;/i&gt; (27 FC, 54% FC, 0.5 RFC), &lt;i&gt;Erythrina sigmoidea&lt;/i&gt; (17 FC, 34% FC, 0.3 RFC), and subsequently &lt;i&gt;Combretum camporum&lt;/i&gt; (15 FC, 30% FC, 0.3 RFC). The most common parts of the plants used include the barks (55.2%), the roots (53.2%), and the leaves (41.8%). Additionally, decoction (74.6%), powdered form (49.3%), and maceration (46.3%) are the most frequently used mode of preparation. The historical knowledge of a traditional system of medicine practiced by the native traditional healers of Sokoto for the treatment of cancer has been documented. The present study further provides a baseline for future pharmacological investigations into the beneficial effects of such medicinal plants for the treatment of cancer.">

        <span class="abst" title="Human trichomoniasis, caused by the pathogenic parasitic protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis, is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease that contributes to reproductive morbidity in affected women and possibly to prostate cancer in men. Tritrichomonas foetus strains cause the disease trichomoniasis in farm animals (cattle, bulls, pigs) and diarrhea in domestic animals (cats and dogs). Because some T. vaginalis strains have become resistant to the widely used drug metronidazole, there is a need to develop alternative treatments, based on safe natural products that have the potential to replace and/or enhance the activity of lower doses of metronidazole. To help meet this need, this overview collates and interprets worldwide reported studies on the efficacy of structurally different classes of food, marine, and medicinal plant extracts and some of their bioactive pure compounds against T. vaginalis and T. foetus in vitro and in infected mice and women. Active food extracts include potato peels and their glycoalkaloids α-chaconine and α-solanine, caffeic and chlorogenic acids, and quercetin; the tomato glycoalkaloid α-tomatine; theaflavin-rich black tea extracts and bioactive theaflavins; plant essential oils and their compounds (+)-α-bisabolol and eugenol; the grape skin compound resveratrol; the kidney bean lectin, marine extracts from algae, seaweeds, and fungi and compounds that are derived from fungi; medicinal extracts and about 30 isolated pure compounds. Also covered are the inactivation of drug-resistant T. vaginalis and T. foetus strains by sensitized light; anti-trichomonad effects in mice and women; beneficial effects of probiotics in women; and mechanisms that govern cell death. The summarized findings will hopefully stimulate additional research, including molecular-mechanism-guided inactivations and human clinical studies, that will help ameliorate adverse effects of pathogenic protozoa.">

        <span class="abst" title="Despite the frightening mortality rate associated with COVID-19, there is no known approved drug to effectively combat the pandemic. COVID-19 clinical manifestations include fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, and other complications. At present, there is no known effective treatment or vaccine that can mitigate/inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Available clinical intervention for COVID-19 is only palliative and limited to support. Thus, there is an exigent need for effective and non-invasive treatment. This article evaluates the possible mechanism of actions of SARS-CoV-2 and present Nigeria based medicinal plants which have pharmacological and biological activities that can mitigate the hallmarks of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 mode of actions includes hyper-inflammation characterized by a severe and fatal hyper-cytokinaemia with multi-organ failure; immunosuppression; reduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enhance pulmonary vascular permeability causing damage to the alveoli; and further activated by open reading frame (ORF)3a, ORF3b, and ORF7a via c-Jun N- terminal kinase (JNK) pathway which induces lung damage. These mechanisms of action of SARS-CoV-2 can be mitigated by a combination therapy of medicinal herbs based on their pharmacological activities. Since the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are multifactorial with co-morbidities, we strongly recommend the use of combined therapy such that two or more herbs with specific therapeutic actions are administered to combat the mediators of the disease.">

To overcome these problems, herbal remedies may offer new alternative medicines. &lt;i&gt;Hygrophila schulli&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal plant traditionally used for the treatment of pain and inflammation-related disorders; yet, these claims are not scientifically validated. Hence, this study was aimed to validate the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;Hygrophila schulli&lt;/i&gt; leaves as anti-inflammatory and analgesic remedy.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In vitro anti-hyaluronidase assay and in vivo carrageenan-induced hind paw oedema model were used to evaluate the anti-inflammatory property of ethanolic leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;Hygrophila schulli&lt;/i&gt;. Tail immersion and acetic acid-induced writhing tests were performed to determine the central and peripheral analgesic activity of the leaf extract, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The ethanolic leaf extract exhibited significant anti-hyaluronidase activity (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) and significant inhibition of carrageenan-induced paw oedema (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05) compared to untreated controls. Similarly, the extract significantly prolonged the reaction time of mice (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05) for the hot-water stimuli. Furthermore, an oral dose of the extract showed significant inhibition (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.01) of acetic acid-induced abdominal contractions of mice. Besides, the ethanolic leaf extract did not cause any obvious sign of acute toxicity at a single oral dose of 2 g/kg.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The findings of this study may partially support the acclaimed traditional use of &lt;i&gt;Hygrophila schulli&lt;/i&gt; leaves for the treatment of pain and inflammatory conditions.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal plant used in Moroccan folk medicine to treat several diseases such as diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the phenolic bioactive compounds and to evaluate the antioxidant and antihyperglycemic activities of &lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; leaf and rootstock extracts. Phenolic compounds of &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; rootstock and leaf extracts were determined using HPLC-DAD-QTOFMS analysis. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS&lt;sup&gt;•+&lt;/sup&gt;) radicals. Moreover, the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antihyperglycemic effects were tested by measuring the inhibition of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase activities. HPLC-DAD-QTOFMS analysis identified thirty-two phenolic components in both leaf and rootstock extracts. Caffeic acid, quinic acid, and chlorogenic acid were the major compounds of &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract (FVLE), while the main compound of &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; rootstock extracts (FVRE) was quinic acid. In the DPPH assay, &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract showed important antioxidant activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.16 ± 0.02 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) than &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; rootstock extract (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 34.36 ± 0.09 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL). Moreover, fennel leaf extracts revealed also the most powerful antioxidant activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 22.95 ± 0.4 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) in the ABTS assay. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antihyperglycemic activity showed that &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; rootstock extract exhibited a remarkable inhibitory capacity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 194.30 ± 4.8 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase compared with &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 1026.50 ± 6.5 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL). Furthermore, the inhibition of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase was more importantly with &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; rootstock (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 165.90 ± 1.2 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) than &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; leaf extracts (203.80 ± 1.3 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL). The funding of this study showed that &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; rootstock and leaf extracts presented several phenolic compounds and showed important antioxidant and antidiabetic effects. We suggest that the identified molecules are responsible for the obtained activities. However, further studies focusing on the isolation and the determination of antioxidant and antidiabetic effects of &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; rootstock and leaf main compounds are required.">

Ciprofloxacin 0.05 mg/disc was used as a positive control. Furthermore, a preliminary phytochemical study was carried out.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The zones of inhibition shown by all extracts of the two plants against the tested bacteria were significantly lesser (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) than the standard drug. &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; were the most susceptible strains for most extracts studied.

        <span class="abst" title="Obesity and overweight are strongly associated with dyslipidemia which can promote the development of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, natural products have been suggested as alternative compounds for antioxidant and antilipidemic activity. The objective of this study was to determine the phenolic compounds and assess the inhibitory activities on pancreatic lipase, cholesterol esterase, and cholesterol micellization of nipa palm vinegar (NPV). Total phenolic content was assessed and phenolic compounds were determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), respectively. Pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase inhibitory activities of the NPV were measured using enzymatic colorimetric assays. The formation of cholesterol micelles was assessed using a cholesterol assay kit. The phenolic content of NPV was 167.10 ± 10.15 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g GAE/mL, and LC-MS analyses indicated the presence of gallic acid, isoquercetin, quercetin, catechin, and rutin as bioactive compounds. Additionally, the NPV inhibited pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase activities in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the NPV also suppressed the formation of cholesterol micellization. These results suggest that phenolic compounds, especially gallic acid, isoquercetin, quercetin, catechin, and rutin, from NPV may be the main active compounds with possible cholesterol-lowering effects through inhibition of pancreatic lipase and cholesterol esterase activities as well as the inhibition of solubility of cholesterol micelles. Therefore, NPV may delay postprandial dyslipidemia, and it could be used as a natural source of bioactive compounds with antilipidemic activity. However, NPV should be extensively evaluated by animal and clinical human studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="The scarcity, high cost, and unreliable supply of healthy food in developing countries have resulted in the search for cheap and alternative sources of healthy and nutritious food. Wild edible plants (WEPs) are one of the alternative sources of healthy and nutritious food, and they are crucially important in supporting the global food basket in all parts of the world in general and in sub-Saharan Africa in particular. These wild edible plants have played a significant role in supplying food and nutritional requirements and increasing the health status of poor communities in many rural parts of the world. In Ethiopia, rural communities use wild edible plants as a means of survival especially during times of drought and famine and during other forms calamities and crises. Wild edible plants have high nutritional content, including proteins, vitamin B2, and vitamin C, which can be used as alternatives to conventional plant-based human diets. The available literature has revealed that some wild edible plants also have medicinal properties. Even though wild edible plants are important for food security, they are usually overlooked and perceived as food for poor families. This review indicates that fruits are the most commonly used WEPs, both for consumption and medicinal value, and most plant parts are eaten directly in raw forms. This review focuses on the commercial exploitation of wild edible plants as a source of dietary supplements and alternative medicines and as a means to generate income; it also focuses on consumer perception toward wild edible plants in Ethiopia. Despite easy accessibility and availability, the consumption of wild edible plants is challenged by numerous factors. This review suggests that nutrition policies have to promote the utilization of wild edible plants as one pillar of food and nutrition security. Bioactive compound contents and antinutritional factor contents of wild and medicinal plants need further investigation.">

Oral infections are the most prevalent diseases in man. The Rhus family has been found to have antimicrobial, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties. Few studies have been done on Rhus vulgaris Meikle. A study was conducted to determine the effect of Rhus vulgaris Meikle stem bark extracts against selected oral pathogenic microorganisms and the safety of the extracts in vitro and in vivo.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Methanol:dichloromethane (1:1), methanol and aqueous extracts were tested for bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans. Cytotoxicity of the active extracts was determined using Vero E6 cell lines while safety was evaluated in mice and rats. Phytochemical screening was performed on the methanol extracts. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons tests were performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20.0 for antimicrobial assay and acute toxicity testing. One-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparison tests were conducted using GraphPad Prism 8.0 for cytotoxicity assay.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Methanol extract of Rhus vulgaris showed significant antimicrobial activity against MRSA (12.00 ± 0.00 mm; p-value of &lt; 0.005; Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of 0.391 mg/ml; Minimum Bactericidal Concentration of 1.563 mg/ml). The extract were not cytotoxic at 100 μg/ml which was the highest tested concentration. In acute dermal irritation testing, the methanol extract resulted in mild irritation with erythema and flaking that cleared within 8 days. There were no observable adverse effects from oral administration of the extracts (acute oral toxicity testing) at concentrations of 50 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg. Tannins, saponins, flavonoids, terpenoids, glycosides, alkaloids and phenols were detected in the methanol extract.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Antimicrobial activity of R. vulgaris extracts supports its traditional use as a toothbrush. Cytotoxicity demonstrated by the extracts as well as the mild skin irritation warrants further study before R. vulgaris can be recommended for the development of effective and safe mouthwashes.">

A number of cancer patients have been found to be using traditional medicine as primary therapy and/or as complementary medicine. Cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality globally among the non-communicable diseases. The aim of this study was to identify the plants used by traditional medicine practitioners (TMPs) in Zimbabwe to treat cancer.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A structured questionnaire was used to interview consenting registered TMPs on ethnomedicinal plants they use to treat cancer. A review of published literature on the cited plants was also carried out. The practitioners were asked about the plants that they use to treat cancer, the plant parts used, type of cancer treated, other medicinal uses of the plants and preparation and administration of the plant parts.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Twenty (20) TMPs took part in the study. A total of 18 medicinal plant species were cited. The commonly treated types of cancer were breast, prostate, colon, skin and blood cancers with most plants being used to treat skin, blood and breast cancers, respectively. Of the medicinal plants cited, 44.4% were used to treat all cancer types. The most used plant parts were the roots (72.2%) and leaves (72.2%) followed by the bark (38.9%). The medicinal plants were used for multiple ailments. The most common plant preparation methods were infusion (72.2%) and decoction (66.7%) and the oral route of administration, as extracts and powder put in tea and porridge, was the most used.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The frequently used plant parts were leaves and roots. The traditional uses of the medicinal plants cited in this study resonate well with their reported uses from other ethnopharmacological studies done in other parts of the world. The plants used by TMPs to treat cancer in Zimbabwe, if adequately explored, can be instrumental in the discovery and development of cancer drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The loss of traditional ecological knowledge in endangered language communities is a cause of concern worldwide. Given the state of current knowledge, it is difficult to say whether language and TEK transmission levels are correlated, i.e. whether the erosion of one is accompanied by erosion of the other. This case study, focusing on a small Indigenous language from northern Australia, represents a first step towards a systematic investigation of this question.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Speakers of the language Kune (which is currently being transmitted to small children in the community) were asked to identify and name a number of common birds and plants known to occur on Kune traditional lands, through a series of audiovisual stimuli.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;There was a weak correlation between speaker age and performance for the plant naming task, but not for the birds. Analysis of the ethnotaxa that were or were not named by individual participants showed that only a small number of plants and birds (approx. 13% and 7% respectively) were known to all participants, while many (approx. 30% and 26% respectively) could only be named by one participant, i.e. the oldest. Edible ethnotaxa were common among the plants and birds that could be named by many people. There was a tendency among younger speakers to use a single umbrella term to label similar-looking species from large genera, such as Acacia, whereas older people would have had distinct labels for each species.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Performance in the plant and bird naming tasks was lower than expected for a community where language transmission to younger generations is high. The loss of certain plant and bird names from the active lexicons of some younger Kune speakers may be due to lifestyle change, particularly in terms of food habits, or due to inter-individual differences in life histories. Differences between the transmission of plant and bird names may be due to more frequent interactions with edible plants, as compared to birds.">

Excessive glutamate causes an up-regulation of the multiple signaling pathways, including phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and autophagy that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases pathophysiology. There are numerous findings on curcumin, astaxanthin, thymoquinone, and berberine, as natural products, which have outstanding effects in cell signaling far beyond their anti-oxidant activity, considering as a potential therapeutic target for glutamate excitotoxicity.

We studied the spatiotemporal regulation and influence of light (photoperiods, intensities, and spectral qualities) on melatonin concentration in the medicinal herb Hypericum perforatum L. Furthermore, melatonin concentrations in the leaves of eight species of the Hypericum genus were compared and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Melatonin concentration was found to be the highest in its flowers and leaves. The leaves exhibited a rhythmic variation in melatonin concentration of approximately 24 h under both light-dark entrained (Zeitgeber time) and constant light [circadian time (CT)] conditions, with melatonin concentration peaking at approximately CT6 in the middle of the subjective day. Melatonin concentration was influenced significantly by not only photoperiods but also applied light's wavelength and intensity. It was approximately six times higher under long-day conditions (18-h light:6-h dark) than under short-day photoperiods (10-h light:14-h dark) and was the highest (131 μg/g fresh weight [FW]) under treatment with blue light at an intensity of 45 µmol·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s of photons. The melatonin concentration of the two examined Hypericum spp., namely H. kouytchense Lev. and H. coris L., were approximately twice that of H. perforatum L.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings provide first insights on melatonin-related functions and mechanisms in the circadian system of H. perforatum and useful resources for further melatonin-oriented research and possible applications in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Bischofia javanica&lt;/i&gt; (Blume), an edible wild plant, has both prospective nutraceutical and therapeutic properties. Here, we intended to explore the pharmacological potentials of the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;B. javanica&lt;/i&gt; (MEBJ) through integrated approaches. Phytochemical screening revealed the presence of important phytoconstituents which were found to be safe during cytotoxicity analysis. The sedative potential of MEBJ (200 and 400 mg/kg) was determined by employing open field, hole cross, and thiopental sodium-induced sleeping time tests, where a significant reduction of the locomotor performance and an enhancement in the duration of sleeping have been observed, respectively. In addition, mice treated with MEBJ exhibited superior exploration during both elevated plus maze and hole board tests. In parallel, anti-diabetic potency was investigated via alpha-amylase inhibitory assay, where a dose-response increase in the percentage of inhibition has been marked. A similar response, such as an increased percentage of clot lysis, was observed during the thrombolytic test. Furthermore, molecular docking was performed with the identified compounds, demonstrated strong binding affinities to the target receptors of the experiments as mentioned above. Also, ADME/T and toxicological parameters verified the drug-like properties of the identified compounds. Collectively, these results indicate bioactivity of &lt;i&gt;Bischofia javanica&lt;/i&gt;, which can be a potential candidate in the food and pharmaceutical industries.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Diospyros mespiliformis&lt;/i&gt;, commonly called Jackal berry or African ebony, belongs to the plant family, Ebenaceae. The roots, barks and leaves have been used traditionally to treat wide varieties of conditions, however, there is limited information and literature reports concerning the toxicity and safety of this plant. The present study was conducted to evaluate the acute and sub-chronic toxicity of the crude methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Diospyros mespiliformis&lt;/i&gt; and its fraction in Wistar rats. &lt;i&gt;Diospyros mespiliformis&lt;/i&gt; was extracted by methanol 96 %. The crude methanolic extract was then fractionated into low, average and high polar compounds using hexane, ethyl acetate and butanol respectively. For the acute toxicity study, the revised limit Dose Test of &quot;Up and Down&quot; procedure according to the OECD guideline was used to determine the median lethal dose (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of the crude methanolic leaf and bark extracts using a single fixed dose (5 g/kg) of the extracts administered by oral-gavage sequentially to 5 female Wistar rats. The rats were observed for instant death and toxicity signs for 24 h and then daily for 14 days. In the sub-chronic toxicity study, the bark and leaf ethyl acetate fractions (extract) was administered orally at doses of 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg bw /day respectively for 28 days to healthy Wistar rats. At the end of the experimental period, body weight, certain haematological, serum biochemical and histopathological parameters were evaluated. Results showed that acute oral administration of crude methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Diospyros mespiliformis&lt;/i&gt; (5 g/kg bw) produced neither mortality nor visible changes in behavior or any other physiological activities and indicated that the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of crude methanolic leaf and bark extract was greater than 5 g/kg bw in Wistar Rats. In the 28-days repeated dose oral toxicity study, no significant toxic effects was detected in any of the parameters evaluated. In conclusion, the crude methanolic extract was found safe in the acute toxicity study and the ethyl acetate fraction of &lt;i&gt;Diospyros mespiliformis&lt;/i&gt; in the sub chronic study in rats could be safe for therapeutic purposes over a period not exceeding 28 days.">

Several medicinal plants and formulations have been claimed to have liver protective activities. The present study aimed to evaluate in vitro antioxidant and in vivo hepatoprotective activities of root bark extracts of &lt;i&gt;Croton macrostachyus (Euphorbiaceae).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Free radical scavenging activity of crude extract and solvent fractions of the plant was conducted using the DPPH assay method. Hepatoprotective activities of the crude extract and solvent fractions of the plant were carried out based on paracetamol-induced liver damage in mice. Serum biomarkers (AST, ALT, ALP, total bilirubin and total protein) were assessed to find out the effect. Histopathological examination was also carried out for all groups of mice to further confirm the findings.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Antioxidant assay revealed that the crude extract, aqueous fraction and chloroform fraction of &lt;i&gt;Croton macrostachyus&lt;/i&gt; exhibited free radical scavenging activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 128.6, 168.9, and 406 µg/mL, respectively. Pretreatment of the mice with the crude extract and solvent fractions of &lt;i&gt;Croton macrostachyus&lt;/i&gt; significantly reduced ALP (p&lt;0.001), ALT (p&lt;0.001), and AST (p&lt;0.001) levels at all the administered doses compared to the toxic group. The crude extract and chloroform fraction decreased total bilirubin level at doses of 200 mg/kg (P&lt;0.05) and 400 mg/kg (P&lt;0.001). Pretreatment of the mice with 400 mg/kg of the crude extract and aqueous fraction elevated total protein value compared to the paracetamol treated group (P&lt;0.05). The hepatoprotective activities of the plant extracts were confirmed by histopathological studies.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;From this study, it can be concluded that the crude extract and solvent fractions of &lt;i&gt;Croton macrostachyus&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated antioxidant and hepatoprotective activities.">

In latter years, plant secondary metabolites have become of special interest because of their potential role in preventing and managing metabolic syndrome. Sesquiterpene lactones constitute a large and diverse group of biologically active compounds widely distributed in several medicinal plants used for the treatment of metabolic disorders. The structural diversity and the broad spectrum of biological activities of these compounds drew significant interests in the pharmacological applications. This review describes selected sesquiterpene lactones that have been experimentally validated for their biological activities related to risk factors of metabolic syndrome, together with their mechanisms of action. The potential beneficial effects of sesquiterpene lactones discussed in this review demonstrate that these substances represent remarkable compounds with a diversity of molecular structure and high biological activity, providing new insights into the possible role in metabolic syndrome management.">

Raf., &lt;i&gt;Cassia fistula&lt;/i&gt; L. and &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia speciosa&lt;/i&gt; L. are three ornamental plants that produce colorful flowers. The present study aimed to evaluate the phytochemicals and bioactivities of methanolic extracts of flowers from &lt;i&gt;Delonix regia&lt;/i&gt; (DrFME), &lt;i&gt;Cassia fistula&lt;/i&gt; (CfFME), and &lt;i&gt;Lagerstroemia speciosa&lt;/i&gt; (LsFME). The presence of ten different chemical classes in varying degrees was confirmed while qualitatively screened. During quantitative determination, LsFME possesses the highest amount of total phenolic (418.0 mg/g), flavonoid (50.8 mg/g), and tannin (256.3 mg/g) contents. The extracts showed excellent antioxidant capacity in a concentration-dependent manner with the lowest IC50 value (41.51 μg/mL) displayed by LsFME. LsFME paralyzed the experimental worms at 2.95 min and killed at 3.96 min. DrFME was found to be more effective in thrombolytic (35.5% clot lysis) and anticoagulant activities. Negligible hemolytic activity (IC50 &gt; 200 μg/mL) found for all extracts which suggest their less potential toxicity. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments revealed that the CfFME has the highest analgesic (64.34% pain inhibition) activity while LsFME has the highest antidiarrheal (70.27% inhibition) and antihyperglycemic (46.94% inhibition) activities at 400 mg/kg of body weight doses. This study has shown the presence of phytochemicals and potential bioactivities which indicates the possibility of these flowers to be used as a source of phytochemicals as well as safe and effective natural medicine.">

        <span class="abst" title="The traditional medicine based on medicinal plants in the Kingdom of Arabia Saudia presents a strong relationship belonging to natural remedies, health, diet, and folk healing practice recognized by a specific culture. The aim of the current study is to carry out an ethnobotanical review on medicinal plants used in traditional medicine in the Kingdom of Arabia Saudia including information on plant species, used parts, preparation method as well as medical uses. Earlier published data in journals, textbooks, periodicals, websites, and databases written in pharmacological evidence of Suadi medicinal plants were based on gathering information. The present review work reported that 96 species belonging to 47 families have been used in Saudi Pharmacopeia. Amaranthaceae has the highest number of plant species (7) Followed by Asteraceae, Apocynaceae, and Fabaceae with 5 plant species in each. The inventoried plant species in the current work are frequently used for the treatment of various illnesses and to ensure the medication safety of Saudi people. The biological analysis of plant form used in Saudi natural remedies showed the dominance of herb and subshrub form with a percentage of 43% and 30% respectively. The most used preparation method of plant drugs, which used in Saudi Alternative medicine was decoction and infusion. The whole plant, leaves, seeds, and aerial parts were the most useful plant parts in natural preparation in Saudi traditional medicine with a percentage of 29%, 28%, 7%, and 5% respectively as reported in the present review work. The present review work gives big data about medicinal plants used in traditional medicine in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia including data about plant species, used parts, preparation method as well as medical uses.">

Such plants may contain novel compounds to display promising biological activities. Here, in this study, we evaluate the biological activities of methanolic extracts of fresh leaves, dry leaves, stem, and roots of T. &lt;i&gt;articulata.&lt;/i&gt; The antioxidant activity was determined by 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and total phenolic and flavonoid content were determined using standard colorimetric methods. Whereas antimicrobial and ant-proliferative activities were determined by standard well-diffusion and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) methods, respectively. Our results demonstrate that all methanolic extracts of T. &lt;i&gt;articulata&lt;/i&gt; showed antioxidant activity, however, the methanolic extract of dry leaves exhibits promising antioxidant effect with IC₅₀ value 49.08 ± 1.98, which was strongly supported by total phenolic (409.92 ± 6.03 mg GAE/g DW) and flavonoid (177.71 mg QE/g DW) content. Although, antimicrobial activity was also exhibited by all the methanolic extracts, however, methanolic extract of dry leaves exhibits promising antimicrobial activity in Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus &lt;i&gt;epidemidis.&lt;/i&gt; Furthermore&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; MTT assay revealed that all methanolic extracts exhibit antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 (breast cancer) and RKO (colorectal cancer) cells with IC₅₀ values ranges from 219 ± 5.112 µg/ml to 253 ± 5.231 µg/ml and 220 ± 4.330 µg/ml to 325 ± 6.213 µg/ml, respectively. However, the most promising antiproliferative effect was displayed by methanolic extract of dry leaves with IC₅₀ values 219 ± 5.112 µg/ml and 220 ± 4.330 µg/ml, respectively&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; In summary, these findings provide evidence that T. &lt;i&gt;articulata&lt;/i&gt; has promising biological activities and can be used for many pharmaceutical activities in the future.">

It has a strong religious significance as it is mentioned in the religious books of Islam and Christianity. In addition to its historical and religious significance, it is also mentioned in ancient medicine. It is widely used in traditional systems of medicine for a number of diseases including asthma, fever, bronchitis, cough, chest congestion, dizziness, paralysis, chronic headache, back pain and inflammation. The importance of this plant led the scientific community to carry out extensive phytochemical and biological investigations on &lt;i&gt;N. sativa&lt;/i&gt;. Pharmacological studies on &lt;i&gt;N. sativa&lt;/i&gt; have confirmed its antidiabetic, antitussive, anticancer, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, neuro-protective, gastroprotective, immunomodulator, analgesic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, and bronchodilator activity. The present review is an effort to explore the reported chemical composition and pharmacological activity of this plant. It will help as a reference for scientists, researchers, and other health professionals who are working with this plant and who need up to date knowledge about it.">

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the aqueous and hydroalcoholic leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;Thymus. schimperi&lt;/i&gt; on blood glucose levels.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The aqueous and 80% methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;T. schimperi&lt;/i&gt; leaves were prepared. Swiss albino mice of either sex weighing 20-30 g were selected for the experiments. Mice that were made diabetic were divided into seven groups to study the antihyperglycemic effect of the extracts. Diabetes was induced by single intraperitonial injection of alloxan monohydrate (180 mg/kg body weight).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;After diabetic mice were treated with an extract of solvent at doses of 250 and 500 mg/kg for 21 days, there were significant decreases in fasting blood glucose when compared to diabetic controls. The observed antidiabetic activity could be associated with the phytochemicals present in this plant extract. The extract of solvent also prevented body weight loss of diabetic when compared to diabetic mice group. It was also observed that the extracts have shown no acute toxicity at a dose of 2 g/kg.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The aqueous and 80% methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;T. schimperi&lt;/i&gt; leaves have shown blood glucose level lowering effects in diabetic mice. Hence, the present study might support the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;T. schimperi&lt;/i&gt; for diabetes mellitus treatment.">

Our present study, &lt;i&gt;Azadirachta indica, Moringa oleifera, Murraya koenigii,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Psidium guajava&lt;/i&gt; extracts were investigated against MRSA. The preliminary antimicrobial study showed pet. ether extract of &lt;i&gt;A. indica&lt;/i&gt; and ethanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;P. guajava&lt;/i&gt; showed a MIC value of 125 μg/mL and MBC value of 500 μg/mL. These extracts showed biofilm inhibition in the range of 60.0-83.9 % and did not possess any hemolytic activity to the human erythrocytes. The plant species investigated in this study had different degrees of antibiofilm activity against MRSA. However, we suggest that &lt;i&gt;A. indica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. guajava&lt;/i&gt; are promising candidates and further investigation is needed to isolate the antimicrobial compounds for the management of MRSA and its mechanism of activity.">

In the present study, we reported the isolation, characterization and pharmacological activities of robustic acid (RA) from the ethyl acetate extract of &lt;i&gt;D. benthami&lt;/i&gt; Prain. The SwissADME prediction showed that the RA satisfied the Lipinski's rule of five (molecule weight (MW): 380.39 g/mol, lipid-water partition coefficient (log P): 3.72, hydrogen bond donors (Hdon): 1, hydrogen bond acceptors (Hacc): 6, rotatable bonds (Rbon): 3. Other chemical and pharmacological properties of this RA were also evaluated, including topological polar surface area (TPSA) = 78.13 Å and solubility (Log S) = -4.8. The probability values of the antineoplastic, anti-free radical activities and topoisomerase I (TopoⅠ) inhibitory activity were found to be 0.784, 0.644 and 0.379, respectively. The molecular docking experiment using the Surflex-Dock showed that the Total Score and C Score of RNA binding with the human DNA-Topo I complex were 7.80 and 4. The MTS assay experiment showed that the inhibitory rates of RA on HL-60, MT4, Hela, HepG2, SK-OV-3 and MCF-7 cells were 37.37%, 97.41%, 81.22%, 34.4%, 32.68% and 51.4%, respectively. In addition, RA exhibited an inhibitory effect on the angiogenesis of zebrafish embryo, a good TopoⅠ inhibitory activity at a 10 mM concentration and in a dose-dependent manner, excellent radical scavenging in the DPPH and ABTS assays, and the free radical scavenging rate was close to the positive control (BHT) at different concentrations (0.5-2.0 mg/mL). Furthermore, 18 potential targets were found for this RA by PharmMapper, including ANXA3, SRC, FGFR2, GSK3B, CSNK2B, YARS, LCK, EPHA2, MAPK14, RORA, CRABP2, PPP1CC, METAP2, MME, TTR, MET and KDR. The GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the &quot;protein tyrosine kinase activity&quot;, &quot;rap1 signaling pathway&quot; and &quot;PI3K-Akt signaling pathway&quot; were significantly enriched by the RA target genes. Our results will provide new insights into the pharmaceutical use of this species. More importantly, our data will expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of RA functions.">

Column chromatography and preparative thin-layer chromatography were used to isolate lupeol (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), raucaffricine (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methylsarpagine (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), and spegatrine (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). The crude extract, fractions and isolated compounds were tested for anti-oxidant, antitrypanosomal and anti-proliferation activities. Two fractions displayed high DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity and reducing power with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (The half maximal inhibitory concentration) and IC&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.022 ± 0.003 mg/mL and 0.036 ± 0.007 mg/mL, and 0.518 ± 0.044 mg/mL and 1.076 ± 0.136 mg/mL, respectively. Spegatrine (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) was identified as the main antioxidant compound in &lt;i&gt;R. caffra&lt;/i&gt; with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and IC&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.119 ± 0.067 mg/mL and 0.712 ± 0 mg/mL, respectively. One fraction displayed high antitrypanosomal activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 18.50 μg/mL. However, the major constituent of this fraction, raucaffricine (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), was not active. The crude extract, fractions and pure compounds did not display any cytotoxic effect at a concentration of 50 μg/mL against HeLa cells. This study shows directions for further in vitro studies on the antioxidant and antitrypanosomal activities of &lt;i&gt;Rauvolfia caffra&lt;/i&gt; Sond.">

In this study, we firstly investigated the diversity and antimicrobial activity of the culturable endophytic fungi from &lt;i&gt;C. japonicus&lt;/i&gt;. A total of 332 fungal colonies were successfully isolated from 555 tissue segments of the medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;C. japonicus&lt;/i&gt; collected from Qinling Mountains, China. One hundred and thirty representative morphotype strains were identified according to ITS rDNA sequence analyses and were grouped into three phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mucoromycota), five classes (Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Mucoromycetes), and at least 30 genera. &lt;i&gt;Colletotrichum&lt;/i&gt; (RA, 60.54%) was the most abundant genus, followed by &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/i&gt; (RA, 11.75%) and &lt;i&gt;Diaporthe&lt;/i&gt; (RA, 9.34%). The Species Richness Index (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;, 56) and the Shannon-Wiener Index (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;', 2.7076) indicated that &lt;i&gt;C. japonicus&lt;/i&gt; harbored abundant fungal resources. Thirteen out of 130 endophytic fungal ethyl acetate extracts exhibited inhibitory activities against at least one pathogenic bacterium or fungus. Among of these, F8158, which was identified as &lt;i&gt;Trichoderma&lt;/i&gt; cf. &lt;i&gt;harzianum&lt;/i&gt;, exhibited good antagonistic capacities (the percent inhibition of mycelial growth ranged from 47.72~88.18) for different pathogens and has a potential application in biological control. In addition, it is noteworthy that the strain F8157 (&lt;i&gt;Thanatephorus cucumeris&lt;/i&gt;, an opportunistic pathogen) showed antibacterial and antifungal activity, which is reported firstly in this study, and should be investigated further. Taken together, these results indicated that the endophytic fungi from &lt;i&gt;C. japonicus&lt;/i&gt; may be of potential interest in screening bio-control agents and discovering of new bioactive compounds.">

However, there is little conclusive evidence that dietary flavonoids provide significant leads for developing more effective drugs, as the majority appears to be of negligible medicinal importance. Some aromatic polyketides of limited distribution have shown more interesting medicinal properties and additional research should be focused on them. Combretastatins, analogues of phenoxodiol, hepatoactive kavalactones, and silymarin are showing a considerable promise in the advanced phases of clinical trials for the treatment of various pathologies. If their limitations such as adverse side effects, poor water solubility, and oral inactivity are successfully eliminated, they might be prime candidates for the development of more effective and in some case safer drugs. This review highlights some of the newer compounds, where they are in the new drug pipeline and how researchers are searching for additional likely candidates.">

        <span class="abst" title="Presently, there are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, which has spread to over 200 countries and at the time of writing was responsible for over 650,000 deaths worldwide. Recent studies have shown that two human proteases, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L, play a key role in host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, inhibitors of these proteases were shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we perform virtual screening of 14,011 phytochemicals produced by Indian medicinal plants to identify natural product inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. AutoDock Vina was used to perform molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filtered by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and non-covalent interactions between protein and ligand were used as an additional filter to identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. This led to the identification of 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. Further, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to analyze the stability of the protein-ligand complexes for the three top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 namely, qingdainone, edgeworoside C and adlumidine, and of cathepsin L namely, ararobinol, (+)-oxoturkiyenine and 3α,17α-cinchophylline. Interestingly, several herbal sources of identified phytochemical inhibitors have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine. Further in vitro and in vivo testing is needed before clinical trials of the promising phytochemical inhibitors identified here.">

More than 19.7 million cases have been reported globally and about 728,000 have died as of this writing (10 August 2020). Recently, it has been confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M&lt;sup&gt;pro)&lt;/sup&gt; enzyme is responsible not only for viral reproduction but also impedes host immune responses. The M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; provides a highly favorable pharmacological target for the discovery and design of inhibitors. Currently, no specific therapies are available, and investigations into the treatment of COVID-19 are lacking. Therefore, herein, we analyzed the bioactive phytocompounds isolated by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) from &lt;i&gt;Tinospora crispa&lt;/i&gt; as potential COVID-19 M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; inhibitors, using molecular docking study.

        <span class="abst" title="The genus &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia&lt;/i&gt; is one of the largest genera in the spurge family, with diversity in range, distribution, and morphology. The plant species in this genus are widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of diseases, ranging from respirational infections, body and skin irritations, digestion complaints, inflammatory infections, body pain, microbial illness, snake or scorpion bites, pregnancy, as well as sensory disorders. Their successes have been attributed to the presence of diverse phytochemicals like polycyclic and macrocyclic diterpenes with various pharmacological properties. As a result, &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia&lt;/i&gt; diterpenes are of interest to chemists and biochemists with regard to drug discovery from natural products due to their diverse therapeutic applications as well as their great structural diversity. Other chemical constituents such as triterpenoids have also been reported to possess various pharmacological properties, thus supporting the traditional uses of the &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia&lt;/i&gt; species. These triterpenoids can provide potential leads that can be developed into pharmaceutical compounds for a wide range of medicinal applications. However, there are scattered scientific reports about the anticancer activities of these constituents. Harnessing such information could provide a database of bioactive pharmacopeia or targeted scaffolds for drug discovery. Therefore, this review presents an updated and comprehensive summary of the ethnomedicinal uses, phytochemistry, and the anticancer activities of the triterpenoids of &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia&lt;/i&gt; species. Most of the reported triterpenoids in this review belong to tirucallane, cycloartanes, lupane, oleanane, ursane, and taraxane subclass. Their anticancer activities varied distinctly with the majority of them exhibiting significant cytotoxic and anticancer activities in vitro. It is, therefore, envisaged that the report on &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia&lt;/i&gt; triterpenoids with interesting anticancer activities will form a database of potential leads or scaffolds that could be advanced into the clinical trials with regard to drug discovery.">

In order to have a better understanding of the flavonoid profile of &lt;i&gt;Chaenomeles&lt;/i&gt;, the petals of four &lt;i&gt;Chaenomeles&lt;/i&gt; species, including &lt;i&gt;Chaenomeles japonica&lt;/i&gt; (RB)&lt;i&gt;, Chaenomeles speciose&lt;/i&gt; (ZP), &lt;i&gt;Chaenomeles sinensis&lt;/i&gt; (GP), and &lt;i&gt;Chaenomeles cathayensis&lt;/i&gt; (MY), were selected as experimental material. The total flavonoid content of GP was found to be the highest, followed by MY, ZP, and RB. In total, 179 flavonoid metabolites (including 49 flavonols, 46 flavonoids, 19 flavone C-glycosides, 17 procyanidins, 15 anthocyanins, 10 flavanols, 10 dihydroflavonoids, 6 isoflavones, 5 dihydroflavonols, and 2 chalcones) were identified by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Tandem Mass Spectrometry. Screening of differential flavonoid metabolites showed that GP had higher levels of metabolites when compared with the other three &lt;i&gt;Chaenomeles&lt;/i&gt; species. Annotation and enrichment analysis of flavonoid metabolites revealed that cyanidin 3,5-diglucoside and pelargonidin-3,5-diglucoside anthocyanins are likely responsible for the color differences of the four &lt;i&gt;Chaenomeles&lt;/i&gt; petals. Additionally, a large number of flavonoids, flavonols, and isoflavones were enriched in the petals of GP. This study provides new insights into the development and utilization of &lt;i&gt;Chaenomeles&lt;/i&gt; petals and provides a basis for future investigations into their utilization.">

A total of 119 articles published between 1968 and 2020 have been reviewed, using scientific search engines such as ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Twenty-seven medicinal plant species that belong to eighteen families are documented along with their botanical sources, potential active constituents, and in vitro and in vivo activities against various cancer cells. The review is compiled and discusses the potential anticancer, antiproliferative, and cytotoxic agents based on the types of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, steroids, and lignans. Among the anticancer secondary metabolites reported in this review, only few have been isolated from plants that are originated and collected in Ethiopia, and the majority of compounds are reported from plants belonging to different areas of the world. Thus, based on the available bioactivity reports, extensive and more elaborate ethnopharmacology-based bioassay-guided studies have to be conducted on selected traditionally claimed Ethiopian anticancer plants, which inherited from a unique and diverse landscape, with the aim of opening a way forward to conduct anticancer drug discovery program.">

        <span class="abst" title="Both plants and animals are living things made up of similar cells as well as organelles, and their essence of life is the same. However, plants face more environmental stress than animals and generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), a group of small molecules that can harm proteins, necessitating distinctive metabolic processes. Secondary metabolites in plants are a group of chemical components that can eliminate ROS and can also exhibit medicinal properties; therefore, herbal medicines are often closely linked to the ecological significance of secondary metabolites. Why plants contain so many, not few, active medicinal ingredients is unknown. The root of Scutellaria baicalensis, a popular herbal medicine, is rich in various flavonoids with diverse structural features. Sodium hydrosulfite (Na2S2O4) can produce O˙-2 radicals and induce physical conditions under environmental stress. Using UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis, a total of 25 different compounds were identified in the roots of S. baicalensis between the Na2S2O4 groups and suitable conditions. Based on the results of the t-test (P&lt;0.05) performed for the groups and ions with values of VIP ≥ 2, the most significantly different chemical markers with Na2S2O4 treatment were shikimic acid, citric acid, baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, 3,5,7,2',6'-pentahydroxyflavanone, 5,2',6'-trihydroxy-7,8-dimethoxy flavone, chrysin, eriodictyol, 5,8-dihydroxy-6,7 -dimethoxy flavone, skullcapflavone Ⅱ, and 5,7-dihydroxy-6,8,2',3'-tetrame thoxyflavone, and most of them were free flavonoids with many phenolic hydroxyl or methoxyl groups and characteristically high antioxidant activities. S. baicalensis roots modified their ability to eliminate ROS and maintained the equilibrium of ROS through the multitudinous biosynthesis and conversion of flavonoids, which is similar to the equilibrium established by an intricate buffer solution and perfectly explains the diversity and complexity of medicinal plant ingredients.">

        <span class="abst" title="Though innovations for sustainable management of natural resources have emerged over time, the rising demand for nature based health solutions and integration of endemic flora into global value chains could have adverse impacts on ecosystems. The ecological risks in the exploitation of the wild endemic medicinal plant resources are exacerbated by a myriad of agrotechnological risks and challenges that highly constrain their domestication. Successful exploitation and commercialisation of medicinal plants thus require a clear understanding of their demand and production systems or value chain analysis. Accordingly there is need for innovative approaches towards their integration into global value chains. Since quality and safety, traceability, certification, as well as consumer tastes and preferences are critical drivers in purchasing decisions by global consumers, they are inadvertently exploited to weaken Indigenous knowledge (IK), undermine common property rights and entrench value chains that favour a few elite buyers. This tend to create pervasive incentives for overexploitation of medicinal plant resources and environmental degradation. Potential solution lies in the recognition of drivers of vulnerability to environmental degradation and the innovative use of policy bricolage, feedback loops and interactions between knowledge, power and agency on one hand, and collective action and property rights institutions on the other hand. We conceptualise a framework that can mediate a transformational agenda and enhance systematic understanding of sustainability lenses in endemic medicinal plant resources value chains. This could strengthen IK, enhance collective action and promote participation of local actors with positive impact on the utilisation and integration of endemic medicinal plant resources into global value chains.">

In view of the emergence of Candida strains resistant to existing antifungal agents, alternative solutions should be considered. This is the purpose of this ethnobotanical survey, which aims to identify the medicinal plant species traditionally used to treat candidiasis in traditional markets of southern Benin.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The study was performed from October 2015 to January 2018 in the traditional markets of Southern-Benin. Data were collected by two complementary methods: triplet purchase of medicinal recipes (ATRM) from herbalists markets and semi-structured interview (ISS) from traditional healers.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 109 species of medicinal plants belonging to 44 families have been listed and identified. The most frequently cited species were Pteleopsis suberosa Engl. &amp; Diels, Lantana camara L., Cyanthillium cinereum (L.) H. Rob, Ocimum gratissimum L. and Lippia multiflora Moldenke with respectively 43.84, 39.73 and 34.25% citation frequencies for the last three species respectively. Leguminosae (20.18%), Euphorbiaceae (5.50%) and Apocynaceae (5.50%) were the most represented botanical families. Leafy stems were more used than other plant organs. The decoction and the oral route were the most appropriate methods of preparation and administration reported by traditional healers.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Benin's plant cover is made up of a wide variety of medicinal plant species used in the traditionnal treatment of candidiasis and which may constitute new sources of medicines to be developed.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The dried roots and rhizomes of medicinal licorices are widely used worldwide as a traditional medicinal herb, which are mainly attributed to a variety of bioactive compounds that can be extracted from licorice root. Endophytes and plants form a symbiotic relationship, which is an important source of host secondary metabolites.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing technology and high-performance liquid chromatography to explore the composition and structure of the endophytic bacterial community and the content of bioactive compounds (glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin and total flavonoids) in different species of medicinal licorices (Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Glycyrrhiza glabra, and Glycyrrhiza inflata) and in different planting years (1-3 years). Our results showed that the contents of the bioactive compounds in the roots of medicinal licorices were not affected by the species, but were significantly affected by the main effect growing year (1-3) (P &lt; 0.05), and with a trend of stable increase in the contents observed with each growing year. In 27 samples, a total of 1,979,531 effective sequences were obtained after quality control, and 2432 effective operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained at 97% identity. The phylum Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the genera unified-Rhizobiaceae, Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, and Pantoea were significantly dominant in the 27 samples. Distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) showed that the content of total flavonoids explained the differences in composition and distribution of endophytic bacterial communities in roots of cultivated medicinal liquorices to the greatest extent. Total soil salt was the most important factor that significantly affected the endophytic bacterial community in soil factors, followed by ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen. Among the leaf nutrition factors, leaf water content had the most significant effect on the endophytic bacterial community, followed by total phosphorus and total potassium.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study not only provides information on the composition and distribution of endophytic bacteria in the roots of medicinal licorices, but also reveals the influence of abiotic factors on the community of endophytic bacteria and bioactive compounds, which provides a reference for improving the quality of licorice.">

The work reported herein, therefore, explored the phytochemical composition of this plant and the potential anti-cancer activity of an isolated chemical constituent.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Phytochemical methods (including chromatographic analysis) combined with spectroscopic and spectrometric analyses (IR, HRMS and NMR (1D and 2D)) were used to identify chemical constituents. Cytotoxic effects were determined using the MTT viability assay and bright-field imaging. Induction of oxidative stress was determined using the fluorescence-based 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assay.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;For the first time in the plant, Compound 1 was isolated from the leaf extract and identified as pentagalloylglucose. Compound 1 was significantly cytotoxic against the cancer cell lines HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line) and MRC5-SV2 (human foetal lung cancer cell line), with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 71.45 and 52.24 μg/ml, respectively. The selectivity index (SI) for Compound 1 was 1.61 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; against the normal human foetal lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5 was 84.33μg/ml), demonstrating better cancer cell-selectivity compared to doxorubicin with a SI of 1.28. The cytotoxic activity of Compound 1 in HeLa cells was also rapid, as shown by its concentration- and time-dependent 3 h and 6 h cytotoxicity profiles, an effect not observed with doxorubicin. Generation of reactive oxygen species at high concentrations of pentagalloylglucose to induce oxidative stress in cancer cells was identified as a mechanistic event that led to or resulted from its cytotoxicity.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We suggest that pentagalloylglucose is selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells, and at high concentrations could exhibit pro-oxidant effects in those cells, as opposed to its general anti-oxidant effects in cells. Also, the presence of Compound 1 (pentagalloylglucose) in the plant and its cancer cell-selective cytotoxicity provide some rationale for the ethno-medicinal use of the plant's leaf extract for treating diseases associated with excessive cell proliferation. Further studies are required to dissect the molecular mechanisms and players differentially regulating the biphasic anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant effects of pentagalloylglucose in normal and cancer cells.">

Thrombolytic and anthelmintic activities were evaluated by using human blood serum and by recording paralysis and death time in earthworm, respectively. Cytotoxic activity was investigated in brine shrimp nauplii. Analgesic and antidiarrheal activities were evaluated in Swiss albino mice and neurological effect was evaluated by open field and Elevated plus-maze test (EPM).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;All fractions (n-hexane, carbon tetrachloride and chloroform) possess significant (p&lt;0.05) cytotoxic activity. In case of thrombolytic activity, the highest concentration of methanolic extract produced a remarkable percentage of clot lysis (46.12%). The concentration of 1000 μg/ml produced a significant antibacterial activity against Gram positive &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and Gram negative &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Aqueous fraction at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight, was found to show promising analgesic activity. In case of antidiarrheal and anthelmintic activity, plant extract showed dose-dependent activity. Methanolic extract and its fractions failed to produce any neurological effect in both methods.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The overall results of the study tend to suggest that the methanolic extract and its fractions have promising pharmacological activities.">

Makino. It is characterized by biological functions of hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antiobesity activities. In this research, it was explained that pectolinarin causes apoptosis in PC12 cells conducted by DNA fragmentation and formation on apoptotic bodies through the activation of ER stress sensors (ATF6 fragmentation and eIF2α phosphorylation). The result of treating the PC12 cells with 50 μM pectolinarin for 24 h has come to increase ATF6 mRNA expression up to 1.6 times, PERK expression up to 1.7 times and IRE1 expression up to 1.4 times, respectively, compared to those of the control. ATF6 fragmentation by pectolinarin treatment was increased about 2 times compared with its control, and phosphorylation of eIF2α was increased 2.5 times. The results proposed that the perception of the molecular mechanisms underlying pectolinarin-caused apoptosis may be useful in new natural medicinal products and health supplements for the apoptosis-related diseases.">

This study focused on elucidating the neuroprotective mechanism of methanol leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;Vernonia amygdalina&lt;/i&gt; (MLVA) in nitrobenzene-induced neurodegenerative disease in rats. Thirty aged male rats were sorted into five groups of six rats each. Group A received distilled water while 100 mg/kg bw of nitrobenzene was orally administered to groups (B to E) to induce neurodegeneration. Group B (disease control) was untreated, while Group C and D were treated with oral administration of 200 and 400 mg/kg bw of MLVA respectively and group E with vitamin E for 14 days. Locomotor behaviour was analysed using video-tracking software while the midbrain, cerebrum and cerebellum of the rats were processed for biochemical analyses. Results showed that treatment of nitrobenzene-induced neurodegenerative rats with MLVA significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increase dopamine, GSH, antioxidant enzymes levels; and decrease acetylcholinesterase activity, biomarkers of inflammatory and oxidative stress level. Also, MLVA enhanced neurobehavioural and locomotor activities in all markers assessed. Taken together, neuroprotective mechanisms of MLVA can be linked to its antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase suppression, lipid peroxidation inhibition, anti-inflammatory and neurobehavioural restoring abilities.">

Colebr., which is a Sri Lankan traditional medicine used to relieve inflammation and cold.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; anti-inflammatory activity was tested using carrageenan-induced rat paw-edema model. Mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by investigating the production of nitric oxide (NO), expression of iNOS enzyme, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) by rat peritoneal cells. The membrane stabilizing activity was also tested. The antibody response was determined by assessing the specific haemagglutination antibodies raised against sheep red blood cells.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The three doses of freeze-dried concoction used ((human equivalent dose (HED)-183 mg/kg) 2 × HED and 1/2HED; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 6 rats/group) showed significant inhibition of paw edema compared to water control at 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt;-5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hours (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Both HED and 1/2HED exhibited marked anti-inflammatory activity (72-83% inhibition at 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; hours; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). The HED of the concoction showed significant inhibition of NO (77.5 ± 0.73%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) and ROS production (26.9 ± 2.55%; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) by rat peritoneal cells. Inhibition of NO production in the concoction treated rat peritoneal cells was confirmed by the lack of iNOS expression. The concoction also exhibited significant membrane stabilizing activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0006 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). HED resulted in a significantly high induction of specific antibody production against SRBC antigens as detected by SRBC haemagglutination assay (mean day 14 titers 253.3 compared to control: 66.7) (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The traditional Sri Lankan concoction of &lt;i&gt;C. sativum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. fenestratum&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated potent &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; anti-inflammatory activity, significant reduction of ROS, and NO production by rat peritoneal cells and the lack of iNOS expression confirmed the low NO production. The increased membrane stability also supports the anti-inflammatory activity of the concoction. Further, this concoction induced a significantly high antibody response reflecting its immunostimulatory activity. Together these results scientifically validate the therapeutic use of the concoction of &lt;i&gt;C. sativum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. fenestratum&lt;/i&gt; in Sri Lankan traditional medicinal system for immunomodulatory effects.">

        <span class="abst" title="The purpose of this study was to gather ethnopharmacological information on plants used by the pastorals of southeastern Iran. The relationships between ecological value of the plant species and ethnobotanical indices were investigated. The loss of medicinal plants and its effective factors were also determined under nomadism and sedentary pastoralism. Ethnopharmacological information of plants was collected through interviews with 85 local people including nomads (43%) and sedentary pastorals (57%). Ethnobotanical indices including relative frequency of citation (RFC), relative importance (RI), cultural value (CV), and use value (UV) were estimated. Canopy cover and density of plant species were measured at 60 sampling plots in the exclosure, nomadic rangelands and sedentary pastorals rangelands. The Importance Value Index (IVI) and Relative Loss Index (RL) were estimated for both nomadic and sedentary pastoral rangelands. Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship between ethnobotanical indices and IVI of plant species. The Bayesian networks was used to investigate the relationship between ethnobotanical indices and plant species loss. In total, 156 medicinal plant species of 50 families were identified in the region by locals. Positive correlation was observed between ethnobotanical indices (RFC and RI) and ecological index (IVI). The mean decline of the ecological importance of medicinal species in sedentary pastoral rangelands was approximately three times higher than in nomadic rangelands. Bayesian networks showed that cultural value, seed exploitation and aerial parts exploitation had direct relationships with species loss in both nomadic and sedentary pastoral rangelands. Bunium persicum, an ecologically and socially important species, had been extensively harvested (more than 60%) in the both nomadic and sedentary pastoral rangelands, making it a priority species in future conservation programs. Medicinal plants had high ecological value and were severely exploited, threatening sustainability of arid and semiarid ecosystems. Local pastorals not only use medicinal plants as herbal remedies but also consider them as a source of income. Popular plants with multiple medicinal uses were more susceptible to loss. Higher medicinal knowledge of pastorals did not help to mitigate medicinal plant loss, requesting new plans to aware them to the circumstances that often leads to species removal from community. Given the importance, abundance and widespread use of medicinal plants, further studies can provide a basis for their conservation and for identifying new therapeutic effects of plants in the region.">

Total phenolics content was measured according to Folin-Ciocalteu's method and total flavonoid content was estimated by using Aluminium chloride colorimetric method.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The results showed that the total phenolic content was highest in both methanol (720 ± 0.04 mg GAE/100 g extract DW) and aqueous (580 ± 0.08 mg GAE/100 g DW) extracts of &lt;i&gt;L. adoensis&lt;/i&gt;. Among the five tested spices, the methanol and aqueous extracts of &lt;i&gt;L. adoensis&lt;/i&gt; exerted the strongest DPPH radical quenching activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;values of 49.17 ± 1.26 and 20.99 ± 8.6 μg/mL, respectively. Both methanol and aqueous extracts of &lt;i&gt;L. adoensis&lt;/i&gt; showed notable reducing capacity. The highest RNS scavenging activity was shown by both methanol (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 597.21 ± 6.99 μg/mL) and aqueous (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 551.5 ± 28.9 μg/mL) extracts of &lt;i&gt;L. adoensis&lt;/i&gt;. High to moderate positive correlations were observed between total phenolic contents and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant assays. This indicates that the antioxidant activities of the tested spices are attributed to the phenolic contents.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The results of the present work revealed that the tested spices demonstrated high phenolic contents and antioxidant properties. Thus, these spices are worth considering as important sources of natural antioxidant agents.">

Physicochemical properties were carried out by using Association of Official Analytical Chemist methods; thin layer chromatography was carried out according to the Stahl method. Larvicidal activity and LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; were studied against the third instar of &lt;i&gt;Culex quinquefasciatus&lt;/i&gt; mosquito larvae to detect and extract toxicity. The ethanolic extracts of the roots were orally tested at the dose 200 mg/kg for the hypoglycemic effect on induced hyperglycemia in normal rats, assessed in the ethanol extract, and were compared with diabetic control and standards glibenclamide 10 mg/kg. Physiochemical parameters showed high rate in the nitrogen-free extract (69.6%), curd fiber (14.5%), crude proteins (8.15%), ether extract (3.75%), and both ash and moisture (2%), and high concentrations values were found in potassium (43 mg/l) followed by phosphorous (28.5 mg/l), calcium (15 mg/l), sodium (3.65 mg/l), and magnesium (0.145 mg/l). In this part, phytochemical compounds showed high amount of alkaloids, triterpene, flavonoids, tannins, sugars, and few amount of anthraquinone glycosides. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) studies different colored phytochemical constituted with different Rf values. All the spots are colored under UV light, but some are localized colorless after spaying. The ethyl acetate (EtAc) extract showed eight spots, and the methanol (MeOH) extract showed thirteen spots. The larvicidal activity showed that the ethyl acetate extract was safe against mosquito larvae with an LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value 1412.54 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05), and the methanol extract had moderate larvicidal activity against mosquito larvae with an LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value 257.54 (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05), while the ethanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Senna occidentalis&lt;/i&gt; (L.) causes a favorable hypoglycemic activity when compared to control significant reduction by [53.15%, 32.87%, and 20.94%], respectively, as well as standard glibenclamide. Based on the various data of the physicochemical parameters, TLC spots, and phytochemical compounds of &lt;i&gt;Senna occidentalis&lt;/i&gt; root, they could be used as references standards for manufacturing units of &lt;i&gt;Senna occidentalis&lt;/i&gt; root larvicidal and antidiabetic drugs.">

This study was conducted to assess the antimalarial activity of a traditionally used medicinal plant, &lt;i&gt;Leonotis ocymifolia,&lt;/i&gt; against &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium berghei&lt;/i&gt;. The plant has been extracted using maceration technique, and doses ranging from 100-800 mg/kg of &lt;i&gt;Leonotis ocymifolia&lt;/i&gt; were used to test its antimalarial activity. Tween 80 (2% in water) and chloroquine 25 mg/kg were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. The antimalarial activities of the plant were determined by measuring parasitemia, survival time, packed cell volume, temperature, and weight. The plant's hydroalcoholic extract, as compared to negative control, maximally decreased parasite load by 41.4% at 800 mg/kg (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). This parasite suppression was followed by longer survival time in the groups taking 400 mg/kg (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) and 800 mg/kg (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) in a four-day suppressive test and in those taking 800 mg/kg (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) in Rane's test. The plant did not prevent weight and PCV reduction but prevented temperature reduction at 400 mg/kg (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) and 800 mg/kg (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) in a four-day suppressive model, and at 800 mg/kg (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) in Rane's model. The average but consistent antimalarial activity of the plant across the test models corroborates the folkloric antimalarial use of the plant. The study recommends further pharmacological screenings, isolation, and identification of active compound(s) of the plant &lt;i&gt;Leonotis ocymifolia&lt;/i&gt;.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Thymus leptobotrys&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family, endemic in Morocco, and used in traditional medicine. The present work aims to study the phenolic compounds, the antioxidant activity, the anti-inflammatory effect, and the toxicity of two ethanolic and methanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;Thymus leptobotrys&lt;/i&gt; aerial part. The yield of the methanolic extraction (22.2%) is higher than that of the ethanolic extraction (15.8%) and is characterized by higher contents of polyphenols 243.08 mg/g GAE (mg/g of gallic acid), flavonoids 179.28 mg/g RE (mg/g of rutin), and tannins 39.31 mg/g CE (mg/g of catechin). The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; measurement of antioxidant activity with the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical reduction test and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) test demonstrates the higher performance of the methanolic extract. The evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effect &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; on adult Wistar female rats leads to a very significant decrease in the inflammation of the edema compared to the standard drug (indomethacin) and the control group. The toxicity test reveals that both extracts showed no toxicity within an LD50 above 2000 mg/kg body weight of the rats.">

We assessed the effects of the aqueous extract of its stem bark on the development of hypertension in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The animals were administered L-NAME once daily for 3 weeks (25 mg/kg, i.p.), concomitantly with aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;A. digitata&lt;/i&gt; stem bark (100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) or captopril (20 mg/kg, p.o.). Then, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic parameters, oxidative stress markers, and the lipid profile were assessed in the blood and heart, aorta, and kidney homogenates, and histopathological analyses were performed.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;L-NAME-induced hypertensive control animals, but not the animals concomitantly treated with &lt;i&gt;A. digitata&lt;/i&gt; extract, displayed increases in the mean arterial blood pressure (21.64% difference, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001, vs. dose 200 mg/kg), systolic arterial blood pressure (21.33%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001), and the diastolic arterial blood pressure (21.84%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). In addition, hypertensive control animals displayed (i) increases in serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, and creatinine levels, malondialdehyde and transaminase activities, and atherogenic index; (ii) decreases in serum HDL, catalase, reduced glutathione, and nitric oxide; and (iii) aorta wall thickening, inflammatory cell infiltration, and cell loss in the cardiac muscle and renal tissues. As captopril, the extract prevented hypertension-like changes in lipid profile, cardiac, hepatic, and renal affection indicators, and oxidative stress markers.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings suggest that the extract of &lt;i&gt;A. digitata&lt;/i&gt; has antihypertensive and antioxidant effects in L-NAME-induced hypertension rat models. These effects partly justify the traditional medicine use against cardiovascular disorders.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Pelargonium sidoides is an important traditional medicine in South Africa with a well-defined history of both traditional and documented use of an aqueous-ethanolic formulation of the roots of P. sidoides (EPs 7630), which is successfully employed for the treatment of respiratory tract infections. There is also historical evidence of use in the treatment of tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to develop a platform of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) kinase enzymes that may be used for the identification of therapeutically relevant ethnobotanical extracts that will allow drug target identification, as well as the subsequent isolation of the active compounds.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Mtb kinases, Nucleoside diphosphokinase, Homoserine kinase, Acetate kinase, Glycerol kinase, Thiamine monophosphate kinase, Ribokinase, Aspartokinase and Shikimate kinase were cloned, produced in Escherichia coli and characterized. HPLC-based assays were used to determine the enzyme activities and subsequently the inhibitory potentials of varying concentrations of a P. sidoides extract against the produced enzymes. The enzyme activity assays indicated that these enzymes were active at low ATP concentrations. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of an aqueous root extract of P. sidoides against the kinases indicated SK has an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.2 μg/ml and GK 1.4 μg/ml. These enzyme targets were further assessed for compound identification from the P. sidoides literature.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study suggests P. sidoides is potentially a source of anti-tubercular compounds and the Mtb kinase platform has significant potential as a tool for the subsequent screening of P. sidoides extracts and plant extracts in general, for compound identification and elaboration by selected extract target inhibitor profiling.">

A checklist questionnaire was completed by 120, 18 to 35-year-old, college students. And then, 84 eligible women (20 to 35 years old) were enrolled in the trial; they were randomly assigned to two groups of intervention (EA) and control (placebo), with 42 participants in each group. Participants in the intervention group received 450 mg capsules of EA per day (three times a day) from the 21st day of their menstrual cycle until the 3rd day of their next cycle for two consecutive cycles. The severity of PMS was measured and ranked using the premenstrual symptoms screening tool (PSST). The generalized estimating equation was used to compare the total score of the severity of PMS between the two groups.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Sixty-nine women with regular menstrual cycles suffering from PMS completed the study. The mean scores of the symptoms in the EA group were 35.3 and 16.1 (P ≤ 0.001) at baseline and after 2 months, respectively, while the mean scores of the symptoms in the placebo group were 31.0 and 28.3 (P = 0.09) at baseline and after 2 months, respectively. The evaluation of the first and the second follow-ups in the intervention group showed that, after being adjusted for age and body mass index (P ≤ 0.001), the mean scores of the premenstrual syndrome, using GEE analysis, have decreased to 6.2 and 11.6, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Based on the results, in comparison with the placebo group, EA was found to be more effective in improving the symptoms of PMS, and is highly recommended for treatment of this syndrome.&lt;h4&gt;Trial registration&lt;/h4&gt;IRCT2015110822779N3 ; Registration date: 2015-11-27.">

        <span class="abst" title="Despite the success of antibiotic discovery, infectious diseases remain the second leading source of death worldwide, while the resistance to antibiotics is among the significant problems in the twenty-first century. Medicinal plants are very rich in phytochemicals which can be structurally optimized and processed into new drugs. Nigeria enjoys a diverse collection of medicinal plants, and joint research has ascertained the efficacy of these plants. Plants such as guava (&lt;i&gt;Psidium guajava&lt;/i&gt;), ginger (&lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt;), neem (&lt;i&gt;Azadirachta indica&lt;/i&gt;), and moringa (&lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt;) have been found to exhibit broad range of antimicrobial activities. Studies on Nigerian plants have shown that they contain alkaloids, polyphenols, terpenes, glycosides, and others with possible therapeutic potentials. The antimicrobial activities of some new compounds such as alloeudesmenol, hanocokinoside, orosunol, and 8-demethylorosunol, identified from medicinal plants in Nigeria, are not yet explored. Further investigation and optimization of these compounds will facilitate the development of new sets of pharmacologically acceptable antimicrobial agents. This review study revealed the efficacy of medicinal plants as an alternative therapy in combating and curtailing the development and survival of multidrug-resistant pathogens coupled with the toxic effects of some antibiotics. Due to enormous therapeutic possibilities buried in medicinal plants, there is a need for more research into unique fingerprints and novel compounds that can provide cure to the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) of humans and animals facing Africa, especially Nigeria.">

Parasite load, packed cell volume (PCV), body weight, and rectal temperature in Swiss albino mice were assessed. This finding is part of the outcomes of drug discovery research for neglected tropical diseases. The extract arrested the motility of trypanosomes within 40 min at 4 and 2 mg/mL concentration, whereas in the untreated control, motility continued for more than 160 min. The extract also reduced parasitemia and prevented drop in PCV and body weight significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05), as compared to control. Phytochemical analysis showed the presence of flavonoids, triterpenes, steroids, saponins, glycosides, tannins, and alkaloids. It is observed that this extract has activity against the parasite. Isolation and purification of specific compounds are required to identify hit compounds responsible for the antitrypanosomal activity of the studied medicinal plant.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Mountain environments are fragile socio-ecological systems and the conservation of their biological and cultural diversities- seen as co-evolving, strongly intertwined entities-represents a crucial issue for fostering their sustainability. Very few ethnobiological studies have assessed in the mountainous regions of Europe how local botanical knowledge, which represents a vital portion of the local environmental knowledge (LEK), changes over time, although this may be quintessential for a better understanding of the factors influencing how knowledge and practices are shaped, eroded, or even re-created.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In the current study, we compared the gathering and use of local medicinal plants in the Upper Sangone Valley, Western Italian Alps, Piedmont (NW Italy) as described in a field study conducted in the mid-seventies and published in 1977 and those arising from field research that we conducted in the spring of 2015 and 2018, during which time ethnobotanical and ethnomycological information concerning both folk medicinal and wild food uses was obtained via 47 in-depth open and semi-structured interviews with community members.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In total, one hundred thirty folk taxa represent the past and present medicinal and wild food plant/mushroom heritage of the Sangone Valley: 26 herbal taxa were recorded 40 years ago only; 68 herbal and wild food taxa have been recorded in the current study only; and 36 herbal taxa have been continuously used during the last 40 years. There were no remarkable quantitative differences between the two diachronic medico-ethnobotanical datasets, but the qualitative differences were substantial. The gathering and use of some medicinal plants growing in meadows, forests and higher mountain environments (i.e. Arctostaphylos, Filipendula, Hepatica, Larix, Laserptium, Picea, Polygonatum, Primula, Tussilago and Veronica spp.) disappeared, whereas the collection of plant genera growing in more anthropogenic environments or possibly promoted via popular books and media has been newly introduced (i.e. Aloysia, Apium, Brassica, Crataegus, Epilobium, Fumaria, Geranium, Juniperus, Melissa, Rubus, Rumex, Sedum, Silybum, Taraxacum and Vaccinium spp.).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The findings show a renegotiation of the situativity that for centuries forged the embeddedness of local communities in their natural environments, probably heavily informed in the past by prevalent pastoralist and forest-centred activities and thus by a deeper knowledge of higher mountain and forest environments. The re-arrangement of a more domestic and more &quot;globalized&quot; herbal knowledge system was possibly inspired by new urban residents, who started to populate the valley at the end of the Seventies, when the original inhabitants abandoned their homes for the urban centres of the Piedmontese plain. The current study suggests that future directions of ethnobiological research should more carefully look at the adaptive capacity of LEK systems.">

Presently, treatment of these diseases is not effective and encounters many challenges due to the cost of drug and side effects. Thus, the search for the alternative agents to replace synthetic drugs is in high demand. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the anticholinesterase properties of &lt;i&gt;Ginkgo biloba&lt;/i&gt; seed.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The seed was extracted with 80% methanol. Toxicity studies and evaluation of anticholinesterase activities were carried out in adult Javanese medaka (&lt;i&gt;Oryzias javanicus&lt;/i&gt;). Phytochemical study to identify the bioactive lead constituents of the crude extract was also carried out using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The result shows activities with high significant differences at &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001 between the treated and nontreated groups. A bioactive compound (vitaxin) was identified with the aid of HPLC method.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The presence of bioactive compound vitaxin is among the major secondary metabolites that contribute to increasing activities of this plant extract. High anticholinesterase activities and low toxicity effect of this plant show its benefit to be used as natural medicine or supplements.">

The most active extract against chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) and chloroquine-resistant (Dd2) &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; strains is the &lt;i&gt;A. hispidum&lt;/i&gt; extract which yielded a mean inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 3.66 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml and 3.71 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml for 3D7 and Dd2, respectively.

For the &lt;i&gt;M. lucida Benth&lt;/i&gt; extract, the least IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value was 6.46 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. All five extracts exhibited dose-dependent antiplasmodial activity. Assessment of the genotoxic effects the &lt;i&gt;A. hispidum&lt;/i&gt; extract by the comet assay revealed substantial damage to &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; DNA.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study demonstrates that the crude extract of &lt;i&gt;A. hispidum&lt;/i&gt; DC, one of the plants used traditionally to treat malaria, inhibits the growth of P. falciparum &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and could be a potential source of antimalarial drug.

In the current study, we investigated three &lt;i&gt;Apiaceae&lt;/i&gt; herbs known as coriander (&lt;i&gt;Coriandrum sativum&lt;/i&gt;), celery (&lt;i&gt;Apium graveolens&lt;/i&gt;), and parsley (&lt;i&gt;Petroselinum crispum&lt;/i&gt;) for their antioxidant, antiperoxidative, and antihemolytic properties. The HPLC-DAD has been used to classify and measure phenolic compounds. The major phenolic compounds studied were p-coumaric, chlorogenic, caffeic acids, luteolin, and quercetin. The polyphenol level was also estimated via Folin-Ciocalteu's method, aluminium chloride, and acidified vanillin. Parsley showed the highest polyphenol level and, thus, showed potential antioxidant activities demonstrated by DPPH, ABTS scavenging tests, and reducing power (FRAP), as well as TBARS assays. Very strong correlations were depicted among phenol levels and antioxidant assays (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ 0.910) and among antihemolytic activity and flavonoids (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ 0.927), indicating the implication of phenolic compounds, mainly flavonoids, in the antiradical properties. These finding may prove the traditional use of these &lt;i&gt;Apiaceae&lt;/i&gt; species in the management of numerous disorders cited within the Moroccan pharmacopoeia.">

        <span class="abst" title="Current scenario depicts that world has been clenched by COVID-19 pandemic. Inevitably, public health and safety measures could be undertaken in order to dwindle the infection threat and mortality. Moreover, to overcome the global menace and drawing out world from moribund stage, there is an exigency for social distancing and quarantines. Since December, 2019, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) have came into existence and up till now world is still in the state of shock.At this point of time, COVID-19 has entered perilous phase, creating havoc among individuals, and this has been directly implied due to enhanced globalisation and ability of the virus to acclimatize at all conditions. The unabated transmission is due to lack of drugs, vaccines and therapeutics against this viral outbreak. But research is still underway to formulate the vaccines or drugs by this means, as scientific communities are continuously working to unravel the pharmacologically active compounds that might offer a new insight for curbing infections and pandemics. Therefore, the topical COVID-19 situation highlights an immediate need for effective therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Towards this effort, the present review discusses the vital concepts related to COVID-19, in terms of its origin, transmission, clinical aspects and diagnosis. However, here, we have formulated the novel concept hitherto, ancient means of traditional medicines or herbal plants to beat this pandemic.">

        <span class="abst" title="Radiotherapy using ionizing radiation is a major therapeutic modality for advanced human lung cancers. However, ionizing radiation itself can induce malignant behaviors such as cancer cell migration and invasion, leading to local recurrence or distal metastasis. Therefore, safer and more effective agents that inhibit the metastatic behaviors of cancer cells in radiotherapy are needed. As a part of our ongoing search for new radiotherapy enhancers from medicinal herbs, we isolated the following triterpenoids from the ethanol extract of C&lt;i&gt;entella asiatica&lt;/i&gt;: asiatic acid (1), madecassic acid (2), and asiaticoside (3). These compounds inhibited the ionizing radiation-induced migration and invasion of A549 human lung cancer cells at noncytotoxic concentrations. These results suggest that triterpenoids 1-3 isolated from &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;asiatica&lt;/i&gt; are candidate natural compounds to enhance the effect of radiotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Premna serratifolia&lt;/i&gt;, commonly known as Arogo in Tentena-Sulawesi, is a popular vegetable. As a promising herbal tea and food ingredient, further investigation is required to find the best knowledge for medicinal use of &lt;i&gt;P. serratifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaves. This research investigated the antioxidant activity of the ethanol (EEPS) and water (WEPS) extracts of &lt;i&gt;P. serratifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaves, based on their scavenging activities on DPPH radicals and their reducing capacities (CuPRAC, total antioxidant/phosphomolybdenum, and ferric thiocyanate reducing power assays). The DNA-protecting effect by EEPS was tested using pBR322 plasmid DNA against •OH radical-induced damage. The inhibition potentials of both extracts against several enzymes related to metabolic diseases (&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase, &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase, xanthine oxidase, and protease) were evaluated. The phytochemical analysis was conducted by an LC-QTOF-MS/MS technique. EEPS proved to be a better antioxidant and had higher phenolic content compared to WEPS. EEPS demonstrated a protective effect on DNA with recovery percentage linearly correlated with EEPS concentrations. Strong inhibition on &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase was observed for EEPS; however, EEPS and WEPS showed weak inhibitions on xanthine oxidase and protease. LC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis identified seven main components in EEPS, namely scroside E, forsythoside A and forsythoside B, lavandulifolioside, diosmin, nobilin D, campneoside I, and isoacteoside. These components may be responsible for the observed enzymes inhibitions and antioxidant properties. &lt;i&gt;Premna serratifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaves can be an appropriate choice for the development of nutraceutical and drug preparations.">

        <span class="abst" title="Amomum nilgiricum is one of the plant species reported from Western Ghats of India, belonging to the family Zingiberaceae, with ethno-botanical values, and is well-known for their ethno medicinal applications. In the present investigation, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of A. nilgiricum were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the important functional groups and phytochemical constituents. The FTIR spectra revealed the occurrence of functional characteristic peaks of aromatic amines, carboxylic acids, ketones, phenols and alkyl halides group from leaf and rhizome extracts. The GC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from leaves, and methanol extract from rhizomes of A. nilgiricum detected the presence of 25 phytochemical compounds. Further, the leaf and rhizome extracts of A. nilgiricum showed remarkable antibacterial and antifungal activities at 100 mg/mL. The results of DPPH and ferric reducing antioxidant power assay recorded maximum antioxidant activity in A. nilgiricum methanolic leaf extract. While, ethyl acetate leaf extract exhibited maximum α-amylase inhibition activity, followed by methanolic leaf extract exhibiting aldose reductase inhibition. Subsequently, these 25 identified compounds were analyzed for their bioactivity through in silico molecular docking studies. Results revealed that among the phytochemical compounds identified, serverogenin acetate might have maximum antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and antidiabetic properties followed by 2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane and (1,3-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)propanedioic acid. To our best knowledge, this is the first description on the phytochemical constituents of the leaves and rhizomes of A. nilgiricum, which show pharmacological significance, as there has been no literature available yet on GC-MS and phytochemical studies of this plant species. The in silico molecular docking of serverogenin acetate was also performed to confirm its broad spectrum activities based on the binding interactions with the antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and antidiabetic target proteins. The results of the present study will create a way for the invention of herbal medicines for several ailments by using A. nilgiricum plants, which may lead to the development of novel drugs.">

However, the plant has not been scientifically evaluated for its traditionally claimed use. The present study aimed at the investigation of analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of 80% methanol root extract of &lt;i&gt;Echinops kebericho&lt;/i&gt; M. in mice model.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Successive maceration was used as a method of extraction using solvents of increasing polarity: methanol and water. After extraction of the roots with 80% hydro methanol, the crude extract was evaluated for its peripheral and central analgesic activities using acetic acid-induced writhing test and hot plate method, respectively, while its anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using carrageenan- and formalin-induced paw edema. The extract was evaluated at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg doses. The positive control groups were treated with ASA 150 mg/kg for writhing test, morphine 10 mg/kg for hot plat method, indomethacin 25 mg/kg and diclofenac 10 mg/kg for paw edema tests and vehicle, distilled water (10 mL/kg) treated mice were assigned as negative controls. All treatment administrations were performed orally.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;E. kebericho extract at all test doses showed statistically significant antinociceptive activity in both chemicals-induced peripheral and thermal-induced central pain in a dose dependent manner (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001). The greater analgesic activity was observed by the maximum dose of the extract (400 mg/kg) in both acetic acids-induced writhing test (57.84%) and hot plate method (69.40%). The effect of the extract was also statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001) in both carrageenan and formalin-induced paw edema in dose dependent manner. Greater edema inhibition was observed by the highest dose (400 mg/kg) in both observations with the respective percentage values of 70.00% and 79.87%, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;In general, the data obtained from the present study elucidated that the extract possessed a significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities and recommended for further studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; Involving patients' representatives in the research and development of medicinal products (medicines R&amp;D) leads to better medical treatment. In 2014, the European Patients' Academy on Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI) was started with the goal of increasing the capacity and capabilities of patient representatives in this field. To make this academy more accessible and applicable for the Netherlands, a Dutch version was launched in September 2019. To explore the options for a durable infrastructure for organizing the Dutch EUPATI course, a multi-stakeholder qualitative study was done. The views of various stakeholders from pharmaceutical industry, governmental organizations, patient organizations, and the academic world were examined about the benefits and challenges of this course for patient involvement in medicines R&amp;D. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; From April to June 2019, 10 semi-structured interviews were completed, each with two representatives of all stakeholders involved. In addition, individual Dutch graduates of the European EUPATI (EUPATI fellows) were consulted &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; an e-mail questionnaire. Using a directed content analysis based on the Business Canvas Model, the transcribed interviews were coded, analyzed, and final attributes consolidated. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; The semi-structured interviews and completed questionnaires explored how the stakeholders are aiming to assist patient involvement in medicines R&amp;D through the Dutch EUPATI course. The building blocks of the Business Canvas Model were described with concrete attributes for making the business case. Stakeholders stated that the Dutch EUPATI course was an incentive for patient involvement in medicines development, for patient-oriented research and outcomes, for the availability of patient representatives (expert ones in particular), and for the content and representation quality of patient representatives. The key values for collaborating in the network as mentioned by the stakeholders were neutrality, patients' interests, equality, independence, shared objectives, long-term commitment, transparency, understanding, trust, and respect. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Patient involvement in medicines R&amp;D is evolving and the demand for qualified patient representatives is growing. Dutch stakeholders confirmed the added value of the patients' academy and expressed their willingness to contribute. Important values and conditions for long term collaboration were formulated.">

Cham. and Schltdl (Apiaceae) is widely used traditionally for the treatment of a wide range of diseases in Southern and Eastern Africa. Although previous studies have reported the biological activities of hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;H. arborescens&lt;/i&gt; leaves, there is no scientific information on the phytochemical contents, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of acetone, ethanol, aqueous and blanched extracts. This study is therefore aimed to investigate and compare the phytochemical contents, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of acetone, ethanol, aqueous and blanched extracts of &lt;i&gt;H. arborescens&lt;/i&gt; leaves. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Phytochemical analysis for the total phenolic, flavonoid, proanthocyanidin, alkaloid and saponin contents of all the fractions were determined by spectroscopic methods, while the free radical scavenging potential of the extracts were evaluated using DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging and total antioxidant capacity assays. Micro dilution method was used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC) of &lt;i&gt;H. arborescens&lt;/i&gt; leaf extracts against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Total phenol content of the extracts ranged between 15.10 mg GAE/g- 42.50 mg GAE/g, proanthocyanidin was 459-8402.1 mg QE/g, and flavonoid content of 109.24-235.79 mg QE/g. In addition, alkaloids (5.59%) and saponins (23.33%) were present in significant amounts. Based on the IC &lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values, the ethanol extract exhibited the highest total antioxidant activity (0.013 mg/mL) with highest inhibition against DPPH and ABTS radicals (0.06 and 0.049 mg/mL respectively). Considerable antibacterial activities were observed in the acetone, ethanol and blanched extracts with MIC values ranging from 1.563-12.5 mg/mL; however, the aqueous extract was inactive against all the bacteria strains. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;: The study suggests that &lt;i&gt;H. arborescens&lt;/i&gt; leaves could be a valuable source of bioactive compounds. Although the blanching process significantly decreased polyphenolic contents and antioxidant activities of the extracts, it increased the antibacterial compounds.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to be a pandemic infection, important severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) non-structural proteins (nsp) have been analysed as promising targets in virtual screening approaches. Among these proteins, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), also named main protease, and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), have been identified as fundamental targets due to its importance in the viral replication stages.&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;To investigate, in silico, two of the most abundant flavonoid glycosides from Dysphania ambrosioides; a medicinal plant found in many regions of the world, along with some of the putative derivatives of these flavonoid glycosides in the human organism as potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Using a molecular docking approach, the interactions and the binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp were predicted for quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (nicotiflorin) and some of their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives.&lt;h4&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;Docking analysis, based on the crystal structure of 3CLpro and RdRp, indicated rutin, nicotiflorin, and their glucuronide and sulfate derivatives as potential inhibitors for both proteins. Also, the importance of the hydrogen bond and π-based interactions was evidenced for the presumed active sites.&lt;h4&gt;Main conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Overall, these results suggest that both flavonoid glycosides and their putative human metabolites can play a key role as inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro and RdRp. Obviously, further researches, mainly in vitro and in vivo experiments, are necessary to certify the docking results reported here, as well as the adequate application of these substances. Furthermore, it is necessary to investigate the risks of D. ambrosioides as a phytomedicine for use against COVID-19.">

Medical herbs have been of a high importance for this purpose. The genus &lt;i&gt;Dorema&lt;/i&gt;, of Apiaceae family (Umbelliferae) has a wide use in ethnobotany and traditional medicine around the world. It has been used as a treatment for CNS disease, convulsion, upper respiratory tract problems, gastrointestinal disorder and high blood sugar. Furthermore, phytochemical investigations have reported &lt;i&gt;Dorema&lt;/i&gt; species to contain a wide range of constituents including terpenes, coumarins and phenolic compounds.

The endophytic isolates were identified by 16S rRNA sequence and investigated for antibiotic sensitivity using different antibiotics. The secondary metabolites were evaluated for antibacterial activity against four bacterial strains. The 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2'-azinobis (3- ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) methods were used to assess their scavenging activities. The chemical components were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Out of 13 isolates, Isolate 1 was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa CP043328.1. It was resistant to clindamycin, ertapenem, penicillin G, amoxicillin, cephalothin and kanamycin but sensitive to imipenem, meropenem, and gentamycin. Its extract demonstrated antibacterial activity with minimum inhibitory concentration value of 0.098 against Bacillus cereus (ATCC 10102) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25925) and 0.391 mg/ml against Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The extract revealed DPPH and ABTS scavenging activities with half maximal inhibitory concentration value of 0.650 mg/ml and 0.15 mg/ml, respectively. The GC-MS revealed a total of 15 compounds with diisooctyl phthalate (50.51%) and [1, 2, 4] oxadiazole, 5-benzyl-3 (10.44%) as major components.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;P. aeruginosa CP043328.1 produced secondary metabolites with antibacterial and antioxidant activities.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Andrographis paniculata&lt;/i&gt; (family: Acanthaceae) is a medicinal herb-used in Indian system of medicine (Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani), traditional and folk systems to treat various illnesses. This study examined the phytochemical constituents of ethanol extract from &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt; and its protective effect against genotoxicity caused by cyclophosphamide (CPA). Phytochemical screening and estimation of total phenolic content were analyzed using standard methods. The bioactive components from the ethanol extract of &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt; (EAP) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To investigate the protective effect of EAP against CPA-induced genotoxicity, human peripheral lymphocyte cultures were used. To test the antigenotoxic and antimutagenic effects of EAP, lymphocytes were treated with different concentrations of extract (50∼250 mg/mL) alone and co-treated along with CPA+EAP for 48 h. The cells were analyzed for structural chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in control, CPA treated, and CPA+ EAP co-treated lymphocytes. Results of the study revealed that the lymphocyte cultures which had 48 h continuous exposure to EAP (50∼250 mg/mL) did not show any significant changes in CAs and SCE frequencies. These results substanti-ate the antimutagenic nature of the extract. Furthermore, the lymphocytes co-treated with CPA along with extract showed a significant reduction in CAs (reduced from 26.50±2.50% to 11.00±1.00%) and SCEs (reduced from 9.92±0.63 per cell to 4.56±0.18 per cell). These results suggest that &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt; is protective against CPA induced genotoxicity and put forward its possible use as a supplement with chemotherapeutic drugs.">

They may however contain phytochemicals that have potent bioactivities. In this study, the phenolic content, and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of oil and non-oil (solid) extracts of &lt;i&gt;C. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; seeds were evaluated using standard protocols. The seed oil contained significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05) higher contents of total phenol and total flavonoid when compared to the solid extract. However, the non-oil extract contained significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05) higher tannin contents than the seed oil. Ferric reducing antioxidant potential was not significantly different between both extracts. The antimicrobial activities of both extracts revealed that the seed oil possesses better antibacterial activities compared to the non-oil extract. The antifungal test revealed that the seed oil significantly inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; (20 mm zone of inhibition at a concentration of 200 μg/mL), however, it did not inhibit the growth of &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Penicillum&lt;/i&gt; sp. The minimum inhibitory concentration values against the bacterial and fungal strains were similar for both extracts in the range of 50∼100 μg/mL. Minimum bactericidal concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration values ranged from 100∼200 μg/mL for both extracts. The results in this study indicate that &lt;i&gt;C. sinensis&lt;/i&gt; seed oil and non-oil extracts possess antioxidant, and antibacterial and antifungal properties that may be differentially exploited in the development of antimicrobial agents.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Current recommendations for the self-management of SARS-Cov-2 disease (COVID-19) include self-isolation, rest, hydration, and the use of NSAID in case of high fever only. It is expected that many patients will add other symptomatic/adjuvant treatments, such as herbal medicines.&lt;h4&gt;Aims&lt;/h4&gt;To provide a benefits/risks assessment of selected herbal medicines traditionally indicated for &quot;respiratory diseases&quot; within the current frame of the COVID-19 pandemic as an adjuvant treatment.&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;The plant selection was primarily based on species listed by the WHO and EMA, but some other herbal remedies were considered due to their widespread use in respiratory conditions. Preclinical and clinical data on their efficacy and safety were collected from authoritative sources. The target population were adults with early and mild flu symptoms without underlying conditions. These were evaluated according to a modified PrOACT-URL method with paracetamol, ibuprofen, and codeine as reference drugs. The benefits/risks balance of the treatments was classified as &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;promising&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;negative&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;unknown&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 39 herbal medicines were identified as very likely to appeal to the COVID-19 patient. According to our method, the benefits/risks assessment of the herbal medicines was found to be positive in 5 cases (&lt;i&gt;Althaea officinalis, Commiphora molmol, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Hedera helix&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Sambucus nigra&lt;/i&gt;), promising in 12 cases (&lt;i&gt;Allium sativum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Andrographis paniculata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea purpurea, Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/i&gt; essential oil&lt;i&gt;, Justicia pectoralis, Magnolia officinalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mikania glomerata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pelargonium sidoides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pimpinella anisum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Salix&lt;/i&gt; sp, &lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt;), and unknown for the rest. On the same grounds, only ibuprofen resulted promising, but we could not find compelling evidence to endorse the use of paracetamol and/or codeine.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Our work suggests that several herbal medicines have safety margins superior to those of reference drugs and enough levels of evidence to start a clinical discussion about their potential use as adjuvants in the treatment of early/mild common flu in otherwise healthy adults within the context of COVID-19. While these herbal medicines will not cure or prevent the flu, they may both improve general patient well-being and offer them an opportunity to personalize the therapeutic approaches.">

This study was planned to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of urinile (a herbal drug) for the treatment of gouty arthritis. Allopurinol was used as standard drug (positive control). The study population of 250 volunteers (gouty arthritis patients) were divided into 2 groups as test and control group (n = 125 each). Gouty arthritis patients in test and control group were treated with 300 mg each of urinile and allopurinol, respectively. Clinical symptoms of all the study volunteers were recorded and serum uric acid was determined. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in serum uric acid level toward normal was found in test group individuals. Clinical symptoms of gouty arthritis patients were also improved in test group compared to control group. Results showed that urinile has the potential to decrease serum uric acid level in gouty arthritis patients probably because of its antioxidant potential and xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity. It can be concluded that the tested herbal drug urinile is more potent in treating gouty arthritis patients and can be used as an effective alternative to the most commonly used allopathic drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Human subsistence societies have thrived in environmental extremes while maintaining biodiversity through social learning of ecological knowledge, such as techniques to prepare food and medicine from local resources. However, there is limited understanding of which processes shape social learning patterns and configuration in ecological knowledge networks, or how these processes apply to resource management and biological conservation. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the prestige (rarity or exclusivity) of knowledge shapes social learning networks. In addition, we test whether people tend to select who to learn from based on prestige (knowledge or reputation), and homophily (e.g., people of the same age or gender). We used interviews to assess five types of medicinal plant knowledge and how 303 people share this knowledge across four villages in Solomon Islands. We developed exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to test whether hypothesized patterns of knowledge sharing based on prestige and homophily are more common in the observed network than in randomly simulated networks of the same size. We found that prestige predicts five hypothesized network configurations and all three hypothesized learning patterns, while homophily predicts one of three hypothesized network configurations and five of the seven hypothesized learning patterns. These results compare the strength of different prestige and homophily effects on social learning and show how cultural practices such as intermarriage can affect certain aspects of prestige and homophily. By advancing our understanding of how prestige and homophily affect ecological knowledge networks, we identify which social learning patterns have the largest effects on biocultural conservation of ecological knowledge.">

        <span class="abst" title="Porphyromonas gingivalis is the keystone pathogen of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease which causes tooth loss and deterioration of gingiva. Medicinal plants have been traditionally used for oral hygiene and health and might play a role as antibacterial agents against oral pathogens. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of plants used for oral hygiene or symptoms of periodontitis against P. gingivalis. We first reviewed the literature to identify plant species used for oral hygiene or symptoms of periodontitis. Then, we cross-checked this species list with our in-house library of plant extracts to select extracts for testing. Antibacterial activity tests were then performed for each plant extract against P. gingivalis, and their cytotoxicity was assessed on HaCaT cells. The selectivity index (SI) was then calculated. A total of 416 plant species belonging to 110 families and 305 genera were documented through our literature search, and 158 plant species were noted as being used by North American Native peoples Once cross-checked with the extracts contained in our library of natural products, 30 matches were identified and 21 were defined as high priority. Of the 109 extracts from 21 plant species selected and tested, 21 extracts from 11 plants had higher than 90% inhibition on P. gingivalis at 64 μg/mL and were further selected for MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) assays. Out of 21 plant extracts, 13 extracts (7 plant species) had a SI &gt; 10. Pistacia lentiscus fruits showed the best MIC with value of 8 μg/mL, followed by Zanthoxylum armatum fruits/seeds with a MIC of 16 μg/mL. P. lentiscus fruits also showed the highest SI of 256. Most of the extracts tested present promising antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity. Further testing for biofilm eradication and examination of activity against other dental pathogens and oral commensals should be performed to confirm the potential of these extracts as antibacterial agents. Future work will focus on application of a bioassay-guided fractionation approach to isolating and identifying the most active natural products in the top performing extracts. This study can serve as a basis for their future development as ingredients for oral hygiene products.">

        <span class="abst" title="Tanzania is one of the African countries endowed with diverse rangeland's biological resources hosting 6 out of 25 globally known biodiversity hotspots. Despite, government efforts on biodiversity conservation, the pressures on rangelands' biodiversity utilization are growing in line with increasing human population. With little recognition of contribution of local knowledge in biodiversity conservation, the current paper reviewed the potential of available indigenous knowledge in Tanzania and challenges limiting adoption of this vital knowledge on rangeland's biodiversity conservation. This review established that, the country has rich indigenous knowledge potential for rangeland management and biodiversity conservation. Traditional enclosures and pastoral mobility are among the important indigenous practices used for rehabilitation of degraded rangelands and conservation of fragile ecosystems. The coexistence of local communities with complex ecosystems offers them excellent experiences on rangelands' biodiversity conservation. However, increasingly loss of rangelands' biodiversity in the country is attributed to ignoring the contribution of local communities which are rich in indigenous knowledge and skills on rangelands management. Among of the challenges hindering the adoption and involvement of indigenous knowledge to conservation are; scientific bias toward pastoral communities, loss of local expertise, poor knowledge inheritance systems, poverty, conflicts and emergence of pandemic diseases. For effective and sustainable utilisation of indigenous knowledge, the following are recommended; fully engagement of local communities in conservation process, empowering local communities to reduce poverty and conflicts, mainstreaming the indigenous knowledge to conservation education, emphasising on livelihoods diversification to reduce reliance on biological resources and promoting studies to document existing indigenous knowledge.">

The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined by Folin-Ciocalteu method and aluminum chloride colorimetry, respectively. Their effects on CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative liver injury were evaluated and compared in a mouse model by administrating each water extract (0.15 g/mL, 10 mL/kg) once per day for seven consecutive days and a dose of CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solution in olive oil (8%, v/v, 10 mL/kg). The herb with the strongest hepatoprotective performance was analyzed for the detailed bioactive components by using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization source-ion trap tandem mass spectrometry.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The results revealed that all tested herbs attenuated CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative liver injury; each resulted in significant decreases in levels of serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and triacylglycerols. In addition, most herbs restored hepatic superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, glutathione levels, and reduced malondialdehyde levels. &lt;i&gt;Sanguisorba officinalis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;S. officinalis&lt;/i&gt;) L., &lt;i&gt;Coptis chinensis&lt;/i&gt; Franch., and &lt;i&gt;Pueraria lobata&lt;/i&gt; (Willd.) Ohwi root were the three most effective herbs, and &lt;i&gt;S. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L. exhibited the strongest hepatoprotective effect. Nine active components were identified in &lt;i&gt;S. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L. Gallic acid and (+)-catechin were quantified (7.86 ± 0.45 mg/g and 8.19 ± 0.57 mg/g dried weight, respectively). Furthermore, the tested herbs displayed a range of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant activities proportional to their phenolic content; the strongest activities were also found for &lt;i&gt;S. officinalis&lt;/i&gt; L.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study is of value to assist the selection of more effective natural products for direct consumption and the development of nutraceuticals or therapeutics to manage oxidative stress-related diseases.">

This study was conducted to investigate the alpha amylase inhibitory potential and mode of inhibition of &lt;i&gt;A. sativum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. cepa&lt;/i&gt; oils.&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;Oil was extracted from dried bulb of &lt;i&gt;A. sativum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. cepa&lt;/i&gt; by Soxhlet extraction. The α-amylase inhibitory potential of the 2 oils were evaluated. The mode of inhibition of the oils were determined from the lineweaver-burk plot and the kinetic parameters obtained from the lineweaver - burk plot.&lt;h4&gt;Result&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;A. sativum&lt;/i&gt; oil had 58.13 ± 1.09 and 69.8 ± 1.11 percent inhibition at 5.0 and 7.0% concentrations respectively while &lt;i&gt;A. cepa&lt;/i&gt; oil had 55.45 ± 1.35, 59.73 ± 1.11 and 65.21 ± 1.11 percent inhibition at 5.0, 7.5 and 10% concentrations respectively. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for &lt;i&gt;A. sativum&lt;/i&gt; oil, &lt;i&gt;A. cepa&lt;/i&gt; oil and acarbose were 3.0 ± 0.02%, 4.4 ± 0.03% and 14.1 ± 0.09% respectively. The lineweaver - burk plot showed that the Vmax of the 2 oils did not change when compared with that of the no inhibitor (no oil) but the Km increased.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These findings indicate that &lt;i&gt;A. sativum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. cepa&lt;/i&gt; oils are competitive inhibitors of α- amylase and can both be used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. &lt;i&gt;A. sativum&lt;/i&gt; oil is a better inhibitor than &lt;i&gt;A. cepa oil.&lt;/i&gt;">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Tetrastigma hemsleyanum&lt;/i&gt; Diels &amp; Gilg (TDG), the family member of Vitaceae, is a traditional herbal medicine in China. The root of TDG can be immediately used after cleaning the muddy soil, and can be dehydrated for dry use. TDG is able to be collected all year round, which is commonly used in the treatment of hepatitis, infantile high fever, snake bite, etc. Based on phytochemistry, the chemical components of TDG are divided into flavonoids, phenolic acids, terpenes, steroids, polysaccharide, and other compounds, showing many pharmacological effects which include anti-tumor, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory activity, as well as other activities. Currently, TDG involves some problems of the reduction of wild resources, the backward processing methods, and storage difficulties as well as the imperfection of detection methods. Therefore, this review summarizes the literature of the past 20 years, and the purpose of this review is to summarize the recent researches on the phytochemistry, pharmacology, quality control, and clinical application of TDG. The above discussions provide new insights for the future research on TDG.">

This study deals with the bio-guided isolation of an active, amyrin-type triterpenoid, namely 3-oxo-6-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxy-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-amyrin (daturaolone; &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), from the chloroform fraction of &lt;i&gt;Datura metel&lt;/i&gt; L. (Angel's trumpet) fruits and its gastrointestinal motility, antipyretic, and muscle relaxation effects in animal models. The chemical structure of daturaolone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and crystallography techniques. The chloroform fraction and daturaolone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) were assessed for the GIT motility test. Data exhibited in charcoal meal GI transit test show that chloroform fraction and daturaolone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) significantly reduce GIT motility and increased intestinal transit time, comparable to the standard (atropine), a muscarinic receptor blocking agent. Muscle relaxant potency of the extract and daturaolone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was assessed in various animal paradigms. In the inclined plane screening test, it produced a significant (P &lt; 0.05) muscle relaxation potential in a dose-dependent manner after 30, 60, and 90 min. Likewise, the muscle relaxation potential of the extract and daturaolone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) was strongly complemented by the chimney and traction test, representing a dominant effect after 60 min of sample administration. The chloroform fraction showed good antipyretic activity, and while daturaolone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) exhibited significant activity at a higher dose, the maximum effect (84.64%) was at 20 mg/kg i.p. In acute toxicity screening test, the chloroform extract (100, 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg) and daturaolone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) (5, 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg) were found safe. In conclusion, the chloroform extract and daturaolone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;) exhibited strong gastrointestinal motility, muscle relaxation, and antipyretic activity in different animal models and intestinally, was found safe at higher tested doses.">

Here, we aim to identify effective medicinal plants for relief of cough and respiratory symptoms in children. The data of this review article were obtained from published articles in scientific databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, until December 2019. The keywords, including &quot;&lt;i&gt;Zataria multiflora&lt;/i&gt; Boiss.&quot; OR &quot;&lt;i&gt;Portulaca oleracea&lt;/i&gt; L.&quot; OR &quot;&lt;i&gt;Ferula assa-foetida&lt;/i&gt; L.&quot; OR &quot;&lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.&quot; AND &quot;respiratory symptoms&quot; OR &quot;airway inflammation&quot; OR &quot;smooth muscle relaxant effects,&quot; were searched individually or combined. The mentioned medicinal plants decreased total white blood cell (WBC), neutrophils, and eosinophils counts of blood and lung lavage in animal model-induced respiratory disorders. These plants also have protective effects on serum immunoglobulin, antibody titer, eosinophil count, and proinflammatory cytokines. Evidence from the studies indicated that the abovementioned medicinal plants have smooth muscle relaxant properties (bronchodilator effects) via stimulation of &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-adrenoceptor or inhibition of muscarinic receptors (&lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;) and also improved the pulmonary function test in clinical settings. These medicinal plants are safe and easy to use. Based on the anti-inflammatory, anti-antispasmodic, and immunomodulatory effects, the clinical benefit may be assumed, therefore considering a place for these medicinal plants in relieve of chronic cough and symptoms of children's allergy, asthma, and common cold.">

In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity, and characterized the phytochemicals of root extracts of &lt;i&gt;A. pluriseta&lt;/i&gt; aimed at validating its therapeutic potential. We used BACTEC MGIT™ 960 system to test for antitubercular activity, disc-diffusion together with the microdilution method to evaluate antimicrobial activities and qualitative phytochemical tests together with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis to determine the phytochemicals that associated with &lt;i&gt;A. pluriseta&lt;/i&gt; extracts activity. We show that methanolic crude extract (at 1 g/mL) had high &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (MTB) inhibitory activity (0 growth unit) and considerable potency against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (11.7 mm), &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (9.0 mm), and &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; (7.7 mm). All the extract fractions exerted remarkable antimycobacterial activities with minimum inhibitory activity of between 6.26 - 25 μg/mL. The highest antimicrobial activity of petroleum ether and dichloromethane fraction was against &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; at inhibition zone diameters of 8.3 mm, and 8.0 mm, respectively, while ethyl acetate fraction was against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; with an inhibition zone of 8.7 mm. Methanolic fraction exhibited broad-spectrum activity against 87.5% of the tested microbes (inhibition zones 6.3-8.3 mm). Furthermore, we qualitatively detected terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolics such as flavonoids, and anthraquinones in extract fractions. GC-MS analysis detected an abundance of fatty acid esters, 2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethyl ester-hexadecanoic acid, and 2,3-dihydroxy propyl ester-octadecanoic acid and four alkanes. Taken together, we show that &lt;i&gt;A. pluriseta&lt;/i&gt; extract fractions (especially ethyl acetate and methanolic fractions) have strong selective antitubercular activity, and thus, we scientifically validate the use of &lt;i&gt;A. pluriseta&lt;/i&gt; as a potential source for the discovery of novel antitubercular agents.">

        <span class="abst" title="The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, producing the disease COVID-19 is a pathogenic virus that targets mostly the human respiratory system and also other organs. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans, however there have been previous outbreaks of different versions of the beta coronavirus including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV1) from 2002 to 2003 and the most recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) which was first identified in 2012. All of the above have been recognised as major pathogens that are a great threat to public health and global economies. Currently, no specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified; however, certain drugs have shown apparent efficacy in viral inhibition of the disease. Natural substances such as herbs and mushrooms have previously demonstrated both great antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity. Thus, the possibilities of natural substances as effective treatments against COVID-19 may seem promising. One of the potential candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be &lt;i&gt;Inonotus obliquus&lt;/i&gt; (IO), also known as chaga mushroom. IO commonly grows in Asia, Europe and North America and is widely used as a raw material in various medical conditions. In this review, we have evaluated the most effective herbs and mushrooms, in terms of the antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects which have been assessed in laboratory conditions.">

Synthetic anthelmintics are most commonly used to control CE, however, prolonged use of these drugs may result in many adverse effects. This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research.">

While the developed countries seem to have these systems stabilized, some parts of the world still face enormous challenges. Yam (&lt;i&gt;Dioscorea&lt;/i&gt; species) is an orphan crop, widely distributed globally; and has contributed enormously to food security especially in sub-Saharan Africa because of its role in providing nutritional benefits and income. Additionally, yam has non-nutritional components called bioactive compounds, which offer numerous health benefits ranging from prevention to treatment of degenerative diseases. Pharmaceutical application of diosgenin and dioscorin, among other compounds isolated from yam, has shown more prospects recently. Despite the benefits embedded in yam, reports on the nutritional and therapeutic potentials of yam have been fragmented and the diversity within the genus has led to much confusion. An overview of the nutritional and health importance of yam will harness the crop to meet its potential towards combating hunger and malnutrition, while improving global health. This review makes a conscious attempt to provide an overview regarding the nutritional, bioactive compositions and therapeutic potentials of yam diversity. Insights on how to increase its utilization for a greater impact are elucidated.">

This was carried out to determine &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; antidiabetic activities of the leaf latex of &lt;i&gt;Aloe pulcherrim&lt;/i&gt;a. &lt;i&gt;Methods&lt;/i&gt;. Sucrase and maltase inhibitory activity of the leaf latex of &lt;i&gt;A. pulcherrima&lt;/i&gt; was determined in glucose oxidase assay, and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase inhibitory activity was determined in dinitrosalicylic acid assay. Normoglycemic, glucose-loaded, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were treated orally to determine blood glucose lowering activity of the latex. Effect of the latex on serum lipid level and body weight was measured in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Additionally, DPPH assay was used to determine free radical scavenging capacity of the latex. &lt;i&gt;Results&lt;/i&gt;. Antioxidant activity of the latex was concentration dependent; the strongest inhibition was measured at 800 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml (80.57%). The leaf latex of &lt;i&gt;A. pulcherrima&lt;/i&gt; inhibited sucrase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.92 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml), maltase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 11.81 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml) and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.92 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml) enzymes. All doses of the leaf latex induced hypoglycemic effect after 4 h in normal mice, and low dose of the latex did not show significant effect after 6 h. Glucose reduction of the leaf latex of &lt;i&gt;A. pulcherrima&lt;/i&gt; was significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) in oral glucose-loaded mice compared to the vehicle control. Blood glucose level of diabetic mice was significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) reduced on week one and weak two in a streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model. Glucose reduction increased with increasing the doses of the leaf latex of &lt;i&gt;A. pulcherrima&lt;/i&gt; on week one (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05 (200 mg/kg), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01 (400 mg/kg), and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001 (600 mg/kg)). Administration of the leaf latex of &lt;i&gt;A. pulcherrima&lt;/i&gt; for two weeks significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) improved diabetic dyslipidemia and body weight of diabetic mice. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion&lt;/i&gt;. The study confirmed that the leaf latex of the plant showed a significant antidiabetic activity justifying the traditional uses of the plant.">

Thirty rats were divided into five groups including three treatment groups with increasing doses of &lt;i&gt;Cs.Cr&lt;/i&gt;, a standard drug group receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and a metal bar-induced frostbite group. Frostbite injury was induced by a 3 × 3.5 cm metal bar frozen up to -79°C on shaved skin for continuous 3 minutes. Wounded area percentages were recorded to measure the healing rate in response to &lt;i&gt;Cs.Cr&lt;/i&gt; administration. Haematological parameters and malondialdehyde content were also noted. On treatment with &lt;i&gt;Cs.Cr&lt;/i&gt;, the healing rate is drastically increased and lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Results were compared with frostbite and ASA (standard drug group). These results indicate that &lt;i&gt;Cs.Cr&lt;/i&gt; possesses excellent wound-healing properties against frostbite injury and can prove to be a prospective compound in such conditions.">

The current situation of medicinal plants in Spain is very limited. This paper provides new insights and greater knowledge about current trends and consumption patterns of medicinal plants in the Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain) for health benefits.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed for a population-based survey on medicinal plants. The data were collected (May 2018 to May 2019) using semi-structured face-to-face interviews in independent pharmacies, hospital centers and primary care health centers in the Autonomous Community of Madrid. The survey had 18 multiple choice and open-ended questions. Quantitative indices were calculated: Fidelity Level (FL), Use Value (UV) and Informants Consensus Factor (ICF). Chi-square test was used for data analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Five hundred forty-three people were interviewed. The majority of the participants (89.6%) have used medicinal plants to treat health disorders in the past 12 months, mainly for digestive problems, sleep disorders and central nervous system diseases. A total of 78 plants were recorded, being Matricaria recutita, Valeriana officinalis, Tilia spp. and Aloe vera the most used. The highest UV was found for Mentha pulegium (UV 0.130) followed by Aloe vera (UV 0.097) and Vaccinium macrocarpon. (UV 0.080). The highest FL values were for Eucalyptus spp. (FL 90.47%) for respiratory conditions and, Matricaria recutita (85.55%) and Mentha pulegium (84.09%) for digestive problems. The highest ICF corresponded to metabolism and depression (ICF = 1), pain (ICF = 0.97), insomnia (ICF = 0.96) and anxiety (ICF = 0.95). Participants mostly acquired herbal medicines from pharmacies, herbal shops and supermarkets. Some side effects (tachycardia, dizziness and gastrointestinal symptoms) and potential interactions medicinal plants-drugs (V. officinalis and benzodiazepines) were reported.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Many inhabitants of the Autonomous Community of Madrid currently use herbal products to treat minor health problems. The most common consumer pattern are young women between 18 and 44 years of age with higher education. In order to confirm the pattern, further research should be focused to investigate current uses of medicinal plants in other Spanish regions.">

However, some plant extracts may be toxic to animals, depending on their seconday metabolite composition and dose, and therefore, animal trials are needed to validate their safety when used as anti-methanogenic additives. This study investigated the effect of three plant extracts used as anti-methanogenic dietary additives, on the haematology and serum biochemical parameters in sheep. Methanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; (MO), &lt;i&gt;Jatropha curcas&lt;/i&gt; (JC) and &lt;i&gt;Aloe vera&lt;/i&gt; (AV) were orally dosed as experimental treatments for 75 days to sheep, and their effect on the haematology and serum biochemical parameters of SA Mutton Merino (SAMM) lambs were compared with sheep on a control treatment without any additive treatment. Extracts of MO, JC and AV were extracted in 100% methanol, freeze-dried, and reconstituted in distilled water. A total of 40 lambs were ranked according to their body weight into a group of four and one sheep at a time was randomly allocated into four dietary treatments which include a control treatment, and treatment with either MO, JC or AV extract. Lambs were drenched twice daily with doses equivalent to 50 mg/kg dry matter intake (DMI) based on previous week feed consumption. Blood samples were collected via jugular vein puncture and analysed for haematology and serum biochemistry parameters, using standard procedures. The results of the haematological analysis showed that most haematological parameters were not affected by plant extract used as anti-methanogenic additives (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05), except for higher white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocytes counts recorded in control lambs and lambs in the AV treatment. All serum biochemical properties (except alkaline phosphatase) were not different (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &gt; 0.05) between the control and lambs treated with plant extracts. Alkaline phosphatase was influenced by the plant extract (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05), with lambs receiving MO, JC and AV having lower alkaline phosphatase concentrations compared to lambs on the control diet without any additive. The result of the study showed that extracts of MO, JC and AV were not toxic to sheep when used as antimethanogenic additives at the recommended dose of 50 mg/kg dry matter feed which had proved previously to be effective in reducing enteric methane emission. Therefore, these plant extracts could be used safely as alternative dietary additives to reduce enteric methane emission and boost the productivity of SA Mutton Merino sheep.">

Their role in traditional medicine, such as the use of a wide range of remedial herbs (thyme, oregano, rosemary, sage, mint, basil), has been well and long known for treating common respiratory problems and cold infections. This review reports on the most highlighted polyphenolic compounds present in up to date literature and their specific antiviral perceptive properties that might enhance the body immunity facing COVID-19, and other viral infectious diseases. In fact, several studies and clinical trials increasingly proved the role of polyphenols in controlling numerous human pathogens including SARS and MERS, which are quite similar to COVID-19 through the enhancement of host immune response against viral infections by different biological mechanisms. Thus, polyphenols ought to be considered as a potential and valuable source for designing new drugs that could be used effectively in the combat against COVID-19 and other rigorous diseases.">

In addition, gut dysbiosis is associated with an increased risk of developing intestinal cancer. In this study, the selective growth-inhibitory activities of ten phytochemicals and their synthetic analogs (berberine, bismuth subsalicylate, ferron, 8-hydroxyquinoline, chloroxine, nitroxoline, salicylic acid, sanguinarine, tannic acid, and zinc pyrithione), as well as those of six commercial antibiotics (ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, tetracycline, and vancomycin) against 21 intestinal pathogenic/probiotic (e.g., &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; spp. and bifidobacteria) bacterial strains and three intestinal cancer/normal (Caco-2, HT29, and FHs 74 Int) cell lines were examined in vitro using the broth microdilution method and thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide assay. Chloroxine, ciprofloxacin, nitroxoline, tetracycline, and zinc pyrithione exhibited the most potent selective growth-inhibitory activity against pathogens, whereas 8-hydroxyquinoline, chloroxine, nitroxoline, sanguinarine, and zinc pyrithione exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. None of the tested antibiotics were cytotoxic to normal cells, whereas 8-hydroxyquinoline and sanguinarine exhibited selective antiproliferative activity against cancer cells. These findings indicate that 8-hydroxyquinoline alkaloids and metal-pyridine derivative complexes are chemical structures derived from plants with potential bioactive properties in terms of selective antibacterial and anticancer activities against diarrheagenic bacteria and intestinal cancer cells.">

However, less attention has been given to the synchronous application of AMF and eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and how that could affect the global plant metabolism. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of AMF and eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, individually or in combination, on growth, photosynthesis, metabolism and the functional food value of &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgare&lt;/i&gt;. Results revealed that both AMF and eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treatments improved the photosynthesis and biomass production, however much more positive impact was obtained by their synchronous application. Moreover, the levels of the majority of the detected sugars, organic acids, amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, volatile compounds, phenolic acids and flavonoids were further improved as a result of the synergistic action of AMF and eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as compared to the individual treatments. Overall, this study clearly shows that co-application of AMF and eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induces a synergistic biofertilization impact and enhances the functional food value of &lt;i&gt;T. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; by affecting its global metabolism.">

We investigated the anticancer potential and possible involvement of AgNPs in apoptosis. The biosynthesized AgNPs are stable (zeta potential, -16.3 mV) and spherical with a crystal size range from 10 to 60 nm. The MTT cell viability assay shows concentration-dependent inhibition of the growth of Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, 12.35 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL). In addition, the fluorescent microscopic analysis shows activation of caspases 3 and 9 by AgNPs that cause morphological changes (AO/EB assay) in the cell membrane and cause nuclear condensation (DAPI assay) that eventually lead to apoptotic cell death (Annexin V/PI assay). It was also observed that AgNPs generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) that modulate oxidative stress in MCF-7 cells. This is the first study that reports the synthesis of a silver nanoparticle mediated by &lt;i&gt;Fagonia indica&lt;/i&gt; extract and evaluation of the cellular and molecular mechanism of apoptosis.">

The antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory and mutagenic/antimutagenic activities were evaluated to provide data on the biologic activities. With respect to the chemical composition, LC-MS/MS technique was used to determine individual phenolic compounds present in the extracts. Antioxidant properties were investigated by different chemical methods including radical quenching (DPPH and ABTS), reducing power (CUPRAC and FRAP), phosphomolybdenum and metal chelating. In the enzyme inhibitory assays, cholinesterases, tyrosinase, amylase and glucosidase were used. Mutagenic and antimutagenic properties were evaluated by the Ames assay. In general, the best antioxidant abilities were observed from H. depilatum and N. erythropus, which also showed highest level of phenolics. The best cholinesterase inhibition ability was found from C. cylindracea (1.02 mg GALAE/g for AChE; 0.99 mg GALAE/g for BChE). Tyrosinase inhibition ability varied from 48.83 to 54.18 mg KAE/g. The extracts exhibited no mutagenic effects and showed significant antimutagenic potential. &lt;i&gt;H. acutoconica&lt;/i&gt;, in particular depicted excellent antimutagenicity with a ratio of 97% for TA100 and with a rate of 96% for TA98 strain against mutagens in the presence of metabolic activation system. Results presented in this study tend to show that the mushroom species could be exploited as potential sources of therapeutic bioactive agents, geared towards the management of oxidative stress, global health problems and cancer.">

The resultant crude juices were subjected to the estimation of certain phytochemicals, i.e. total phenols, flavonoids, tannins and anthocyanins by HPLC. The assessment of their antioxidant activities were performed by three methods, i.e. DPPH, reducing power and metal chelating assays. The results indicated that the amounts of polyphenols, flavonoids, tannins and anthocyanins in crude pomegranate peels juices were markedly higher than those of other medicinal plants crude juices. The polyphenolic constituents in fig leaves, pomegranate leaves and peels, guava leaves and olive leaves were distinguished using HPLC. The major compounds found in all crude juices were gallic acid, ellagic acid, naringenin, ferulic acid and methyl gallate, respectively. Pomegranate peels crude juice exhibited the highest antioxidant activity assessed by the aforementioned methods in comparison with other medicinal plants crude juices.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Clausena lansium&lt;/i&gt; (Lour.) Skeels (wampee) is an outstanding natural plant with medicinal properties. The aim of this study was to compare the cytoprotective effects of four parts of wampee under oxidative stress. The aqueous extracts of leaf, peel, pulp, and seed were tested for the proliferation effects on human gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells and the protective effects in the hydrogen peroxide-induced HGF model. Furthermore, the total glutathione assay and identification of rutin by high-performance liquid chromatography were carried out to attempt to determine whether the cytoprotective effects were related to the total glutathione (GSH) stability and rutin content. The results showed that all of the extracts had no cytotoxicity to HGF at tested concentrations ranging from 50 to 5000 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml during 24 h, and the leaf, pulp, and seed extracts increased proliferation of HGF at relatively high concentrations. All the extracts except for the seed extract significantly decreased the production of reactive oxygen species, and the peel extracts exhibited the most effective antioxidant effect. The leaf extract had the highest anticytotoxicity and GSH stabilization effect in the HGF challenged with hydrogen peroxide. In addition, the relative content of rutin in peel and leaf extracts was higher than that in pulp and seed. The results of GSH assay and rutin identification suggest that different cellular protective effects among the four parts of wampee are partially related to the GSH stabilization and rutin content. These findings provide a scientific basis for the antioxidant effect-related biological activities of wampee extracts.">

According to the estimation of the World Health Organization, in developing countries, 80% of the population has still depended on traditional medicines or folk medicines which are mostly prepared from the plant for prevention or treatment diseases. Traditional medicine from plant extracts has proved to be more affordable, clinically effective and relatively less adverse effects than modern drugs. Literature shows that the attention on the application of phytochemical constituents of medicinal plants in the pharmaceutical industry has increased significantly. Plant-derived secondary metabolites are small molecules or macromolecules biosynthesized in plants including steroids, alkaloids, phenolic, lignans, carbohydrates and glycosides, etc. that possess a diversity of biological properties beneficial to humans, such as their antiallergic, anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and antioxidant activities Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease result of metabolic disorders in pancreas β-cells that have hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia can be caused by a deficiency of insulin production by pancreatic (Type 1 diabetes mellitus) or insufficiency of insulin production in the face of insulin resistance (Type 2 diabetes mellitus). The current medications of diabetes mellitus focus on controlling and lowering blood glucose levels in the vessel to a normal level. However, most modern drugs have many side effects causing some serious medical problems during a period of treating. Therefore, traditional medicines have been used for a long time and play an important role as alternative medicines. Moreover, during the past few years, some of the new bioactive drugs isolated from plants showed antidiabetic activity with more efficacy than oral hypoglycemic agents used in clinical therapy. Traditional medicine performed a good clinical practice and is showing a bright future in the therapy of diabetes mellitus. World Health Organization has pointed out this prevention of diabetes and its complications is not only a major challenge for the future, but essential if health for all is to be attained. Therefore, this paper briefly reviews active compounds, and pharmacological effects of some popular plants which have been widely used in diabetic treatment. Morphological data from V-herb database of each species was also included for plant identification.">

The plant is extensively used in Ayurveda and other traditional medicinal systems without obvious adverse effects. Beside notable progress in the biological and phytochemical evaluation of this plant over the past few years, comprehensive reviews of &lt;i&gt;H. pubescens&lt;/i&gt; are limited in scope. It has economic importance due to the extensive use of seeds as an antidiabetic. Furthermore, the plant is extensively reported in traditional uses among the natives of Asia and Africa, while scientifical validation for various ailments has not been studied either in vitro or in vivo. This review aims to summarize information on the pharmacology, traditional uses, active constituents, safety and toxicity of &lt;i&gt;H. pubescens&lt;/i&gt;. Chemical analysis of &lt;i&gt;H. pubescens&lt;/i&gt; extracts revealed the presence of several bioactive compounds, such as conessine, isoconnessine, conessimine, conimine, conessidine, conkurchicine, holarrhimine, conarrhimine, mokluangin A-D and antidysentericine. Overall, this review covers the ethnopharmacology, phytochemical composition, and pharmacological potential of &lt;i&gt;H. pubescens,&lt;/i&gt; with a critical discussion of its toxicity, biological activities (in vitro and in vivo), the mechanism of action, as well as suggestions for further basic and clinical research.">

        <span class="abst" title="Actinomycetes in extreme alpine habitat have attracted much attention due to their unique physiological activities and functions. However, little is known about their ecological distribution and diversity. Here, we explored the phylogenetic relationship and physiological heterogeneity of cultivable actinomycetes from near-root soils of different plant communities in the Laohu Ditch (2200 - 4200 m) and Gaize County area (5018 - 5130 m) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A total of 128 actinomycete isolates were obtained, 16S rDNA-sequenced and examined for antimicrobial activities and organic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, diffusible pigments, various extracellular enzymes production. Seventy three isolates of the total seventy eight isolates from the Laohu Ditch, frequently isolated from 2200 to 4200 m, were closely related to &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; spp. according to the 16S rDNA sequencing, while four isolates within the genus &lt;i&gt;Nocardia&lt;/i&gt; spp. were found at 2200, 2800, and 3800 m. In addition, one potential novel isolate with 92% sequence similarity to its nearest match &lt;i&gt;Micromonospora saelicesensis&lt;/i&gt; from the GenBank database, was obtained at 2200 m. From the Gaize County area, fifty &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; isolates varied in diversity at different sites from 5018 to 5130 m. The investigation of phenotypic properties of 128 isolates showed that 94.5, 78.9, 68, 64.8, 53, 51.6, 50, 36.7, 31.2, and 22.7% of the total isolates produced catalase, lipase 2, urease, protease, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, lipase 3, amylase, lipase 1, diffusible pigment and organic acid, respectively. The antimicrobial assays of the total isolates revealed that 5, 28, 19, and 2 isolates from &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; spp. exhibited antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. This study intends to bring helpful insights in the exploitation and utilization of alpine actinomycetes for novel bioactive compounds discovery.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Ethnobotanical and plant-based products allow for the isolation of active constituents against a number of maladies. Monotheca buxifolia is used by local communities due to its digestive and laxative properties, as well as its ability to cure liver, kidney, and urinary diseases. There is a need to explore the biological activities and chemical constituents of this medicinal plant.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In this work, the biochemical potential of M. buxifolia (Falc.) A. DC was explored and linked with its biological activities. Methanol and chloroform extracts from leaves and stems were investigated for total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) was used to determine secondary-metabolite composition, while high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detection (HPLC-PDA) was used for polyphenolic quantification. In addition, we carried out in vitro assays to determine antioxidant potential and the enzyme-inhibitory response of M. buxifolia extracts.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Phenolics (91 mg gallic-acid equivalent (GAE)/g) and flavonoids (48.86 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g) exhibited their highest concentration in the methanol extract of stems and the chloroform extract of leaves, respectively. UHPLC-MS analysis identified a number of important phytochemicals, belonging to the flavonoid, phenolic, alkaloid, and terpenoid classes of secondary metabolites. The methanol extract of leaves contained a diosgenin derivative and polygalacin D, while kaempferol and robinin were most abundant in the chloroform extract. The methanol extract of stems contained a greater peak area for diosgenin and kaempferol, whereas this was true for lucidumol A and 3-O-cis-coumaroyl maslinic acid in the chloroform extract. Rutin, epicatechin, and catechin were the main phenolics identified by HPLC-PDA analysis. The methanol extract of stems exhibited significant 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical-scavenging activities (145.18 and 279.04 mmol Trolox equivalent (TE)/g, respectively). The maximum cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) (361.4 mg TE/g), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (247.19 mg TE/g), and total antioxidant potential (2.75 mmol TE/g) were depicted by the methanol extract of stems. The methanol extract of leaves exhibited stronger inhibition against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glucosidase, while the chloroform extract of stems was most active against butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) (4.27 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g). Similarly, the highest tyrosinase (140 mg kojic-acid equivalent (KAE)/g) and amylase (0.67 mmol acarbose equivalent (ACAE)/g) inhibition was observed for the methanol extract of stems.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;UHPLC-MS analysis and HPLC-PDA quantification identified a number of bioactive secondary metabolites of M. buxifolia, which may be responsible for its antioxidant potential and enzyme-inhibitory response. M. buxifolia can be further explored for the isolation of its active components to be used as a drug.">

Thus, the current study intended to evaluate the hypoglycemic, anti-diabetic, and anti-hyperlipidemic effects of &lt;i&gt;Bersama abyssinica&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The solvent fractions of &lt;i&gt;Bersama abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; leaves were prepared. A total of 132 healthy, male Swiss albino mice weighing 20-28 grams (age of 6-10 weeks) were used. The antidiabetic activity of all the doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) of &lt;i&gt;Bersama abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; solvent fractions was evaluated by animal models: normoglycemic mice, oral glucose loaded mice, and diabetic mice. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (150mg/kg body weight). The effect of the plant extract on body weight and serum lipid levels were measured in diabetic mice. Statistical analysis was performed by using statistical package for social sciences version 24. The analyses were carried out using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests. The result was considered significant when p &lt;0.05.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The solvent fractions of &lt;i&gt;B. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; at all tested doses (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) exhibited significant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05-0.001) BGL reduction in all animal models. In hypoglycemic activity, the percentage reduction of baseline BGL was 25.90%, 26.36%, 38.43%, 30.96% and 49.42% for EAF200mg/kg, AQF200mg/kg, EAF400mg/kg, AQF400mg/kg, and GLC 5mg/kg, respectively. &lt;i&gt;B. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; at the dose of AQF 200 mg/kg (p&lt;0.05), AQF 400mg/kg (p&lt;0.001), EAF 200mg/kg (p&lt;0.01), and GLC 5mg/kg (p&lt;0.001) significantly reduced the BGL following 1-hour post-treatment as compared to the negative control. Likewise, the higher doses of the solvent fractions (400mg/kg) significantly (p&lt;0.001) reduced the BGL following 2- and 3-hours post-treatment as compared to the negative control. Daily administration of aqueous fraction of &lt;i&gt;B. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; caused a maximum reduction in fasting BGL at the fourteenth day of administration by 33.29%, 38.59%, 52.71%, and 59.66%, respectively, for AQF100, AQF200, AQF400, and GLC 5mg/kg. The aqueous fraction of &lt;i&gt;B. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; and the glibenclamide significantly (p&lt;0.05) prevent loss of body weight and showed improvement in serum lipid levels.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The solvent fractions of &lt;i&gt;Bersama abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; exhibit noticeable antidiabetic activity in all animal models (normoglycemic mice, oral glucose loaded mice, and diabetic mice) and showed improvement in body weight and serum lipid profile levels, which rationalizes the claimed use of the &lt;i&gt;B. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; in the treatment of diabetes mellitus.">

Characterization of AgNPs was performed using UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, TEM, and SEM analyses. Anti-cancer activity of AgNPs against human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells was tested using MTT assay. UV-Visible spectroscopy analysis indicated the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sharp peak at 350-430 nm wavelength that corresponds to the production of AgNPs. FTIR analysis reveals that existence of carboxyl (-C[bond, double bond]O) and amine (N-H) functional groups in the AgNPs. The X-ray diffraction analysis confirms four spectral peaks at 111, 200, 220, and 311. SEM analysis showed that AgNPs are in a spherical shape with a size of 42-61 nm and TEM analysis showed particle size are ranged between 20-51 nm. Anti-cancer study reveals that AgNPs had shown cytotoxicity against HT-29 cells at the concentrations ranged from 25 to 500 μg/mL and IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; at 150.8 µg/mL. This study concludes that AgNPs synthesized using rhizome of &lt;i&gt;Z. officinale and C. longa&lt;/i&gt; possesses potential anti-cancer activity.">

The present investigation aimed to examine the antibacterial, anti-scavenging and cytotoxic potential of garden cress (GC) polysaccharides. The antibacterial effects &lt;i&gt;vs Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and as well as &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; of GC polysaccharides were examined by means of agar diffusion assay, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), outer and inner cell membrane permeability. Antioxidant potential of the GC polysaccharides were performed by free radical DPPH scavenging, superoxide anion scavenging, hydroxyl radical scavenging, reducing power potential assay, and hydrogen peroxide method. Cytotoxicity potential of GC polysaccharides were evaluated by MTT assay in human cervical (HeLa) and liver carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. The findings showed that GC polysaccharides MIC were 1.06 and 0.56 mg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Compared to the standard inhibitor, the GC polysaccharides showed essential inhibitor assays in a very dose dependent approach, and notable actions to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also due to the large quantities of hydrophilic polyphenols. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of all tested parameters were measured against standard ascorbic acid antioxidant agent. The GC polysaccharides diminish the cell viability percentage of HeLa and HepG2 in a concentration dependent manner. GC polysaccharides at a dose of 500 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; exhibited higher anti-tumor activity in both HeLa (65.33 ± 3.75%) and HepG2 (60.33 ± 3.48%). The findings obtained in this study indicate that GC polysaccharides has antibacterial and has a possible source of natural antioxidant and also has cytotoxic effect on different carcinoma cell lines.">

However, there are limited reports on toxicity studies.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;This study was intended to evaluate the acute and sub-acute toxicity effects of plants.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The crude extracts of &lt;i&gt;A. aspera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. murale&lt;/i&gt; leaves, &lt;i&gt;S. punctata&lt;/i&gt; aerial parts, &lt;i&gt;R. abyssinicus&lt;/i&gt; rhizomes, and &lt;i&gt;A. Pulcherrima&lt;/i&gt; gel were prepared using 70 % ethanol. In acute toxicity, 125, 500 and 2000 mg/kg were tested in a stepwise manner; whereas 2000 mg/kg administrated to female rats using gavage during sub-acute toxicity. On day 14 and 28, blood samples were collected from retro-orbital sinus; liver and kidneys of each animal were collected under anaesthesia. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, Dunnett's comparison test of the Graph Pad Prism.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;No mortality and significant weight loss for all extracts in both toxicity tests. In acute toxicity, &lt;i&gt;C. murale&lt;/i&gt; extract significantly reduced hemoglobin and platelets (P &lt; 0.01) compared with the control. Likewise, &lt;i&gt;S. punctata&lt;/i&gt; (P &lt; 0.05) and &lt;i&gt;R. abyssinicus&lt;/i&gt; (P &lt; 0.01) extracts revealed significant reduction in platelet count. An exposure to &lt;i&gt;C. murale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R. abyssinicus&lt;/i&gt; extracts reduced the concentrations of platelet distribution width and platelet larger cell ratio (p &lt; 0.05) during sub-acute toxicity test. The level of creatinine reduced due to &lt;i&gt;A. aspera&lt;/i&gt; extract administrations(P &lt; 0.05). Liver histopathological examinations revealed focal periportal hepatitis following sub-acute toxicity test of &lt;i&gt;C. murale.&lt;/i&gt; Histopathological studies of liver demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;R. abyssinicus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. aspera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. punctata&lt;/i&gt; extracts showed mild acute liver injury. &lt;i&gt;A. pulcherrima&lt;/i&gt; was not associated with any toxicity.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;C. murale&lt;/i&gt; extract showed hematological, and histopathological toxicity profiles in rats. Furthermore, chronic toxicity studies of &lt;i&gt;A. aspera&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. punctata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R. abyssinicus&lt;/i&gt; extracts would be beneficial to ensure safety.">

        <span class="abst" title="The genus &lt;i&gt;Coccoloba&lt;/i&gt; is widely used in traditional folk medicine, but few scientific data exist for this genus. The goal of this study was to characterise the chemical composition and antioxidant activities of &lt;i&gt;C. alnifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaf extracts using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; assays. Six extracts were obtained: hexane (HE), chloroform (CE), ethanol (EE), methanol (ME), water end extract (WEE), and water extract (WE). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis showed the presence of phenols, saponins, terpenes, and flavonoids. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays demonstrated substantial antioxidant potential, especially for polar extracts (EE, ME, WEE, and WE). Moreover, no toxic effects were observed on mammalian cell lines for most of the extracts at the concentrations evaluated. The nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; was also used as an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; model for testing antioxidant potential. The EE and WE were chosen, based on previously obtained results. It was observed that neither the EE nor the WE had any toxic effect on &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; development. Additionally, the antioxidant potential was evaluated using &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl hydroperoxide as a stressor agent. The EE increased the life span of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; by 28% compared to that of the control, and the WE increased the range to 39.2-41.3%. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) showed the presence of gallic acid, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumaric acid, and vitexin in the WE. Therefore, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data demonstrated the antioxidant potential of &lt;i&gt;C. alnifolia&lt;/i&gt; extracts and their possible biotechnological applications.">

The present work assessed, for the first time, the antibacterial efficacy of solvent fractions from &lt;i&gt;P. huayllabambana&lt;/i&gt; fruits. The crude methanol extract was obtained applying ultrasound-assisted extraction, followed by partitioning through successive depletion among solvents of increasing polarity to yield fractions (n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined following antibacterial testing, using the broth microdilution technique against a panel of drug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Possible modes of action of the most active fraction were also investigated. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify phytocompounds that may account for the recorded activities. Methanol, n-hexane (PH-n-Hex), and ethyl acetate extracts inhibited 100% of studied bacteria, with the recorded MIC ranging from 0.125-1 mg/mL. PH-n-Hex appeared as the most active partition, exerting a bacteriostatic effect. PH-n-Hex probably acts by interfering with bacterial biofilm formation, proton pumps, and bacterial cell membrane integrity. The GC-MS analysis of PH-n-Hex led to the identification of 11 potentially bioactive components, including fatty acids, phytosterol, and diterpene alcohol as major ones. &lt;i&gt;P. huayllabambana&lt;/i&gt; can be considered as a plant of pharmacological value-a source of potent anti-infective drug entities.">

        <span class="abst" title="This study aimed at assessing the biological activities of &lt;i&gt;Mucuna pruriens&lt;/i&gt; seeds using cytotoxicity, phytochemical, antiparasitic screening, and antioxidant assays. Mature fruits of &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pruriens&lt;/i&gt; were harvested from Fort Hare University's Research Farm located in Alice, South Africa. The collected seeds were pulverized in a standard process and taken to the laboratory for crude extraction and further treatments. Cytotoxic, antimalarial, and trypanocidal effects of crude extracts obtained from ethanol and water were tested, while the total phenolic, proanthocyanidin, and flavonoid contents of the aqueous extracts as well as their pharmacological activities were determined in vitro using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl ethanol (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays. Although the extracts showed mild antiparasitic (antiplasmodial and trypanocidal) effects, results from the cytotoxic experiment revealed that &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;pruriens&lt;/i&gt; is not toxic to human cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells when tested using 50 µg/mL of extracts. It was observed that the seeds were remarkably rich in phenol (3730.1 ± 15.52 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g) compared to flavonoids (63.03 ± 1.95 mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/g) and proanthocyanidin (18.92 ± 1.09 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g). Also, the antioxidant activities of the extracts were comparable to those of the standard antioxidant drugs (rutin and gallic acid) used, in a concentration-dependent manner. There was a direct relationship between phenolic acid content and antioxidant effects. It is therefore suggested that &lt;i&gt;M. pruriens&lt;/i&gt; seeds be incorporated into human diets as a supplement to promote healthy living. Pharmaceutical industries with a particular interest in natural phenolic acids should consider using seeds of &lt;i&gt;M. pruriens&lt;/i&gt; as pharmaceutical precursors.">

        <span class="abst" title="Traditional medicine is still widely practiced in Iraqi Kurdistan, especially by people living in villages on mountainous regions; medicinal plants are also sold in the markets of the large towns, such as at Erbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region. About a dozen of &lt;i&gt;Verbascum&lt;/i&gt; species (Scrophulariaceae) are commonly employed in the Kurdish traditional medicine, especially for treating burns and other skin diseases. However, the isolation of bioactive secondary metabolites from these plants has not been the subject of intense scientific investigations in Iraq. Therefore, the information reported in the literature about the species growing in Kurdistan has been summarized in the first part of this paper, although investigations have been performed on vegetable samples collected in neighbouring countries, such as Turkey and Iran. In the second part of the work, we have investigated, for the first time, the contents of a methanol and a hydromethanol extract of &lt;i&gt;V. calvum&lt;/i&gt; flowers. The extracts exhibited weak antimicrobial activities, whereas the methanol extract showed significant antiproliferative effects against an A549 lung cancer cell line. Moreover, both extracts exhibited a significant dose-dependent free radical scavenging action against the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, comparable to that of ascorbic acid. In the subsequent phytochemical study, a high phenolic content was determined in both extracts by the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and medium-pressure liquid chromatographic (MPLC) separation led to the isolation of iridoid glucosides ajugol and aucubin from the methanol extract. In conclusion, the high anti-inflammatory effects of aucubin and the remarkable antioxidant (antiradical) properties of the extracts give scientific support to the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;V. calvum&lt;/i&gt; flowers for the preparation in Kurdistan of remedies to cure skin burns and inflammations.">

        <span class="abst" title="Traditional healers in Thailand are a primary source of health care for the Thai people. Highly experienced traditional healers are generally older people and they continue to pass away without recording or passing on their knowledge. Consequently, the cumulative knowledge held by traditional healers regarding the use of medicinal plants is being eroded and could be lost. In this study, we aimed to identify and document the medicinal plants and associated ethnobotanical knowledge held by traditional healers in Roi Et in northeastern Thailand. Data and plant specimens were collected from four traditional healers of the Phu Tai people. They were selected by purposive sampling and questioned using a semi-structured interview. The interviews covered their training, the ailments treated, treatment techniques, method of preparation and in addition, several healing sessions were observed. During field walks, we searched for the medicinal plants with the healers to review and document the availability of medicinal plants at each locality and in different habitats around the villages. Use values (UV) were calculated to estimate the importance of each medicinal plant and informant agreement ratios (IAR) were calculated to understand how widely known the uses were. The four Phu Tai traditional healers knew 162 medicinal plant species in 141 genera and 63 families. The family with the most medicinal plants was Leguminosae with 15 species. The plant part that they used most commonly was the stem, which was used for 82 species (49%). The most common preparation method was decoction, which was done for 124 species (75%). The most important and widely used medicinal plants were &lt;i&gt;Rothmannia wittii&lt;/i&gt;, which had the highest use value (UV = 1.7). Most medicinal plants were used for treating tonic (34 species (21%)). Jaundice had the highest informant agreement ratio (IAR = 0.5). The most common life form among the medicinal plants was trees (56 species (34%)). The medicinal plants were mostly collected in community forests (81 species (49%)). Considering the richness of the healer's pharmacopeia, and the fact that their profession is not being perpetuated, this study points to the urgent need to document the traditional knowledge from the old herbalists before it disappears with the last practitioners from rural communities in Thailand.">

        <span class="abst" title="Emerging needs for diversifying human diet and to explore novel therapeutic procedures have led to increasing attempts to retrieve traditional nourishments and recruit beneficial wild plant species. Species of the genus &lt;i&gt;Erodium&lt;/i&gt; (Geraniaceae) harbor medicinal indications and substances known from folklore and scientific research. Hairy stork's bill (&lt;i&gt;Erodium crassifolium&lt;/i&gt; L'Hér), is a small hemicryptophyte that inhabits arid southeast Mediterranean regions. &lt;i&gt;E. crassifolium&lt;/i&gt; is among the very few Geraniaceae species known to produce tubers. Traditional knowledge holds that the tubers are edible and used by Bedouin tribes. However, no scientific information was found regarding nutrition or medicinal properties of these tubers. The objectives of our project are to unravel potential nutritional and medicinal benefits of the tubers, conduct initial steps towards domestication and develop agricultural practices enhancing &lt;i&gt;E. crassifolium&lt;/i&gt; tuber yield and quality. Tubers show high water content (90%), low caloric value (23 Kcal 100&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; g) and considerable contents of minerals and vitamins. In addition, the tubers contain significant amounts of catechins and epigallocatechin, polyphenolic compounds known for their antioxidative, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative activities. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effects on human cell cultures. &lt;i&gt;E. crassifolium&lt;/i&gt; is highly responsive to environmental changes; fertigation (700 mm) increased tuber yield by 10-fold, compared to simulated wild conditions (50-200 mm). These results indicate a significant potential of &lt;i&gt;E. crassifolium&lt;/i&gt; becoming a valuable crop species. Therefore, there is a need for continued efforts in domestication, including ecotype selection, breeding, development of suitable agricultural practices and further exploration of its medicinal benefits.">

This review stems from the fact that in many &lt;i&gt;Punica granatum&lt;/i&gt; L. articles, &lt;i&gt;Punica protopunica&lt;/i&gt; Balf. is mentioned, but just in an informative way, without mentioning their taxonomic and genetic relationship and their medicinal properties. It is there where the need arises to know more about this forgotten species: &quot;the other pomegranate tree.&quot; A large part of the human population does not know of its existence, since only its &quot;sister&quot; has spread throughout the world. The present review deals with the taxonomy and origin of &lt;i&gt;Punica protopunica&lt;/i&gt; Balf., the morphology of the tree, distribution, cultivation, vulnerability, and as well as its relationship with &lt;i&gt;Punica granatum&lt;/i&gt; L. It also discusses its uses in traditional medicine, its antioxidant capacity, and the medicinal properties of this forgotten species.">

To date, there is no specific medicine or vaccine available against this pandemic disease. However, the presence of medicinal plants and their bioactive molecules with antiviral properties might also be a successful strategy in order to develop therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, this review will summarize the available literature and other information/data sources related to antiviral medicinal plants, with possible ethnobotanical evidence in correlation with coronaviruses. The identification of novel antiviral compounds is of critical significance, and medicinal plant based natural compounds are a good source for such discoveries. In depth search and analysis revealed several medicinal plants with excellent efficacy against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which are well-known to act on ACE-2 receptor, 3CLpro and other viral protein targets. In this review, we have consolidated the data of several medicinal plants and their natural bioactive metabolites, which have promising antiviral activities against coronaviruses with detailed modes of action/mechanism. It is concluded that this review will be useful for researchers worldwide and highly recommended for the development of naturally safe and effective therapeutic drugs/agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be used in therapeutic protocols alone or in combination with chemically synthetized drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Dodonaea viscosa&lt;/i&gt; Jacq (Sapindaceae) is a medicinal plant with a worldwide distribution. The species has undergone enormous taxonomic changes which caused confusion amongst plant users. In Kenya, for example, two varieties are known to exist based on morphology, i.e., &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;viscosa&lt;/i&gt; along the coast, and &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; in the Kenyan inland. These two taxa are recognized as distinct species in some reports. This prompted us to apply metabolomics to understand the relationship among naturally occurring populations of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; in Kenya, and to identify compounds that can assist in taxonomic delineation of the different varieties of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; from different parts of Kenya. The phytochemical variability of Kenyan &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; populations collected from four different geographical regions (Nanyuki, Machakos, Nairobi, and Narok) and one coastal &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;viscosa&lt;/i&gt; (the Gazi) were analyzed by LC-MS using a metabolomics-driven approach. Four known compounds, two diterpenoids (dodonic acid (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), hautriwaic acid lactone (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), and two flavonoids (5,7,4',5'-tetrahydroxy-3,6,2'-trimethoxyflavone (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) and catechin (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;)) were isolated and purified from the Gazi coastal collection. The presence of these compounds and their relative abundance in other populations was determined by LC-MS analyses. Multivariate statistical analyses of LC-MS data was used for the visualization of the patterns of variation and identification of additional compounds. Eleven discriminant compounds responsible for separating chemometric clusters were tentatively identified. In an antimicrobial assay, hautriwaic acid lactone (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and catechin (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;) were the most active compounds followed by the extract from the coastal (Gazi) population. The clustering pattern of the five populations of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; suggested that the metabolite profiles were influenced by geo-environmental conditions and did not support the current classification of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; based on morphology. This study disputes the current classification of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; in Kenya and recommends revision using tools such as molecular phylogenetics.">

A rapid analytical technique to facilitate the evaluation of the &lt;i&gt;P. malayana&lt;/i&gt; leaves' quality has not been well-established yet. This work aimed therefore to develop a validated analytical technique in order to predict the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory action (AGI) of &lt;i&gt;P. malayana&lt;/i&gt; leaves, applying a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) fingerprint and utilizing an orthogonal partial least square (OPLS). The dried leaf extracts were prepared by sonication of different ratios of methanol-water solvent (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) prior to the assessment of alpha-glucosidase inhibition (AGI) and the following infrared spectroscopy. The correlation between the biological activity and the spectral data was evaluated using multivariate data analysis (MVDA). The 100% methanol extract possessed the highest inhibitory activity against the alpha-glucosidase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 2.83 ± 0.32 μg/mL). Different bioactive functional groups, including hydroxyl (O-H), alkenyl (C=C), methylene (C-H), carbonyl (C=O), and secondary amine (N-H) groups, were detected by the multivariate analysis. These functional groups actively induced the alpha-glucosidase inhibition effect. This finding demonstrated the spectrum profile of the FTIR for the natural herb &lt;i&gt;P. malayana&lt;/i&gt; Jack, further confirming its medicinal value. The developed validated model can be used to predict the AGI of &lt;i&gt;P. malayana&lt;/i&gt;, which will be useful as a tool in the plant's quality control.">

        <span class="abst" title="This ethnobotanical survey was carried out in Caspoggio (Valmalenco, SO, Italy) with the purpose of investigating the traditional uses of medicinal plants. Moreover, a bibliographic research meant to validate or refute the uses, focusing on the potentially responsible compounds, was performed. Fifty-nine species, attributable to 30 families (Asteraceae, Pinaceae, Malvaceae, and Lamiaceae the most cited), were mentioned. &lt;i&gt;Arnica montana&lt;/i&gt;, anti-inflammatory for traumas and musculoskeletal pains; &lt;i&gt;Pinus mugo&lt;/i&gt;, expectorant; &lt;i&gt;Malva sylvestris&lt;/i&gt;, anti-inflammatory and soothing; &lt;i&gt;Achillea moschata&lt;/i&gt;, digestive. The compounds, responsible for the therapeutic activities, are often polyphenols and terpenoids: helenanin in &lt;i&gt;A. montana&lt;/i&gt;, α-pinene, δ-3-carene, and limonene in &lt;i&gt;P. mugo&lt;/i&gt;, gossypin and malvin in &lt;i&gt;M. sylvestris&lt;/i&gt;, luteolin and apigenin in &lt;i&gt;A. moschata&lt;/i&gt;. Scientific evidence for at least one of the traditional activities described was found for 50 species but only in 26 out of 196 works consulted, it is possible to make a comparison between investigated extracts and traditional preparations. This study is thus a stimulus to new phytochemical investigations, mimicking as much as possible the traditional preparations. This work is part of the European Interreg Italy-Switzerland B-ICE project, aimed at creating a management model for the ongoing climate change and searching for new sources of territory valorization as attractions for tourists.">

However, the mechanisms underlying these pharmacologic activities are poorly understood. To develop new drugs based on DCA, more information is required regarding its interactions with biomolecules. The present study showed that DCA inhibits the activity of the enzyme sphingomyelin synthase, with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 4 µM. The structure-activity relationships between DCA and sphingomyelin synthase were evaluated using derivatives and cyclized hongoquercin A. In addition, DCA was found to inhibit amyloid β aggregation.

        <span class="abst" title="Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (EC:3.4.17.23) is a transmembrane protein which is considered as a receptor for spike protein binding of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). Since no specific medication is available to treat COVID-19, designing of new drug is important and essential. In this regard, in silico method plays an important role, as it is rapid and cost effective compared to the trial and error methods using experimental studies. Natural products are safe and easily available to treat coronavirus affected patients, in the present alarming situation. In this paper five phytochemicals, which belong to flavonoid and anthraquinone subclass, have been selected as small molecules in molecular docking study of spike protein of SARS-CoV2 with its human receptor ACE2 molecule. Their molecular binding sites on spike protein bound structure with its receptor have been analyzed. From this analysis, hesperidin, emodin and chrysin are selected as competent natural products from both Indian and Chinese medicinal plants, to treat COVID-19. Among them, the phytochemical hesperidin can bind with ACE2 protein and bound structure of ACE2 protein and spike protein of SARS-CoV2 noncompetitively. The binding sites of ACE2 protein for spike protein and hesperidin, are located in different parts of ACE2 protein. Ligand spike protein causes conformational change in three-dimensional structure of protein ACE2, which is confirmed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies. This compound modulates the binding energy of bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein. This result indicates that due to presence of hesperidin, the bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment becomes unstable. As a result, this natural product can impart antiviral activity in SARS CoV2 infection. The antiviral activity of these five natural compounds are further experimentally validated with QSAR study.">

This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of 2 varieties of ethanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;Phoenix dactylifera&lt;/i&gt; i-e Ajwa and Khalas against bacterial biofilms. This study also investigated the protective effect of Ajwa and Khalas against hydroxyl radical damage to calf thymus DNA. Antioxidant potential through different antioxidant assays showed that Ajwa has higher antioxidant potential than Khalas. Both Ajwa and Khalas presented good antimicrobial activities against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtili&lt;/i&gt;s and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella multocida&lt;/i&gt;. Biofilm inhibition assay showed that increasing concentration of Ajwa and Khalas exhibited higher percentage of bacterial biofilm inhibition. Microscopic examination revealed significant inhibition of microbial biofilm. Ajwa and Khalas protected the calf thymus DNA against damage caused by hydroxyl radicals produced by fenton reagent. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra confirmed the presence of O-H, C=C and C-O functional groups in tested extracts. The study concluded that tested varieties of Date palm have the potential to inhibit bacterial biofilms and can be used for therapeutic purposes against biofilm producing pathogens.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Bacteria belonging to the Salmonella genus are major concern for health, as they are widely reported in many cases of food poisoning. The use of antibiotics remains a main stream control strategy for avian salmonellosis as well as typhoid and paratyphoid fevers in humans. Due to the growing awareness about drug resistance and toxicities, the use of antibiotics is being discouraged in many countries whilst advocating potent benign alternatives such as phyto-based medicine. The objective of this work was to isolate, characterise the bioactive compounds of Canarium schweinfurthii; and evaluate their anti-salmonellal activity.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The hydro-ethanolic extract of Canarium schweinfurthii was fractionated and tested for their anti-salmonellal activity. The most active fractions (i.e. chloroform and ethyl acetate partition fractions) were then explored for their phytochemical constituents. Fractionation on normal phase silica gel column chromatography and size exclusion chromatography on Sephadex LH-20 led to the isolation of four compounds (maniladiol, scopoletin, ethyl gallate and gallic acid) reported for the first time in Canarium schweinfurthii.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Result indicated that scopoletin and gallic acid had greater activity than the crude extracts and partition fractions. Among the isolated compounds, scopoletin showed the highest inhibitory activity with a MIC of 16 μg/ml against Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The overall results of this study indicates that the hydro-ethanolic extract as well as some of isolated compounds have interesting anti-salmonellal activities that could be further explored for the development of potent therapy for salmonellosis. Furthermore, the study adds credence to the folkloric applications of the plant.">

It can also lead to reductions in the chemical contents of medicinal plants. In this study, we intercropped continuously cropped &lt;i&gt;Pogostemon cablin&lt;/i&gt; (patchouli) with turmeric or ginger. High-throughput sequencing was used to study the soil bacteria and fungi. Community composition, diversity, colony structure, and colony differences were also analyzed. A redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to study the interactions between soil physical and chemical factors, and the bacteria and fungi. The correlations between the soil community and the soil physical and chemical properties were also investigated. The results showed that intercropping turmeric and ginger with patchouli can improve soil microbial abundance, diversity, and community structure by boosting the number of dominant bacteria, and by improving soil bacterial metabolism and the activities of soil enzymes. They also modify the soil physical and chemical properties through changes in enzyme activity, soil pH, and soil exchangeable Ca (Ca). In summary, turmeric and ginger affect the distribution of dominant bacteria, and increase the contents of the active ingredient in patchouli. The results from this study suggested that the problems associated with continuously cropping patchouli can be ameliorated by intercropping it with turmeric and ginger.">

        <span class="abst" title="Mushroom beta-glucans show immunomodulatory, anticancer and antioxidant features. Numerous papers have been published in the last years on fungal polysaccharides, especially beta-glucans, demonstrating their various biological activities. However substantial data about beta-glucan contents in many mushroom species, especially wild mushrooms, are still missing. Therefore, the main objective of the study was to evaluate β-glucans in 18 species of wild mushrooms and three species of commercial mushrooms for comparison purposes. The contents of β-glucans were determined by the Megazyme method and with the Congo red method, which differ in analytical procedure. Among wild mushrooms, the highest mean β-glucan content assessed with the Megazyme method was found in &lt;i&gt;Tricholoma portentosum&lt;/i&gt; (34.97 g/100 g DM), whereas with the Congo red method in &lt;i&gt;Lactarius deliciosus&lt;/i&gt; (17.11 g/100 g DM) and &lt;i&gt;Suillus grevillei&lt;/i&gt; (16.97 g/100 g DM). The β-glucans in wild mushrooms assessed with the Megazyme method were comparable to commercial mushrooms, whereas β-glucans assessed with the Congo red method were generally higher in wild mushrooms, especially in &lt;i&gt;Russula vinosa, L. deliciosus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. grevillei.&lt;/i&gt; This study indicates wild mushrooms as interesting material for β-glucan extraction for food industry and medicinal purposes.">

It has been widely used as a food additive and as a medicine in oriental medicine to treat lumps, dropsy, swelling, testicular pains, and urinary problems. &lt;i&gt;S. fulvellum&lt;/i&gt; has been identified as a potential producer of a wide spectrum of natural compounds such as carotenoids, fucoidans, and phlorotannins, showing different biological activities in various industrial applications including pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, cosmeceutical, and functional food. However, the promising health effects associated with the extracts and compounds isolated from &lt;i&gt;S. fulvellum&lt;/i&gt; have not been reviewed to date. The present review thus focuses on the biological activity of &lt;i&gt;S. fulvellum&lt;/i&gt; as reported by previous publications, which include antioxidant, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, and anticancer effects. Thus, this review might serve to increase the utilization of this invaluable natural source as a potential component in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications.">

General behavioral adverse effects, mortality, and latency of mortality were determined. In the subacute study, the &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel extract was administered orally at doses of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg daily for 30 days to Wistar rats. Body weight and selected biochemical and hematological parameters were determined at the end of the experiment. Sections of livers and kidneys were removed for histological studies.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Acute toxicity study showed that the oral LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel extract was 5000 mg/kg. The subacute toxicity study of &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel extract at doses 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg did not produce any observable symptoms of toxicity and no significant variation in body weight, organ weights, food, and water consumption or mortality in all treated rats. However, the administration of the &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel extract to rats at 500 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg showed a significant decrease in platelets. Moreover, only at the highest dose (2000 mg/kg), the extract caused a significant increase in red blood cells and hemoglobin. Our results showed that subacute treatments with &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel extract at doses of 1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase and triglycerides. Histological studies showed that the subacute treatments of rats with &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel extracts, at the doses 1000 and 2000 mg/kg, induced some histopathological changes in the livers but a slight changing in kidneys.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our results indicated low acute toxicity of the aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel. Furthermore, daily oral administration of &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel extract caused some damages to the livers of rats treated with high doses, expressed by an increase in some enzyme activities such as ALP. Regarding the renal function, we did not find remarkable toxicity in the subacute treatment with &lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; Pomel extracts at doses 1000 and 2000 mg/kg. However, further toxicity assessments should be done to ascertain the safety or the toxicity of this valuable plant species &quot;&lt;i&gt;Haloxylon scoparium&lt;/i&gt; pomel&quot; in subchronic treatments.">

        <span class="abst" title="Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other free radicals cause oxidative damage in cells under biotic and abiotic stress. Endophytic microorganisms reside in the internal tissues of plants and contribute to the mitigation of such stresses by the production of antioxidant enzymes and compounds. We hypothesized that the endophytic actinobacterium &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. strain DBT34, which was previously demonstrated to have plant growth-promoting (PGP) and antimicrobial properties, may also have a role in protecting plants against several stresses through the production of antioxidants. The present study was designed to characterize catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), two enzymes involved in the detoxification of ROS, in methanolic extracts derived from six endophytic actinobacterial isolates obtained from the traditional medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Mirabilis jalapa&lt;/i&gt;. The results of a preliminary screen indicated that &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. strain DBT34 was the best overall strain and was therefore used in subsequent detailed analyses. A methanolic extract of DBT34 exhibited significant antioxidant potential in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays. The cytotoxicity of DBT34 against liver hepatocellular cells (HepG2) was also determined. Results indicated that methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. strain DBT34 exhibited significant catalase and SOD-like activity with 158.21 U resulting in a 55.15% reduction in ROS. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of a crude methanolic extract of strain DBT34 on DPPH radical scavenging and ABTS radical cation decolorization were 41.5 µg/mL and 47.8 µg/mL, respectively. Volatile compounds (VOC) were also detected in the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. strain DBT34 using GC-MS analysis to correlate their presence with bioactive potential. Treatments of rats with DBT34 extract and sitagliptin resulted in a significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.001) reduction in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and VLDL-cholesterol, relative to the vehicle control and a standard diabetic medicine. The pancreatic histoarchitecture of vehicle control rats exhibited a compact volume of isolated clusters of Langerhans cells surrounded by acinies with proper vaculation. An in-vivo study of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; sp. strain DBT34 on chickpea seedlings revealed an enhancement in its antioxidant potential as denoted by lower IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity under greenhouse conditions in relative comparison to control plants. Results of the study indicate that strain DBT34 provides a defense mechanism to its host through the production of antioxidant therapeutic agents that mitigate ROS in hosts subjected to biotic and abiotic stresses.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ginseng is a traditional medicinal herb commonly consumed world-wide owing to its unique family of saponins called ginsenosides. The absorption and bioavailability of ginsenosides mainly depend on an individual's gastrointestinal bioconversion abilities. There is a need to improve ginseng processing to predictably increase the pharmacologically active of ginsenosides. Various types of ginseng, such as fresh, white, steamed, acid-processed, and fermented ginsengs, are available. The various ginseng processing methods produce a range ginsenoside compositions with diverse pharmacological properties. This review is intended to summarize the properties of the ginsenosides found in different &lt;i&gt;Panax&lt;/i&gt; species as well as the different processing methods. The sugar moiety attached to the C-3, C-6, or C-20 deglycosylated to produce minor ginsenosides, such as Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd→Rg3, F2, Rh2; Re, Rf→Rg1, Rg2, F1, Rh1. The malonyl-Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd were demalonylated into ginsenoside Rb1, Rb2, Rc, and Rd by dehydration. Dehydration also produces minor ginsenosides such as Rg3→Rk1, Rg5, Rz1; Rh2→Rk2, Rh3; Rh1→Rh4, Rk3; Rg2→Rg6, F4; Rs3→Rs4, Rs5; Rf→Rg9, Rg10. Acetylation of several ginsenosides may generate acetylated ginsenosides Rg5, Rk1, Rh4, Rk3, Rs4, Rs5, Rs6, and Rs7. Acid processing methods produces Rh1→Rk3, Rh4; Rh2→Rk1, Rg5; Rg3→Rk2, Rh3; Re, Rf, Rg2→F1, Rh1, Rf2, Rf3, Rg6, F4, Rg9. Alkaline produces Rh16, Rh3, Rh1, F4, Rk1, ginsenoslaloside-I, 20(S)-ginsenoside-Rh1-60-acetate, 20(R)-ginsenoside Rh19, zingibroside-R1 through hydrolysis, hydration addition reactions, and dehydration. Moreover, biological processing of ginseng generates the minor ginsenosides of Rg3, F2, Rh2, CK, Rh1, Mc, compound O, compound Y through hydrolysis reactions, and synthetic ginsenosides Rd12 and Ia are produced through glycosylation. This review with respect to the properties of particular ginsenosides could serve to increase the utilization of ginseng in agricultural products, food, dietary supplements, health supplements, and medicines, and may also spur future development of novel highly functional ginseng products through a combination of various processing methods.">

The compound analyses showed good calibration curve linearity (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0.999) and low detection and quantifications limit. These results validated the method for its use in the simultaneous quantitative evaluation of phenolic compounds in the studied &lt;i&gt;Iris&lt;/i&gt; sp. &lt;i&gt;I. hungarica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;I. variegata&lt;/i&gt; rhizomes exhibited antioxidant activity, as demonstrated by the HPLC-ABTS system and NRF2 expression assay and anti-inflammatory activity on respiratory burst in human neutrophils. Moreover, the extracts showed anti-allergic and cytotoxic effects against cancer cells. Anti-coronavirus 229E and lipid formation activities were also evaluated. In summary, potent antioxidant marker compounds were identified in the examined &lt;i&gt;Iris&lt;/i&gt; sp.">

This work aims to study phytochemical composition as well as acute and subacute toxicity of &lt;i&gt;W. frutescens&lt;/i&gt; hydroethanolic extract in mice. The phytochemical composition of &lt;i&gt;W. frutescens&lt;/i&gt; extract was performed using gas chromatographic analysis. Acute toxicity was studied in vivo with oral administration of single doses 400 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg, and 2000 mg/kg for 14 days. Subacute toxicity was studied with the administration of repeated doses of 400 mg/kg/day and 2000 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Phytochemical analysis of &lt;i&gt;W. frutescens&lt;/i&gt; hydro-ethanolic extract confirmed the presence of interesting chemical compounds. Acute toxicity results showed no toxic symptoms in mice treated with an increasing dose up to a maximum of 2000 mg/kg. Alongside acute toxicity, subacute data showed no clinical symptoms nor biochemical or histological alteration in mice treated with an increasing dose up to a maximum of 2000 mg/kg compared to the control group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). This study shows no toxic effects in animals treated with &lt;i&gt;W. frutescens&lt;/i&gt; extract, and, therefore, this plant can be considered safe in animals up to 2000 mg/kg under both acute and subacute toxicity conditions.">

This study aims (1) at exploring polyphenols profiles from two types of extracts-aqueous (herbal infusion) and acetonic (polyphenol rich) extracts from &lt;i&gt;A. borbonica&lt;/i&gt; leaves-and (2) at evaluating their potential toxicity in vivo for the first time. We first demonstrated that, whatever type of extraction is used, both extracts displayed significant antioxidant properties and acid phenolic and flavonoid contents. By using selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we performed polyphenol identification and quantification. Among the 19 identified polyphenols, we reported that the main ones were caffeic acid derivatives and quercetin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-rutinoside. Then, we performed a Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity test to assess the toxicity of both extracts following the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. In both zebrafish embryos and larvae, the polyphenols-rich extract obtained by acetonic extraction followed by evaporation and resuspension in water exhibits a higher toxic effect with a median lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 5.6 g/L) compared to the aqueous extract (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 20.3 g/L). Our data also reveal that at non-lethal concentrations of 2.3 and 7.2 g/L for the polyphenol-rich extract and herbal infusion, respectively, morphological malformations such as spinal curvature, pericardial edema, and developmental delay may occur. In conclusion, our study strongly suggests that the evaluation of the toxicity of medicinal plants should be systematically carried out and considered when studying therapeutic effects on living organisms.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background/Aims Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented an unprecedented challenge for non-COVID related clinical trials of investigational medicinal medicines (CTIMPs). These challenges are considerable for trials run in high -risk groups, such as older adults. Clinical trials must ensure the safety of their participants, whilst also considering the potential, and often long-term, benefits of the trial intervention to public health. Here we sought to provide a brief perspective on the response and conduct of CTIMPs relevant to older adults and neurology in the UK to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study, surveying CTIMP teams running trials broadly relevant to older adults and neurology in the UK, as well as sponsors and Clinical Trials Units (CTU), to understand the response and preparedness to the pandemic. Results Due to the pandemic, active recruitment has been suspended in more than half of the trials. The primary driver for the temporary halt of recruitment activity was considerations of patient safety. Interestingly, the majority of trials, sponsors and CTUs did not consider pandemic or epidemic outbreaks in their risk assessments before January 2020. Conclusion These findings support the need to re-evaluate the risk-management approach whereby clinical trials establish contingency plans for predicted but rare events to minimise the disruption to recruitment and clinical trial delivery.">

        <span class="abst" title="Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have proven to possess advantages in counteracting virus infections according to clinical practices. It's therefore of great value to discover novel antivirals from TCMs. In this paper, One hundred medicinal plants which have been included in TCM prescriptions for antiviral treatment were selected and prefractionated into 5 fractions each by sequentially using cyclohexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol, and water. 500 TCM-simplified extracts were then subjected to a phenotypic screening using a recombinant IAV expressing Gaussia luciferase. Ten TCM fractions were identified to possess antiviral activities against influenza virus. The IC50's of the hit fractions range from 1.08 to 6.45 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, while the SIs, from 7.52 to 98.40. Furthermore, all the ten hit fractions inhibited the propagation of progeny influenza virus significantly at 20 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. The hit TCM fractions deserve further isolation for responsible constituents leading towards anti-influenza drugs. Moreover, a library consisting of 500 simplified TCM extracts was established, facilitating antiviral screening in quick response to emerging and re-emerging viruses such as Ebola virus and current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.">

        <span class="abst" title="Bambara groundnut (&lt;i&gt;Vigna subterranea&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Verdc.) [BGN] is an easy-to-cultivate vegetable crop neglected over the past years. It is a drought-tolerant crop with nutritional and medicinal values and as a result, the crop is referred to as nutraceuticals. Based on this, there exist a need to review the beneficial potential (nutraceutical value) of this neglected and underutilized crop to protect and promote its cultivation for food (source of nutrients) and medicines especially among rural poor communities in sub-Saharan Africa. This review systematically examines the background information and uses of BGN. The antimicrobial properties of BGN were also considered and examined to ascertain its nutraceutical importance. BGN has been reported as a crop possessing antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Clinically, the extracts of BGN have been reported to exhibit antimicrobial activities against bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 700603, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 27853, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 33591, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;, yeast (&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;) and mold (&lt;i&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/i&gt;). This review outlines the uses of BGN as a functional food crop as well as its nutraceutical and antimicrobial potentials. However, there exist paucity of knowledge and literature on the crop's antimicrobial activities especially against plant pathogens of economic importance. Hence, this review proposes that more research be geared towards assessing the nutraceutical value and antimicrobial potentials of this crop against plant pathogens of economic importance and the promotion of the crop's cultivation.">

Plants are large reservoir of secondary metabolites largely untapped or under-tapped for use as pesticides. One problem associated with this is to identify plants which can be assessed and further exploited for this use. &lt;i&gt;Borreria verticillata&lt;/i&gt; belongs to &lt;i&gt;Rubiaceae&lt;/i&gt;, it is native to South Americas but gained popularity globally. It is known as a weed, showing resistance to many synthetic pesticides and can be grown on a wide range of soil types. &lt;i&gt;B. verticillata&lt;/i&gt; is used traditionally against skin diseases such as eczema, infectious dermatitis and scabies&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Its antimicrobial application is large and efficient as revealed by most authors. This article inclines to propose and offer current studies with information on the various application of this plant species against various microorganisms, thereby extending its use against plant parasitic nematodes which cause severe yield losses to numerous agricultural crops. Most search engines, journals and dissertation search engines i.e. Google scholar, pubmed, sciencedirect, scopus, web of science, springer, elsevier, like Open-thesis, OATD, ProQuest and EthOs were queried by employing titles such as &lt;i&gt;B. verticillata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Borreria verticillata&lt;/i&gt; and biological activity of &lt;i&gt;B. verticillata&lt;/i&gt;. The most synonymous name was queried too i.e. &lt;i&gt;Spermacoce verticillata&lt;/i&gt;. This review suggests a main point about this resistant weed i.e. its significant antimicrobial activity. It further emphases the need exploits this useful effect against nematodes since they are microorganisms. Phytochemistry of the &lt;i&gt;B. verticillata&lt;/i&gt; was gathered in this study and the compounds isolated from the plant i.e. terpenes, iridoids, flavonoids and alkaloids (29 compounds) further provide a basis for a significant antihelmintic effect. The review concludes on the need to extends its antimicrobial activity to sustainable agriculture. Since it is a very common plant in Nigeria, it is easily accessible to farmer protect their cultivations from plant-parasitic nematode attacks.">

        <span class="abst" title="Mycotoxins present a great concern to food safety and security due to their adverse health and socio-economic impacts. The necessity to formulate novel strategies that can mitigate the economic and health effects associated with mycotoxin contamination of food and feed commodities without any impact on public health, quality and nutritional value of food and feed, economy and trade industry become imperative. Various strategies have been adopted to mitigate mycotoxin contamination but often fall short of the required efficacy. One of the promising approaches is the use of bioactive plant components/metabolites synergistically with mycotoxin-absorbing components in order to limit exposure to these toxins and associated negative health effects. In particular, is the fabrication of β-cyclodextrin-based nanosponges encapsulated with bioactive compounds of plant origin to inhibit toxigenic fungi and decontaminate mycotoxins in food and feed without leaving any health and environmental hazard to the consumers. The present paper reviews the use of botanicals extracts and their phytochemicals coupled with β-cyclodextrin-based nanosponge technology to inhibit toxigenic fungal invasion and detoxify mycotoxins.">

In view of that, three tropical tanniferous plants &lt;i&gt;Rhus glutinosa, Syzygium guineensa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Albizia gumifera,&lt;/i&gt; were selected based on their relative high content of condensed tannins.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, eggs were collected from artificially infected with &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt;. Then the egg was directly subjected to invitro assay with these condensed tannin-enriched extracts using egg hatchability assay and inhibition of larval development assay.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The result showed that extracts from all three tropical tanniferous plants demonstrated statistically significant (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) dosedependent inhibition of both egg hatchability and larval development. According to IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and IC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; values, the condensed tannin-enriched extracts inhibiting egg hatching and larval development most potently were &lt;i&gt;Rhus glutinosa&lt;/i&gt; followed in descending order of activity by &lt;i&gt;Syzygium guineensa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Albizia gumifera.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;The result of this study showed that these condensed tanninenriched extracts were effective in inhibiting egg hatchability as well as larval development. Therefore, condensed tannin might be recommended as one of the options for the control of &lt;i&gt;H. contortus&lt;/i&gt; in sheep.">

Here, we report on the bio-guided fractionation of &lt;i&gt;H. noldeae&lt;/i&gt; and assessment of the inhibitory properties of some fractions and purified compounds on NLRP3 inflammasome and Interleukin 6 (IL-6). The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was determined by detecting the activity of caspase-1 and the production of Interleukin 1β (IL-1β) in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and ATP-stimulated Tamm-Horsfall Protein 1 (THP-1) macrophages, while the production of IL-6 was studied in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. It was observed that hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the crude extract of the aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;H. noldeae&lt;/i&gt;, as well as caffeic acid, isoquercetin, and ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions revealed significant inhibitory effects on Caspase-1 activities, and on IL-1β and IL-6 production. The ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions downregulated the production of IL-1β and IL-6, in a similar range as the caspase-1 inhibitor AC-YVAD-CHO and the drug Dexamethasone, both used as controls, respectively. Overall, our work does provide the very first scientific based evidence for &lt;i&gt;Hibiscus noldeae&lt;/i&gt; anti-inflammatory effects and widespread use by traditional healers in Rwanda for a variety of ailments.">

In regard to this, essential oils-natural and liquid secondary plant metabolites-are gaining importance for their use in the protection of foods, since they are accepted as safe and healthy. Although research studies indicate that the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of essential oils (EOs) are more common compared to other biological activities, specific concerns have led scientists to investigate the areas that are still in need of research. To the best of our knowledge, there is no review paper in which antifungal and especially antimycotoxigenic effects are compiled. Further, the low stability of essential oils under environmental conditions such as temperature and light has forced scientists to develop and use recent approaches such as encapsulation, coating, use in edible films, etc. This review provides an overview of the current literature on essential oils mainly on antifungal and antimycotoxigenic but also their antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Additionally, the recent applications of EOs including encapsulation, edible coatings, and active packaging are outlined.">

This study focuses on the encapsulation of &lt;i&gt;Saccocalyx satureioides&lt;/i&gt; Coss. et Durieu essential oil into nanoemulsions by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) and its effect on the volatile constituents and the antioxidant and anticancer activities of the essential oil. The analysis of hydrodistilled (HD) &lt;i&gt;S. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; essential oil using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed a total of 28 constituents, representing 99.80%, while only 13 constituents were identified in nanoemulsions, representing 98.65% of the total volatile material. The use of HPH led to qualitative and quantitative differences between the volatile profiles of the HD and the nanoemulsion of &lt;i&gt;S. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. Whereas borneol, α-terpineol, and thymol were the predominant constituents in the HD oil, carvacrol, thymol, and γ-terpinene were the major constituents in the nanoemulsion. The antioxidant activity of the &lt;i&gt;S. satureioides&lt;/i&gt; essential oil nanoemulsion displayed was lower as compared to that of HD oil using DPPH free radical-scavenging, CUPRAC, and ABTS assays. This is consistent with the differences in total flavonoid, total phenolic, and volatiles detected in both HD oil and its nanoemulsion. Meanwhile, the cytotoxicity on liver cancer cells (Hep-G2) was stronger using nanoemulsions (106 μg/mL) than using HD oil (274.8 μg/mL).">

The present study was carried out to determine the possible anti-inflammatory, analgesic, neuropharmacological and anti-diarrhoeal activity of the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;B. pilosa&lt;/i&gt; leaves (MEBPL) through in vitro, in vivo and in silico approaches. In the anti-inflammatory study, evaluated by membrane stabilizing and protein denaturation methods, MEBPL showed a significant and dose dependent inhibition. The analgesic effect of MEBPL tested by inducing acetic acid and formalin revealed significant inhibition of pain in both tests. During the anxiolytic evaluation, the extract exhibited a significant and dose-dependent reduction of anxiety-like behaviour in mice. Similarly, mice treated with MEBPL demonstrated dose-dependent reduction in locomotion effect in the open field test and increased sedative effect in the thiopental sodium induced sleeping test. MEBPL also showed good anti-diarrheal activity in both castor oil induced diarrheal and intestinal motility tests. Besides, a previously isolated compound (beta-sitosterol) exhibited good binding affinity in docking and drug-likeliness properties in ADME/T studies. Overall, &lt;i&gt;B. pilosa&lt;/i&gt; is a biologically active plant and could be a potential source of drug leads, which warrants further advanced study.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Peltophorum pterocarpum&lt;/i&gt; is regarded as one of the most important medicinal plants in the traditional medicine system of Vietnam. However, scientific evidence for the antioxidant effects against lipid peroxidation and the potential effects in cancer of this plant are lacking. In our experiments, 70% ethanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;P. pterocarpum&lt;/i&gt; leaves (LPP) and stem bark (SPP) were evaluated for their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines. Both LPP and SPP inhibited Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated LDL by increasing the lag time of conjugated diene formation and inhibiting the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in a dose-dependent manner. In cancer cells, LPP and SPP triggered the most potent cytotoxic effects against human leukemia cells, CRF-SBA and HL-60, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values ranging from 118.5 to 157.2 µg/mL. SPP exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MIA PACA2, A549, and KG cell lines with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 167.5, 244.1 and 255.0 µg/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, LPP showed cytotoxic activity against KG with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 228.1 µg/mL. SPP mediated cytotoxicity in HL-60 and CCRF-SBA cells through the activation of the apoptosis pathway, including the activation of caspases 3, and 9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). These results suggested that SPP may prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis and leukemia in humans.">

The &lt;i&gt;C. grandiflora&lt;/i&gt; flower ethanol extract (CFEE) was purified by HPD600, and the QSI activities were examined in further detail. CFEE inhibited violacein production of &lt;i&gt;Chromobacterium violaceum&lt;/i&gt; 026 in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibit the swarming abilities of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; PAO1. Furthermore, CFEE could inhibited biofilm formation and destroyed mature biofilms of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 and &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; PAO1. The composition of CFEE was determined by UPLC-MS/MS to distinguish active QSI compounds, and 21 compounds were identified. In addition to gallic acid and caffeic acid, two organic acids, malic acid and succinic acid, were confirmed for the first time to have autoinducer type 1 QSI activities. Therefore, CFEE is a potential QSI that could be used as a novel antimicrobial agent and should be considered for medicinal development.">

        <span class="abst" title="Winter Savory (&lt;i&gt;Satureja montana&lt;/i&gt; L.) has been used in traditional medicine and as a spice or natural food preservative in the Mediterranean region for centuries. In this paper, some technological and analytical aspects of the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; tinctures development and an evaluation of the essential oil composition are provided. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents and phenolic compounds profile analyzed spectrophotometrically and by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), respectively, were evaluated in the developed tinctures. The results showed that the tinctures prepared from the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; herb by maceration or remaceration are rich in polyphenols, and there is an influence of the technological factors (particle size and extraction mode) on the total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Caffeic, rosmarinic, and chlorogenic acids, (-)-catechin and rutin were identified in the tinctures using the HPTLC method. &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-Thymol (81.79%) revealed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was the predominant compound of the essential oil of this plant. Thus, the high contents of polyphenols and flavonoids in the developed tinctures and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-thymol among the volatile components of the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; essential oil could indicate the promising antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of these herbal preparations. The obtained results are a ground for the organization of the manufacture of the &lt;i&gt;S. montana&lt;/i&gt; tincture and essential oil with the purpose of performing preclinical studies.">

The capsaicin and AuNPs were packed within HTCs in HTCs-capsaicin, HTCs-AuNP, and HTCs-AuNPs/capsaicin nanofibrous mats. In vitro antibacterial testing against &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella multocida, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus pyogenes,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/i&gt; was conducted in comparison with difloxacin and chloramphenicol antibiotics. Cell viability and proliferation of the developed nanofibers were evaluated using an MTT assay. Finally, in vivo study of the wound-closure process was performed on New Zealand white rabbits. The results indicate that HTCs-capsaicin and HTCs-AuNPs are suitable in inhibiting bacterial growth compared with HTCs and HTCs-capsaicin/AuNP nanofibers and antibiotics (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01). The MTT assay demonstrates that the nanofibrous mats increased cell proliferation compared with the untreated control (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01). In vivo results show that the developed mats enhanced the wound-closure rate more effectively than the control samples. The novel nanofibrous wound dressings provide a relatively rapid and efficacious wound-healing ability, making the obtained nanofibers promising candidates for the development of improved bandage materials.">

        <span class="abst" title="Thai basil is a renowned medicinal plant and a rich source of bioactive antioxidant compounds with several health benefits, with actions to prevent of cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Plant cell and tissue culture technologies can be routinely established as an important, sustainable and low-cost biomass source to produce high-value phytochemicals. The current study aimed at developing an effective protocol to produce Thai basil leaf-derived callus cultures with sustainable and high production of biomass and antioxidants as an alternative of leaves production. MS basal medium with various concentrations of plant growth regulators (PGRs) compatible with nutraceutical applications (i.e., gibberellic acid (GA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) either alone or in combination with naphthalene acetic acid (NAA)) were evaluated. Among all tested PGRs, the combination BAP:NAA (5 mg/L:1 mg/L) yields the maximum biomass accumulation (fresh weight (FW): 190 g/L and dry weight (DW): 13.05 g/L) as well as enhanced phenolic (346.08 mg/L) production. HPLC quantification analysis indicated high productions of chicoric acid (35.77 mg/g DW) and rosmarinic acid (7.35 mg/g DW) under optimized callus culture conditions. Antioxidant potential was assessed using both in vitro cell free and in vivo cellular antioxidant assays. Maximum in vitro antioxidant activity DPPH (93.2% of radical scavenging activity) and ABTS (1322 µM Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) was also observed for the extracts from callus cultures grown in optimal conditions. In vivo cellular antioxidant activity assay confirmed the effective protection against oxidative stress of the corresponding extract by the maximum inhibition of ROS and RNS production. Compared to commercial leaves, callus extracts showed higher production of chicoric acid and rosmarinic acid associated with higher antioxidant capacity. In addition, this biological system also has a large capacity for continuous biomass production, thus demonstrating its high potential for possible nutraceutical applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;In the EU, clinical assessors, rapporteurs and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use are obliged to assess the ethical aspects of a clinical development program and include major ethical flaws in the marketing authorization deliberation processes. To this date, we know very little about the manner that these regulators put this obligation into action. In this paper, we intend to look into the manner and the extent that ethical issues discovered during inspection have reached the deliberation processes.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;To gather data, we used the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board database and first searched for the inspections, and their accompanying site inspection reports and integrated inspection reports, related to central marketing authorization applications (henceforth, application/s) of drugs submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) from 2011 to 2015. We then extracted inspection findings that were purely of ethical nature, i.e., those that did not affect the benefit/risk balance of the study (issues related to informed consent, research ethics committees, and respect for persons). Only findings graded at least major by the inspectorate were included. Lastly, to identify how many of the ethically relevant findings (ERFs) reach the application deliberation processes, we extracted the relevant joint response assessment reports and reviewed the sections that discussed inspection findings.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;From 2011 to 2015, there were 390 processed applications, of which 65 had inspection reports and integrated inspection reports accessible via the database of the Dutch Medicines Evaluation Board. Of the 65, we found ERFs in 37 (56.9%). The majority of the ERFs were graded as major and half of the time it was informed-consent related. A third of these findings were related to research ethics committee processes and requirements. Of the 37 inspections with ERFs, 30 were endorsed in the integrated inspection reports as generally GCP compliant. Day 150 joint response assessment reports and Day 180 list of outstanding issues were reviewed for all 37 inspections, and none of the ERFs were carried over in any of the assessment reports or list of outstanding issues.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;None of the ethically relevant findings, all of which were graded as major or critical in integrated inspection reports, were explicitly carried over to the joint assessment reports. This calls for more transparency in EMA application deliberations on how ERFs are considered, if at all, in the decision-making processes.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Scrophularia amplexicaulis&lt;/i&gt; is an Iranian endemic plant belonging to the Scrophulariaceae family, which is used in traditional medicine to treat many diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; anticancer activity of &lt;i&gt;S. amplexicaulis&lt;/i&gt; extracts against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and mouse fibrosarcoma (WEHI-164) cell lines. The ground aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;S. amplexicaulis&lt;/i&gt; were soxhlet-extracted with n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol. MTT assay exhibited that dichloromethane and methanol extracts remarkbly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 and WEHI-164 cancer cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner with little cytotoxicity on normal cell line HUVEC. Cell death ELISA, TUNEL assay, and the cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) uncovered that the cytotoxic effects of dichloromethane and methanol extracts were attributed to apoptosis in cancerous cells. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR revealed significant increases in the mRNA expression levels of p-53, caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax, and also a decrease in Bcl-2 expression. These results suggested that the extracts mainly induced apoptosis via a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway. Notably, dichloromethane extract had higher cytotoxic and apoptotic activities than that of methanol extract, against both cancer cell lines, particularly MCF-7 cells. Our results indicate that &lt;i&gt;S. amplexicaulis&lt;/i&gt; may serve as a promising source of potent agents for the treatment of human cancers.">

The extracts were tested in anti-inflammatory assays against cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenase, and the safety profile was determined in a cell-based in-vitro assay.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane fraction of &lt;i&gt;G. mollis&lt;/i&gt; leaf extracts had significant activity against both COX-1 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; =0.97±1.9 µg/mL) and COX-2 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; =1.13±0.2 µg/mL) better than the indomethacin positive control (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; =1.3±0.6 and 1.52±0.2 µg/mL), respectively (p≤ 0.05). Also, all the extracts and fractions of &lt;i&gt;G. mollis&lt;/i&gt; tested inhibited the activity of 15-LOX (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; =12.48±2.9 to 29.43±9.9 µg/mL) better than the quercetin reference control (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; =61.82±5.5 µg/mL), with the butanol fraction demonstrating the best anti-15 LOX action (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; =12.48±2.9 µg/mL). Furthermore, all the extracts and fractions of &lt;i&gt;G. mollis&lt;/i&gt; had relatively lower cytotoxicity on vero monkey kidney cells (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; =30.56-479±0.07 µg/mL) compared to the doxorubicin positive control (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; =2.59 µg/mL), but the selectivity index (SI=1.04-1.89) determination suggested that some of the extracts may contain toxic constituents.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Organic extracts of the leaves of &lt;i&gt;Grewia mollis&lt;/i&gt; contained bioactive molecules with potent action on COX-2 and 15-LOX. Targeted high-resolution high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) methods have streamlined and enhanced bioactive compound isolation and purification process. This allows for the separation of undesirable compounds that could cause metabolic cytotoxicity in the plant extract mixtures. The method could be used to develop an alternative therapeutic strategy to manage pain associated with chronic inflammation where the use of NSAID is problematic.">

Specifically, hCA II and VII, putative main CA targets when central nervous system (CNS) diseases are concerned, were most efficiently activated by these oxime ether derivatives. Furthermore, a multitude of selective hCA VII activators were identified. As hCA VII is one of the key isoforms involved in brain metabolism and other brain functions, the identified potent and selective hCA VII activators may be considered of interest for investigations of various therapeutic applications or as lead compounds in search of even more potent and selective CA activators.">

Results showed that the total phenolic content of the aqueous leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;Ricinus communis&lt;/i&gt; L. (RCE) was 48.39 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram dry weight (DW). The flavonoid content was 9.76 mg quercetin dihydrate equivalent (QE)/g DW. Ferrous chelating activity was approximately 56.2% with an RCE concentration of 1 mg/mL; the highest chelating activity was 91.2% with 4 mg/mL extract. The reducing power of 1 mg/mL RC was 1.17 times better than 1 mg/mL butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 12.5 mg/mL RCE was equivalent to 3.09 mg/mL Trolox. RCE (10 mg/mL) had a lipid oxidative inhibition capacity of 35.3%. A total of 80 ISA brown laying hens at twenty-nine weeks of age were randomly allocated into the control or 1 of 3 treatment groups; the latter received 0.5%, 1% or 2% of RC, respectively, for 12 weeks. Results showed that the RC supplementation improved the feed conversion rate and 0.5% RC generated the best results. Additionally, the egg yolk score was significantly increased in all RC-supplemented groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference in serum characteristics between the treatment groups. Serum antioxidant enzyme activity showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased in the RC-supplemented groups relative to the control but was not significantly different. mRNA expression levels of the antioxidant regulatory genes &lt;i&gt;GCLC&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GST, HO-1, SOD1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;SOD2&lt;/i&gt; were significantly increased with 2% RC supplementation. In summary, RC is a suitable feed additive for laying hens and the addition of 0.5% RC leaf powder resulted in the greatest benefits.">

The natural ingredient quercetin isolated from &lt;i&gt;I. verum&lt;/i&gt; could effectively inhibit SGIV infection in a dose-dependent manner. The possible antiviral mechanism of quercetin was further analyzed in this study. It showed that quercetin did obvious damages to SGIV particles. Furthermore, quercetin could interfere with SGIV binding to targets on host cells (by 76.14%), disturb SGIV invading into host cells (by 56.03%), and effect SGIV replication in host cells (by 52.73%), respectively. Quercetin had the best antiviral effects during the SGIV life cycle of binding to the receptors on host cells' membranes. Overall, the results suggest that quercetin has direct and host-mediated antiviral effects against SGIV and holds great potential for developing effective drugs to control SGIV infection in aquaculture.">

Their antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and cancer-preventing activities have been extensively reported. Due to their wide use as food preservers and additives, as well as their use in agriculture, perfumes, and make-up products, these complex mixtures of volatile compounds have gained importance from a commercial point of view, not only in the pharmaceutical industry, but also in agronomic, food, cosmetic, and perfume industries. An analysis of the recent scientific literature allowed us to highlight the presence of an increasing number of studies on the potential antiarthritic properties of EOs and their main constituents, which seems to suggest a new interesting potential therapeutic application. The aim of this review is to examine the current knowledge on the beneficial effects of essential oils in the treatment of arthritic diseases, providing an overview of the reports on the in vivo and in vitro effects of EOs. Furthermore, this review critically examines the recent findings on the potential roles of the main components of EOs in the exerted beneficial effects. Obtained negative results are also reported.">

Although commercially available or ad hoc produced, their synthesis and purification are necessary, increasing time and costs. To address this limitation, here we suggest a revision of this methodology, by performing a &lt;i&gt;chemo-enzymatic approach&lt;/i&gt;, by using a BG-substrate containing an azide group appropriately distanced by a spacer from the benzyl ring. The SNAP-&lt;i&gt;tag&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and its relative thermostable version (&lt;i&gt;Ss&lt;/i&gt;OGT-&lt;i&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ) proved to be very active on this substrate. The stability of these &lt;i&gt;tags&lt;/i&gt; upon enzymatic reaction makes possible the exposition to the solvent of the azide-moiety linked to the catalytic cysteine, compatible for the subsequent conjugation with DBCO-derivatives by azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition. Our studies propose a strengthening and an improvement in terms of biotechnological applications for this self-labelling &lt;i&gt;protein-tag&lt;/i&gt;.">

Our research aims to find the optimal light-emitting diode (LED) lighting conditions to improve the growth and development of &lt;i&gt;A. roxburghii&lt;/i&gt; seedling at the acclimation stage. Two-month-old explants were cultured under the various lighting conditions including red (R), blue (B), BR (one blue: four red), BRW151 (one blue: five red: one white), BRW142 (one blue: four red: two white), and fluorescent lamp (FL). The results showed that the lighting conditions not only affect the growth and morphology of plants but also the accumulation of total flavonoids. Single wavelengths (B or R LED) inhibited the growth and secondary biosynthesis of &lt;i&gt;A. roxburghii&lt;/i&gt;, while the BR LED showed an enhancement in both growth and biomass accumulation. &lt;i&gt;A. roxburghii&lt;/i&gt; plants were grown under BR LED light has average plant height (7.18 cm), stem diameter (17.6mm), number of leaves (5.78 leaves/tree), leaf area (4.67 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), fresh weight (0.459 g/tree), dry matter percentages (11.69%), and total flavonoid (1.811 mg/g FW) is considered to be superior to FL lamps and other LEDs in the experiment. This indicates that both blue and red wavelengths are required for the normal growth of &lt;i&gt;A. roxburghii&lt;/i&gt;. To learn more about how light affects flavonoid biosynthesis, we evaluated the expression of genes involved in this process (&lt;i&gt;pal&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;chs&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;chi&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;fls&lt;/i&gt;) and found that BR LED light enhances the expression level of &lt;i&gt;chi&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fls&lt;/i&gt; genes compared to fluorescent lamps (1.18 and 1.21 times, respectively), leading to an increase in the flavonoid content of plant. Therefore, applying BR LED during in vitro propagation of &lt;i&gt;A. roxburghii&lt;/i&gt; could be a feasible way to improve the medicinal value of this plant.">

        <span class="abst" title="Improvement of the medical textile industry has received more attention recently, especially with widespread of microbial and viral infections. Medical textiles with new properties, such as bacterial pathogens self-cleaning, have been explored with nanotechnology. In this study, an endophytic actinomycetes strain of &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces laurentii&lt;/i&gt; R-1 was isolated from the roots of the medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Achillea fragrantissima.&lt;/i&gt; This is used as a catalyst for the mediated biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) for applications in the textile industry. The biosynthesized Ag-NPs were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray Diffraction (XRD), which confirmed the successful formation of crystalline, spherical metal nanoparticles. The biosynthesized Ag-NPs exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Our data elucidated that the biosynthesized Ag-NPs had a highly cytotoxic effect against the cancerous caco-2 cell line. The selected safe dose of Ag-NPs for loading on cotton fabrics was 100 ppm, regarding their antibacterial activity and safe cytotoxic efficacy. Interestingly, scanning electron microscope connected with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) of loaded cotton fabrics demonstrated the smooth distribution of Ag-NPs on treated fabrics. The obtained results highlighted the broad-spectrum activity of nano-finished fabrics against pathogenic bacteria, even after 5 and 10 washing cycles. This study contributes a suitable guide for the performance of green synthesized NPs for utilization in different biotechnological sectors.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Citrus hystrix&lt;/i&gt; (CH) is a beneficial plant utilized in traditional folk medicine to relieve various health ailments. The antisenescent mechanisms of CH extracts were investigated using human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y). Phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities of CH extracts were analyzed using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) assay and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assay. Effects of CH extracts on high glucose-induced cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cell cycle arrest and cell cycle-associated proteins were assessed using a 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide tetrazolium (MTT) assay, non-fluorescent 2', 7'-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DCFDA) assay, flow cytometer and Western blot. The extracts protected neuronal senescence by inhibiting ROS generation. CH extracts induced cell cycle progression by releasing senescent cells from the G1 phase arrest. As the Western blot confirmed, the mechanism involved in cell cycle progression was associated with the downregulation of cyclin D1, phospho-cell division cycle 2 (pcdc2) and phospho-Retinoblastoma (pRb) proteins. Furthermore, the Western blot showed that extracts increased Surtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression by increasing the phosphorylation of Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Collectively, CH extracts could protect high glucose-induced human neuronal senescence by inducing cell cycle progression and up-regulation of SIRT1, thus leading to the improvement of the neuronal cell functions.">

In the present study, extracts from different &lt;i&gt;Protea&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;caffra&lt;/i&gt; organs were screened against drug-sensitive and -resistant diarrhoeagenic pathogens using the microdilution assay (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC). Twig extracts (70% methanol, MeOH) of the plant were purified and the resultant fractions screened for antibacterial properties (MIC). The chemical profiles of the fractions were determined by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), while ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used to quantify the phenolic acids in the plant. The mutagenic properties of bioactive extracts were assessed using the Ames test. The extracts demonstrated weak-moderate antibacterial properties (MIC: 0.3-0.6 mg/mL). A cold ethyl acetate fraction of MeOH twig extract exhibited significant antibacterial properties (MIC = 0.078 mg/mL) against &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt;. The presence of antibacterial compounds (1-adamantane carboxylic acid, heptacosanol, levoglucosan, nonadecanol) in the plant was putatively confirmed based on GC-MS analysis. Furthermore, UHPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed varying concentrations of phenolic acids (0.08-374.55 µg/g DW). Based on the Ames test, the extracts were non-mutagenic thereby suggesting their safety. To a certain degree, the current study supports the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;Protea caffra&lt;/i&gt; to manage diarrhoea among local communities in South Africa.">

        <span class="abst" title="Kaempferol (KA) is a natural flavonol that can be found in plants and plant-derived foods with a plethora of different pharmacological properties. In the current study, we developed an efficient extraction method for the isolation of KA from ultrasonicated basil leaves (&lt;i&gt;Ocimum basilicum&lt;/i&gt;). We successfully employed a Box-Behnken design (BBD) in order to investigate the effect of different extraction variables including methanol concentration (40-80%), extraction temperature (40-60 °C), and extraction time (5-15 min). The quantification of KA yield was carried out by employing a validated densitometric high performance thin layer chromatography in connection with ultraviolet detection (HPTLC-VIS). The obtained data showed that the quadratic polynomial model (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.98) was the most appropriate. The optimized ultrasonic extraction yielded 94.7 ng/spot of KA when using methanol (79.99%) at 60 °C for 5 min. When using toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid (70:30:1 &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) as a solvent, KA was detected in basil leaves at an Retention factor (Rf) value of 0.26 at 330 nm. Notably, the analytical method was successfully validated with a linear regression of R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.99, which reflected a good linear relationship. The developed HPTLC-VIS method in this study was precise, accurate, and robust due to the lower obtained results from both the percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) and SEM of the &lt;i&gt;O. basilicum.&lt;/i&gt; The antioxidant activity of KA (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0.68 μg/mL) was higher than that of the reference ascorbic acid (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.79 μg/mL) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.88 μg/mL). The development of economical and efficient techniques is very important for the extraction and quantification of important pharmaceutical compounds such as KA.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Polygonum multiflorum&lt;/i&gt; Thunb. is a perennial plant that belongs to Polygonaceae. Root tissues are the main plant parts used as medicinal herbs in Korean oriental medicine. The &lt;i&gt;P. multiflorum&lt;/i&gt; tuber is well known for its medicinal properties in Korean oriental medicine, and it contains a number of useful substances (secondary metabolites of emodin, 2,3,5,4'-tetrahydroxystilbene-2-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-d-glucoside (TSG), etc.) that are increasing in demand, as several studies show that they have beneficial effects on the human body. In this study, the production volumes and useful material content differences between cultured &lt;i&gt;P. multiflorum&lt;/i&gt; seedlings (culture seedlings: CSs), which had been grown using a tissue culture technique under optimized conditions, and existing varieties in circulation (seed seedlings: SSs) were determined using a long-term field test. The growth characteristics of the underground parts were investigated by harvesting the tuberous roots (medicinal parts) after 1 year, and the results showed that the fresh and dry weights of the CS tubers were higher than those of the SS tubers. However, the SS rootlets had higher fresh and dry weights than the CS rootlets. A liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry component analysis of the &lt;i&gt;P. multiflorum&lt;/i&gt; tubers and a Fourier transform near-infrared spectrophotometer analysis of the roots were undertaken. The results showed that the levels of TSG, which is a medicinal substance produced by &lt;i&gt;P. multiflorum&lt;/i&gt;, were higher in the CSs than in the SSs, but the differences were not significant. The CS results from this study will inform future studies on the mass production of &lt;i&gt;P. multiflorum&lt;/i&gt; in the field because the medicinal area was greater in CSs than in SSs.">

        <span class="abst" title="The convergence of nanotechnology and biotechnology has led to substantial advancements in nano-biomaterials (NBMs) used in medical devices (MD) and advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP). However, there are concerns that applications of NBMs for medical diagnostics, therapeutics and regenerative medicine could also pose health and/or environmental risks since the current understanding of their safety is incomplete. A scientific strategy is therefore needed to assess all risks emerging along the life cycles of these products. To address this need, an overarching risk management framework (RMF) for NBMs used in MD and ATMP is presented in this paper, as a result of a collaborative effort of a team of experts within the EU Project BIORIMA and with relevant inputs from external stakeholders. The framework, in line with current regulatory requirements, is designed according to state-of-the-art approaches to risk assessment and management of both nanomaterials and biomaterials. The collection/generation of data for NBMs safety assessment is based on innovative integrated approaches to testing and assessment (IATA). The framework can support stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, regulators, consultants) in systematically assessing not only patient safety but also occupational (including healthcare workers) and environmental risks along the life cycle of MD and ATMP. The outputs of the framework enable the user to identify suitable safe(r)-by-design alternatives and/or risk management measures and to compare the risks of NBMs to their (clinical) benefits, based on efficacy, quality and cost criteria, in order to inform robust risk management decision-making.">

        <span class="abst" title="The &lt;i&gt;Dendropanax&lt;/i&gt; genus is a kind of flowering plant in the family of Araliaceae that encompasses approximately 91 to 95 species. Several &lt;i&gt;Dendropanax&lt;/i&gt; species are used as traditional medicinal plants, extensively used Korea and South America and other parts of the world. Almost every part of the plant, including the leaves, bark, roots, and stems, can be used as traditional medicine for the prevention and management of a broad spectrum of health disorders. This paper sought to summarizes the ethnopharmacological benefits, biological activities, and phytochemical investigations of plants from the genus &lt;i&gt;Dendropanax,&lt;/i&gt; and perhaps to subsequently elucidate potential new perspectives for future pharmacological research to consider. Modern scientific literature suggests that plants of the &lt;i&gt;Dendropanax&lt;/i&gt; genus, together with active compounds isolated from it, possess a wide range of therapeutic and pharmacological applications, including antifungal, anti-complement, antioxidant, antibacterial, insect antifeedant, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, and anti-hypouricemic properties. The botanical descriptions of approximately six to 10 species are provided by different scientific web sources. However, only six species, namely, &lt;i&gt;D. morbiferus, D. gonatopodus, D. dentiger&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D. capillaris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;D. chevalieri,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;D. arboreus&lt;/i&gt;, were included in the present investigation to undergo phytochemical evaluation, due to the unavailability of data for the remaining species. Among these plant species, a high concentration of variable bioactive ingredients was identified. In particular, &lt;i&gt;D. morbifera&lt;/i&gt; is a traditional medicinal plant used for the multiple treatment purposes and management of several human diseases or health conditions. Previous experimental evidence supports that the &lt;i&gt;D. morbifera&lt;/i&gt; species could be used to treat various inflammatory disorders, diarrhea, diabetes, cancer, and some microbial infections. It has recently been reported, by our group and other researchers, that &lt;i&gt;D. morbifera&lt;/i&gt; possesses a neuroprotective and memory-enhancing agent. A total of 259 compounds have been identified among six species, with 78 sourced from five of these species reported to be bioactive. However, there is no up-to-date information concerning the &lt;i&gt;D. morbifera&lt;/i&gt;, its different biological properties, or its prospective benefits in the enhancement of human health. In the present study, we set out to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the botany, traditional medicinal history, and medicinal resources of species of the &lt;i&gt;Dendropanax&lt;/i&gt; genus. In addition, we explore several phytochemical constituents identified in different species of the &lt;i&gt;Dendropanax&lt;/i&gt; genus and their biological properties. Finally, we offer comprehensive analysis findings of the phytochemistry, medicinal uses, pharmacological actions, and a toxicity and safety evaluation of the &lt;i&gt;D. morbifera&lt;/i&gt; species and its main bioactive ingredients for future consideration.">

The antiviral activity was determined using a plaque reduction assay against three common viruses namely, herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1), hepatitis A (HAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The antimicrobial activity was assessed using agar diffusion and microdilution methods and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined. In addition, the anti-mycobacterial evaluation was carried out using the Alamar blue assay and the effect against &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; was investigated. The anti-trypanosomal activity was evaluated using the resazurin method. GC investigations revealed that camphor is the major constituent of both oils accounting for 36.69 and 14.56% in the essential oils from &lt;i&gt;C. indicum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. &lt;i&gt;C. indicum&lt;/i&gt; was biologically more active in all experiments; it exhibited a notable antitrypanosomal activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value equals 45.89 μg/mL and a notable antimicrobial activity versus &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus agalactiae&lt;/i&gt; with a MIC value of 62.5 μg/mL. It also inhibited the replication of VSV with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 3.14 μg/mL. Both oils revealed antioxidant potential with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 2.21 and 2.59 mg/mL for &lt;i&gt;C. indicum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium,&lt;/i&gt; respectively. This study provides evidence beyond the traditional use of both &lt;i&gt;Chrysanthemum indicum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. morifolium&lt;/i&gt; as anti-infective agents. Thus they could be used as spices in food and can be incorporated in different food products and pharmaceutical preparations as natural preservatives possessing antioxidant potential.">

Seeds of &lt;i&gt;Irvingia gabonensis&lt;/i&gt; have been reported to possess both nutritional and medicinal values which include antidiabetic, weight losing, antihyperlipidemic, and antioxidative effects. Protective effects of &lt;i&gt;Irvingia gabonensis&lt;/i&gt; ethanol seed extract (&lt;i&gt;IGESE&lt;/i&gt;) was investigated in doxorubicin (DOX)-mediated cardiotoxicity induced with single intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg of DOX following the oral pretreatments of Wistar rats with 100-400 mg/kg/day of &lt;i&gt;IGESE&lt;/i&gt; for 10 days, using serum cardiac enzyme markers (cardiac troponin I (cTI) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)), cardiac tissue oxidative stress markers (catalase (CAT), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and reduced glutathione (GSH)), and cardiac histopathology endpoints. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative analyses to determine IGESE's secondary metabolites profile and its &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant activities were also conducted. Results revealed that serum cTnI and LDH were significantly elevated by the DOX treatment. Similarly, activities of tissue SOD, CAT, GST, and GSH levels were profoundly reduced, while GPx activity and MDA levels were profoundly increased by DOX treatment. These biochemical changes were associated with microthrombi formation in the DOX-treated cardiac tissues on histological examination. However, oral pretreatments with 100-400 mg/kg/day of &lt;i&gt;IGESE&lt;/i&gt; dissolved in 5% DMSO in distilled water significantly attenuated increases in the serum cTnI and LDH, prevented significant alterations in the serum lipid profile and the tissue activities and levels of oxidative stress markers while improving cardiovascular disease risk indices and DOX-induced histopathological lesions. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant studies showed &lt;i&gt;IGESE&lt;/i&gt; to have good antioxidant profile and contained 56 major secondary metabolites prominent among which are &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-sitosterol, Phytol, neophytadiene, stigmasterol, vitamin E, hexadecanoic acid and its ethyl ester, Phytyl palmitate, campesterol, lupeol, and squalene. Overall, both the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; findings indicate that &lt;i&gt;IGESE&lt;/i&gt; may be a promising prophylactic cardioprotective agent against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, at least in part mediated via &lt;i&gt;IGESE&lt;/i&gt;'s antioxidant and free radical scavenging and antithrombotic mechanisms.">

        <span class="abst" title="Optimizing the processing technology is an effective way to improve the yield of active ingredients for the industrial production of medicinal crops. Baikal Skullcap (&lt;i&gt;Scutellaria baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; Georgi) is a perennial herb in the &lt;i&gt;Lamiaceae&lt;/i&gt; family and its dried root is used as a famous traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Modern pharmacological studies have shown that the active ingredients of &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; have important pharmacological effects including anti-oxidation, anti-bacterial, anti-viral, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammation. Specifically, it is recently found that &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; has significant curative effects on the treatment of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In recent years, the market demand for the medicinal products of &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; is increasing because of its great medicinal values. However, the annual yield of active ingredients originated from the root of &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; is limited due to that little progress has been made on the traditional processing technology used in the extraction process. A pressing issue faced by both herbalists and scientists is how to improve the processing efficiency, thereby obtaining the maximum yield of products for &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, a systematic analysis on the effects of growth years and post-harvest processing on the contents of medicinal active ingredients of &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; was conducted. The contents of eight active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, scutellarin, scutellarein, apigenin, and chrysin) in roots of &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; of different growth years (ranging from 1 year to 15 years) were estimated using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and further analyzed to determine the optimal harvest period. In particular, the contents of six active ingredients in different parts (cortex and stele) of the root of &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; were estimated and compared. Meanwhile, the dynamic changes of the contents of active ingredients in fresh-crush and fresh-cut roots of &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; at room temperature were compared and analyzed to reveal the influence of post-harvest treatment on the contents of active ingredients. In addition, the effects of six different post-harvest treatments on the contents of active ingredients were systematically designed and compared to determine the best primary processing technology. The results showed that the best harvesting period for &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; should be determined as 2-3 years based on comprehensive evaluation of active ingredient content, annual yield increment, and land use efficiency. The contents of active ingredients including baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin in cortex were significantly higher than those in stele (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ≤  0.05). The contents of baicalin, wogonoside, and scutellarin in fresh roots of &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt; significantly reduced as the storage time increased, but the reduction of fresh-cutting was significantly lower than that of fresh-crushing. For the effects of different processing treatments, the contents of four main active ingredients (baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, and wogonin) under drying (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;) and cutting-drying (&lt;i&gt;C-D&lt;/i&gt;) treatments were significantly higher than those of the other four treatments (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ≤  0.05). Collectively, the above results will not only provide novel processing methods that will improve the yield of active ingredients for &lt;i&gt;S. baicalensis&lt;/i&gt;, but also shed light on the optimization of processing technology for the industrial production of medicinal crops.">

In this study, an ethnobotanical survey was undertaken to document medicinal plants used by traditional healers in the Ejisu-Juaben district in the Ashanti region of Ghana to treat infections and to further investigate the antibiofilm formation properties of selected plants in resisting pathogenic bacteria. Seventy medicinal plants used by traditional practitioners for the treatment of skin infections and wounds were documented from the ethnobotanical survey. Forty out of the seventy plants were collected and their methanol extracts evaluated for antimicrobial activity by the agar diffusion assay. Extracts that showed antibacterial activity were tested for biofilm inhibitory activity, and the most active plant was subsequently purified to obtain the active constituents. Biofilm formation was significantly mitigated by petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;Holarrhena floribunda&lt;/i&gt; stem bark. Bioassay-guided fractionation of an alkaloidal extract prepared from the methanol fraction led to the isolation of three steroidal alkaloids, namely, holonamine, holadienine, and conessine. The isolated compounds demonstrated varying degrees of biofilm formation inhibitory properties. The current study reveals that screening of indigenous medicinal plants could unravel potential leads to salvage the declining efficacy of conventional antibiotics. &lt;i&gt;Holarrhena floribunda&lt;/i&gt; stem bark extract has strong biofilm formation inhibition properties, which could be attributed to the presence of steroidal alkaloids.">

Thus, natural compounds with fewer side effects represent a promising source for safe drugs. The genus &lt;i&gt;Senecio&lt;/i&gt; is widely used in folk medicine due to its various pharmacological properties. In the present study, the total phenolic content of &lt;i&gt;Senecio glaucus&lt;/i&gt;, which is grown in Saudi Arabia, was assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteau colorimetric method. Scavenging DPPH and ABTS assays were utilized to determine the antioxidant properties of &lt;i&gt;S. glaucus&lt;/i&gt; fractions, and MTT assay was used to screen the cytotoxic activity of &lt;i&gt;S. glaucus&lt;/i&gt; against various cancer cells. In addition, HPLC-UV was utilized to detect the presence of two phenolic acids, namely, vanillic acid (VA) and gallic acid (GA). Among all fractions tested, &lt;i&gt;S. glaucus&lt;/i&gt; chloroform fraction (SGCF) yielded the highest value (125.3 mg·GA/g) in terms of total phenolic content. SGCF also exhibited the highest scavenging activities (76.7 and 74.1%) on both DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. Similarly, SGCF also possessed the most potent cytotoxic activity against the MCF-7 cell line, with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 41.8 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. The validated HPLC method confirmed the presence of VA (4.8 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mg DW) and GA (3.9 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mg DW) in SGCF. Overall, our data show that &lt;i&gt;S. glaucus&lt;/i&gt; had antioxidant and cytotoxic properties. A developed validated HPLC method which could be helpful for quantifying phenolic compounds in &lt;i&gt;S. glaucus&lt;/i&gt; was established.">

Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the antidiabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic activity of &lt;i&gt;Hagenia abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; leaves crude extract in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Antidiabetic and anti-hyperlipidemic activity of the crude extract of &lt;i&gt;Hagenia abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; was studied in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. The effects of the extract on fasting blood glucose level, body weight, and serum lipid profiles were analyzed. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used for data analysis and p&lt;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Hagenia abyssinica leaves crude extract showed significant (p&lt;0.05-p&lt;0.001) blood-glucose-lowering activity. Moreover, the crude extract of &lt;i&gt;H. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; reduced the fasting blood glucose level by 23.21%, 38.20%, 43.53%, and 58.99%, respectively, for CE100, CE 200, CE 400, and GLC 5 mg/kg on the 14th day of treatment. After diabetic mice were treated with &lt;i&gt;H. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg) for 14 days, there was a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and serum triglyceride and a significant increase in body weight, and HDL-cholesterol level as compared to diabetic control.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The present findings revealed that &lt;i&gt;H. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; leaves could be useful for the management of diabetes mellitus and other abnormalities related to this metabolic disorder. Thus, the present study may support the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;H. abyssinica&lt;/i&gt; for diabetes mellitus treatment.">

In the present study, Chaetomium globosum, an endophytic fungus isolated from Moringa oleifera Lam has been explored for its various biological activities. The chloroformic extract of C. globosum showed good antimutagenicity against the reactive carcinogenic mutagen, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF) in Ames test. The antiproliferative activity against various cell lines such as HCT-15, HeLa and U87-MG was found to be dose dependent and the viability reduced to 9.26%, 15.7% and 16.3%, respectively. Further, the chloroformic fungal extract was investigated for free radical scavenging activity using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzthiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) assay which showed the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 45.16 µg/ml and 50.55 µg/ml, respectively. The fungal extract also showed good ferric reducing power. Total phenolic and flavonoid content was found to be in linear relationship with the antioxidant potential of the fungal extract. High performance liquid chromatography showed the presence of phenolics which may help to combat the free radicals. The presence of various bioactive compounds was analysed by GC-MS which endorsed Chaetomium globosum to be a promising candidate for drug development.">

        <span class="abst" title="Coronaviruses are the causative agents of many infectious diseases in human and animals. These included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian infectious bronchitis (IBV) in poultry, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans. These results had considerable death burdens and negative influences on social-economic life. Since the appearance of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, continuous investigations have been carried out by researchers to find active compounds, mainly from plants, as natural sources, that could inhibit or stop the proliferation of the causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). The most common symptoms caused by infections with COVID-19 can include cough, fever, and sore throat. Nevertheless, there is a shortage of active antiviral compounds for treating different strains of coronavirus. Herbal medicine is a class of medication that originates from nature and is aimed at decreasing the use of preservatives, excipients, or other additives and, consequently, lesser side effects. The rapid spread of COVID-19 infection besides the lack of knowledge about any treatments and the growing concern of the public from the virus directed us toward writing this review article in an aim to provide alternatives to the allopathic medicine use. There is a wealth of chemical diversity in the naturally existing compounds, including their antiviral activities, which may encourage their utilization as therapeutics against viral infections, including coronaviruses. The majority of publications on the herbal remedies of coronavirus, MERS, or SARS focused primarily on the use of polar compounds. These substances displayed encouraging inhibitory influences on coronavirus in humans. These include psoralidin, scutellarein, silvestrol, tryptanthrin, caffeic acid, quercetin, myricetin, saikosaponin B2, griffithsin (lectins), and isobavachalcone. Some other agents like lycorine may be useful, if the antiviral activity is obtained by concentrations below the toxic plasma levels. According to the available literatures, the most promising inhibitors of coronaviruses are polyphenolic compounds, which are small molecules with conjugated fused ring structures.">

In an attempt to contribute to the valorization of this species, the present study brings new insights on the antifungal and anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of T. albicans essential oil. The antifungal activity of the oil and its major compounds was assessed for the first time against standard and clinically isolated strains of yeasts and filamentous fungi. The effect on the two major virulence factors of Candida albicans (germ tube formation and biofilm disruption) was considered in more detail. At 0.08 μL/mL, the oil inhibited C. albicans germ tube formation by more than 40% and decreased biofilm biomass at MIC values, thus pointing out its antivirulent potential. The anti-inflammatory activity of the essential oil was investigated on LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) by evaluating the levels of several pro-inflammatory mediators, namely nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). T. albicans oil reduced the production of nitrites, a NO derived sub-product, at non-cytotoxic concentrations of 0.32 and 0.64 μL/mL, by 27 and 41%, respectively. In addition, the iNOS protein levels of essential oil pre-treated cells were reduced by 14%. Overall, the high essential oil yield of T. albicans as well as its bioactive effects at concentrations without cytotoxicity, encourage further studies on the potential pharmacological applications of this species. Furthermore, these results raise awareness for the need to preserve endangered species that may hold relevant medicinal value.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plant species of the Poaceae family are not only used as fodder and forage but also contribute substantially to the treatment of various health disorders, particularly in livestock. Consequently, the present study was aimed to document the therapeutic uses of Poaceae practiced by the inhabitants of the Punjab Province for the treatment of various veterinary health disorders. Semi structured interviews, group discussion and field walks were conducted to collect the data. Quantitative indices including cultural significance index (CSI), relative frequency of citations (RFC), fidelity level (FL), relative popularity level (RPL), and Jaccard Index (JI) were used for the data analysis. Traditional uses of 149 species belonging to 60 genera and 16 tribes of 5 sub families of Poaceae were recorded. Whole plants and leaves were the most consistently used parts with 40.94 and 29.53%. The plants were mainly given orally as fodder (59 reports) without processing followed by decoction (35 reports). Most of the species were employed to treat infectious diseases (25.93%), and digestive disorders (14.10%). Triticum aestivum had the highest CSI, RFC and RPL levels at 8.00, 0.96, 1.00, respectively, followed by Oryza sativa and Poa annua. Likewise, T. aestivum and Saccharum spontaneum had 100% FL and ROP. Jaccard index ranged from 12.25 to 0.37. Twelve plant species namely Chrysopogon zizanioides (anti-inflammatory), Pennisetum lanatum (improve bull fertility), Cymbopogon citratus (glandular secretion), Sorghum saccharatum and Themeda triandra (malaria), Aristida funiculate (anticancer), Koeleria argentia (skin allergies), Tetrapogon villosus (antibacterial), Cynodon radiatus (eyes infection), Sporobolus nervosa (Jaundice), Enneapogon persicus (antifungal), and Panicum repens (dysfunctional cattle organs) were reported for the first time, with novel ethnoveterinary uses. The inhabitants of the study area had a strong association with their surrounding plant diversity and possessed significant knowledge on therapeutic uses of Poaceae to treat various health disorders in animals. Plant species with maximum cultural and medicinal values could be a potential source of novel drugs to cure health disorders in animals and human as well.">

The study was extended to the assessment of the mode of induction of apoptosis by ASL. The resazurin reduction assay (RRA) was used for cytotoxicity studies. Assessments of cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were performed by flow cytometry. A caspase-Glo assay was used to evaluate caspase activities. Botanicals ASL, ASLb and ASLc as well as doxorubicin displayed observable IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values towards the nine tested cancer cell lines while ASLa and compounds &lt;b&gt;1-7&lt;/b&gt; had selective activities. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranged from 13.45 μg/mL (in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 33.20 μg/mL (against MDA-MB-231-&lt;i&gt;BCRP&lt;/i&gt; breast adenocarcinoma cells) for ASL, from 16.42 μg/mL (in CCRF-CEM cells) to 29.64 μg/mL (against MDA-MB-231-&lt;i&gt;pcDNA&lt;/i&gt; cells) for ASLc, and from 22.94 μg/mL (in MDA-MB-231-&lt;i&gt;BCRP&lt;/i&gt; cells) to 40.19 μg/mL (against HCT116 (&lt;i&gt;p53-/-)&lt;/i&gt; colon adenocarcinoma cells) for ASLb (Table 1), and from 0.02 μM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96 μM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. ASL induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells, mediated by ROS production. &lt;i&gt;Acacia sieberiana&lt;/i&gt; is a good cytotoxic plant and should be further explored to develop an anticancer phytomedicine to combat both sensitive and drug resistant phenotypes.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Sickle cell disease or drepanocytosis is the most known hemoglobin abnormality in the world. Recently, many medicinal plants used in the management of sickle cell disease in African traditional medicine have shown &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antisickling activity.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;This research study aims to document some Congolese plant species used in the management of sickle cell disease in Kikwit city and investigate their pharmacological property &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A cross-sectional survey was done from June 2015 to March 2016 among 26 traditional healers in Kikwit city, Democratic Republic of Congo. Emmel test was used to assess &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antisickling activity. Habitat, morphological, biological types, phytogeographical distribution, local names, and used parts of these plant species were also determined.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Obtained results show that 23 plant species belonging to 16 families are used. The leaves represent the most used part (70%). Antisickling investigation showed that aqueous extracts of 18 plants (78%) exhibit a change in the shape of a sickle cell into a normal one with a normalized rate of at least 70%, confirming the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; effect observed by traditional healers when used as herbal medicine traditionally in the management of sickle cell disease. The evaluation of perimeter, surface, and radius of untreated and treated sickle red blood cells showed a significant difference (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) as modification indicators of the red blood cell shape. &lt;i&gt;Alchornea cordifolia, Alternanthera bettzickiana, Annona senegalensis, Dissotis brazzae, Hypoxis angustifolia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Justicia secunda&lt;/i&gt; presented a very high antisickling activity with normalization &gt;70%. Otherwise, &lt;i&gt;Dissotis brazzae&lt;/i&gt; was the most active plant with a minimal concentration of normalization (MCN) of 11 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL and a maximal normalization rate (NRmax) of 86%.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Almost 80% of the plants studied showed interesting antisickling activity and justified their use in traditional medicine. The isolation of the molecules responsible for the biological activity of the most active plants and the determination of their chemical structures is under investigation.">

        <span class="abst" title="Sepsis refers to organ failure due to uncontrolled body immune responses towards infection. The systemic inflammatory response triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, is accompanied by the release of various proinflammatory mediators that can lead to organ damage. The progression to septic shock is even more life-threatening due to hypotension. Thus, sepsis is a leading cause of death and morbidity globally. However, current therapies are mainly symptomatic treatment and rely on the use of antibiotics. The lack of a specific treatment demands exploration of new drugs. Malaysian herbal plants have a long history of usage for medicinal purposes. A total of 64 Malaysian plants commonly used in the herbal industry have been published in Malaysian Herbal Monograph 2015 and Globinmed website (http://www.globinmed.com/). An extensive bibliographic search in databases such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus revealed that seven of these plants have antisepsis properties, as evidenced by the therapeutic effect of their extracts or isolated compounds against sepsis-associated inflammatory responses or conditions in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or/and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies. These include &lt;i&gt;Andrographis paniculata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Zingiber officinale&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Piper nigrum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Syzygium aromaticum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Momordica charantia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Centella asiatica&lt;/i&gt;. Among these, &lt;i&gt;Z. officinale&lt;/i&gt; is the most widely studied plant and seems to have the highest potential for future therapeutic applications in sepsis. Although both extracts as well as active constituents from these herbal plants have demonstrated potential antisepsis activity, the activity might be primarily contributed by the active constituent(s) from each of these plants, which are andrographolide (&lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt;), 6-gingerol and zingerone (&lt;i&gt;Z. officinale&lt;/i&gt;), curcumin (&lt;i&gt;C. longa&lt;/i&gt;), piperine and pellitorine (&lt;i&gt;P. nigrum&lt;/i&gt;), biflorin (&lt;i&gt;S. aromaticum&lt;/i&gt;), and asiaticoside, asiatic acid, and madecassoside (&lt;i&gt;C. asiatica&lt;/i&gt;). These active constituents have shown great antisepsis effects, and further investigations into their clinical therapeutic potential may be worthwhile.">

CKEO, in comparison to its major constituent, geraniol, showed better MICs against tested pathogens. In combination studies, the effective concentrations of CKEO and streptomycin were reduced from 20 to 5 μg/mL and 11 to 0.7 ng/mL against E. coli. This suggests their synergistic action. However, CKEO showed partial synergy with ciprofloxacin. To understand the efficacy of CKEO, time-kill kinetics was performed. CKEO took the half time to show the bactericidal effect in comparison to streptomycin at their 2x MICs (double the MIC), while their combination took only 30 min for this. Fluorescence and surface electron microscopic and protein estimation studies suggested the multi-target action of CKEO-streptomycin combination against E. coli. Further, CKEO alone/in combination exhibited less than 10% haemolytic activity at its MIC.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These results indicate that CKEO is a potentially safe alternative for the treatment of various pathogenic bacterial strains. It could be used for a variety of applications including human health, food storage, aquaculture, etc.">

Anti-diabetic actions of phytochemicals from various medicinal herbs have been explored as an alternative therapy in the management of DMT2 due to adverse effects of synthetic drugs used in allopathic medicine. α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory potential and phytochemical profiling were investigated in aqueous extracts of two new &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum zeylanicum&lt;/i&gt; accessions, namely &lt;i&gt;C. zeylanicum&lt;/i&gt; Sri Wijaya (SW), &lt;i&gt;C. zeylanicum&lt;/i&gt; Sri Gemunu (SG) and commercially available &lt;i&gt;C. zeylanicum&lt;/i&gt; (CC).&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Microwave Digestion (MD), Pressurized Water Extraction (PWE), Steam Distillation (SD), Solvent Extraction (SE), Decoction Water Extraction (DWE) and Infusion Water Extraction (IWE) methods were used to prepare Cinnamon quill extracts. Total phenolic content (TPC, Folin-Ciocalteu method) and Proanthocyanidin content (PC, vanillin assay), α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition of Cinnamon extracts were determined spectrophotometrically. The α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibition were reported in terms of IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value. The phytochemical profiling was accomplished by GC-MS technique.&lt;h4&gt;Results and discussion&lt;/h4&gt;Lowest IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were observed in PWE and DWE of SW. The highest PC and TPC were also observed in PWE and DWE of SW. Pressured water and decoctions are promising methods for the extraction of antidiabetic constituents from cinnamon. Benzoic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, and 4-Allyl-2,6-dimethoxyphenol were identified as major compounds in SW extracts. These compounds are believed to be responsible for strong enzyme inhibitory activity of the extracts.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This is the first study to explore the use of pressured and decoctions water to extract anti-diabetic phytochemicals from cinnamon. The extensive metabolite profiling of novel SW and SG extracts and comparison of that with commercially available CC are reported for the first time in this study. The &lt;i&gt;C. zeylanicum,&lt;/i&gt; SW accession holds some promise in the management of diabetes.">

        <span class="abst" title="The use of medicinal plants in traditional medicine is a common practice in developing countries. However, this unregulated or irrational use may pose a risk of toxicity to humans in the short and/or long term. Recent studies reported interesting ethnopharmacological, antioxidant, and phytochemical data on some medicinal plants used in the traditional treatment of male infertility in Benin. Unfortunately, very little data exist on the long-repeated dose toxicity of these medicinal plants. This study was aimed at evaluating the larval cytotoxicity and subacute toxicity of the hydroethanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;Cassytha filiformis&lt;/i&gt; whole plant, &lt;i&gt;Gardenia ternifolia&lt;/i&gt; roots, and &lt;i&gt;Rourea coccinea&lt;/i&gt; leaves. The subacute toxicity of these plants was evaluated in male Wistar albino rats at three different doses (200, 400, and 800 mg/kg) according to the OECD 407 guidelines. Hematological and biochemical examinations and the histological study of the liver and kidneys were carried out. Larval cytotoxicity was assessed by the sensitivity of &lt;i&gt;Artemia salina&lt;/i&gt; larvae to different concentrations of the studied plants extracts. The mean lethal concentration (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) was determined by the probit method. Subacute toxicity data indicated that there was no mortality or structural alterations of the liver and kidneys in the lot of treated animals. However, significant alterations in certain hematological and biochemical parameters (hematocrit, ASAT, and uremia) were noted. These abnormalities were observed in the lot of rats treated with &lt;i&gt;Rourea coccinea&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cassytha filiformis&lt;/i&gt; extracts. Larval cytotoxicity data indicate that the studied plants extracts are not cytotoxic (LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0.1 mg/mL). These data suggest that the use in traditional medicine of studied plants at high doses and repeated over a long period of time requires special attention.">

Toxicity studies are required to determine the safety profile of &lt;i&gt;P. curatellifolia&lt;/i&gt; in the consideration of its potential pharmaceutical benefits as a source of lead compounds in cancer therapy. The effects of &lt;i&gt;P. curatellifolia&lt;/i&gt; on both the integrity of the erythrocyte membrane and on normal cells were determined. The dried leaf powder of &lt;i&gt;P. curatellifolia&lt;/i&gt; was used in serial exhaustive extraction procedures using hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, methanol, and water as solvents in addition to extraction using DCM: methanol in equal ratio. Alkaloids, flavonoids, and saponins were isolated from the ethanol extract. The leaf extracts were tested for haemolytic activity on sheep erythrocytes at concentrations of 0.625 to 5 mg/ml. The extracts were also tested for toxicity activity on normal mammalian cells such as the BALB/c mice peritoneal cells using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) at the concentrations of 6.3 to 50 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. In the haemolysis assays, none of the plant extracts had a significant haemolytic activity with the saponin-enriched extract having the maximum haemolytic activity of 12.2% for a concentration of 5 mg/ml. In the MTT cell viability assay, none of the 11 plant extracts had significant cytotoxicity. The water extract, however, had significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) proliferative activity towards the murine immune cells at all concentrations&lt;i&gt;. P. curatellifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaf extracts were, therefore, not toxic to both erythrocytes and immune cells, and the water extract may have immunostimulatory effects. It is concluded that &lt;i&gt;P. curatellifolia&lt;/i&gt; leaf extracts are not toxic &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and, therefore, our results support the use of the plant for ethnomedicinal use.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants produce some of the most potent therapeutics and have been used for thousands of years to treat human diseases. Today, many medicinal natural products are still extracted from source plants at scale as their complexity precludes total synthesis from bulk chemicals. However, extraction from plants can be an unreliable and low-yielding source for human therapeutics, making the supply chain for some of these life-saving medicines expensive and unstable. There has therefore been significant interest in refactoring these plant pathways in genetically tractable microbes, which grow more reliably and where the plant pathways can be more easily engineered to improve the titer, rate and yield of medicinal natural products. In addition, refactoring plant biosynthetic pathways in microbes also offers the possibility to explore new-to-nature chemistry more systematically, and thereby help expand the chemical space that can be probed for drugs as well as enable the study of pharmacological properties of such new-to-nature chemistry. This perspective will review the recent progress toward heterologous production of plant medicinal alkaloids in microbial systems. In particular, we focus on the refactoring of halogenated alkaloids in yeast, which has created an unprecedented opportunity for biosynthesis of previously inaccessible new-to-nature variants of the natural alkaloid scaffolds.">

The oil was separated from the solvent and the bioactive compounds were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The identified peaks in the mass spectrum were matched with the database of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) library.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The FT-IR results indicated the presence of alcohols, carboxylic acids, phenols, alkanes, ketones, and primary amine compounds. GC-MS identified 43 compounds representing 95% of the total leaf essential oil components. Some of the major isolated compounds included a pyrrolizine; 1-dodecanol; 1,2-nonadecanediol; phytol; 1,3-dioxolane; 4-undecene, 9-methyl, (Z)-; 1-eicosanol; and imidazole.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The identified constituents of the extracted oil have established pharmacologic and insecticidal activities, and these compounds are also used in the drink, food, and cosmetic industries. This extract is highly valuable for the medical treatment of various ailments.">

        <span class="abst" title="Honeyberry (Lonicera caerulea) has long been used as a traditional medicine in China, Japan and northern Russia. Functional studies of honeyberry have mainly focused on the fruits, which have been reported to exert various pharmacological activities, including anti‑inflammatory activity, with limited or no studies on the other parts of the plant, such as the leaves and branches. In the present study, the anti‑inflammatory effects of extracts of the leaves (HBL), branches (HBB) and fruit (HBF) of honeyberry plant were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑stimulated RAW264.7 cells. HBL and HBB significantly inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in LPS‑stimulated RAW264.7 cells, and the inhibitory effects of HBL and HBB were stronger than those of HBF. HBL and HBB blocked the nuclear accumulation of p65 independently of IκB‑α. HBL did not inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 or p38; however, HBB effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of p38 but not ERK1/2. HBL and HBB increased the expression of heme oxygenase‑1 (HO‑1) protein by inducing the nuclear accumulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2‑related factor 2 (Nrf2) through the activation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/p38 pathway; the reduction in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin‑1β (IL‑1β) expression by HBL and HBB was inhibited by HO‑1 knockdown. In addition, HBL and HBB increased the expression of activating transcription factor‑3 (ATF3), and the reduction in iNOS and IL‑1β expression by HBL and HBB was inhibited by ATF3 knockdown. Collectively, HBL and HBB inhibited LPS‑induced nuclear factor‑κB activation by blocking the nuclear accumulation of p65, increasing HO‑1 expression through activation of the ROS/p38/Nrf2 pathway, and increasing ATF3 expression. Furthermore, HBB inhibited LPS‑induced p38 phosphorylation. These findings suggest that HBL and HBB may have great potential as natural products for the development of anti‑inflammatory drugs.">

Lipase, phospholipase, protease, &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase, and xanthine oxidase activities under treatment with aqueous and ethanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia cyparissias&lt;/i&gt; were observed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of these extracts, as well as their antioxidant and cytotoxic effects. Results showed that ethanolic and aqueous extracts exhibited important inhibitory activity in a concentration-related manner on digestive enzymes, which is more effective than the commercial drugs used as controls. Results also showed that, out of the two extracts tested, the ethanolic extract presented the most promising results in inhibiting the activities of all digestive enzymes used. Moreover, the two extracts displayed a higher reducing power than that of the positive control used. The obtained results, together with previous reports in the literature, strongly suggest that &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia cyparissias&lt;/i&gt; extracts may be natural inhibitors of the digestive enzymes and thus a potential new drug for metabolic syndrome treatment.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Crinum abyscinicum&lt;/i&gt; Hochst. ExA. Rich bulb is traditionally used in Ethiopia for the treatment of various ailments including internal parasites, mastitis, rabies, colic diseases of animals, and cancer. Despite its importance in traditional cancer treatment, no research work has been reported on the antiproliferative activity of the bulb extract and its major constituents. Phytochemical investigation of the bulb extract of &lt;i&gt;C. abyscinicum&lt;/i&gt; by PTLC over silica gel resulted in the isolation of two alkaloids, which were unequivocally identified as 6-hydroxycrinamine and lycorine on the basis of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H- and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-NMR and MS analysis. The bulb extract, 6-hydroxycrinamine, and lycorine possessed significant antiproliferative activity, lycorine being the most active exhibiting GI&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 2.8 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml and 3.4 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml against A2780 and MV4-11 cells, respectively. Cell cycle analysis and annexin V/propidium iodide double staining in A2780 cells revealed that both compounds increased the percentage of cells in the S-phase at 30 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml without inducing apoptosis. Our results suggest that the antiproliferative activities of the bulb extract of &lt;i&gt;C. abyscinicum,&lt;/i&gt; 6-hydroxycrinamine, and lycorine could support the traditional claim of the plant against cancer.">

        <span class="abst" title="Diabetes mellitus is referred as common metabolic abnormalities characterized as hyperglycemia, mainly caused due to insufficient production of insulin at cellular level or/and defects in insulin action. Such an endocrine disorder is responsible for serious health problems and its worldwide prevalence is rapidly increasing. Common management of diabetes by oral administration of drugs without creating any side effects is still considered a challenging task and increasing cost of conventional medicine in developing countries is another matter of concern. To address these issues, traditional preparations of herbal plant extracts in the form of medicines already gained immense attention. Swertia chirayita is one among such plants which is known for its hypoglycemic potential. Numerous chemical constituents with promising pharmacological properties have been identified from such plant extracts but still, such compounds have not been well characterized, specifically against human application. Hence, more research efforts are necessitated to understand exact mechanism of such compounds and to develop overall safety of such plant formulations. Present review clearly represents antidiabetic properties of Swertia chirayita extract, strategies to be taken to strengthen its safety application on humans and biotechnological interventions that ensure conservation of such endangered species to promote its future application in modern medicine.">

Phylogenetic analyses of FIPs from different origins were performed using Neighbor-Joining method. It was found that FIP-mco belonged to a new branch of the FIP family and may evolved from a different ancestor compared with most other FIPs. The cDNA sequence of FIP-mco was cloned and expressed in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Pichia Pastoris&lt;/i&gt; X33. The recombinant protein of FIP-mco (rFIP-mco) was purified by agarose Ni chromatography and determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis. The protein rFIP-mco could significantly suppress the proliferation of A549 and HepG2 cells at the concentration of 15 and 5 μg/ml, respectively, and inhibited the migration and invasion of human A549 and HepG2 cells at the concentration of 15 and 30 μg/ml respectively &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Further, rFIP-mco can significantly reduce the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the THP1 cells (human myeloid leukemia mononuclear cells). In order to explore the potential mechanism of the cytotoxicity effect of rFIP-mco on A549 and HepG2 cells, cell cycle and apoptosis assay in the two cancer cells were conducted. The results demonstrated that G0/G1 to S-phase arrest and increased apoptosis may contribute to the proliferation inhibition by rFIP-mco in the two cancer cells. Molecular mechanism of rFIP-mco's reduction effect on the inflammatory cytokines was also studied by suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway. It showed that suppression of NF-κB signaling is responsible for the reduction of inflammatory cytokines by rFIP-mco. The results indicated the prospect of FIP-mco from &lt;i&gt;M. conica&lt;/i&gt; SH as an effective and feasible source for cancer therapeutic studies and medical applications.">

That also medicinal drugs and medicinal knowledge crossed the Pacific Ocean is hardly known or discussed. Myroxylon balsamum (L.) Harms var. pereirae (Royle) Harms (&quot;New World&quot; or &quot;Peruvian balsam&quot;) is a botanical balsam that has a long history of medicinal use, particularly as antiseptic and for wound healing. Except for a Chinese article discussing the reception of balsam in China and Japan, no scientific studies on its impact in China and Japan and the channels of transfer from the Americas to Asia exist.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Description: (1) This section provides a general introduction into Commiphora gileadensis (&quot;Old World&quot; balsam) as a medicinal category and discusses the specific medicinal properties of Myroxylon balsamum (L.) Harms var. pereirae (Royle) Harms. The section &quot;Historical research and uses&quot; provides a brief survey on some historical analyses of balsam. Aim, design, setting: (2) Applying a comparative textual and archaeological analysis the article critically examines Chinese and Japanese sources (texts, maps) to show (i) what Chinese and Japanese scholars knew about balsam, (ii) where and how it was used, and (iii) to identify reasons why the &quot;digestion&quot; of knowledge on balsam as a medicinal developed so differently in China and Japan.&lt;h4&gt;Results and discussion&lt;/h4&gt;This chapter discusses the introduction of &quot;Peruvian balsam&quot; into, its uses as a medicinal as well as its scholarly reception in early modern China and Japan and introduces the channels of transmission from Spanish America to Asia. It is shown that Myroxylon balsamum (L.) Harms var. pereirae (Royle) Harms was partly a highly valued substance imported from the Americas into China and Japan. But the history of the reception of medicinal knowledge on Peruvian balsam was significantly different in China and Japan.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;In Japan, the knowledge on Myroxylon balsamum was continuously updated, especially through mediation of Dutch physicians; Japanese scholars, doctors and pharmacists possessed a solid knowledge on this balsam, its origin and its medicinal uses. In China, on the contrary, there was no further &quot;digestion&quot; or development of the knowledge on either Myroxylon balsamum (L.) Harms var. pereirae (Royle) Harms or Commiphora gileadensis. By the late nineteenth century, related medicinal and even geographic knowledge had mostly been lost. The interest in &quot;balsam&quot; in late Qing scholarship was pure encyclopaedic and philosophic.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background-Medicinal plants are traditionally used as infusions or decoctions for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic and anti-diabetic properties. Purpose-The aim of the study was to define the polyphenol composition and to assess the antioxidant capacity of eight medicinal plants from Reunion Island referred to in the French Pharmacopeia, namely &lt;i&gt;Aphloia theiformis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ayapana triplinervis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dodonaea viscosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hubertia ambavilla&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hypericum lanceolatum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pelargonium x graveolens&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Psiloxylon mauritianum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Syzygium cumini&lt;/i&gt;. Methods-Polyphenol content was assessed by biochemical assay and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Antioxidant capacity was assessed by measuring DPPH reduction and studying the protective effects of herbal preparation on red blood cells or preadipocytes exposed to oxidative stress. Results-Polyphenol content ranged from 25 to 143 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/L for infusions and 35 to 205 mg GAE/L for decoctions. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry analysis showed the presence of major bioactive polyphenols, such as quercetin, chlorogenic acid, procyanidin and mangiferin. Antioxidant capacity assessed by different tests, including DPPH and Human red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis of herbal preparations, demonstrated a dose-dependent effect whatever the extraction procedure. Our data suggest that decoction slightly improved polyphenol extraction as well as antioxidant capacity relative to the infusion mode of extraction (DPPH test). However, infusions displayed a better protective effect against oxidative stress-induced RBC hemolysis. Conclusion-Traditional preparations of medicinal plant aqueous extracts (infusions and decoctions) display antioxidant properties that limit oxidative stress in preadipocytes and red blood cells, supporting their use in the context of metabolic disease prevention and treatment.">

The scarcity of rigorous scientific data on the surviving Mascarene endemic taxa renders bioprospecting of this untapped resource of utmost importance. Thus, in view of valorizing the native resource, this study has as its objective to investigate the bioactivities of endemic leaf extracts. Herein, seven Mascarene endemic plants leaves were extracted and evaluated for their in vitro antioxidant properties and antiproliferative effects on a panel of cancer cell lines, using methyl thiazolyl diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and clonogenic cell survival assays. Flow cytometry and comet assay were used to investigate the cell cycle and DNA damaging effects, respectively. Bioassay guided-fractionation coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography-MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis were used to identify the bioactive compounds. Among the seven plants tested, &lt;i&gt;Terminalia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;bentzoë&lt;/i&gt; was comparatively the most potent antioxidant extract, with significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) higher cytotoxic activities. &lt;i&gt;T. bentzoë&lt;/i&gt; extract further selectively suppressed the growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells and significantly halted the cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase, decreased the cells' replicative potential and induced significant DNA damage. In total, 10 phenolic compounds, including punicalagin and ellagic acid, were identified and likely contributed to the extract's potent antioxidant and cytotoxic activities. These results established a promising basis for further in-depth investigations into the potential use of &lt;i&gt;T. bentzoë&lt;/i&gt; as a supportive therapy in cancer management.">

In this study, the therapeutic potential of a new iridoid glycoside isolated from the leaves of &lt;i&gt;Clerodendrum volubile&lt;/i&gt; against COVID-19 was investigated. Harpagide 5-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (HG) was isolated, characterised and investigated for its druglikeness, optimized geometry, and pharmacokinetics properties. Its immunomodulatory was determined by chemiluminescence assay using polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) in addition to T-cell proliferation assay. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis was used in determining its molecular interaction with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2). HG displayed potent druglikeness properties, with no inhibitory effect on cytochrome P&lt;sub&gt;450&lt;/sub&gt; (1A2, 2C19, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4) and a predicted LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 2000 mg/kg. Its &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-NMR chemical shifts showed a little deviation of 0.01 and 0.11 ppm for H-4 and H-9, respectively. HG significantly suppressed oxidative bursts in PMNs, while concomitantly inhibiting T-cell proliferation. It also displayed a very strong binding affinity with the translation initiation and termination sequence sites of spike (S) protein mRNA of SARS-COV-2, its gene product, and host ACE2 receptor. These results suggest the immunomodulatory properties and anti-SARS-COV-2 potentials of HG which can be explored in the treatment and management of COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.">

        <span class="abst" title="COVID-19 is an infectious pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The critical components of SARS-CoV-2 are the spike protein (S-protein) and the main protease (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;). M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; is required for the maturation of the various polyproteins involved in replication and transcription. S-protein helps the SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 is required for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 on the host cells, ACE2 inhibitors and blockers have got wider attention, in addition to S-protein and M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; modulators as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. So far, no specific drugs have shown promising therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic potential of traditional medicinal plants against COVID-19. The bioactives from the medicinal plants, along with standard drugs, were screened for their binding against S-protein, M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; and ACE2 targets using molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics. Based on the higher binding affinity compared with standard drugs, bioactives were selected and further analyzed for their pharmacological properties such as drug-likeness, ADME/&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-test, biological activities using &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; tools. The binding energies of several bioactives analyzed with target proteins were relatively comparable and even better than the standard drugs. Based on Lipinski factors and lower binding energies, seven bioactives were further analyzed for their pharmacological and biological characteristics. The selected bioactives were found to have lower toxicity with a higher GI absorption rate and potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities against targets of COVID-19. Therefore, the bioactives from these medicinal plants can be further developed as phytopharmaceuticals for the effective treatment of COVID-19.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;Diarrhea is a cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in children. Patients with diarrhea have been suffering from limited treatment options due to poor drug tolerance, side effect, and multi-drug resistance to almost all the current drug treatments. Therefore, it is important to search for a new therapeutic medicine that can effectively prevent the disease and safe. &lt;i&gt;Vernonia amygdalina&lt;/i&gt; is an indigenous medicinal plant used traditionally for the treatment of diarrhea in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was therefore to confirm the antidiarrheal activities of 80% methanol leaves extract using mice models.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The antidiarrheal activities of the 80% methanol leaves extract were investigated using castor oil-induced diarrhea, intestinal motility, and enteropooling models in mice. The negative control received distilled water orally, the test groups received three dose levels (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) of the plant materials, and the positive control is given 3 mg/kg Loperamide orally.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In the castor oil-induced diarrheal model, the extract delayed onset of diarrhea and reduced fecal parameters at all tested doses significantly as compared with the negative control. Results from the charcoal meal test revealed that the extract produced a significant anti-motility effect at all tested doses as compared with the negative control. In the enteropooling test, the extract produced a significant decline in the volume and weight of intestinal contents. The observed antidiarrheal activity could be associated with the phytochemicals present in this plant extract. It was also observed that the extracts have shown no acute toxicity at a dose of 2 g/kg.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study provides the antidiarrheal activity of the crude extract in all three models. Hence, the findings provide scientific support for the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;Vernonia amygdalina&lt;/i&gt; leaves as treatment of diarrhea.">

The use of anthelmintic to control gastrointestinal nematode put a selection pressure on nematode populations which led to emergence of anthelmintic resistance. Because of that, this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of aqueous and methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;Cassia siamea&lt;/i&gt; against the motility of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; Bristol N2 and &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; DA1316. &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; Bristol N2 is a susceptible strain and &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; DA1316 is an ivermectin resistant strain. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; bioassay of various concentrations of (0.2, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 2.0 mg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) aqueous and methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;C. siamea&lt;/i&gt; was conducted against the motility of L4 larvae of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; Bristol N2 and &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; DA1316. The L4 larvae were treated with 0.02 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of ivermectin served as positive control while those in M9 solution served as negative control. The activity of the extracts was observed after 24 h and 48 h. A significant difference was recorded in the extract performance compared to control at (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) after 48 h against the motility of the larvae of both strains. The methanol extracts inhibited the motility of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; Bristol N2 by 86.7% as well as DA1316 up to 84.9% at 2.0 mg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; after 48 h.

The Cannabis industry is currently one such focal area receiving attention, owing to the occurrence of phytocannabinoids (pCBs) which have shown promise in health-promotion and disease prevention. However, the occurrence of pCBs in other plant species are often overlooked and rarely studied. Leonotis leonurus (L.) R. Br. is endemic to South Africa with a rich history of use in TM practices amongst indigenous people and, has been recorded to induce mild psychoactive effects akin to Cannabis. While the leaves have been well-reported to contain therapeutic phytochemicals, little information exists on the flowers. Consequently, as part of a larger research venture, we targeted the flowers of L. leonurus for the identification of potential pCB or pCB-like compounds.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Flower extracts were separated and analyzed using high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). A single pCB candidate was isolated from HPTLC plates and, using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we could successfully group this compound as a fatty amide and tentatively identified as 7,10,13,16-Docosatetraenoylethanolamine (adrenoyl-EA), a known bioactive compound.">

However, the plant has not been scientifically validated, and thus the present study evaluated the in vitro anti-oxidant and the in vivo wound healing activity of the crude extract and solvent fractions of &lt;i&gt;B. carinata&lt;/i&gt; seeds in mice.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The crude extract was prepared by maceration using 80% methanol and formulated as 5% and 10% w/w ointments for topical application. The acute dermal toxicity was performed in female albino rats based on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guideline number 434. Excision and incision wound healing models were used to evaluate the wound healing activities of crude extract and solvent fractions ointments in mice. Wound healing parameters such as wound area contraction and the period of epithelialization were determined in an excision model, whereas tensile strength was determined in an incision model. Moreover, the crude extract and solvent fractions were evaluated for the free radical scavenging activities in DPPH assay.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The acute dermal toxicity test showed that a limit dose of 2,000 mg/kg of 10% w/w crude extract ointment did not cause dermal toxicity in mice. In the excision wound model, the data revealed that 10% w/w ointment exhibited a significant wound contraction (from day 6 to 16, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) effect with a significant decrease in epithelization period (at day 14, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001). In addition, 5% ointment of the crude extract showed a significant effect in wound contraction (from day 8 onwards, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.01) and epithelization period (at day 16, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.01). Despite all fractions being shown to promote wound healing, 10% w/w aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions showed a significant wound contraction (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) effect starting from the 4th day onwards. Besides, the maximum antioxidant activity was seen in the aqueous fraction with an IC50 value of 3.45±0.12 mg/mL.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The present study demonstrated that the 80% methanol extract and solvent fractions of the seeds of &lt;i&gt;B.carinata&lt;/i&gt; possess potential wound healing and anti-oxidant effects, supporting the traditional use of the plant for wound management.">

Prednisolone was used as the standard control. MESM was subsequently partitioned using &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and aqueous-methanol (90:10 v/v), after which PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-inhibitory activity of the partitions was determined. The best partition was subjected to chromatographic techniques and the fractions obtained were assessed for PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhibition at 0.4 mg/mL. Compounds in the most active fraction were determined using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy &lt;b&gt;(&lt;/b&gt;FTIR) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;MESM significantly inhibited PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activity at 0.8 mg/mL (44.253%) compared to prednisolone (35.207%). &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-Hexane partition (SMP1) proved more active with inhibition of 55.870% observed at 0.1 mg/mL. Fraction 1 (SMF1) showed the highest PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-inhibitory activity of 58.117%. FTIR studies revealed the presence of some functional groups in SMF1, and GC-MS confirmed the presence of 9 compounds which are first reported in this plant. Hexadecanoic acid, ethyl ester was identified as the major compound (24.906%).&lt;h4&gt;Discussion and conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-inhibitory activity of MESM suggests that its compounds may be explored further in monitoring anti-inflammatory genes affected by the venoms.">

The results indicated that substitution at C3 of quinoline is favoured for HDAC6 selectivity. Two compounds (&lt;b&gt;25&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;26&lt;/b&gt;) were also found to be potent anti-proliferative compounds with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging from 1.29 to 2.13 µM against A549 and HCT116 cells. These compounds displayed remarkable selectivity for HDAC6 over other HDAC isoforms with nanomolar IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values. Western blot analysis revealed that compounds of this series activate apoptotic caspase pathway as indicated by cleavage of caspase 3, 8, and 9 and also increase phosphorylated H2AX thus inducing DNA double strand fragmentation in a concentration dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis also displayed a dose dependent increase of cell population in sub G1 phase.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Hericium erinaceus is a culinary and medicinal mushroom in Traditional Chinese Medicines. It has numerous pharmacological effects including immunomodulatory, anti-tumour, anti-microbial, anti-aging and stimulation of nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, but little is known about its potential role in negating the detrimental effects of oxidative stress in depression. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of H. erinaceus standardised aqueous extract (HESAE) against high-dose corticosterone-induced oxidative stress in rat pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells, a cellular model mimicking depression.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;PC-12 cells was pre-treated with HESAE for 48 h followed by 400 μM corticosterone for 24 h to induce oxidative stress. Cells in complete medium without any treatment or pre-treated with 3.125 μg/mL desipramine served as the negative and positive controls, respectively. The cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, aconitase activity, mitochondrial membrane potentials (MMPs), intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and number of apoptotic nuclei were quantified. In addition, HESAE ethanol extract was separated into fractions by chromatographic methods prior to spectroscopic analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We observed that PC-12 cells treated with high-dose corticosterone at 400 μM had decreased cell viability, reduced endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, disrupted mitochondrial function, and increased oxidative stress and apoptosis. However, pre-treatment with HESAE ranging from 0.25 to 1 mg/mL had increased cell viability, decreased LDH release, enhanced endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, restored MMP, attenuated intracellular ROS and protected from ROS-mediated apoptosis. The neuroprotective effects could be attributed to significant amounts of adenosine and herierin III isolated from HESAE.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;HESAE demonstrated neuroprotective effects against high-dose corticosterone-induced oxidative stress in an in vitro model mimicking depression. HESAE could be a potential dietary supplement to treat depression.">

To explore their potential, it is important to bring these remedies out of historical treatises, and into present-day scientific evaluation. Using an example of Indian traditional medicine (Ayurveda), we present a perspective toward evaluating historical remedies for anti-biofilm potential. Across compendia, we identified three plant-based remedies (of &lt;i&gt;Kalanchoe pinnata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cynodon dactylon&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Ocimum tenuiflorum&lt;/i&gt;) recommended for wounds. The remedies were reconstituted in accordance with historical practices, and tested for their effects on biofilm formation and eradication assays of wound pathogens, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;. Based on our approach and the results obtained, we provide insights into the considerations and challenges related to identifying potential remedies in historical texts, and testing them in the laboratory with standard biofilm assays. We believe this will be relevant for future studies exploring anti-biofilm approaches at the interface of historical medicine and present-day scientific practices.">

Previously, chromatogram of 10 characteristic metabolites in S. miltiorrhiza showed a significant difference after &quot;Sweating&quot;.

Multivariate analysis was conducted to screen differential metabolites. Analysis indicated distinct differences between sweated and non-sweated samples. 10,108 substance peaks had been detected altogether, and 4759 metabolites had been identified from negative and positive ion model. 287 differential metabolites were screened including 112 up-regulated and 175 down-regulated and they belong to lipids and lipid-like molecules, and phenylpropanoid and polyketides. KEGG analysis showed the pathway of linoleic acid metabolism, and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were mainly enriched. 31 and 49 identified metabolites were exclusively detected in SSM and NSSM, respectively, which mainly belong to carboxylic acids and derivatives, polyketides and fatty acyls. By mapping tanshinones and salvianolic acids to 4759 identified metabolites library, 23 characteristic metabolites had been identified, among which 11 metabolites changed most. We conclude that &quot;Sweating'' has significant effect on metabolites content and composition of S. miltiorrhiza.">

        <span class="abst" title="Viral infections and associated diseases are responsible for a substantial number of mortality and public health problems around the world. Each year, infectious diseases kill 3.5 million people worldwide. The current pandemic caused by COVID-19 has become the greatest health hazard to people in their lifetime. There are many antiviral drugs and vaccines available against viruses, but they have many disadvantages, too. There are numerous side effects for conventional drugs, and active mutation also creates drug resistance against various viruses. This has led scientists to search herbs as a source for the discovery of more efficient new antivirals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 65% of the world population is in the practice of using plants and herbs as part of treatment modality. Additionally, plants have an advantage in drug discovery based on their long-term use by humans, and a reduced toxicity and abundance of bioactive compounds can be expected as a result. In this review, we have highlighted the important viruses, their drug targets, and their replication cycle. We provide in-depth and insightful information about the most favorable plant extracts and their derived phytochemicals against viral targets. Our major conclusion is that plant extracts and their isolated pure compounds are essential sources for the current viral infections and useful for future challenges.">

        <span class="abst" title="The pepper-bark tree (Warburgia salutaris) is one of the most highly valued medicinal plant species worldwide. Native to southern Africa, this species has been extensively harvested for the bark, which is widely used in traditional health practices. Illegal harvesting coupled with habitat degradation has contributed to fragmentation of populations and a severe decline in its distribution. Even though the species is included in the IUCN Red List as Endangered, genetic data that would help conservation efforts and future re-introductions are absent. We therefore developed new molecular markers to understand patterns of genetic diversity, structure, and gene flow of W. salutaris in one of its most important areas of occurrence (Mozambique). In this study, we have shown that, despite fragmentation and overexploitation, this species maintains a relatively high level of genetic diversity supporting the existence of random mating. Two genetic groups were found corresponding to the northern and southern locations. Our study suggests that, if local extinctions occurred in Mozambique, the pepper-bark tree persisted in sufficient numbers to retain a large proportion of genetic diversity. Management plans should concentrate on maintaining this high level of genetic variability through both in and ex-situ conservation actions.">

Such issue appears particularly important when contextualized in the rapid progress of CAR-T cell treatment, translating into a constant need of updating and evolution. Moreover, the clinical grade manufacturing of CAR-T cells is complex and implies articulated regulatory and organizational aspects. The main goal of this review is to summarize and provide an accurate analysis of the clinical, logistic, and regulatory requirements of CAR-T cell centers.

The present work reports a method for a facile and an eco-friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using &lt;i&gt;Terminalia chebula&lt;/i&gt; fruit extract (TCE). The obtained AgNPs was characterized by using different spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The analysis of the results revealed that the as-obtained AgNPs have spherical morphology with an average diameter of 22 nm. Furthermore, the preliminary bioactivity evaluations revealed that the bio-conjugation of AgNPs, using TCE, significantly enhanced the antibacterial and anti-breast cancer potentials of the latter. The antibacterial activity of the as-prepared AgNPs showed that &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; was more sensitive towards the AgNPs, followed by &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;; while, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. mutans&lt;/i&gt; showed comparatively minimal sensitivity toward the AgNPs. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of TCE, AgNPs and TCE + AgNPs treatment of MCF-7 were found to be 17.53, 14.25 and 6.484 µg/mL, respectively. Therefore, it can be ascertained that the bio-conjugation may provide a headway with regard to the therapeutic employment of &lt;i&gt;T. chebula&lt;/i&gt;, upon mechanistically understanding the basis of observed antibacterial and anticancer activities.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Piper capense&lt;/i&gt; Linn is a plant used in Cameroon to treat cancer and several other diseases such as urinary tract disorder, fever, stomach-ache and to improve appetite. The methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;Piper capense&lt;/i&gt; has been reported for its antiproliferative activity towards several human cancer cell lines. The aim of this work was to evaluate the acute and subchronic oral toxicities of a methanol extract from &lt;i&gt;P. capense&lt;/i&gt; fruits on rats. The acute oral toxicity assay was carried out by administration of a single dose of 5000 mg/kg body weight of methanol extract of the &lt;i&gt;Piper capense&lt;/i&gt; to five female rats, after which the behavior of the animals and the number of deaths were noted after 48 h. The animals were then kept for observation for 14 days. On the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, the rats were sacrificed and macroscopic observation of the organs was made. Concerning the subchronic toxicity study, the rats composed of males and females received three doses (250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day) for a period of 28 days by oral gavage. General animal behavior, food intake, weight gain, organ weights, haematological parameters, serum, and urinary biochemical parameters, and histological sections of liver and kidneys, were evaluated. Methanol extract from the &lt;i&gt;Piper capense&lt;/i&gt; fruits did not cause any death in rats that were administered a single dose of 5000 mg/kg body weight of extract and therefore, the letal dose 50 (LD50) of the extract is greater than 5000 mg/kg body weight. Subchronic administration of the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;Piper capense&lt;/i&gt; fruits showed significant variations (P &gt; 0.05) after analysis of certain biochemical parameters: serum urea, urinary urea, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase, (ASAT), serum protein; in both male and female rats that received the dose of 1000 mg/kg body weight/day. No major signs of toxicity were observed in the liver and kidneys of animals after analysis of the histological sections performed. Beside, some signs of toxicity were observed, including cell lysis and inflammation on the liver and kidney organs at a dose of 1000 mg/kg body weight/day. Finally, the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;Piper capense&lt;/i&gt; fruits is safe at lower doses, but could cause some damages at doses as high as 1000 mg/kg body weight/day. Consequently, it should be taken with caution when used in therapy.">

Some EOs have significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, and thus could effectively increase the shelf lives of foodstuff and beverages. In this study, fourteen essential oils (clove, eucalyptus, fennel, lavender, oregano, palmarosa, pepper, star anise, tea tree, turmeric, Chinese yin yang, Japanese yin yang, and ylang ylang) from different medicinal plant families were screened by gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for their different chemical profiles and bioassays were performed to assess their antifungal and antioxidant activities. The results obtained were assessed by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA distinguished six groups characterized by different terpene chemotypes. Amongst the EOs studied, the clove EO showed the strongest antioxidant activity characterized by an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.36 µL/mL. The oregano EO had the greatest antiyeast activity characterized by a minimal inhibitory concentration of 10 µL/mL. In conclusion, clove and oregano EOs are strong antifungal and antioxidant agents, respectively, with great potential in the food industry to avoid spoilage and to increase shelf life.">

        <span class="abst" title="The naturopathic treatment of obesity is a matter of keen interest to develop efficient natural pharmacological routes for disease management with low or negligible toxicity and side effects. For this purpose, optimized ultrasonicated hydroethanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;Taraxacum officinale&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated for antiobesity attributes. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl method was adopted to evaluate antioxidant potential. Porcine pancreatic lipase inhibitory assay was conducted to assess the in vitro antiobesity property. Ultra-high performance chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer was utilized to profile the secondary metabolites in the most potent extract. The 60% ethanolic extract exhibited highest extract yield (25.05 ± 0.07%), total phenolic contents (123.42 ± 0.007 mg GAE/g DE), total flavonoid contents (55.81 ± 0.004 RE/g DE), DPPH-radical-scavenging activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 81.05 ± 0.96 µg/mL) and pancreatic lipase inhibitory properties (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 146.49 ± 4.24 µg/mL). The targeted metabolite fingerprinting highlighted the presence of high-value secondary metabolites. Molecular-binding energies computed by docking tool revealed the possible contribution towards pancreatic lipase inhibitory properties of secondary metabolites including myricetin, isomangiferin, icariside B4, kaempferol and luteolin derivatives when compared to the standard drug orlistat. In vivo investigations revealed a positive impact on the lipid profile and obesity biomarkers of obese mice. The study presents &lt;i&gt;Taraxacum officinale&lt;/i&gt; as a potent source of functional bioactive ingredients to impart new insights into the existing pool of knowledge of naturopathic approaches towards obesity management.">

Different growth environment and intraspecific hybridization of different germplasm resources lead to large differences in the yield, quality and medicinal value of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt;. Here, the volatile compounds of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; from four producing regions (Zhejiang, Fujian, Yunnan and Jiangxi) were analyzed to provide a certain reference value for the selection of a specific medicinal component in &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; breeding. Fresh stems of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; germplasm resources were collected, and the chemical constituents were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 101 volatile compounds were identified, of which esters and alcohols accounted for 23 and 22. Hexacosane is the highest relative content of all volatile components. The highest content of hexacosane was observed in YA1 from Yunnan was 34.41%, and the lowest (23.41%) in JA1 from Jiangxi. Moreover, 5-10 unique substances were determined in different regions. A total of 17 medicinal components were detected, and three unique medicinal components were detected only in YA1, revealing that YA1 can provide raw materials for the application of specific medicinal substances extraction. A total of four toxic components were detected, but no toxic components were detected in JA1 from Jiangxi, suggested that the germplasm resources from Jiangxi could be exploited efficiently for breeding superior &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; specimens. The results provide a theoretical basis for the collection, protection and utilization of &lt;i&gt;D. officinale&lt;/i&gt; germplasm resources in different regions.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Echinacea purpurea&lt;/i&gt; is used in herbal medicinal products for the prevention and treatment of the common cold, as well as for skin disorders and minor wounds. In this study, the efficiency of traditional maceration using water and ethanol was compared with the maceration using mixtures of water and glycerol, a non-toxic, biodegradable solvent from renewable sources. It was found that the glycerol-water mixtures were as effective as ethanol/water mixtures for the extraction of caffeic acid derivatives. All the prepared extracts demonstrated notable antiradical properties. Furthermore, an efficient ultrasound-assisted extraction using glycerol-water mixtures was developed using six independent variables. Their levels needed for the maximum extraction of caffeic acid derivatives were as follows: glycerol 90% (&lt;i&gt;m/m&lt;/i&gt;), temperature 70 °C, ultrasound power 72 W, time 40 min, and ascorbic acid 0 mg/mL. Under the optimized conditions, ultrasound-assisted extraction was superior to maceration. It achieved significantly higher yields of phenolic acids in shorter extraction time. The presence of zinc in plant material may contribute to the beneficial effects of &lt;i&gt;E. purpurea&lt;/i&gt; preparations. Since glycerol is a non-toxic solvent with humectant properties, the prepared extracts can be directly used for the preparation of cosmetics or oral pharmaceutical formulations without the need for solvent removal.">

It is also used to treat indigestion, stomach ulcers, liver disorders, and, as emmenagogue, diaphoretic, diuretic, nervine, and aphrodisiac. We examined antioxidant properties and bioactive compounds in various solvent extracts from the seeds of &lt;i&gt;M. fragrans&lt;/i&gt;. Methanol, ethanol, and acetone extracts exhibited relatively strong antioxidant activities by 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), superoxide radical, and hydroxyl radical scavenging tests. Furthermore, methanol extracts also displayed significant anti-α-glucosidase activity. Examined and compared to the various solvent extracts for their chemical compositions using HPLC analysis, we isolated the ten higher content compounds and analyzed antioxidant and anti-α-glucosidase activities. Among the isolates, dehydrodiisoeugenol, malabaricone B and malabaricone C were main antioxidant components in seeds of &lt;i&gt;M. fragrans&lt;/i&gt;. Malabaricone C exhibited stronger antioxidant capacities than others based on lower half inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values in DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging assays, and it also showed significant inhibition of α-glucosidase. These results shown that methanol was found to be the most efficient solvent for extracting the active components from the seeds of &lt;i&gt;M. fragrans&lt;/i&gt;, and this material is a potential good source of natural antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitor.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants are considered green resources for thousands of bioactive compounds. Essential oils (EOs) are an important class of secondary compounds with various biological activities, including allelopathic and antimicrobial activities. Herein, the present study aimed to compare the chemical profiles of the EOs of the widely distributed medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Calotropis procera&lt;/i&gt; collected from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In addition, this study also aimed to assess their allelopathic and antimicrobial activities. The EOs from Egyptian and Saudi ecospecies were extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed via GC-MS. The correlation between the analyzed EOs and those published from Egypt, India, and Nigeria was assessed by principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC). The allelopathic activity of the extracted EOs was tested against two weeds (&lt;i&gt;Bidens pilosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dactyloctenium aegyptium&lt;/i&gt;). Moreover, the EOs were tested for antimicrobial activity against seven bacterial and two fungal strains. Ninety compounds were identified from both ecospecies, where 76 compounds were recorded in Saudi ecospecies and 33 in the Egyptian one. Terpenes were recorded as the main components along with hydrocarbons, aromatics, and carotenoids. The sesquiterpenes (54.07%) were the most abundant component of EO of the Saudi sample, while the diterpenes (44.82%) represented the mains of the Egyptian one. Hinesol (13.50%), &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-chrysanthenyl acetate (12.33%), 1,4-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-1,7-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-acorenone (7.62%), phytol (8.73%), and myristicin (6.13%) were found as the major constituents of EO of the Saudi sample, while phytol (38.02%), &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-docosane (6.86%), linoleic acid (6.36%), &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-pentacosane (6.31%), and bicyclogermacrene (4.37%) represented the main compounds of the Egyptian one. It was evident that the EOs of both ecospecies had potent phytotoxic activity against the two tested weeds, while the EO of the Egyptian ecospecies was more effective, particularly on the weed &lt;i&gt;D. aegyptium&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, the EOs showed substantial antibacterial and antifungal activities. The present study revealed that the EOs of Egyptian and Saudi ecospecies were different in quality and quantity, which could be attributed to the variant environmental and climatic conditions. The EOs of both ecospecies showed significant allelopathic and antimicrobial activity; therefore, these EOs could be considered as potential green eco-friendly resources for weed and microbe control, considering that this plant is widely grown in arid habitats.">

This study measured a PA base concentration of ~ 70 ng/L in stream water adjacent to an invasive PA-producing plant Petasites hybridus (Asteraceae). After intense rain the PA concentration increased tenfold. In addition, PAs measured up to 230 ng/L in seepage water from groundwater wells. The dominant PAs in both water types corresponded to the most abundant PAs in the plants (senkirkine, senecionine, senecionine N-oxide).

        <span class="abst" title="Intra-species genetic variability assessment is an effective tool in formulating genetic improvement and germplasm conservation strategies. &lt;i&gt;Houttuynia cordata&lt;/i&gt; Thunb. is a semidomesticated medicinal herb consumed widely in traditional diet in North-Eastern India. In the present study, an effort has been made to assess the genetic diversity of &lt;i&gt;H. cordata&lt;/i&gt; Thunb. from Brahmaputra valley of North-East India. A total of 545 genotypes from 18 populations of &lt;i&gt;H. cordata&lt;/i&gt; Thunb. from four different regions, i.e. North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West, with respect to river Brahmaputra were collected and population genetic diversity and structure were analysed using ISSR molecular markers. Population genetic structure analysis using unweighted pair group method with averages (UPGMA)-based hierarchical cluster analysis, principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and model-based clustering in STRUCTURE program revealed that the population of &lt;i&gt;H. cordata&lt;/i&gt; Thunb. grouped according to regional distribution and forms four genetically distinct clusters. The analysis of molecular variance showed that differentiation among regions was significant with 60% genetic variation among region, 3% genetic variation among population within region and 37% genetic variation within population. We found wide variation in Nei's gene diversity (Hj) ranging from 0.07782 in Margherita population to 0.13634 in Barapani population. Furthermore, Nei's gene diversity within population (Nei's Hs) and total gene diversity (Ht) were found to be 0.1081 and 0.1769 respectively. The genetic differentiation among 18 population was high (Fst = 0.3894; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) with relatively restricted gene flow (Nm = 0.6564). Based on the result of this study, we suggest ex situ conservation could be an appropriate measure to adequately capture the total genetic diversity of &lt;i&gt;H. cordata&lt;/i&gt; Thunb. populations of North-East India by selecting few individuals from different populations.&lt;h4&gt;Supplementary information&lt;/h4&gt;The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11105-020-01260-9.">

Two cycloartane-type triterpenes, Combretin A and Combretin B, were isolated from this plant. This study was aimed at evaluating the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticolitis effects of these compounds. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; anti-inflammatory properties were evaluated by inhibition of cyclooxygenase, 5-lipoxygenase, and denaturation of the protein; antioxidant properties were assessed by using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) ABTS&lt;sup&gt;•+&lt;/sup&gt;, capacity tests ferric reducing antioxidant (FRAP), and trapping nitric oxide. For &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; analysis, we used the model of ulcerative colitis induced by Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS). Studies of the anti-inflammatory activity showed that Combretin A and Combretin B had maximal inhibitory activity on cyclooxygenase (71.92% and 89.59%), 5-lipoxygenase (76.68% and 91.21%), and protein denaturation (63.93% and 87.78%). Antioxidant activity on DPPH, ABTS&lt;sup&gt;•+&lt;/sup&gt;, ferric reducing antioxidant capacity (FRAP), and nitric oxide scavenging showed that Combretin A and Combretin B showed good antioxidant activities. These compounds significantly reduced the signs of DSS-induced colitis in the treated animals by preventing the weight loss of the animals, by significantly reducing the disease activity index, improving the condition of the stool, preventing the reduction of the length of the colon, and preventing the degradation of the colon. This study revealed that Combretin A and Combretin B have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and curative properties against colitis experimentally induced by DSS in rats.">

        <span class="abst" title="IntroductionAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most important challenges in modern clinical practice. The European regulatory network has a strategy to support prevention of AMR by applying specific referral procedures.AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate post-authorisation changes made in the product information of key antibiotics that underwent referral procedures between 2007 and 2020.MethodIn a comprehensive analysis of the changes made for antibiotics, we extracted information on changes from the European Commission community register of medicinal products and the European Medicines Agency's database for antibiotics that went through referrals. Changes made in the specific sections of the summary of product characteristics of each referral procedure were scrutinised.ResultsWe identified 15 antibiotics from seven classes of antibiotics during the study period. The outcome of all referrals included the restriction of antibiotic use. Therapeutic indications were revised for all antibiotics, with septicaemia and gonorrhoea most common diseases removed. Posology and/or method of administration was updated for all; the majority of referrals included adjustment of dosage for specific populations. Information on contraindication (most regarding hypersensitivity) and information on warnings was amended for all referrals.ConclusionOur findings highlight the importance of the regulatory actions. The changes made in the product information aim to ensure appropriate use. Ongoing harmonisation activities are likely to lead to further refinements and restrictions on individual antibiotics in support of rational use. However, further research is required to examine the impact of post-referral label changes on the clinical practice.">

Twenty treatments were evaluated with 15 sample replicates. Treatments were made up of 4 different soilless growing media, namely: pure silica sand, 50% silica sand with 50% coco-peat, 50% silica sand with 50% vermiculite, and 50% silica sand with 50% perlite. These growing media were tested in conjunction with 5 different fertigation regimes (FR). Plants grown in FR1 received aqueous nutrient solution once every week, FR2 received aqueous nutrient solution once every second week, FR3 received aqueous nutrient solution once every third week, FR4 received aqueous nutrient solution once every fourth week and FR5 received aqueous nutrient solution once every fifth week respectively. Results from this experiment showed that different soilless growing media and fertigation had varying effects on alkaloid concentrations in &lt;i&gt;S. tortuosum&lt;/i&gt;.

For the treatment of metabolic syndrome, traditional herbal medicines such as frankincense or &lt;i&gt;Boswellia&lt;/i&gt; species have been used due to their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-obesity, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and hypolipidemic properties. Based on the literature, published evidence up to 2020 about the therapeutic effects of &lt;i&gt;Boswellia&lt;/i&gt; species on the metabolic disorder among Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar were precisely evaluated by keywords such as obesity, diabetes, hyperglycemia, hypertension, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, frankincense, and Boswellia. According to the results, &lt;i&gt;Boswellia&lt;/i&gt; species have beneficial effects to control metabolic syndrome and its related disorders such as hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and its complications. &lt;i&gt;Boswellia&lt;/i&gt; species by reducing the resistance to insulin and restoring pancreatic beta cells decrease blood glucose. Also, &lt;i&gt;Boswellia&lt;/i&gt; species has antithrombotic and anticoagulant properties that regulate blood pressure. The anti-oxidant properties of &lt;i&gt;Boswellia&lt;/i&gt; species modulate the blood lipid profile via reducing TNF-α, IL-1β levels, and increasing the adiponectin level. The therapeutic and protective effects of &lt;i&gt;Boswellia&lt;/i&gt; species on metabolic disorders were remarkably confirmed regarding decreasing hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obesity.">

The aim of study was to compare the effects of OT and DAT pyrophosphates (-PP) on the kinetics of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; culture of HeLa cells. The kinetic study showed that 3-deazathiamine pyrophosphate (DATPP) was a much stronger competitive inhibitor (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0026 μM) of PDHC than OTPP (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; = 0.025 μM). Both &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; values were much lower versus &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; for thiamine pyrophosphate (0.06 μM). However, DATPP added to the culture medium for the HeLa cells culture did not hamper the rate of cell growth and showed not significant impact on the viability of the cells, whereas OTPP and OT showed a significant cytostatic effect. The differences between the thiamine antivitamins in their effect on cell growth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; may be due to differences in physicochemical properties and difficulty in DAT transport across the cell membrane.">

        <span class="abst" title="The First Australians had well-developed healing systems. Groote Eylandt inhabitants used a variety of plant species to treat diarrhoea and other gastrointestinal illnesses. This study was undertaken to test, identify, and evaluate traditional medicines to treat these conditions against gastrointestinal bacterial, protozoal, and viral pathogens, as well as against cancer cell proliferation. Six plant species (&lt;i&gt;Buchanania obovata&lt;/i&gt; Engl., &lt;i&gt;Casuarina equisetifolia&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus tetrodonta&lt;/i&gt; F. Muell., &lt;i&gt;Planchonia careya&lt;/i&gt; (F. Muell.) R. Knuth, &lt;i&gt;Terminalia carpentariae&lt;/i&gt; C. T. White, and &lt;i&gt;Vigna vexillata&lt;/i&gt; (L.) A. Rich.) were selected from a survey of a panel of elders from the Warnindhilyagwa tribe and compared with the published literature. Decoctions prepared according to traditional methods were screened for growth inhibitory activity of a panel of diarrhoea-causing bacterial pathogens by disc diffusion and liquid dilution MIC assays. Inhibitory activity against the gastrointestinal protozoal parasite &lt;i&gt;Giardia duodenalis&lt;/i&gt; and antiproliferative activity against human colorectal (Caco2) and cervical (HeLa) cancer cell lines were evaluated using MTS-based colorimetric cell proliferation assays. Preliminary antiviral screening was accomplished using an MS2 bacteriophage plaque reduction assay. Toxicity was evaluated using &lt;i&gt;Artemia franciscana&lt;/i&gt; nauplii mortality and HDF cell viability bioassays. All traditional medicines tested inhibited bacterial growth, often with MIC values substantially &lt;1000 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. &lt;i&gt;T. carpentariae&lt;/i&gt; was particularly noteworthy, with MIC values of 230-350 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL against &lt;i&gt;Citrobacter freundii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Salmonella newport&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Shigella sonnei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus epidermidis&lt;/i&gt;. This species also had MICs 450-950 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL against all other bacterial pathogens. &lt;i&gt;B. obovata&lt;/i&gt; Engl. and &lt;i&gt;E. tetrodonta&lt;/i&gt; were also good inhibitors of bacterial growth, albeit with substantially higher MIC values than determined for &lt;i&gt;T. carpentariae.&lt;/i&gt; The &lt;i&gt;T. carpentariae&lt;/i&gt; decoction was also the best inhibitor of MS2 phage replication (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 427 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) and Caco2 and HeLa proliferation (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 885 and 85 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, respectively). None of the extracts were particularly strong inhibitors of &lt;i&gt;Giardia duodenalis&lt;/i&gt; growth. All decoctions were nontoxic in the &lt;i&gt;Artemia&lt;/i&gt; nauplii and HDF cell viability bioassays, indicating their suitability for therapeutic use.">

This might be due to lack of awareness about the traditional uses and lack of scientific study of ethnomedicinal plants. So, this study aimed to carry out the antibacterial and antioxidant activity of two medicinal plants which are used traditionally for wound healing activity, i.e.,&lt;i&gt;Mimosa rubicaulis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Reinwardtia indica.&lt;/i&gt; Different parts of &lt;i&gt;Mimosa rubicaulis&lt;/i&gt; (root, stem, and leaves) and &lt;i&gt;Reinwardtia indica&lt;/i&gt; (flower and leaves) were used for the study. Extractions were done by maceration using ethanol as solvent. Antibacterial activity was carried out by the well diffusion method, and antioxidant activities were screened by DPPH radical scavenging and NO scavenging assays. Extract of &lt;i&gt;M. rubicaulis&lt;/i&gt; has shown a weak zone of inhibition towards &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; whereas &lt;i&gt;R. indica&lt;/i&gt; has shown no zone of inhibition towards selected bacterial strains. Leaf, root, and stem extracts of &lt;i&gt;M. rubicaulis&lt;/i&gt; have shown potent antioxidant activity, i.e., IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 9.8 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, 10.19 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, and, 13.64 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. Similarly, leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;R. indica&lt;/i&gt; exhibited antioxidant activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 19.73 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. The percentage inhibition of NO radicals of root and stem of &lt;i&gt;M. rubicaulis&lt;/i&gt; and leaves of &lt;i&gt;R. indica&lt;/i&gt; was 31%, 21%, and 22%, respectively. Out of these two plant species, &lt;i&gt;M. rubicaulis&lt;/i&gt; had shown antibacterial activity towards selected microorganism, but antioxidant activity was shown by both plant species. These properties on above mentioned two plant species might help for the development of a marketed formulation for antibacterial and wound-healing agent since wound healing is promoted by antibacterial and antioxidant activities.">

The effective therapeutics are in urgent need. Here, we developed a high-content screening for the antiviral candidates using fluorescence-based SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein detection in Vero E6 cells coupled with plaque reduction assay. Among 122 Thai natural products, we found that Boesenbergia rotunda extract and its phytochemical compound, panduratin A, exhibited the potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Treatment with B. rotunda extract and panduratin A after viral infection drastically suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero E6 cells with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 3.62 μg/mL (CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 28.06 µg/mL) and 0.81 μΜ (CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 14.71 µM), respectively. Also, the treatment of panduratin A at the pre-entry phase inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 5.30 µM (CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 43.47 µM). Our study demonstrated, for the first time, that panduratin A exerts the inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection at both pre-entry and post-infection phases. Apart from Vero E6 cells, treatment with this compound was able to suppress viral infectivity in human airway epithelial cells. This result confirmed the potential of panduratin A as the anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent in the major target cells in human. Since B. rotunda is a culinary herb generally grown in China and Southeast Asia, its extract and the purified panduratin A may serve as the promising candidates for therapeutic purposes with economic advantage during COVID-19 situation.">

Currently, there are no approved treatments or vaccines, and this severe respiratory illness has cost many lives. Despite the established antimicrobial and immune-boosting potency described for honey, to date there is still a lack of evidence about its potential role amid COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the previously explored antiviral effects and phytochemical components of honey, we review here evidence for its role as a potentially effective natural product against COVID-19. Although some bioactive compounds in honey have shown potential antiviral effects (i.e., methylglyoxal, chrysin, caffeic acid, galangin and hesperidinin) or enhancing antiviral immune responses (i.e., levan and ascorbic acid), the mechanisms of action for these compounds are still ambiguous. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exclusively summarizing all these bioactive compounds with their probable mechanisms of action as antiviral agents, specifically against SARS-CoV-2.">

Because the main advantage of natural products consists in administering them in combination rather than as single compound, we aimed to understand whether the combination of PEL and LAT, herein PELIRGOSTIM, could still prove beneficial or additive/synergistic activities during inflammatory conditions. To pursue this goal, we used macrophagic cells (J774.1) and treated them with PEL and LAT in a concentration-dependent manner. We found that PELIRGOSTIM was able to reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrite, effects that were correlated to the release of lower levels of IL-1β after LPS treatment. In addition, the combination of PEL and LAT showed bacteriostatic activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli which had limited growth starting from 5 hours up to 20 hours. This effect was stronger than that observed for penicillin/streptomycin. Our results provide PELIRGOSTIM as an innovative combination of natural products capable to prevent inflammation-, oxidative stress- and microbial-related disorders.">

The study focused on highlighting the importance of this plant's phytoconstituents as potential source of novel antimicrobials against planktonic as well as biofilm forming microorganisms, along with their antiproliferative activity. The biosafety of the phytoconstituents was also established, followed by detection of probable antimicrobial components.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The best organic extractant and major groups of phytoconstituents were tested for their antimicrobial activity against reference microbial strains and drug-resistant clinical isolates. The anti-proliferative potential of the most active group of phytoconstituents was evaluated against cancerous cell lines. The in vitro biosafety of phytoconstituents was evaluated by Ames and MTT assay, while in vivo biosafety of the most active phytoconstituents, i.e., flavonoids was determined by acute oral toxicity. Further, the probable antimicrobial components in the flavonoids were detected by TLC and GC-MS.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Ethyl acetate extract was the most effective among various organic extracts, whereas phytoconstituents such as flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, saponins, tannins, triterpenes and phytosterols were the major groups present, with flavonoids being the most potent antimicrobials. The phytoconstituents displayed a significant antibiofilm potential, as exhibited by inhibition of initial cell attachment, disruption of the pre-formed biofilms and reduced metabolic activity of biofilms. The phytoconstituents were significantly active against the drug-resistant strains of E.coli, MRSA and Salmonella spp. Further, flavonoids showed significant cytotoxic effect against the cancerous cell lines but were non-cytotoxic against Vero (normal) cell line. All the test preparations were biosafe, as depicted by the Ames test and MTT assay. Also, flavonoids did not induce any abnormality in body weight, clinical signs, biochemical parameters and organs' histopathology of the Swiss albino mice during in vivo acute oral toxicity studies. The flavonoids were resolved into 4 bands (S1-S4), where S3 was the most active and its GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of a number of compounds, where Bicyclo [2.2.1]heptan-2-one,1,7,7-trimethyl-, (1S)- was the most abundant.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;These findings suggest that the phytoconstituents from Symplocos racemosa bark could act as potential source of antimicrobial as well as antiproliferative metabolites.">

However, pharmacological studies on these compounds are still scarce. In the present study, we aim to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms associated with the effects of RTA-B in RAW264.7 macrophages and LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells by detecting cell viabilities, nitric oxide (NO) production, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production. Simultaneously, the anti-inflammatory action mechanisms of these two compounds were illustrated through western blot assay. Besides, the antihepatic fibrosis activities of these compounds have also been explored. The results demonstrated that RTA and RTB inhibited the production of NO, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, and IL-6 and suppressed liver fibrosis. RTA and RTB treatment also greatly inhibited the activation of NF-kappaB (NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B) pathway. Our study confirmed the promising anti-inflammatory and anti-liver fibrosis actions of RTA-B, suggesting that they might be developed as alternative and promising drugs for the treatment of hepatic inflammatory and fibrotic diseases.">

It has demonstrated several pharmacological activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Various studies have indicated that the pharmacological activity of curcumin is contributed by its metabolites. The aim of this review is to present an overview of metabolic products of curcumin produced upon its reduction like di, tetra, hexa and octa-hydrocurcumin. In addition, this paper has systematically analyzed the current information regarding medicinal use of reduced metabolites of curcumin and identified the limitations which have hindered its widespread usage in the medical world. Several diverse therapeutic effects have shown to be exhibited by reduced metabolites of curcumin such as antioxidant, anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory activities. The potential underlying molecular mechanisms of the biological activities of reduced metabolites of curcumin have also been highlighted, which may provide insight into the principle of effectiveness of curcumin.">

Essential oils are known for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties. This study evaluated the antifungal activity of essential oil from &lt;i&gt;E. kebericho&lt;/i&gt; against four common pathogenic fungi and two standard strains.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. The antifungal screening was done by agar well diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution. Minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by subculturing fungal strains with no visible growth onto a Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; were highly sensitive while &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/i&gt; did not show sensitivity up to 1 mg/ml of essential oil; MICs ranged from 0.083 mg/ml to 0.208 mg/ml. Concentration and fungal species showed significant dose-dependent associations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.0001) with antifungal activity. The MICs of essential oil were comparable to those of the standard drug (fluconazole) against &lt;i&gt;C. glabrata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. krusei.&lt;/i&gt; The lowest MFC of the essential oil was observed against &lt;i&gt;Candida parapsilosis&lt;/i&gt; (0.145 mg/ml) while the highest MFC was against &lt;i&gt;Candida krusei&lt;/i&gt; (0.667 mg/ml).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Echinops kebericho&lt;/i&gt; essential oil showed noteworthy antifungal activity against &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Candida glabrata&lt;/i&gt; and could be a potential candidate for further antifungal drug development.">

        <span class="abst" title="Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (known as chuanbeimu in Chinese, FCB) is a famous folk medicine which has been widely used to relieve cough and eliminate phlegm for thousands of years in China. The medicine originates from dried bulbs of six species of &lt;i&gt;Fritillaria&lt;/i&gt; which are distributed in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere. Increasing attention has been paid to FCB because of its excellent medicinal value such as being antitussive, expectorant, analgesic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative. During the past years, a large number of research studies have been conducted to investigate the phytochemistry, pharmacology, and pharmacokinetics of FCB. A range of compounds have been isolated and identified from FCB, including alkaloids, saponins, nucleosides, organic acids, terpenoids, and sterols. Among them, alkaloids as the main active ingredient have been illustrated to exert significant therapeutic effects on many diseases such as cancer, acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. Due to the excellent medical value and low toxicity, FCB has a huge market all over the world and triggers a growing enthusiasm among researchers. However, there is still a lack of systematic review. Hence, in this work, we reviewed the FCB-based articles published in Sci Finder, Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, CNKI, and other databases in the recent years. The traditional uses, sources, phytochemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity of FCB were discussed in the review, which aims to provide a reference for further development and utilization of FCB.">

The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiproliferative effects of TCEO on A549, HepG2, MCF-7 cancer cells, and HUVEC non-tumor cells was investigated using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to evaluate cell cycle distribution using propidium iodide staining, and cell death mode using Annexin V-FITC/PI assays. The expression of some apoptosis related genes was investigated using qRT-PCR. Major constituents of TCEO included fenchol, borneol, 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol and 3-ethyl-3-methyl. Cell viability test showed that TCEO is highly effective against MCF-7 cells with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 12.5 µg/mL. Cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase, and apoptosis mediation were evident in the presence of TCEO. Gene expression analysis of several pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes revealed the initiation of apoptosis in TCEO-MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our study confirms the antiproliferative activity of the &lt;i&gt;T. camphoratus&lt;/i&gt; essential oil.">

        <span class="abst" title="Traditional and complementary medicine constitutes an important, and often underestimated, source of healthcare for multiple diseases including cancer. However, little is known about the ethnomedical knowledge and practices in Northern Africa. The main objective of this study is to identify and analyze the variety of natural products used in Algerian ethnopharmacology for cancer therapy. For this purpose, semi-structured interviews with 225 traditional healers, herbalists and practitioners were realized in twelve locations in Algeria throughout field studies performed from June 2015 to July 2019. Interviews covered popular and vernacular names of the natural product, mode of use and administration, dose, period of treatment, toxicity and side effects among other data. The obtained results reveal the use of 113 medicinal plants (belonging to 53 families and 104 genera), 10 animal species and various products and by-products from different origins such as honey, olive oil, thorns, urine, milk, animal fat and the alkaline water of Zamzam. Basing on the frequency of citation (FC), use reports (UR) and use value (UV), the most used natural products for cancer treatment are honey (FC = 181, UR = 194, UV = 0.65), &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; L. (FC = 131, UR = 152, UV = 0.54), &lt;i&gt;Aristolochia longa&lt;/i&gt; L. (FC = 118, UR = 144, UV = 0.51), &lt;i&gt;Berberis vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; L. (FC = 111, UR = 142, UV = 0.51), &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt; L. (FC = 107, UR = 121, UV = 0.43), &lt;i&gt;Trigonella foenum&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;graecum&lt;/i&gt; L. (FC = 102; UR = 119, UV = 0.43), &lt;i&gt;Citrus limon&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Obseck (FC = 97, UR = 120, UV = 0.43), &lt;i&gt;Artemisia herba-alba&lt;/i&gt; Asso (FC = 92, UR = 115, UV = 0.41) and the holy water 'Zamzam' (FC = 110, UR = 110, UV = 0.43) respectively. Mixtures of two or more ingredients were frequently used. The use of Pelophylax saharicus skin' was reported for the first time for the treatment of visible tumors and skin cancer. This is the first study documenting the traditional uses of various natural products for cancer treatment in Algeria. Our findings are relevant to document the traditional uses of numerous natural products and to provide background basis to search for novel compounds for cancer therapy.">

In this study, synthesis of AgNPs and AuNPs was performed using two different aqueous extraction methods for &lt;i&gt;Crassocephalum rubens&lt;/i&gt;: maceration using laboratory method of extraction (cold aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;Crassocephalum rubens&lt;/i&gt; (AECR)), and decoction using traditional healer's method of extraction (hot aqueous crude extract of &lt;i&gt;Crassocephalum rubens&lt;/i&gt; (CECR)). The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized using various methods, and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant potential were thereafter investigated. The characterization results indicated the formation of mostly spherical-shaped AgNPs and AuNPs with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of 470 nm and 540 nm, respectively. The nanoparticles possess high antioxidant potentials but AECR synthesized AuNPs exhibited the least phytochemical contents and antioxidant potential when compared to other nanoparticles. It can therefore be concluded that extraction method and nanoparticle type are important factors that could influence the antioxidant properties of the nanoparticles. Further studies using these nanoparticles as anticancer or anti-inflammatory agent in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro and in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are underway.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The Mountains of the Western Lesser Caucasus with its rich plant diversity, multicultural and multilingual nature host diverse ethnobotanical knowledge related to medicinal plants. However, cross-cultural medicinal ethnobotany and patterns of plant knowledge have not yet been investigated in the region. Doing so could highlight the salient medicinal plant species and show the variations between communities. This study aimed to determine and discuss the similarities and differences of medicinal ethnobotany among people living in highland pastures on both sides of the Georgia-Turkey border.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;During the 2017 and 2018 summer transhumance period, 119 participants (74 in Turkey, 45 in Georgia) were interviewed with semi-structured questions. The data was structured in use-reports (URs) following the ICPC classification. Cultural Importance (CI) Index, informant consensus factor (FIC), shared/separate species-use combinations, as well as literature data were used for comparing medicinal ethnobotany of the communities.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;One thousand five hundred six UR for 152 native wild plant species were documented. More than half of the species are in common on both sides of the border. Out of 817 species-use combinations, only 9% of the use incidences are shared between communities across the border. Around 66% of these reports had not been previously mentioned specifically in the compared literature. Only 33 species have similar use reports in both countries, most important of which are Plantago major, Urtica dioica, Picea orientalis, Anthemis spp., Sambucus ebulus, Achillea millefolium, Helichrysum rubicundum, Mentha longifolia, Pinus sylvestris var. hamata, Hypericum perforatum, Tussilago farfara, Helichrysum plicatum, Rumex crispus, Berberis vulgaris, and Origanum vulgare. More than half of species reported in each country were found to have more than one part of the plant valued for medicinal use. The most common way of using plants medicinally in both countries is drinking the water infusion of aerial parts with flowers. Based on CI index value, two-thirds of the salient 15 genera in both countries have use reports in at least seven medicinal use categories. While the most cited category with highest FIC is digestive in Georgia, it is skin category in Turkey. Patterns of medicinal plant knowledge among studied communities appear to be connected with more than one cultural factor, in particular ethnolinguistic diversity, cultural background, and access to multilingual written folk and scientific literature, or probably a combination of various factors.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Considering the regions' floral similarity, common historical-cultural contact, and similar livelihood strategies of the communities, shared ethnomedicinal knowledge across the Georgia-Turkey border is quite low. Even though the impacts of accessing multilingual folk and scientific literature are likely to be significant, the factors that shape the medicinal plant knowledge patterns of the communities are shown to be variable among species, needing further research into intracultural diversity and socio-economical conditions, as well as the political history across the border.">

This disease starts slow, increasing gradually to worsen in the due course of time. AD is mainly characterized by the associated dementia, which is a decline of cognitive effects such as memory, praxis, and orientation. The dementia is further highlighted by the presence of psychological and behavioral symptoms. Additionally, AD is also associated with the multiple interconnected pathways linked neuropathological changes such as the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β plaques inside the brain. AD therapeutics have been of prime concern over the decades, resulting in the elucidation of promising therapeutic targets. The requirement of AD stage dependent optimized conditions has necessitated a combinatorial approach toward treatment. The priority in AD research has remained to develop disease-modifying and development-reducing drugs for treatment regimens followed during the early and later stages, respectively.">

The major focus of experimental and clinical studies are conducted on the effects of natural products and their active components on neurodegenerative diseases. This review will discuss an herbal constituent known as cinnamaldehyde (CA) with the neuroprotective potential to treat neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Accumulating evidence supports the notion that CA displays neuroprotective effects in AD and PD animal models by modulating neuroinflammation, suppressing oxidative stress, and improving the synaptic connection. CA exerts these effects through its action on multiple signaling pathways, including TLR4/NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B, NLRP3, ERK1/2-MEK, NO, and Nrf2 pathways. To summarize, CA and its derivatives have been shown to improve pathological changes in AD and PD animal models, which may provide a new therapeutic option for neurodegenerative interventions. To this end, further experimental and clinical studies are required to prove the neuroprotective effects of CA and its derivatives.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Cordyceps militaris&lt;/i&gt; (CM), a valuable edible and medicinal fungus, has been used as traditional medicine to treat health conditions, as well as hyposexuality in Asian societies for over a century. Due to the high demand, several artificial cultivation methods have been developed for their biological activities. In this study, CM was cultured on medium that contained white rice and silkworm pupae, and the levels of cordycepin and adenosine, as well as its aphrodisiac effects in diabetes-induced erectile dysfunction (DIED), were evaluated. Diabetic rats were induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection and administered orally with CM (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 g/kg BW/day) for 3 weeks. Diabetic rats in negative and positive control groups received vehicle and sildenafil citrate (5 mg/kg), respectively. Results showed the changes in mating behaviour in which mount latency and intromission latency were significantly increased in diabetic rats, compared with the normal control group. Diabetic rats also showed a significant reduction in intracavernosal pressure (ICP) response to cavernous nerve stimulation, sperm count, testosterone level, penile nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and testicular superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, when compared to the normal control group. Administration of CM (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 g/kg BW/day) reversed the effects of diabetes on the mating behaviour, and the ICP responses to electrical stimulation. Moreover, the levels of penile NOS, testicular SOD activities, testosterone, and sperm count were significantly increased, and testicular malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased in these treated diabetic rats. Diabetic rats treated with sildenafil showed a significant induction in intromission frequency and NOS and SOD activities, as well as a marked increase in ICP responses. These results suggest that CCM exerts its aphrodisiac effect, possibly through activating testosterone production and suppressing oxidative stress to enhance erectile function in diabetic rats.">

The reducing sugar content and total phenolic content were determined by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) and the Folin-Ciocalteu method, respectively. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant activity was evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The reducing sugar content of the studied plant samples ranged from 6.89 ± 2.44 to 674.13 ± 2.43 mg GE/g dry extract weight and the total phenolic content ranged from 14.87 ± 0.41 to 281.71 ± 1.47 mg GAE/g dry extract weight. The reducing sugar and total phenolic content were found highest in &lt;i&gt;Ficus glaberrima&lt;/i&gt;. Antioxidant activity was found highest in &lt;i&gt;Melastoma malabathricum&lt;/i&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;value = 6.27 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), followed by &lt;i&gt;F. glaberrima&lt;/i&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;value = 11.7 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL). A positive and significant correlation was found between (i) total phenolic content and reducing sugar content and (ii) total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The present study is the first study for the analysis of reducing sugar content of selected plants and for the scientific exploration of &lt;i&gt;F. glaberrima&lt;/i&gt;. The present result suggests that the various parts of these studied plants could be assumed as a rich source of biologically active compounds and considered beneficial for the food and pharmaceutical industries.">

The resistance of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; to the ACT (Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies) has led to the search for new antimalarial drugs. The purpose of this research was to assess the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activity of &lt;i&gt;Entandrophragma cylindricum&lt;/i&gt; ethyl acetate extract to provide a scientific basis for the use of this medicinal plant to treat malaria.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Entandrophragma cylindricum&lt;/i&gt; stem bark powder was macerated in ethyl acetate to obtain the extract. The extract liquid filtrate was concentrated, evaporated and dry using a Rotavapor. The Peter and Rane test were used for the suppressive and curative antiplasmodial activities at different doses (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg). A positive and negative control groups were administered chloroquine (5 mg/kg) and 10% hypromelose, respectively. To assess the parasitemia of the mice a thin blood smear was made.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The ethyl acetate extract completely (100%) inhibited the development of &lt;i&gt;P. berghei&lt;/i&gt; in the suppressive test at the dose of 500 mg/kg while that of the curative test was inhibited at 95%. The extract-treated group (500 mg/kg) and (Chloroquine (5 mg/kg) group all survived. The negative control group recorded a 100% mortality rate.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The present study provides scientific confirmation on the use of &lt;i&gt;E. cylindricum&lt;/i&gt; stem bark as an antiplasmodial remedy. However, the identification of the mode of action and the purification of the active compounds are necessary for further studies.">

In this study the phenolic and carotenoid composition of this plant was both investigated and associated bioactivities were evaluated. Aiming to obtain extracts and volatile fractions of known medicinal plants to valorize them in the pharmaceutical or food industries, two techniques of extraction and five solvents were used to determine the biologically active compounds. Gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization and mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography coupled to photodiode array and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry highlighted the presence of 15 volatiles, 19 phenolic, and 24 natural pigments in &lt;i&gt;Scabiosa atropurpurea&lt;/i&gt; L. stem samples; among them, the most abundant were 1,8-cineole, chlorogenic acid, cynaroside, and lutein. Bioactivity was assessed by a set of in vitro tests checking for antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and allelopathic (against &lt;i&gt;Brassica oleracea&lt;/i&gt; L. and &lt;i&gt;Lens culinaris&lt;/i&gt; Medik) effects. &lt;i&gt;Scabiosa atropurpurea&lt;/i&gt; L. stem extracts presented a considerable antioxidant, antibacterial, and allelopathic potential, with less antifungal effectiveness. These results indicate that the volatile fractions and extracts from &lt;i&gt;S. atropurpurea&lt;/i&gt; L. stem could be considered as a good source of bioactive agents, with possible applications in food-related, agriculture, and pharmaceutical fields. Genetic investigations showed 97% of similarity with &lt;i&gt;Scabiosa tschiliensis&lt;/i&gt;, also called Japanese &lt;i&gt;Scabiosa.&lt;/i&gt;">

In this study, we examined inhibitory effects of snapdragon flower extract (SFE) against distinctive properties of cancer cells, stimulated growth, and activated metastasis, using H1299 lung cancer and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines. SFE treatment at 100-1,000 μg/ml for 24-72 hr resulted in a time- and dose-dependent growth inhibition in H1299 and HCT116 cells. Cell cycle analysis and Annexin V staining assay further revealed that SFE caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and induction of apoptosis, indicating the growth inhibition by SFE is attributed to its G2/M cell cycle-arresting and apoptosis-inducing activities. SFE dose-dependently enhanced generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in H1299 cells but had no effect on intracellular ROS levels in HCT116 cells, suggesting that the type of apoptosis induced by SFE in H1299 cells is different to that in HCT116 cells. Furthermore, SFE alleviated invasion, levels of matrix metalloproteinases, migration, and adhesion in H1299 and HCT116 cells. These results indicate that SFE not only inhibits cell growth by cell cycle arrest at G2/M and apoptosis induction but also alleviates metastatic properties such as invasion, migration, and adhesion in lung and colon cancer cells.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Heracleum persicum&lt;/i&gt;, commonly named Persian hogweed, is a principal native medicinal plant in Iran. Collecting &lt;i&gt;H. persicum&lt;/i&gt; at the most appropriate growing stage is the key factor to achieve the high phytochemical quality to meet consumer's needs. In the present experiment, the aerial parts of this plant were harvested at up to six different developmental stages during the growing season to determine the phytochemical profiles. Our results indicated that the highest essential oil content was obtained in the mid-mature seed stage (3.5%). The most elevated extract content was recorded in the floral budding stage (10.4%). In the vegetative stage, limonene (18.1%), in floral budding stage, caryophyllene (14.1%), anethole (14.6%), and β-bisabolene (12.7%), in the full flowering stage, myristicin (15.0%), and hexyl butyrate (9.1%), in the early development of seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (32.1%), and octyl acetate (11.7%), in the mid-mature seeds stage hexyl butyrate (38.8%), octyl acetate (14.5%), in the late-mature/ripe seeds stage, hexyl butyrate (23.6%), and octyl acetate (10.5%) are recorded as the main components. The highest phenolic acids content was obtained in the floral budding stage (287.40 mg/g dried extract). The analysis of phenolic acids demonstrated cinnamic acid (8.0-225.3 mg/g extract), p-coumaric acid (1.7-39.2 mg/g extract), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (0.8-16.8 mg/g extract), and ferulic acid (2.4-15.8 mg/g extract) as the main phenolic acids. Cinnamic acid was found as the major phenolic compound in the vegetative stage following by floral budding, the full flowering stage, the early development of seeds, and late-mature/ripe seeds stages. P-coumaric acid was the most abundant phenolic compounds in the mid-mature seeds stage. In this regard, the harvest time of &lt;i&gt;H. persicum&lt;/i&gt; aerial parts can be selected to achieve the highest secondary metabolites of interest. The results of this study can be used as a guideline for grower to obtain the highest possible amount of desirable metabolites, beneficial in both food and pharmaceutical industries as well as their undeniable economical benefits.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Dental caries and periodontal disease are the most common chronic infectious oral diseases in the world. Acacia nilotica was commonly known in Sudan as Garad or Sunt has a wide range of medicinal uses. In the present study, antibacterial activity of oral bacteria (Streptococcus sobrinus and Porphyromonas gingivalis), inhibitory activity against glucosyltransferase (GTF) enzyme and antioxidant activity were assayed for methanolic crude extract of A. nilotica bark and its fractions.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Methanoilc crude extract of A. nilotica bark was applied to a Sephadex LH-20 column and eluted with methanol, aqueous methanol, and finally aqueous acetone to obtain four fractions (Fr1- Fr4). Furthermore, the crude extract and fractions were subjected to analytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The crude extract and its fractions were assayed for antibacterial activity against S. sobrinus and P. gingivalis using a microplate dilution assay method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), as well as GTF inhibition and antioxidant activity using ABTS radical scavenging method.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Fractions (Fr1 and Fr2) exhibited MIC values of 0.3 mg/ml against the P. gingivalis. Additionally, Fr2 displayed MBC value of 1 mg/ml against two types of bacteria. Fr4 showed an especially potent GTF inhibitory activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 3.9 μg/ml. Fr1 displayed the best antioxidant activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 1.8 μg/ml. The main compound in Fr1 was identified as gallic acid, and Fr2 was mostly a mixture of gallic acid and methyl gallate.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The results obtained in this study provide some scientific rationale and justify the use of this plant for the treatment of dental diseases in traditional medicine. A. nilotica bark, besides their antibacterial potentiality and GTF inhibitory activity, it may be used as adjuvant antioxidants in mouthwashes. Further studies in the future are required to identify the rest of the active compounds.">

Their contribution still holds an important place in modern drug discovery due to their chemical, and biological diversities. However, the poor documentation of traditional medicine, in developing African countries for instance, can lead to the loss of knowledge related to such practices. In this study, we present the Eastern Africa Natural Products Database (EANPDB) containing the structural and bioactivity information of 1870 unique molecules isolated from about 300 source species from the Eastern African region. This represents the largest collection of natural products (NPs) from this geographical region, covering literature data of the period from 1962 to 2019. The computed physicochemical properties and toxicity profiles of each compound have been included. A comparative analysis of some physico-chemical properties like molecular weight, H-bond donor/acceptor, logP&lt;sub&gt;o/w&lt;/sub&gt; , etc. as well scaffold diversity analysis has been carried out with other published NP databases. EANPDB was combined with the previously published Northern African Natural Products Database (NANPDB), to form a merger African Natural Products Database (ANPDB), containing ∼6500 unique molecules isolated from about 1000 source species (freely available at http://african-compounds.org). As a case study, latrunculins A and B isolated from the sponge Negombata magnifica (Podospongiidae) with previously reported antitumour activities, were identified via substructure searching as molecules to be explored as putative binders of histone deacetylases (HDACs).">

The plants and the remedy were macerated with 95% ethanol and boiled in water. Cytotoxic activity of the extracts was analyzed by SRB assay. Total flavonoid contents of the extracts were determined and their correlation with cytotoxic activity was evaluated. The hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to classify the extracts by their cytotoxic characteristics. A total of 66.7% of the plants was active against the tested cancer cell lines. Among the 44 plants in the remedy used for cancer treatment, nine plants that are also used in Thai cuisine exerted significant cytotoxicity against tested cancer cell lines. Eleven plants in the remedy were active against at least one of the tested cancer cell lines. All extracts were grouped into three groups and illustrated as heat map and hierarchical dendrogram. Total flavonoid content showed weak or no correlation with cytotoxic activity. &lt;i&gt;A. dahurica, F. albopurpurea,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;T. indica&lt;/i&gt; selectively exerted potent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 with SI value more than 6. &lt;i&gt;A. galanga, P. amarus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L. striatum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H. indicum,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;F. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; exerted moderate cytotoxicity to all tested cell with low toxicity to normal cells.

Mass of crude extracts was determined by using the Whatman No. 1 filter paper and rotary evaporator. Major secondary metabolites were also screened using phytochemical screening tests. Antibacterial activities (inhibition zones, mm) and minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) were evaluated using agar-well diffused methods and agar dilution methods, respectively. The antibiotics ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, penicillin, and tetracycline were used as positive controls at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml and 0.2 mg/ml, while distilled water was used as the negative control. All the crude extracts were tested triplet (3x) for antibacterial activities against selected bacterial strains with two different concentrations 25 and 50 mg/ml and analyzed to compare the mean ± standard deviation between triplets. The results revealed that ethanol extracts showed high crude mass extracts, antibacterial activities, and major secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, tennis, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, and phlobatannins compared with aqueous extracts. Among antibiotics used, penicillin showed resistance to &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; O157 H:7. &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; was found to be the most susceptible bacterium to ethanol extracts' leaves, barks, and stems with MIC 3.125 mg/ml, whereas &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; was the least susceptible to all crude extracts.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;b&gt;Objectives:&lt;/b&gt; Cholinesterase inhibition is a common strategy to treat Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we have investigated the cholinesterase inhibitory effects of a first-of-its-kind turmeric extract (REVERC3) having enriched content of bisdemethoxycurcumin as major active curcuminoid. &lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The inhibition studies were performed using Ellman's colorimetric assay. The kinetics of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase was determined in the presence of REVERC3 using the Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. Furthermore, we used AutoDock tools to predict the binding of bisdemethoxycurcumin with the active sites of cholinesterases. &lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: REVERC3 showed 4.8- and 5.39-fold higher inhibitory potential of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase with IC50 values of 29.08 and 33.59 µg/mL, respectively, compared to the regular turmeric extract. The mode of binding of REVERC3 was competitive in the case of acetylcholinesterase while it was uncompetitive for the inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase. Docking analysis revealed that bisdemethoxycurcumin, the major constituent of REVERC3, has different preferences of binding in the active sites of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. However, the best binding pose predictions are in line with the experimental binding mode of the cholinesterases. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;: These results indicate that bisdemethoxycurcumin-enriched turmeric extract could improve the cholinergic functions via dual inhibition of cholinesterases. However, the predominant role of bisdemethoxycurcumin in REVERC3 must be further validated using preclinical studies and clinical trials.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The incidence and mortality of breast cancer in women is increasing worldwide. Breast cancer contains a subpopulation of cells known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). The CSCs are believed to be responsible for chemotherapeutic resistance and are also involved in tumor initiation, progression, evolution, and metastasis to distant sites. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-CSC potential of selected Ethiopian medicinal plants traditionally used for breast cancer treatment.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The solvent fractions of three medicinal plants (the ethyl acetate fraction of Vernonia leopoldi, the aqueous fraction of Sideroxylon oxyacanthum, and the chloroform fraction of Clematis simensis) resulting from the methanolic crude extracts were selected based on their previously demonstrated cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cell lines. The effect of these solvent fractions on the status of the cancer stem cell subpopulation of the JIMT-1 cell line was assessed by flow cytometric evaluation of the proportion of aldehyde dehydrogenase positive cells and by measuring colony forming efficiency in a serum-free soft agar assay after treatment. Effects on cell migration using a wound healing assay and on tumor necrosis factor-α-induced translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B to the cell nucleus were also investigated.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The solvent fractions showed a dose-dependent reduction in the aldehyde dehydrogenase positive subpopulation of JIMT-1 cells. The chloroform fraction of C. simensis (80 μg/mL) completely blocked colony formation of JIMT-1 cells. The wound healing assay showed that all fractions significantly reduced cell migration. The ethyl acetate fraction of V. leopoldi (0.87 μg/mL) significantly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-α-induced nuclear factor-kappa B translocation to the nucleus.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The solvent fractions of the medicinal plants showed desirable activities against breast cancer stem cells in the JIMT-1 cell line, which warrants further studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Central Myanmar is located in the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, and the Bamar people are the main ethnic group, which settled there over 1000 years ago. Despite being the core region of the country, central Myanmar has been ignored in previous ethnobotanical studies. Local healthy foods and knowledge are regarded as treasures for resource development and pharmaceutical drug discovery, and market surveys are a good strategy in ethnobotanical research. Thus, we collected and documented typical vegetables and local knowledge in local markets and then analysed the diversity and local knowledge of these vegetables.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;Observations and interviews were used in the field study, and 10 markets and fairs were selected in central Myanmar. A total of 277 vegetable stalls or shops were visited. We compared the local knowledge we collected with selected important and typical herbal books on traditional Myanmar medicine. Quantitative analysis, including frequency of citation (FC), relative frequency of citation (RFC) and use value (UV), was used to assess the diversity and local knowledge of these vegetables.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 132 plant taxa from 47 botanical families and 116 genera were collected. Most (106 taxa, 80.3%) of these vegetables were cited by the informants as functional foods that had health benefits, while others were regarded as merely &quot;good for health&quot;. The main health function of the vegetables was treating digestive problems. Sixty-four species were recorded in selected herbal books on traditional Myanmar medicine, and forty-seven taxa were not recorded in these books but were nonetheless used as healthy vegetables by local people. Twenty-eight species of vegetables were collected from wild places.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The diversity and local knowledge of healthy vegetables in central Myanmar were rich. Nevertheless, the diversity of wild vegetables was seemingly relatively low. The possible reason was that we counted only the vegetables that were from entirely wild sources as &quot;wild vegetables&quot;. The most frequently cited vegetables were commonly cultivated species, which reflects the fact that plants cultivated on a large scale comprise the major source of vegetables. Some lesser known vegetables could reflect the unique food culture of local people, but most of these were cited only a few times by the interviewees, which caused low UV and RFC rankings for them in the league table. In addition, future research should pay more attention to the food safety of these vegetables.">

In this work, we synthesized telmisartan copper nanoparticles and 2-pyrimidinamines via Biginelli reaction using telmisartan copper nanoparticles (Cu-Nps) as a reusable catalyst. The synthesis of 2-pyrimidinamine derivatives (1a-c) was achieved in water and under solvent-free condition (Green chemistry approach). Synthesis of 2-pyrimidinamine with telmisartan copper nanoparticle (Cu-Nps-Pyr) unexpected product was also isolated from synthesis of 2-pyrimidinamine preparation. Antioxidant and cytotoxic activities were carried out both in 2-pyrimidinamine (1a-1c) and 2-pyrimidinamine with telmisartan copper nanoparticles (Cu-Nps-Pyr). The synthesized 2-pyrimidinamine derivatives (1a-c) were characterized from FT-IR, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR spectroscopy, mass and elemental analyses. The synthesized telmisartan copper nanoparticles (Cu-Nps) were characterized from UV spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, EDX, AFM (atomic force microscopy), profile, waviness, and roughness analyses. Antioxidant activity was screened based on ABTS&lt;sup&gt;·+&lt;/sup&gt; radical scavenging and linoleic acid peroxidation performance. Cu-Nps-Pyr-1b showed substantial antioxidant (97.2%) activity against ABTS&lt;sup&gt;·+&lt;/sup&gt; assay and 91.2% activity against AAPH assays compared with Trolox. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using HepG2, HeLa, and MCF-7 cell lines, the Cu-Nps-Pyr-1a is high in toxicities (GI&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;m) against the HeLa cancel cell line compared with doxorubicin. The developed copper NPs with 2-pyrimidinamine (Cu-Nps-Pyr) could provide promising advances as antioxidant activities; this nanocomposition could be considered an anticancer treatment in future investigations.">

As one of the major scholarly Asian traditional medical systems, Sowa Rigpa is the principal health resource for populations across Tibetan regions of China, Mongolia, Bhutan, Nepal, India, and culturally-related areas of Russia. The geography represented by this medicinal plant dataset extends across the entire Tibetan plateau, its adjacent ranges, the wider transregional Himalayas, central Asia and much of the Indian subcontinent. Data collection drew from textual analysis of the seminal works of the Tibetan medical canon, including the &lt;i&gt;Four Medical Treatises, Crystal Orb and Rosary&lt;/i&gt; among others; as well as the contemporary definitive work &lt;i&gt;Stainless Crystal Mirror of Materia Medica&lt;/i&gt; by Gawé Dorjé. Study authors applied the same classification system as Gawé Dorjé, yet reanalyzed specimens according to a database cataloging research on regional herbarium botanical specimens, geographic distributions and regional plant chemistry studies, and confirming proper identification with the most current modern botanical taxonomies. Subsequently, almost 700 of the most commonly used materia medica were selected for compilation. Thus, this dataset represents updated botanical identifications and confirmations from both early and contemporary sources. Botanical specimen names were entered into spreadsheet format with Gawé Dorjé's categories listed alongside Deumar Tendzin Püntsok's early standard. Enclosed raw data are written in Unicode Tibetan font to retain fidelity to entries in the classical texts, with parallel columns in standard Wylie Tibetan transliteration and phonetic transcription. Latin botanical names are updated for each materia medica specimen using Kew's Medicinal Plant Names Services (Kew-MPNS) with missing entries supplied by World Flora Online (WFO) and Flora of China (FoC). This dataset is the first publicly available comprehensive ethnobotanical identification of Sowa Rigpa materia medica with Latin binomial nomenclature. This dataset was developed to inform botanical and pharmacological analysis of the Tibetan medical materia medica repertoire as well as make comparative analyses of related materia medica in other Asian medical systems.">

The Mentha species investigated are &lt;i&gt;Mentha pulegium, Mentha spicata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha viridis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha suaveolens&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha longifolia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha gattefossei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha rotundifolia&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Mentha vulgare&lt;/i&gt;, with &lt;i&gt;M. pulegium&lt;/i&gt; being the most studied species. &lt;i&gt;M. spicata&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;M. viridis&lt;/i&gt; are poorly explored even though they are daily consumed by Moroccans in tea infusions. The elucidated factors affecting the composition of Mentha essential oils are fertilization, drying conditions, mechanical impedance, NaCl stress, and Gamma irradiation. Investigation of the activities of the Mentha species showed that the main interest was dedicated to addressing the antibacterial effect towards gram+ and gram- bacteria. Essential oils of Mentha species exhibited antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, insecticidal, licidal, niticidal, allelopathic, antidiabetic, derma-protective, and anticorrosive activities. The ethnobotanical surveys revealed that Mentha species are used in seven regions: Tafilalet, High Atlas, Fez-Boulemane, Taounat, Oujda, Ouazzane, and Rabat. By calculating the Jaccard index, the highest degree of similarity was found between Tafilalet, Rabat, and Oujda regions. The wide use of the Mentha species in Morocco highlights the high ethnobotanical value of the genus.">

        <span class="abst" title="BGR-34 is a polyherbal formulation frequently used to combat diabetes around the globe especially in Asian countries. It provides an attractive treatment option to prediabetics, diabetics, and in metabolic disorders by controlling the altered blood glucose level. The lack of phytopharmacological studies on BGR-34 prompted as to reveal the compounds responsible for the antidiabetic and free-radical scavenging activity of BGR-34. An attempt was made to assess &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition of BGR-34 along with its free-radical scavenging potential via DPPH scavenging activity. Further, HPTLC profiling and quantitative analysis of berberine and palmatine in BGR-34 were carried out. Thereafter, the TLC-bioautographic-MS analysis was performed to identify the compounds responsible for antidiabetic and antioxidant activities in BGR-34. The results had shown a significant and dose-dependent inhibition potential of BGR-34 against &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymatic reactions along with significant inhibition in DPPH free-radical scavenging activity. The HPTLC profiling and quantitative validation studies showed the presence of berberine and palmatine 44.926 ± 0.2907 and 10.507 ± 0.154 μg/g, respectively. The TLC-MS bioautography revealed a total of four DPPH-active, two α-amylase-active, and nine α-glucosidase-active compounds in BGR-34. It was observed from the study that BGR-34 possesses verities of bioactive compounds, which are reasonable not only for its antidiabetic effect but also for its antioxidant activity.">

        <span class="abst" title="Crocus sativus, a medicinally important herbaceous plant, has been traditionally used to cure coughs, colds, insomnia, cramps, asthma, and pain. Moreover, the therapeutic applications of saffron include its immunomodulatory and anticancer properties. The current experimental analysis was performed to explore the potential nutraceutical efficacy of corm, leaf, petal, and stigma of saffron ethanolic extracts as analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and antidepressant using hot plate, carrageenan-induced paw edema, capillary tube and forced swim test, respectively in mice. The results indicated that among all the extracts, stigma ethanolic extract (SEE) represented maximum latency activity (72.85%) and edema inhibition (77.33%) followed by petal ethanolic extract (PEE) with latency activity and edema inhibition of 64.06 and 70.50%, respectively. Corm ethanolic extract (CEE) and leaf ethanolic extract (LEE) displayed mild analgesic activity of 22.40% and 29.07%, respectively. Additionally, LEE (53.29%) and CEE (47.47%) exhibited mild to moderate response against inflammation. The coagulation time of SEE (101.66 s) was almost equivalent to the standard drug, aspirin (101.66 s), suggesting a strong anticoagulant effect followed by PEE (86.5 s). LEE (66.83 s) represented moderate inhibitory effect on coagulation activity while CEE (42.83 s) showed neutral effect. Additionally, PEE and SEE also expressed itself as potential antidepressants with immobility time ≤76.66 s, while CEE (96.50 s) and LEE (106.83 s) indicated moderate to mild antidepressant efficacy. Based on the in vivo activities, saffron extract, particularly SEE and PEE, can be used as a potential nutraceutical and therapeutic agent due to its significant pharmacological activities.">

Disc diffusion and microdilution assays were used for the antimicrobial activities. Coxsackievirus B-3 (CVB3) and Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) were used for the antiviral activities. &lt;i&gt;Chromobacterium violaceum&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 12472 and CV026) and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; PAO1 were used as starter strains for the anti-quorum sensing tests. Isoprenoids are the main class of compounds identified, and 13R-hydroxy-9E,11Z-octadecadienoic acid, valtratum, rhoifolin, sericetin diacetate, and dihydrosamidin were the dominant phytoconstituents. The highest mean diameter of growth inhibition zone was recorded for &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; (19.33 ± 1.15 mm). The minimal inhibitory concentrations were ranging from 6.25 to 25 mg/mL for bacterial strains, and from 6.25 to 25 mg/mL for &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species. The 50% cytotoxic concentration on VERO (African Green Monkey Kidney) cell lines was estimated at 209 µg/mL. No antiviral activity was recorded. Additionally, &lt;i&gt;T. polium&lt;/i&gt; extract was able to inhibit &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; PAO1 motility in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the tested extract was able to inhibit 23.66% of the swarming and 35.25% of swimming capacities of PAO1 at 100 µg/mL.

In this work, we studied some factors likely to modify these therapeutic properties with the aim to contribute to its standardization as an improved traditional medicine. &lt;i&gt;P. capitata&lt;/i&gt; parasitizing &lt;i&gt;Persea americana, Psidium guajava,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Podocarpus mannii&lt;/i&gt; were harvested at three phenological stages (vegetative, flowering, and fruiting stages). The extracts were prepared by maceration in n-hexane, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, and distilled water. The total phenolic, flavonoid, flavonol, and tannin contents were measured using appropriate methods. The antioxidant potential of extracts was investigated using TAC, DPPH scavenging, and FRAP methods. The &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase inhibitory activities of extracts were determined using enzymatic methods. The ethyl acetate extracts with the best phenolic content were subjected to HPLC analysis. The extraction yields were higher with methanol. The ethyl acetate extract of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt; harvested from &lt;i&gt;P. guajava&lt;/i&gt; showed a stable HPLC profile during the development of the plant, while extracts from the plant collected from &lt;i&gt;P. americana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. mannii&lt;/i&gt; showed both qualitative and quantitative variations according to phonological stages of the plant. The inhibition of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase was more pronounced for &lt;i&gt;P. capitata&lt;/i&gt; harvested from &lt;i&gt;P. guajava&lt;/i&gt;, decreasing during flowering and fruiting, while inhibition of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase was not influenced by the phenological stage and the host of the plant. The &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase inhibitors were better extracted by ethyl acetate and those of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase by ethanol or methanol. The phenolic contents and antioxidant properties of the extracts were influenced by the phenological stage of &lt;i&gt;P. capitata&lt;/i&gt; and its hosts. These results suggest that it is preferable to harvest &lt;i&gt;P. capitata&lt;/i&gt; during flowering or during fruiting stages on any host. None of the used solvents permitted an optimal extraction of active principles form &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;capitata&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that the mixture of solvents must be considered in further studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="The novel coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents the actual greatest global public health crisis. The lack of efficacious drugs and vaccines against this viral infection created a challenge for scientific researchers in order to find effective solutions. One of the promising therapeutic approaches is the search for bioactive molecules with few side effects that display antiviral properties in natural sources like medicinal plants and vegetables. Several computational and experimental studies indicated that flavonoids especially flavonols and their derivatives constitute effective viral enzyme inhibitors and possess interesting antiviral activities. In this context, the present study reviews the efficacy of many dietary flavonols as potential antiviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 enzymes and proteins including Chymotrypsin-Like Protease (3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;), Papain Like protease (PL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;), Spike protein (S protein) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and also their ability to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. The relationship between flavonol structures and their SARS-CoV-2 antiviral effects were discussed. On the other hand, the immunomodulatory, the anti-inflammatory and the antiviral effects of secondary metabolites from this class of flavonoids were reported. Also, their bioavailability limitations and toxicity were predicted.">

(Annonaceae) and derived food supplements. &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; grows as a tree and is native to the Caribbean and Central America. Preparations made from different plant parts of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; (i.e. fruit, leaves, bark, roots) have been used as herbal medicine and are also marketed worldwide as over-the-counter food supplements that have been purported to support general health or to treat a wide range of health conditions, particularly cancer and parasitic infections. However, open questions remain regarding the safety of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt;-based food supplements, since Annonaceae have been reported to contain potentially neurotoxic compounds, i.e. acetogenins. The assessment conducted within the present fellowship programme shows that substantial uncertainties exist regarding the safe use of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt;-based supplements. The available data provide indications of neurotoxic potential of certain &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; preparations. The paucity of adequate studies, particularly related to long-term use of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; supplements, currently does not allow the establishment of a safe intake level. Within this technical report a workflow of the project is presented.">

It is a valuable medicinal plant recorded to have pharmaceutical properties. However, the phytotoxic potential of &lt;i&gt;Wedelia chinensis&lt;/i&gt; has not yet been examined. Thus, we carried out this study to establish the allelopathic effects of &lt;i&gt;Wedelia chinensis&lt;/i&gt; and to identify its phytotoxic substances. Extracts of &lt;i&gt;Wedelia chinensis&lt;/i&gt; exhibited high inhibitory activity against the root and shoot growth of cress, alfalfa, rapeseed, lettuce, foxtail fescue, Italian ryegrass, timothy, and barnyard grass. The inhibition was varied with species and was dependent on concentrations. The extracts were separated through several purification steps, and the two effective substances were isolated and characterized as vanillic acid and gallic acid using spectral analysis. Vanillic acid and gallic acid significantly arrested the growth of cress and Italian ryegrass seedlings. The concentrations of vanillic acid and gallic acid needed for 50% inhibition (I&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values) of the seedling growth of the cress and Italian ryegrass were 0.04-15.4 and 0.45-6.6 mM, respectively. The findings suggest that vanillic acid and gallic acid may be required for the growth inhibitory activities of &lt;i&gt;Wedelia chinensis&lt;/i&gt;.">

Therefore, knowledge on the antioxidant potential of different plant species and their nutraceutical and pharmaceutical properties is of utmost importance. Exploring this scientific research field provides fundamental clues on (1) plant stress responses and their adaptive evolution to harsh environmental conditions and (2) (new) natural antioxidants with a functional versatility to prevent and treat human pathologies. These natural antioxidants can be valorized via plant-derived foods and products. Cuba contains an enormously rich plant biodiversity harboring a great antioxidant potential. Besides opening new avenues for the implementation of sustainable agroecological practices in crop production, it will also contribute to new strategies to preserve plant biodiversity and simultaneously improve nature management policies in Cuba. This review provides an overview on the beneficial properties of antioxidants for plant protection and human health and is directed to the valorization of these plant antioxidants, emphasizing the need for biodiversity conservation.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants have been used as drugs to treat human disease for centuries. Ursonic acid (UNA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid extracted from certain medicinal herbs such as &lt;i&gt;Ziziphus jujuba&lt;/i&gt;. Since the pharmacological effects and associated mechanisms of UNA are not well-known, in this work, we attempt to introduce the therapeutic potential of UNA with a comparison to ursolic acid (ULA), a well-known secondary metabolite, for beneficial effects. UNA has a keto group at the C-3 position, which may provide a critical difference for the varied biological activities between UNA and ULA. Several studies previously showed that UNA exerts pharmaceutical effects similar to, or stronger than, ULA, with UNA significantly decreasing the survival and proliferation of various types of cancer cells. UNA has potential to exert inhibitory effects in parasitic protozoa that cause several tropical diseases. UNA also exerts other potential effects, including antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. Of note, a recent study highlighted the suppressive potential of UNA against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular modifications of UNA may enhance bioavailability, which is crucial for in vivo and clinical studies. In conclusion, UNA has promising potential to be developed in anticancer and antiprotozoan pharmaceuticals. In-depth investigations may increase the possibility of UNA being developed as a novel reagent for chemotherapy.">

We tested the anti-proliferative activity of the methanolic extracts of these compounds using MTT assay on seven different human cancer cell lines: HeLa, MDA-MB-231, A549, HepG2, U-87, SK-OV-3 and HL60. Induction of cell death was assessed by cell cycle analysis, apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-FITC binding and caspase 3/7 activity. As well, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell migration were tested. The genetic toxicity, using the alkaline comet assay, was evaluated. The studied extracts inhibited the cell proliferation of all tested cancer cell lines with concentration dependent effect over time. All of these extracts mainly induced apoptosis of HeLa cells by the accumulation of hypodiploid cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase and increasing the activity of caspase 3/7, as well they showed potential MMP disturbance and expressed a marked inhibitory effect on cell migration. Assessment of probable genetic toxicity by these extracts revealed no or minimum incidence of genetic toxicity. Therefore, the studied plant extracts are exhibiting potent anticancer activity based upon marked induction of tumor-cell death.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Populus nigra&lt;/i&gt; L. (Salicaceae family) is one of the most popular trees that can be found in deciduous forests. Some particularities that characterize the &lt;i&gt;Populus&lt;/i&gt; genus refer to the fact that it includes more than 40 species, being widespread especially in Europe and Asia. Many residues, parts of this tree can be used as a bioresource for different extracts as active ingredients in pharmaceuticals next to multiple benefits in many areas of medicine. The present review discusses the latest findings regarding the phytochemical composition and the therapeutic properties of &lt;i&gt;Populus nigra&lt;/i&gt; L. buds. The vegetal product has been described mainly to contain phenolic compounds (phenols, phenolic acids and phenylpropanoids), terpenoids (mono and sesquiterpenoids), flavones (e.g., apigenol and crysin), flavanones (e.g., pinocembrin and pinostrombin), caffeic/ferulic acids and their derivates, and more than 48 phytocompounds in the essential oils. The resinous exudates present on the buds have been the major plant source used by bees to form propolis. Several studies depicted its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antidiabetic, antitumor, hepatoprotective, hypouricemic properties and its effects on melanin production. All these lead to the conclusion that black poplar buds are a valuable and important source of bioactive compounds responsible for a wide range of therapeutic uses, being a promising candidate as a complementary and/or alternative source for a large number of health problems. The aim of the review is to gather the existing information and to bring an up to date regarding the phytochemical and therapeutic uses of &lt;i&gt;Populus nigra&lt;/i&gt; L. buds.">

Given the rise in resistance to conventional antibiotics, natural products have been targeted for the development of antimicrobials with novel mechanism of action. This review aimed to collate available evidence on the antimicrobial, anti-parasitic and anti-inflammatory activities of mānuka oil and its components. A comprehensive literature search of was conducted using PubMed and Embase (via Scopus) targeting articles from database inception until June 2020. Chemical structures and IUPAC names were sourced from PubChem. Unpublished information from grey literature databases, Google search, targeted websites and Google Patents were also included. The present review found extensive in vitro data supporting the antimicrobial effects of mānuka oil warrants further clinical studies to establish its therapeutic potential. Clinical evidence on its efficacy, safety and dosing guidelines are necessary for its implementation for medical purposes. Further work on regulation, standardization and characterization of the medicinal properties of mānuka oil is required for establishing consistent efficacy of the product.">

        <span class="abst" title="Many African countries are endowed with rich biodiversity with enormous nutritional and economic prospects, but the majority of these resources are not fully harnessed. Exploring these neglected resources, for example, the Transvaal red milkwood tree [(&lt;i&gt;Mimusops zeyheri&lt;/i&gt;) Sond. family: Sapotaceae] is of paramount importance for food and nutritional security as well as economic prosperity. This review provides a critical appraisal of the nutritional and health benefits as well as the economic potential of &lt;i&gt;Mimusops zeyheri&lt;/i&gt;. The plant is known for its diverse uses among rural communities. In folk medicine, the decoction from the bark and leaves of &lt;i&gt;Mimusops zeyheri&lt;/i&gt; are used for treating wounds and ulcers, while the root is used as an infusion taken to treat candidiasis and other health issues. The nutritional profile of the fruit tree is similar to popular exotic fruits and richer in vitamin C when compared to guava and orange. &lt;i&gt;Mimusops zeyheri&lt;/i&gt; is a rich source of vitamins, protein, and fatty acids. Based on the rich chemical pool, especially in the fruit and seeds, it has the potential to provide an accessible, readily available, and affordable enriched functional food with valuable health benefits. However, the successful exploration of &lt;i&gt;Mimusops&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;zeyheri&lt;/i&gt; for food security and sustainability requires multidisciplinary research. This will help achieve the envisaged food-nutrition security and poverty alleviation potential of the plant, especially among local communities.">

Biofilms, are complex biological systems difficult to treat by conventional antibiotic therapy, which contributes to &gt;80% of humans infections. In this report, we examined the antibacterial activity of &lt;i&gt;Origanum majorana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rosmarinus officinalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Thymus zygis&lt;/i&gt; medicinal plant essential oils against MRSA clinical isolates using disc diffusion and MIC methods. Moreover, biofilm inhibition and eradication activities of oils were evaluated by crystal violet. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed variations between oils in terms of component numbers in addition to their percentages. Antibacterial activity testing showed a strong effect of these oils against MRSA isolates, and &lt;i&gt;T. zygis&lt;/i&gt; had the highest activity succeeded by &lt;i&gt;O. majorana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R. officinalis&lt;/i&gt;. Investigated oils demonstrated high biofilm inhibition and eradication actions, with the percentage of inhibition ranging from 10.20 to 95.91%, and the percentage of eradication ranging from 12.65 to 98.01%. &lt;i&gt;O. majorana&lt;/i&gt; oil had the highest biofilm inhibition and eradication activities. Accordingly, oils revealed powerful antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against MRSA isolates and could be a good alternative for antibiotics substitution.">

The tested extract showed promising antioxidant activities (ABTS-IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.042 mg/mL; 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.087 mg/mL, β-carotene-IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.101 mg/mL and FRAP-IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.292 mg/mL). Using both malignant Walker 256/B and MatLyLu cell lines, &lt;i&gt;T. polium&lt;/i&gt; methanolic extract showed a dose/time-dependent antitumor activity. The molecular docking approach revealed that most of the identified molecules were specifically binding with human peroxiredoxin 5, human androgen, and human progesterone receptors with high binding affinity scores.

Moreover, as to provide the sustainable option for production of such valuable ingredients, plant tissue culture (PTC) as alternative method for industrial metabolite cultivation was also proposed herein. The results illustrated that detergent plant extracts showed moderate in foaming and detergency abilities compared with those of synthetic surfactant. The phytochemical analysis illustrated the positive detection of saponins in &lt;i&gt;L. glutinosa&lt;/i&gt; plant extracts. The highest callus formation was found in &lt;i&gt;L. glutinosa&lt;/i&gt; explant cultured with MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mg/L Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The callus extract was chemical elucidated using chromatography, which illustrated the presence of saponin similar to those from the crude leaf and Quillaja saponin extracts. Compact mass spectrometry confirmed that the surfactant was of the steroidal diagnostic type.">

Based on the above facts, in the present study, we designed, synthesized and evaluated the antibacterial and antifungal activity of novel fluorinated compounds comprising of chalcones bearing trifluoromethyl (&lt;b&gt;A1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;A10&lt;/b&gt;) and trifluoromethoxy (&lt;b&gt;B1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;B10&lt;/b&gt;) substituents. The compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four pathogenic Gram-positive (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;) and Gram-negative (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;) bacterial and fungal (&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/i&gt;) strains. In this study, the compounds with trifluoromethoxy group were more effective than those with trifluoromethyl group. Among the 20 fluorinated chalcones, compound &lt;b&gt;A3&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;B3&lt;/b&gt; bearing an indole ring attached to the olefinic carbon have been proved to possess the most antimicrobial activity compared to the standard drugs without showing cytotoxicity on human normal liver cell line (L02). Further, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for &lt;b&gt;A3&lt;/b&gt;/&lt;b&gt;B3&lt;/b&gt; was determined by serial tube dilution method and showed potential activity. These results would provide promising access to future study about the development of novel agents against bacterial and fungal infections.">

The root of &lt;i&gt;Ageratum conyzoides&lt;/i&gt; was investigated for its effects on alloxan-induced diabetic Wistar rats' cardiac tissues. Thirty-two (32) Wistar rats weighing between 180 and 190 g were randomly divided into four groups. The animals in groups B-D were induced with a single dose of 150 mg/kg body weight of alloxan (ALX) intraperitoneally. They were confirmed hyperglycemic after 72 hours of induction and then sustained in hyperglycemic condition for 2 weeks. Animals in groups C and D received AC intervention, as stated above, for four weeks. The body weight of the experimental animals and blood collection for glucose estimation were taken weekly for six weeks using appropriate instruments. Biochemical assays for lipid profile, antioxidant enzymatic, and nonenzymatic markers were carried out. Histopathological changes in the cardiac tissues were also studied. Administration of 150 mg/kg of ALX to experimental rats induced diabetes and significantly reduced the body weights, significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) increased the glucose level, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and decreased the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and antioxidant enzymatic markers such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) while the antioxidant nonenzymatic marker such as malondialdehyde (MDA) level was significantly increased. By contrast, rats given the ethanolic extract root of &lt;i&gt;A. conyzoides&lt;/i&gt; had significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) increased the body weight gain, whereas the glucose levels significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) improved in treated diabetic rats. This extract also improved the cardiovascular system of the diabetic rats by significantly decreasing TG and LDL levels, significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) increasing the HDL level, significantly reducing the cardiac contents of CAT, SOD, and GPx, and significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) decreasing MDA. Ethanolic extract root of &lt;i&gt;A. conyzoides&lt;/i&gt; exhibited antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic activities and mitigates damage to the heart from the ALX-induced myocardial toxicity associated with type-1 diabetes.">

Hence, the aim of the study was to increase the antimicrobial properties of GICs through its modification with mixture of plant extracts to be evaluated along with an 0.5% chlorohexidine-modified GIC (CHX-GIC) with regard to biological and compressive strength properties. Conventional GIC (freeze-dried version) and CHX were used. Alcoholic extract of Salvadora persica, Olea europaea, and Ficus carcia leaves were prepared using a Soxhlet extractor for 12 h. The plant extract mixture (PE) was added in three different proportions to the water used for preparation of the dental cement (Group 1:1 PE, 2:1 PE, and 1:2 PE). Specimens were then prepared and tested against the unmodified GIC (control) and the 0.5% CHX-GIC. Chemical analysis of the extract mixture was performed using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated using agar diffusion assay against Micrococcus luteus and Streptoccocus mutans. Compressive strength was evaluated according to ISO 9917-1:2007 using a Zwick testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Antimicrobial activity against Streptoccocus mutans was significantly increased for all the extract-modified materials compared to the unmodified cement, and the highest concentration was comparable to the CHX-GIC mixture. The activity against Micrococcus luteus was also significantly increased, but only for the material with the highest extract concentration, and here the CHX-GIC group showed statistically the highest antimicrobial activity. Compressive strength results revealed that there was no statistically significant difference between the different mixtures and the control except for the highest tested concentration that showed the highest mean values. The plant extracts (PEs) enhanced the antimicrobial activity against S. mutans and also against M. luteus in the higher concentration while compressive strength was improved by addition of the PE at higher concentrations.">

In this study, the antibacterial activity of the leaf and stem bark extracts of the plant against methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA), as well as the metabolite profiles of the bioactive fractions, was investigated. The antibacterial activity was determined by disc diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), while the microbial reduction by the bioactive fraction was evaluated using time-kill test. The bioactive fraction was further subjected to ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis to putatively identify the chemical constituents contained therein. All the extracts and fractions showed different levels of antibacterial activity on the tested MRSA strains. The highest total antibacterial activity, i.e., 4007.6 mL/g, was exhibited by the crude leaf methanolic extract. However, the ethyl acetate fraction of the leaf showed moderate to significant antibacterial activity against MRSA at low MIC (0.08-1.25 mg/mL). Metabolite profiling of this fraction using UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS resulted in the putative identification of 28 compounds, which included phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols and flavonols. The results of this study showed that the ethyl acetate fraction of &lt;i&gt;Arbutus pavarii&lt;/i&gt; leaf possessed potential antibacterial activity against MRSA and hence can be further explored for pharmaceutical applications as a natural antibacterial agent.">

The main aim of this article is to collect and analyze the scientific information related to traditional uses, bioactive chemical constituents and pharmacological activities. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; Scientific information on &lt;i&gt;C. hirsutus&lt;/i&gt; was retrieved from the online bibliographic databases (e.g. MEDLINE/PubMed, SciFinder, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus). Information regarding traditional uses was also acquired from secondary resources including books and proceedings. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Different plant parts of &lt;i&gt;C. hirsutus&lt;/i&gt; were reported to be used for the treatment of fever, skin diseases, stomach disorders and urinary diseases. Alkaloids such as jasminitine, hirsutine, cohirsitine and their derivatives along with a few flavonoids, triterpene derivatives and volatile compounds were reported from whole plant or different plant parts. Extracts were evaluated for their antimicrobial, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory and hepatoprotective activities among others. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Although widely used in traditional medicines, only a few studies have been performed related to chemical constituents. Most of the biological activity evaluations were carried out using in vitro evaluation methods and only a few studies were carried out in animal models. In the future, properly designed in vivo and clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the pharmacological activities of &lt;i&gt;C. hirsutus&lt;/i&gt; along with bioassay-guided studies to isolate and identify the active constituents.">

This study examines the chemical constituents, antioxidant activity, and potential inhibitory effect against human peroxiredoxin 5, a key enzyme of &lt;i&gt;P. cubeba&lt;/i&gt; essential oil from fruits. Using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), the principal components were methyleugenol (41.31%) and eugenol (33.95%), followed by (E)-caryophyllene (5.65%), &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene-8-ol (3.50%), 1,8-cineole (2.94%), and α-terpinolene (1.41%). Results showed similar scavenging activity via 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl DPPH radical scavenging activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 110.00 ± 0.08 μg/mL), as well as very potent antioxidant activity against both ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) (106.00 ± 0.11 μg/mL) and β-carotene bleaching (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 315.00 ± 2.08 μg/mL) assays when compared to positive butylated hydroxytoluene and ascorbic acid. The molecular docking approach has also been performed to screen the antioxidant activities of the major and potent compounds against human protein target peroxiredoxin 5. Results showed good binding profiles and attributed the strongest inhibitory activity to β-caryophyllene oxide (-5.8 kcal/mol), followed respectively by isocembrol and α-selinene (-5.4 kcal/mol), and viridiflorol (-5.1 kcal/mol). Furthermore, ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)-related physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties have been assessed and support our in vitro findings. This work demonstrates the powerful antioxidant potency of cubeba pepper and paves the way for the discovery and development of antioxidant agent with high potency.">

The significantly highest yield (92.4% direct shoot organogenesis) and secondary metabolites (2.94% Reb A, 2.52% ST, 95.3% DPPH-FRSA, 15.0% TPC, 13.0 µg/mg TFC, 22.3 µg/mg TAC, and 19.8 µg/mg TRP) production in response to abiotic stress elicitors was obtained in Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium treatment provided with 4% of PEG 6000. The overall trend was significant enhancement of growth dynamics and pharmaceutical compounds from control to 4% of PEG 6000 concentration as a defensive response against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in excess by water deficit. This is a very promising study to be employed in bioreactors to get markedly enhanced content of compounds of medicinal importance in the pharmaceutical market.">

This study evaluates the susceptibility of &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; strains to selected natural products (NPs) and frontline antibiotics. Two &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; strains (ATCC&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; 33560&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and MT947450) and two &lt;i&gt;C. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains (ATCC&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; 33559&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; and MT947451) were used. The antimicrobial potential of the NPs, including plant extracts, essential oils, and pure phytochemicals, was evaluated by broth microdilution. The growth was measured by spectrophotometry and iodonitrotetrazolium chloride. Antibiotic resistance genes (&lt;i&gt;tet&lt;/i&gt;(O) and &lt;i&gt;gyr&lt;/i&gt;A) were characterized at the molecular level. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) ranged from 25 to 1600 µg/mL. Cinnamon oil, (E)-Cinnamaldehyde, clove oil, eugenol, and baicalein had the lowest MIC and MBC values (25-100 µg/mL). MT947450 and MT947451 were sensitive to erythromycin and gentamicin but resistant to quinolones and tetracycline. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;gyr&lt;/i&gt;A and &lt;i&gt;tet&lt;/i&gt;(O) genes from resistant strains were confirmed by sequencing. The findings show that NPs are effective against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt; strains. The resistance to antibiotics was confirmed at phenotypic and genotypic levels. This merits further studies to decipher the action mechanisms and synergistic activities of NPs.">

Flavonoids possess a number of medicinal benefits, including anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral properties. They also have neuroprotective and cardio-protective effects. These biological activities depend upon the type of flavonoid, its (possible) mode of action, and its bioavailability. These cost-effective medicinal components have significant biological activities, and their effectiveness has been proved for a variety of diseases. The most recent work is focused on their isolation, synthesis of their analogs, and their effects on human health using a variety of techniques and animal models. Thousands of flavonoids have been successfully isolated, and this number increases steadily. We have therefore made an effort to summarize the isolated flavonoids with useful activities in order to gain a better understanding of their effects on human health.">

The characteristic of the subspecies was undertaken in terms of selected morphological parameters and the quality of the raw material. The herb of both subspecies was evaluated on the content and composition of essential oil by hydrodistillation followed by GC-MS and GC-FID (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry and flame ionization detector), the total content of phenolic acids (according to PP 6th ed.) and the content of rosmarinic acid (by HPLC). The sensory evaluation (QDA) was performed, as well. Greek oregano was distinguished by visibly higher number of glandular trichomes on the leaves (up to 4.85 per 1 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) followed by higher content of essential oil in the herb (up to 3.36 g × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) in comparison to common oregano. Based on the essential oil composition, Greek oregano was classified as mixed carvacrol/γ-terpinene chemotype, while common oregano as mixed sabinyl/cymyl type rich in sesquiterpenes. Greek oregano was also characterized by higher total content of phenolic acids (up to 6.16 g × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) and rosmarinic acid (up to 6787.2 mg × 100 g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) than common oregano. Essential oil content reached the maximum at the beginning of blooming (common oregano) and at the full blooming stage (Greek oregano). In turn, the amount of phenolic acids followed by rosmarinic acid was the highest at the beginning of seed-setting stage, in the case of both subspecies. The differences between subspecies concerning chemical composition (especially essential oil) were reflected in the sensory attributes, where both odor and taste notes were found at higher level for Greek oregano. Results of our work indicate that Greek oregano is well adapted to grow in the temperate zone conditions. Such adaptation was reflected mainly in the satisfied yield and maintaining characters typical for the Mediterranean plant, e.g., a high essential oil content followed by high carvacrol share, traits the most important from practice viewpoint.">

To overcome the adverse effects, we formulated a combination of the extracts, named GenoTX-407, with SBR and MOB extracts mixed in 5:1 ratio. The antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities of SBR and MOB extracts and GenoTX-407 were evaluated.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;To optimize the extraction conditions of SBR and MOB, different ethanol concentrations and extraction times and treatments of the extracts with different solvents for varying time periods were tested. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed via NO scavenging assay and analysis of anti-inflammatory activity-related gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Agar disk diffusion and microdilution assays were used to determine the antimicrobial activity. Antioxidant activity was evaluated through DPPH assay and analyses of peroxidation and antioxidant-related protein expression in HeLa cells.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Extraction with 0% ethanol for 2 h and 1.5% phosphoric acid for 0.5 h yielded maximum SBR extracts. For MOB, 50% ethanol extraction for 2 h followed by further extraction in hexane for 0.5 h yielded the highest extracts. SBR (46.1 ± 0.9 %) and MOB (48.9 ± 1.0 %) extracts effectively inhibited NO production, and dose-dependently reduced the expression of &lt;i&gt;TNF-α&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;iNOS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NF-κB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;COX2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;IL-6&lt;/i&gt;. MOB and GenoTX-407 inhibited the growth of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Propionibacterium acnes&lt;/i&gt;, as evidenced in disk diffusion and microdilution assays. SBR (EC50, 107.7 µg/mL and 38.3 µg/mL), MOB (62.41 µg/mL and 72.45 µg/mL), and GenoTX-407 (7.7 µg/mL and 26.4 µg/mL) exhibited excellent antioxidant potency and could scavenge free radicals of DPPH and lipid peroxidation; additionally, SOD, CAT, HO-1, and Nrf2 expression was increased in HeLa cells. SBR showed more potent antioxidant activity than MOB. Contrastingly, MOB exhibited more potent anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities than SBR. Interestingly, GenoTX-407 was the most efficient in all the assays, compared with SBR and MOB.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This study demonstrated that GenoTX-407, the combination of SBR and MOB, is a potential drug candidate exerting antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects via the Nrf2/HO-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways.">

The synthesized AgNPs exhibited significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, such as &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;.

Results of dose-dependent studies showed that synthesized nanoparticles were also effective at low concentrations. Molecular docking studies performed with the salivary protein and odorant-binding protein of &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Culex quinquefasciatus&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated that the naphthoquinone compound plumbagin exhibited reliable binding affinity towards the two enzymes. The findings thus reveal that the plant extract and its nanoparticles can be a better alternative to available chemicals to control mosquitos.">

        <span class="abst" title="In the face of the recent pandemic and emergence of infectious diseases of viral origin, research on parasitic diseases such as malaria continues to remain critical and innovative methods are required to target the rising widespread resistance that renders conventional therapies unusable. The prolific use of auxiliary metallo-fragments has augmented the search for novel drug regimens in an attempt to combat rising resistance. The development of organometallic compounds (those containing metal-carbon bonds) as antimalarial drugs has been exemplified by the clinical development of ferroquine in the nascent field of Bioorganometallic Chemistry. With their inherent physicochemical properties, organometallic complexes can modulate the discipline of chemical biology by proffering different modes of action and targeting various enzymes. With the beneficiation of platinum group metals (PGMs) in mind, this review aims to describe recent studies on the antimalarial activity of PGM-based organometallic complexes. This review does not provide an exhaustive coverage of the literature but focusses on recent advances of bioorganometallic antimalarial drug leads, including a brief mention of recent trends comprising interactions with biomolecules such as heme and intracellular catalysis. This resource can be used in parallel with complementary reviews on metal-based complexes tested against malaria.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Brucea javanica&lt;/i&gt; oil (BJO) is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat various types of cancer and inflammatory diseases. There is significant interest in understanding the medicinal activities of BJO and its molecular components, especially quassinoids, and in exploring how they can be incorporated into nanomedicine delivery strategies for improved application prospects. Herein, we cover the latest progress in developing different classes of drug delivery vehicles, including nanoemulsions, liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, and spongosomes, to encapsulate BJO and purified quassinoids. An introduction to the composition and medicinal activities of BJO and its molecular components, including quassinoids and fatty acids, is first provided. Application examples involving each type of drug delivery vehicle are then critically presented. Future opportunities for nanomedicine delivery strategies in the field are also discussed and considered within the context of translational medicine needs and drug development processes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most dangerous metabolic diseases with a high rate of mortality worldwide. It is well known that insulin resistance and deficiency in insulin production from pancreatic β-cells are the main characteristics of DM. Due to the detrimental side effects of the current treatment, there is a considerable need to develop new effective antidiabetic drugs, especially alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitors with lesser adverse effects. These inhibitors are known to be directly involved in the delay of carbohydrate digestion, resulting in a reduction of glucose absorption rate and, consequently, reducing the postprandial rise of plasma glucose, which can reduce the risk of long-term diabetes complications. Furthermore, natural products are well-known sources for the discovery of new bioactive compounds that can serve as scaffolds for drug discovery, including that of new antidiabetic drugs. The phytochemical investigation of &lt;i&gt;Salvia aurita&lt;/i&gt; collected from Hogobach Pass, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa (SA), yielded four known abietane diterpenes namely carnosol (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), rosmanol (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), 7-methoxyrosmanol (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), 12-methoxycarnosic acid (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and one flavonoid named 4,7-dimethylapigenin (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). Structural characterization of these isolated compounds was conducted using 1 and 2D NMR, in comparison with reported spectroscopic data. These compounds are reported for the first time from &lt;i&gt;S. aurita&lt;/i&gt;. The biological evaluation of the isolated compound against alpha-glucosidase exhibited strong inhibitory activities for &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values of 4.2 ± 0.7 and 16.4 ± 1.1 µg/mL respectively, while &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated strong alpha-amylase inhibitory activity amongst the isolated compounds with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 16.2 ± 0.3 and 19.8 ± 1.4 µg/mL. Molecular docking analysis confirms the strong inhibitory activity of &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; against alpha-glucosidase. Additionally, excellent antioxidant capacities were displayed by &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;1,&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3,&lt;/b&gt; respectively, with oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) (25.79 ± 0.01; 23.96 ± 0.01; 23.94 ± 0.02) mM Trolox equivalent (TE)/g; &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; as ferric-ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (3.92 ± 0.002; 1.52 ± 0.002) mM ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE)/g; &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; as Trolox equivalent absorbance capacity (TEAC) (3.19 ± 0.003; 2.06 ± 0.003) mM TE/g. The methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;S. aurita&lt;/i&gt; is a rich source of abietane diterpenes with excellent antioxidant and antidiabetic activities that can be useful to modulate oxidative stress and might possibly be excellent candidates for the management of diabetes. This is the first scientific report on the phytochemical isolation and biological evaluation of the alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities of &lt;i&gt;Salvia aurita&lt;/i&gt;.">

        <span class="abst" title="Peptic ulcers are characterized by erosions on the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract that may reach the muscle layer. Their etiology is multifactorial and occurs when the balance between offensive and protective factors of the mucosa is disturbed. Peptic ulcers represent a global health problem, affecting millions of people worldwide and showing high rates of recurrence. &lt;i&gt;Helicobacter pylori&lt;/i&gt; infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most important predisposing factors for the development of peptic ulcers. Therefore, new approaches to complementary treatments are needed to prevent the development of ulcers and their recurrence. Natural products such as medicinal plants and their isolated compounds have been widely used in experimental models of peptic ulcers. Flavonoids are among the molecules of greatest interest in biological assays due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The present study is a literature review of flavonoids that have been reported to show peptic ulcer activity in experimental models. Studies published from January 2010 to January 2020 were selected from reference databases. This review refers to a collection of flavonoids with antiulcer activity in vivo and in vitro models.">

        <span class="abst" title="The worldwide emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the thread of widespread superbug infections have led researchers to constantly look for novel effective antimicrobial agents. Within the past two decades, there has been an increase in studies attempting to discover molecules with innovative properties against pathogenic bacteria, notably by disrupting mechanisms of bacterial virulence and/or biofilm formation which are both regulated by the cell-to-cell communication mechanism called 'quorum sensing' (QS). Certainly, targeting the virulence of bacteria and their capacity to form biofilms, without affecting their viability, may contribute to reduce their pathogenicity, allowing sufficient time for an immune response to infection and a reduction in the use of antibiotics. African plants, through their huge biodiversity, present a considerable reservoir of secondary metabolites with a very broad spectrum of biological activities, a potential source of natural products targeting such non-microbicidal mechanisms. The present paper aims to provide an overview on two main aspects: (i) succinct presentation of bacterial virulence and biofilm formation as well as their entanglement through QS mechanisms and (ii) detailed reports on African plant extracts and isolated compounds with antivirulence properties against particular pathogenic bacteria.">

        <span class="abst" title="Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) refer to a group of disorders characterized by inflammation in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, which mainly comprises Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). IBDs are characterized by inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, are highly debilitating, and are without a definitive cure. Their pathogenesis has not yet been fully elucidated; however, it is assumed that genetic, immunological, and environmental factors are involved. People affected by IBDs have relapses, and therapeutic regimens are not always able to keep symptoms in remission over the long term. Natural products emerge as an alternative for the development of new drugs; bioactive compounds are promising in the treatment of several disorders, among them those that affect the gastrointestinal tract, due to their wide structural diversity and biological activities. This review compiles 12 terpenes with intestinal anti-inflammatory activity evaluated in animal models and in vitro studies. The therapeutic approach to IBDs using terpenes acts basically to prevent oxidative stress, combat dysbiosis, restore intestinal permeability, and improve the inflammation process in different signaling pathways.">

Both hydro-alcoholic extracts have proven to be rich in polyphenolic compounds, flavonoids, flavonols and tannins. Therefore, the leaves' extracts reveal an inhibition percentage of 89%, almost comparable with the standard reference (95%). To complete the toxicological profile, the study also assessed the potential cytotoxicity of basil hydro-alcoholic extracts on immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT), skin human fibroblasts (1BR3), mice epidermis (JB6Cl41-5a) and primary human melanocytes (HEMa) cells, correlated to A375 antitumor in vitro activity. The extracts did not induce significant cytotoxic effect on any of the selected normal cell lines but showed relevant activity on A375 cells. Considering the low values obtained regarding the irritative effects in the chorionallantoic membrane of the egg on blood vessels, we can emphasize that both extracts can be considered as biocompatible ingredients. Regarding the potential activity of hydro-alcoholic extracts on human skin, the decrease of erythema values after the application of extracts was a relevant observation which indicates the anti-inflammatory potential of &lt;i&gt;Ocimum basilicum&lt;/i&gt; L.">

        <span class="abst" title="Halophytes are the category of plants growing under harsh conditions of super-salinity, and are wide-spread in the coastal Mediterranean climatic conditions and desert oasis. They are adept at surviving through maintaining excessive production of enzymatic, and non-enzymatic secondary metabolites, especially phenolics and flavonoids that primarily work as anti-oxidants and phytoalexins. Five major halophyte species growing in the kingdom's Qassim's high-salted desert regions were investigated for confirming their traditionally used biological activity of sugar-control and anti-infectious properties. In this context, the comparative presence of phenolics, and flavonoids together with anti-microbial, anti-oxidants, and the anti-diabetic potentials of the plants' extracts were investigated through the α-amylase inhibition method. The highest concentrations of phenolics and flavonoids were detected in &lt;i&gt;Salsola imbricata&lt;/i&gt; (360 mg/g of the extract as Gallic-Acid-Equivalents/GAE, and 70.5 mg/g of the extract as Rutin-Equivalents/RE). In contrast, the lowest concentrations of phenolics and flavonoids were detected in &lt;i&gt;Salsola cyclophylla&lt;/i&gt; (126.6 mg/g GAE, and 20.5 mg/g RE). The halophytes were found rich in trace elements, a factor for water-retention in high-salinity plants, wherein iron and zinc elements were found comparatively in higher concentrations in &lt;i&gt;Aeluropus lagopoides&lt;/i&gt; (4113 µg/kg, and 40.1 µg/kg, respectively), while the copper was detected in higher concentration (11.1 µg/kg) in &lt;i&gt;S. imbricata&lt;/i&gt;, analyzed through Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometric (ICP-OES) analysis. The anti-oxidant potentials and α-amylase enzyme inhibition-based anti-diabetic activity of &lt;i&gt;S. imbricata&lt;/i&gt; was significantly higher than the other halophytes under study, wherein &lt;i&gt;S. cyclophylla&lt;/i&gt; exhibited the lowest level of α-amylase inhibition. The maximum DPPH radicals' (52.47 mg/mL), and α-amylase inhibitions (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 22.98 µg/mL) were detected in &lt;i&gt;A.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;lagopoides&lt;/i&gt;. The anti-microbial activity against the Methicillin-Resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; was strongly exhibited by &lt;i&gt;Zygophyllum simplex&lt;/i&gt; (33 mm Inhibition Zone-Diameter, 50 µg/mL Minimum-Inhibitory-Concentration), while &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; growths were moderately inhibited by &lt;i&gt;Tamarix aphylla&lt;/i&gt;. The current findings exhibited significant differences among the locally distributed halophytic plants species with regards to their bioactivity levels, anti-oxidant potentials, and the presence of trace elements. The ongoing data corroborated the plants' traditional uses in infections and diabetic conditions. The enhanced local distribution of the plants' diaspora and higher density of occurrence of these plants species in this region, in comparison to their normal climatic condition's counterparts, seemed to be affected by humans' use of the species as part of the traditional and alternative medicine over a period of long time.">

Natural substances with antiproliferative activities are currently potential alternatives in the treatment of cancers. &lt;i&gt;Dacryodes edulis&lt;/i&gt;, for instance, is a medicinal plant traditionally used in the treatment of cancer. Scientific studies have reported the antioxidant activity of this plant. In addition, the presence of prostate cancer chemopreventive polyphenols was reported in &lt;i&gt;D. edulis&lt;/i&gt; extracts. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the effects of the aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;D. edulis&lt;/i&gt; leaves on cell proliferation induced by estradiol in ovariectomized female Wistar rats. In this regard, ovariectomized (OVX) rats were cotreated with estradiol valerate (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V) (0.75 mg/kg) and the aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;D. edulis&lt;/i&gt; leaves. Control groups received either the vehicle (sham-operated animals and the OVX control), E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V (0.75 mg/kg) only, or E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;V (0.75 mg/kg) and tamoxifen (10 mg/kg). Treatments were administered orally for 3 consecutive days, and animals were sacrificed thereafter. Epithelial heights of the uterus and vagina were assessed. Uterine levels of total cholesterol and estradiol were determined as well. Results showed that the aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;D. edulis&lt;/i&gt; leaves reversed the effects of estradiol as it reduced uterine weight (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05), uterine (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05), and vaginal (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) epithelium heights. This antiproliferative effect of &lt;i&gt;D. edulis&lt;/i&gt; was associated with reduced tissue (uterine) levels of estradiol (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that the aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;D. edulis&lt;/i&gt; leaves could be a potential alternative treatment for proliferation-related diseases.">

Thus, a rapid, efficient, and precise method based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was applied to rapidly analyse the phytochemical profiling of &lt;i&gt;D. dentiger&lt;/i&gt; with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. As a result, a total of 78 chemical compositions, including 15 phenylpropanoids, 15 alkaloids, 14 flavonoids, 14 fatty acids, 7 phenols, 4 steroids, 4 cyclic peptides, 3 terpenoids, and 2 others, were identified or tentatively characterized in the roots of &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dentiger&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, alkaloid and cyclic peptide were reported from &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;dentiger&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. In addition, the ethanol crude extract of D. dentiger roots exhibited remarkable anti-inflammatory activity against cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 inhibitory and antioxidant activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. This study is the first to explore the phytochemical analysis and COX-2 inhibitory activity of &lt;i&gt;D. dentiger&lt;/i&gt;. This study can provide important phytochemical profiles and biological functions for the application of &lt;i&gt;D. dentiger&lt;/i&gt; roots as a new source of natural COX-2 inhibitors and antioxidants in pharmaceutical industry.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Tamarix articulata&lt;/i&gt; (TA) is a wild halophytic plant growing in extremely harsh environmental conditions in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. Evaluating the protective effect of the methanolic extract of different parts (fresh and dry leaves, stem, and root) of TA was determined by MTT assay using Hs27 skin fibroblasts as the cellular model. The study was designed and conducted in two sets. The first set assesses the toxicity profile of TA extracts in both concentration- and time-dependent ways on Hs27 cells. Our MTT results showed that methanolic extracts from all four parts of TA at varying doses (27.5, 55, 110, and 220 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) display negligible toxicity when exposed for 4 h. However, exposure of Hs27 cells to varying doses of all four TA extracts for 24 and 48 h promotes significant 23%, 24%, 26%, and 25% (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) and 35%, 36%, 39%, and 41% (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) cell toxicity at 220 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL of all four TA extracts compared to untreated control cells. To evaluate the protection offered by TA extracts against H₂O₂, we perform a second set of experiments to preincubate Hs27 cells with the TA extracts in both dose- and time-dependent way. This is followed by 300 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M hydrogen peroxide- (H₂O₂-) mediated oxidative insult for 1 h. Using MTT assay, we found that methanolic extracts of TA at different time points (4, 24, and 48 h) and higher doses (220 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) provide significant protection in cell viability when challenged with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative stress in Hs27 cells. The protective effect was more pronounced at 48 h and 220 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL and the amounts were 39%, 41%, 41%, and 44% for stem, root, fresh leaf, and dry leaf TA extracts (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05), respectively, compared to untreated cells (2-4%). Collectively, the current study demonstrates that methanolic extracts of TA contain potential bioactive compounds and offer significant protection against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated oxidative stress in Hs27 skin fibroblasts.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Euphorbia cuneata&lt;/i&gt; (EC; Euphorbiaceae), which widely grows in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, is used traditionally to treat pain and inflammation. This study aimed to evaluate the protective anti-inflammatory effect of a standardized extract of EC against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice and the possible underlying mechanism(s) of this pharmacologic activity. ALI was induced in male Balb/c mice using intraperitoneal injection of LPS. A standardized total methanol extract of EC or dexamethasone was administered 5 days prior to LPS challenge. Bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) and lung samples were collected for analysis. The results demonstrated the protective anti-inflammatory effect of EC against LPS-induced ALI in mice. Standardized EC contained 2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-naringenin-7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), kaempferol-7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), cuneatannin (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), quercetin (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and 2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;-naringenin (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;) in concentrations of 6.16, 4.80, 51.05, 13.20, and 50.00 mg/g of extract, respectively. EC showed a protective effect against LPS-induced pulmonary damage. EC reduced lung wet/dry weight (W/D) ratio and total protein content in BALF, indicating attenuation of the pulmonary edema. Total and differential cell counts were decreased in EC-treated animals. Histopathological examination confirmed the protective effect of EC, as indicated by an amelioration of LPS-induced lesions in lung tissue. EC also showed a potent anti-oxidative property as it decreased lipid peroxidation and increased the antioxidants in lung tissue. Finally, the anti-inflammatory activity of EC was obvious through its ability to suppress the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and hence its reduction of the levels of downstream inflammatory mediators. In conclusion, these results demonstrate the protective effects of EC against LPS-induced lung injury in mice, which may be due to its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities.">

The aim of this study was to analyze, for the first time, the chemical composition, the antioxidant activity and the metal chelating properties of fruit juices obtained from four different species of the Cucurbitaceae family cultivated in Romania, namely &lt;i&gt;Momordica charantia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cucumis metuliferus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Benincasa hispida&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trichosanthes cucumerina&lt;/i&gt;. The samples of juice were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and all the four species displayed high levels of the two triterpenes, oleanolic and ursolic acids, and also in phenolic compounds, including catechin, (-)-epicatechin and gallic acid. The juices demonstrated significant antioxidant activity against the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (ranging from 20 to 95%,), a good iron binding ability (ranging from 7.45 ± 0.28% to 86.95 ± 0.97%) and also promising antioxidant potential against the ABTS radical (ranging from 4.97 to 32.60 μETx/mL juice). Our findings raise interesting questions for further research on Cucurbitaceae fruit juices and, consequently, their very good antioxidant potential suggests these fruits should be further explored for their protective effect against oxidative damage. This is the first time the chemical composition and antioxidant activities of fruit juices from these four Romanian Cucurbitaceae varieties have been investigated.">

The five species were collected at Mt. Rtanj and the village of Sesalac, Eastern Serbia. The main EO constituents of Lamiaceae plants were &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-cymene (24.4%), geraniol (63.4%) and germacrene D (21.5%) in &lt;i&gt;Satureja kitaibelii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus serpyllum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Origanum vulgare&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;vulgare&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. &lt;i&gt;A. millefolium&lt;/i&gt; EO had multiple constituents with major ones being camphor (9.8%), caryophyllene oxide (6.5%), terpinen-4-ol (6.3%) and 1,8-cineole (5.6%), while the main EO constituents of &lt;i&gt;A. clypeolata&lt;/i&gt; were 1,8-cineole (45.1%) and camphor (18.2%). Antimicrobial testing of the EO showed that &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (Gram-positive) was more sensitive to all of the tested EOs than &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (Gram-negative). &lt;i&gt;S. kitaibelii&lt;/i&gt; EO showed the highest antimicrobial activity against both tested bacterial strains. This is the first study to characterize the EO composition and antimicrobial activity of these five medicinal species from Eastern Serbia in comparison with comprehensive literature data. The results can be utilized by the perfumery, cosmetics, food and pharmaceutical industries, but also for healing purposes in self-medication.">

        <span class="abst" title="On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the spread of the new coronavirus had reached the stage of a pandemic. To date (23.10.2020), there are more than 40 million confirmed cases of the disease in the world, at the same time there is still no effective treatment for the disease. For management and treatment of SARS-Cov2, the development of an antiviral drug is needed. Since the representatives of all human cultures have used medicinal plants to treat viral diseases throughout their history, plants can be considered as sources of new antiviral drug compounds against emerging viruses. The huge metabolic potential of plants allows us to expect discovery of plant compounds for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus infection. This idea is supported by number of papers on the anti-SARS-Cov2 activity of plant extracts and specific compounds in the experiments &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we summarize information on methods and approaches aimed to search for anti-SARS-Cov2 compounds including cheminformatics, bioinformatics, genetic engineering of viral targets, interacting with drugs, biochemical approaches etc. Our mini-review may be useful for better planning future experiments (including rapid methods for screening compounds for antiviral activity, the initial assessment of the antiviral potential of various plant species in relation to certain pathogens, etc.) and giving a hand to those who are making first steps in this field.">

        <span class="abst" title="Corydalis Rhizoma (CR) is a commonly used traditional Chinese medicine for its potency in activating blood circulation and analgesia. In clinic, CR extracts or components are commonly used in the treatment of myocardial ischemia, rheumatism, and dysmenorrhea with different types of inflammation. However, due to different mechanism of pain and inflammation, the anti-inflammatory property of CR has not been fully revealed. Here, the major chromatographic peaks of CR extracts in different extracting solvents were identified, and the anti-inflammatory activities of CR extracts and its major alkaloids were evaluated in LPS-treated macrophages by determining expressions of proinflammatory cytokines, I&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; and NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B. The most abundant alkaloid in CR extract was dehydrocorydaline, having &gt;50% of total alkaloids. Besides, the anti-inflammatory activities of dehydrocorydaline and its related analogues were demonstrated. The anti-inflammatory roles were revealed in LPS-treated cultured macrophages, including (i) inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines release, for example, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, IL-6; (ii) suppressing mRNA expressions of proinflammatory cytokines; (iii) promoting I&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; expression and suppressing activation of NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B transcriptional element; and (iv) reducing the nuclear translocation of NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B. The results supported that dehydrocorydaline was the major alkaloid in CR extract, which, together with its analogous, accounted the anti-inflammatory property of CR.">

Modern studies have shown that &lt;i&gt;P. perfoliatum&lt;/i&gt; has pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antiviral, anti-liver fibrosis, antitussive and expectorant, anti-tumor, anti-oxidation, and so on. By consulting and sorting out a large number of related literatures at home and abroad in recent years, this paper systematically reviewed the botany, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacological activities, and quality control of &lt;i&gt;P. perfoliatum&lt;/i&gt;, and discussed its development potential in new drug research and clinical application in the future, in order to provide a reference basis for further research and promote the in-depth development and utilization.">

The collection areas covered various climate zones in the world. We examined the usability of the global fungal extract library (GFEL) against parasitic malaria transmission, Gram-positive and negative bacterial pathogens, and leukemia cells.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Nearly ten thousand fungal strains were isolated. Sequences of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) from 40 randomly selected strains showed that over 80% were unique. Screening GFEL, we found that the fungal extract from &lt;i&gt;Penicillium thomii&lt;/i&gt; was able to block &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; transmission to &lt;i&gt;Anopheles gambiae&lt;/i&gt;, and the fungal extract from &lt;i&gt;Tolypocladium album&lt;/i&gt; was able to kill myelogenous leukemia cell line K562.

This review aims to highlight these steps by providing an overview of the regulatory approaches adopted during the onset of the pandemic, provide an assessment of observed trends, and offer some reflections and proposals to leverage learnings and opportunities from this current pandemic.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Documents and informational materials on regulating the development and management of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic were collected and classified. These materials were sourced from official websites and press releases from health authorities and international bodies from selected markets across the globe, and covered the period between January and July 2020. Additional information to support this study was gathered through a literature review and analysis of related data available from the public domain, and was complemented with the authors' personal experience.&lt;h4&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;Communication has been vital in addressing the impact of COVID-19. A total of 1705 documents and informational materials related to health or regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic were gathered. Of these, 343 (around 20%) were identified as regulatory agilities. These agile approaches were classified into 3 categories, namely, where health and regulatory authorities had: (1) facilitated product management across the entire lifecycle, notably in expediting medical product use for COVID-19, ensuring the continuity of clinical trials, and addressing supply chain issues; (2) strengthened international cooperation; and (3) addressed regulatory burden with the adoption of electronic and digital tools.&lt;h4&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;While many regulatory measures have been introduced temporarily as a response to the COVID-19 crisis, there are opportunities for leveraging an understanding from these approaches in order to collectively achieve more efficient regulatory systems and to mitigate and address the impact of COVID-19 and further future-proof the regulatory environment.">

Our results revealed the highest total carotenoids (162.00 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), chlorophyll &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; (313.09 ± 2.53 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW), and chlorophyll &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; (292.52 ± 8.84 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; DW) concentrations in &lt;i&gt;U. intestinalis&lt;/i&gt;. In the &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase inhibitory activity, &lt;i&gt;S. ilicifolium&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated the lowest efficacy with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 38.491 ppm compared to other species of seaweed. &lt;i&gt;H. macroloba&lt;/i&gt; extract, on the other hand, was found to be the most cytotoxic toward MCF-7 and HT 29 cells with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 37.25 ± 0.58 and 21.32 ± 0.25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, respectively, compared to other cell lines evaluated. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;H. macroloba&lt;/i&gt; extract was also found to be less toxic to normal cell (3T3) with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 48.80 ± 0.11 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. &lt;i&gt;U. intestinalis&lt;/i&gt; extract exhibited the highest cytotoxicity toward Hep G2 cells with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 23.21 ± 0.11 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, whereas &lt;i&gt;S. ilicifolium&lt;/i&gt; was less toxic to MDA- MB231 cell with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 25.23 ± 0.11 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. Subsequently, the GC-MS analysis of the methanolic extracts of these seaweed samples led to the identification of 27 metabolites in &lt;i&gt;U. intestinalis&lt;/i&gt;, 22 metabolites in &lt;i&gt;H. macroloba&lt;/i&gt;, and 24 metabolites in &lt;i&gt;S. ilicifolium&lt;/i&gt;. Taken together, the results of this present study indicated that all the seaweed species evaluated are good seaweed candidates that exhibit potential for cultivation as functional food sources for human consumption and need to be promoted.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The gout is a metabolic disease that is associated with a high level of uric acid in the blood. This disease is treated with some medications that aim to reduce serum urate levels. However, the use of various medicines leads to the appearance of some side effects, hence the importance of using other treatments based on natural resources.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;This study presents some medical treatments, their side effects, and some plants that are used for gout management in Morocco in the aim to valorize them.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We have been consulting various English publications in PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect published between 1991 and 2019 using the following keywords &quot;drugs,&quot; &quot;gout,&quot; &quot;Morocco,&quot; &quot;medicinal plants,&quot; &quot;&lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;,&quot; and &quot;&lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;&quot; terms. Then, we have classified the medicines, according to their action mechanisms, and we have cited some species that were reported in Moroccan pharmacopeia as antigout.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Three methods of the gout medical management were cited in this work: xanthine oxidase inhibitors, uric acid excretion enhancer, and uricase recombinant. However, it was found that these treatments had various side effects. We have described 23 species, and some of them showed experimentally an antigout effect by blocking the &quot;xanthine oxidase&quot; enzyme. These plants belong to 11 families. Lamiaceae represents the most dominant family with six species followed by Asteraceae with two species. Colchicine isolated from &lt;i&gt;Colchicum autumnale&lt;/i&gt; is the most known compound for its efficiency towards gout.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This work summarized different treatments particularly medicinal plants that are used in Morocco to treat gout disease by blocking uric acid secretion. However, several studies are needed to valorize these antigout natural sources.">

This study evaluated the leishmanicidal and cytotoxic activities of alcohol and non-alcohol extracts from four Andean plant extracts (L.S, O.F, P.F, and P.B).&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;Extracts were obtained by percolation with solvents of different polarities - hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol. Phytochemical screening was conducted based on reported methods. All products were evaluated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to determine the leishmanicidal activity against amastigotes of &lt;i&gt;Leishmania panamensis&lt;/i&gt; and cytotoxicity against U937 cells.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Flavonoids, triterpenes, and tannins were the main secondary metabolites found. From the results, dichloromethane extracts from O.F and P.B, ethanol extract from P.B, and ethyl acetate extracts of all plants were active, with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;30 μg/mL. Ethyl acetate was the most active extract, which showed EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 9.8, 14.1, 23.7, and 25.5 μg/mL, for L.S, P.B, O.F, and P.F, respectively. Hexane extracts from P.B and O.F exhibited moderate activity with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 84.8 and 87.4 μg/mL, respectively. Hexane and ethanol extracts from O.F, ethyl acetate, and ethanol extracts from L.S, and all extracts from P.F were not toxic. Alternatively, hexane and dichloromethane extracts from L.S and P.B as well as dichloromethane and ethyl acetate extracts from O.F displayed high toxicity.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Based on the activity we observed, ethyl acetate extract can continue in its usage in the search for new antileishmanial drugs, mainly ethyl acetate extract from L.S showed activity comparable to meglumine antimoniate and was not cytotoxic.">

Demand for anticancer therapy is therefore increasing on daily basis. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have many applications in biomedical field. Biological synthesis of AuNPs using aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;Crassocephalum rubens&lt;/i&gt; (AECR) was designed to investigate the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; anticancer potential. The synthesized AuNPs were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The characterization results showed the formation of green AuNPs of wavelength 538 nm, and mostly spherical AuNPs with 20 ± 5 nm size. Significant anticancer activity of the AECR-AuNPs on MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells was noted at higher concentrations (125 and 250 μg/mL) during 24 and at all concentrations tested during 48 h. It can therefore be concluded that AECR leaves can mediate stable AuNPs with anticancer properties.">

The Molecular docking studies between the derivatives and Polo-like kinases (Plk1) receptor proved that the derivatives of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones bind tightly to the receptor, thou ligand 24 and 27 had the highest binding affinities of -8.8 and - 9.1 kcal/mol, which was found to be higher than Doxorubicin with a docking score of -8.0 kcal/mol. These new derivatives of 2-(4-fluorophenyl) imidazol-5-ones shall be excellent inhibitors against (plk1). The pharmacokinetics analysis performed on the new structures revealed that all the structures passed the test and also the Lipinski rule of five, and they could further proceed to pre-clinical tests. They both revealed a revolution in medicine for developing novel anti-breast cancer drugs against MCF-7 cell line.">

        <span class="abst" title="Salt stress affects the metabolic homeostasis of medicinal plants. However, medicinal plants are sessile organisms that cannot escape from salt stress. They acclimatize themselves to the stress by reprogramming their metabolic pathways. Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF) with strong antioxidant activity is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, tea, and beverage. Nevertheless, the variation of integrated metabolites in LJF under different salt stresses remains unclear. In this study, High Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem triple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC- triple TOF-MS/MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis was applied to comparatively investigate the metabolites changes in LJF under different salt stress (0, 100, 200, 300 mM NaCl). Total 47 differential metabolites were screened from 79 metabolites identified in LJF under different salt stress. Low salt-treated group (100 mM NaCl) appeared to be the best group in terms of relative contents (peak areas) of the wide variety in bioactive components. Additionally, the phenylpropanoid pathway, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and alkaloid biosynthesis were disturbed in all salt-stress LJF. The results showed that LJF metabolisms were dramatically induced under salt stress and the quality of LJF was better under low salt stress. The study provides novel insights into the quality assessment of LJF under salt stress and a beneficial framework of knowledge applied to improvement the medicinal value of LJF.">

The antibacterial activity of the total plant extract was assayed using the broth microdilution method. Fractionation was performed using a separation funnel and solvents with different polarities. Broth microdilution and agar well diffusion assays were performed to determine the antibacterial potential of the obtained fractions. Quantitative and qualitative phytochemical analyses were performed to confirm the presence of secondary metabolites in both the total extract and the fractions.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;P. scoparia&lt;/i&gt; root exhibited antibacterial activity against all tested bacterial strains, especially against Methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) isolates. This extract, compared to the aqueous and chloroformic extracts, exhibited the presence of active antibacterial compounds. The quantitative and qualitative results of phytochemical screening showed that phenols and flavonoids were the main antibacterial compounds in the methanolic extract of the plant.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;For the first time, we demonstrated the antibacterial activity of the &lt;i&gt;P. scoparia&lt;/i&gt; root against MRSA isolates and other common burn wound pathogens.">

Kuntze (&lt;i&gt;Nepeta curviflora&lt;/i&gt;) is a medicinal herb growing in the eastern parts of the Mediterranean Sea Basin and is widely consumed as a tea. The leaves of this plant have been traditionally used for the treatment of various infectious diseases. The current research was designed to identify the chemical composition of &lt;i&gt;Glechoma curviflora&lt;/i&gt; (Boiss.) essential oil (EO) and to assess its antibacterial, antifungal, and cyclooxygenase inhibitory activities and the biophysical gating effect on AMPA receptors. Twenty phytochemicals were identified from &lt;i&gt;G. curviflora&lt;/i&gt; leaves and flowers EO amounting to almost 100% of the total constituents using GC-MS technique, of which 1,6-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane (27.51%) &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, caryophyllene oxide (20.08%) &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene (18.28%) &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; were the main constituents. The biophysical properties' effect from the plant extract on various AMPA-type receptors expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells was assessed by exploiting the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Microdilution assay was adopted for assessing the antimicrobial property against eight virulent microbial strains whilst the cyclooxygenase inhibition effect was accomplished utilizing COX inhibitory screening colorimetric assay &lt;i&gt;G. curviflora&lt;/i&gt; EO displayed potent activity against &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; (MIC = 1.25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), &lt;i&gt;S. sonnei&lt;/i&gt; (MIC = 3.12 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; (MIC = 1.25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), compared with ciprofloxacin (positive control) and potent antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, MRSA, &lt;i&gt;S. sonnei&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; compared to Ampicillin (2nd positive control). It also showed anti-&lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; (MIC = 6.25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) and antimold (MIC = 3.125 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) activities compared with fluconazole (antifungal positive control).

        <span class="abst" title="Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. Oxidative stress (OS) associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and the deterioration of the electron transport chain are factors that contribute to neurodegeneration and perform a potential role in the pathogenesis of ALS. Natural antioxidant molecules have been proposed as an alternative form of treatment for the prevention of age-related neurological diseases, in which ALS is included. Researches support that regulations in cellular reduction/oxidation (redox) processes are being increasingly implicated in this disease, and antioxidant drugs are aimed at a promising pathway to treatment. Among the strategies used for obtaining new drugs, we can highlight the isolation of secondary metabolite compounds from natural sources that, along with semisynthetic derivatives, correspond to approximately 40% of the drugs found on the market. Among these compounds, we emphasize oxygenated and nitrogenous compounds, such as flavonoids, coumarins, and alkaloids, in addition to the fatty acids, that already stand out in the literature for their antioxidant properties, consisting in a part of the diets of millions of people worldwide. Therefore, this review is aimed at presenting and summarizing the main articles published within the last years, which represent the therapeutic potential of antioxidant compounds of natural origin for the treatment of ALS.">

        <span class="abst" title="Orthosiphon aristatus (Blume) Miq. of the Lamiaceae family, called as kumis kucing in Indonesia, is a valuable medicinal plant for their pharmacological properties. The present study comprised of fifteen genotypes of O. aristatus was undertaken to evaluate the genotypes based on phytochemical content and pharmacological activities of leaves ethanol extract. Chemometric analysis (correlation and principal component analysis) was also used to investigate the genetic variability based on phytochemical content and pharmacological activities of O. aristatus genotypes. Results of phytochemical characterization showed that total phenolic ranged from 1.48 to 36.08 (maximum in A15) mg GAE/g DW, total flavonoid ranged from 0.10 to 3.07 (maximum in A15) mg QE/g DW, sinensetin ranged from 0.36 to 4.02 (maximum in A11) mg/g DW, and rosmarinic acid ranged 0.06 to 7.25 (maximum in A7) mg/g DW. Antioxidant activity was tested using DPPH and FRAP assay. Antioxidant results showed that DPPH ranged from 1.68 to 15.55 (maximum in A15) μmol TE/g DW and FRAP ranged from 0.07 to 1.60 (maximum in A1 and A7) μmol TE/g DW. The genotype A8 showed the highest cytotoxic activities against HeLa (66.25%) and MCF-7 (61.79%) cell lines. Maximum α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was recorded in genotype A2 with the value of 62.84%. The genotypes A1, A2, A7, A11, and A15 were identified as superior based on their phytochemicals content and pharmacological activities coupled with chemometric analysis. This finding is important for breeding studies and also the pharmaceutical perspective of O. aristatus.">

        <span class="abst" title="Oleanolic acid is a pentacyclic triterpenoid compound that exists widely in medicinal herbs and other plants. Because of the extensive pharmacological activity, oleanolic acid has attracted more and more attention. However, the structural characteristics of oleanolic acid prevent it from being directly made into new drugs, which limits the application of oleanolic acid. Through the application of modern preparation techniques and methods, different oleanolic acid dosage forms and derivatives have been designed and synthesized. These techniques can improve the water solubility and bioavailability of oleanolic acid and lay a foundation for the new drug development. In this review, the recent progress in understanding the oleanolic acid dosage forms and its derivatives are discussed. Furthermore, these products were evaluated comprehensively from the perspective of characterization and pharmacokinetics, and this work may provide ideas and references for the development of oleanolic acid preparations.">

Delaying thirst is one of the uses of the medicinal product of this plant which has been emphasized in Iranian traditional medicine though it was not proven scientifically. Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of PO product on thirst.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;In this research, two main Set of experiments were considered: acute water deprivation group and chronic water restriction group. The urine parameters analyzed were osmolality, and sodium, and potassium concentration, and blood parameters evaluated included blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, osmolality, and sodium, and potassium concentration. The PO dosages were 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The findings showed that the effects of PO 100 and 200 (mg/kg) on blood and urine parameters were greater than that of PO 50 mg/kg, but there were no significant differences between them.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;In general, these findings indicate that PO extract can play an important role in reducing thirst symptoms most likely by affecting intra- and extra-cellular environments. Also, it is recommended to study the beneficial effects of this plant on diseases that lead to hypokalemia or blood potassium depletion.">

The plant was studied for its anti-inflammatory as well as analgesic potency using standard biological models.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The stembark of &lt;i&gt;L. sericeus&lt;/i&gt; was evaluated for anti-inflammatory properties using egg albumin and xylene-induced oedema models. The pain-relieving property was evaluated using acetic acid-induced writhing and thermally-induced pain models. Median lethal dose determination (intraperitoneal LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;), quantification of some phytochemicals as well as phytochemical screening were also performed.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of stembark extract of &lt;i&gt;L. sericeus&lt;/i&gt; was found to be 3,100 mg/kg (i. p). The crude extract and fractions (310-930 mg/kg) effectively reduced oedema caused by egg albumin and xylene and exhibited high analgesic properties in inhibiting pain induced by acetic acid and heat. These reductions were dose-dependent and statistically significant (p&lt;0.05-0.001) when compared to distilled water and similar to prototype drugs employed. Quantitative determinations of some bio-active constituents of the plant showed a higher flavonoid content (0.52±0.02 mg/100 g) compared to alkaloids (0.36±0.02 mg/100 g) and flavonoids (0.49±0.03 mg/100 g). Phytochemical screening of the stembark showed the presence of alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids terpenes, tannins and saponins.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;These results imply that the stembark extract of &lt;i&gt;L. sericeus&lt;/i&gt; possesses anti-inflammatory and analgesic potency and these data validate its wide use in folkloric medicine for inflammation and pain management.">

        <span class="abst" title="Mushrooms have been valued as food and health supplements by humans for centuries. They are rich in dietary fiber, essential amino acids, minerals, and many bioactive compounds, especially those related to human immune system functions. Mushrooms contain diverse immunoregulatory compounds such as terpenes and terpenoids, lectins, fungal immunomodulatory proteins (FIPs) and polysaccharides. The distributions of these compounds differ among mushroom species and their potent immune modulation activities vary depending on their core structures and fraction composition chemical modifications. Here we review the current status of clinical studies on immunomodulatory activities of mushrooms and mushroom products. The potential mechanisms for their activities both in vitro and in vivo were summarized. We describe the approaches that have been used in the development and application of bioactive compounds extracted from mushrooms. These developments have led to the commercialization of a large number of mushroom products. Finally, we discuss the problems in pharmacological applications of mushrooms and mushroom products and highlight a few areas that should be improved before immunomodulatory compounds from mushrooms can be widely used as therapeutic agents.">

The effects of hydroethanolic barks extract from &lt;i&gt;B. atroviridis&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated on diabetes disorders including hematology, inflammatory, and oxidative stress parameters. The in vitro antioxidant capacity of the hydroethanolic bark extract (70 : 30) was evaluated. Nicotinamide-/streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were daily treated with the &lt;i&gt;B. atroviridis&lt;/i&gt; extract for fifteen days. Glycemia were evaluated every 5 days, insulin sensibility test was performed, and haematological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress parameters were analysed. Histomorphometry of the pancreas was realized. The extract was able to scavenge free radicals in vitro and decrease significantly the blood glucose levels. The treatment resulted in a significant alleviation of insulin resistance, anemia, leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia observed in untreated diabetic rats. The extract significantly decreased proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, IL-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, and IL-10. The rate of reduced glutathione was increased in the pancreas, whereas the catalase activity and nitrite concentration were decreased. Diabetic control showed a reduced size of Langerhans islet, whereas the size of islets was large in treated groups. The hydroethanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;B. atroviridis&lt;/i&gt; was able to improve glycemia and alleviate haematological and inflammatory parameters disorders observed in diabetic conditions, probably due to its antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant capacities.">

Until the present, there is no scientific validation on the biological activity of this plant from the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa and as a result, this study aimed to assess the bioactive compounds, free radicals scavenging and anticancer potentials of crude bulb extracts (chloroform, acetone, and ethanol) of &lt;i&gt;Boophone disticha&lt;/i&gt; obtained from this geographical location. Standard biochemical techniques and Gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) analysis were used to pinpoint the bioactive compounds in the crude extracts sequel to their antioxidant potentials against radicals such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide as well as their ferric ion reducing power. In addition, their cytotoxicity effects against Human cervix adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells were assessed as an in vitro model for anticancer. The phytochemical evaluation of the crude extracts showed the presence of phenolics, flavonoids, and alkaloids. GCMS profiles confirmed the presence of some bioactive compounds in the crude extracts of &lt;i&gt;B. disticha&lt;/i&gt; that could be responsible for their biological activities. The plant extracts possessed considerable antioxidant activity and exhibited dose-dependent radicals' inhibition from all assays carried out. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity effects against HeLa cells recorded inhibition concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.5, 1.6, and 1.9 µg/mL for acetone, chloroform, and ethanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;B. disticha&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Findings from the present study suggest that &lt;i&gt;B. disticha&lt;/i&gt; could be a good prospective source of antioxidant and anticancer agents. Therefore, further research on the isolation and purification of compounds from these extracts are indispensable.">

Initially, among various extracts tested, aqueous and ethanolic peel extracts depicted the presence of diverse phytoconstituents. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidative properties of peel extracts were determined using standard methodologies. Results showed that aqueous and ethanolic extracts had IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 471.7 and 509.16 μg/mL, respectively in terms of 1,1,diphenyl 2,2,picrylhydrazyl scavenging. Likewise, IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of aqueous and ethanol extract were obtained as 488.76 and 478.47 μg/mL towards the degradation of hydrogen peroxide. The ethanolic extract exhibited the highest inhibition of α&lt;b&gt;-&lt;/b&gt;glucosidase by showing activity of 53.34 ± 2.0 to 15.18 ± 1.4 U/L in a dose dependent manner (100-1000 µg/mL). Ethanolic extract was reported as the most active inhibitor of lipase with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 603.50 µg/mL. Ethanolic extract showed increased inhibition of ACE in a concentration dependent manner (100-1000 µg/mL) with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 519.45 µg/mL. Fourier transform-infrared spectrum revealed the availability of various functional groups in the ethanolic extract of peel. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry chromatogram of peel extract illustrated 23 diversified chemical constituents including 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol, Dimethyl sulfone, 9-octadecenamide, and Pentadecanoic acid as predominant compounds. In summary, &lt;i&gt;P. granatum&lt;/i&gt; fruits peel extract revealed promising antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, and anti-hypertensive properties.">

The present study was designed to investigate the role of IO extract (IOE) in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R) and determine the exact molecular mechanisms. The left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated to establish the MI/R injury model in rats. IOE exhibited a novel cardioprotective effect, as shown by improvement in cardiac function and decrease in infarct size. Pretreatment with IOE activated antioxidant enzymes in cardiomyocytes, including glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase. IOE pretreatment also induced the upregulation of NAD‑dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin‑1 (SIRT1) and downregulation of glucose‑regulated protein 78, phosphorylated (p‑) protein kinase R‑like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, p‑eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit α, C/EBP homologous protein and &lt;i&gt;caspase&lt;/i&gt;‑12. Furthermore, IOE alleviated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress‑induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes by decreasing the mRNA levels of caspase‑12. IOE inhibited apoptosis induced by overexpression of pro‑caspase‑9 and pro‑caspase‑3. In summary, IOE pretreatment protects the heart against MI/R injury through attenuating oxidative damage and suppressing ER stress‑induced apoptosis, which may be primarily due to SIRT1 activation.">

The selected of active compounds obtained from the screening of compounds by LC-MS were docked with the targeted enzyme that involved in the mechanism of T2DM. From the results, root extracts displayed a better promising outcome in α-glucosidase (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 2.72 ± 0.32) as compared with the fruit extracts (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 3.87 ± 0.32). Besides, root extracts also displayed a better activity in the inhibition of DPP (IV), enhance insulin secretion and glucose uptake activity. Molecular docking results revealing that phlorizin binds strongly with α-glucosidase, DPP (IV) and Insulin receptor (IR) enzymes with achieving the lowest binding energy value. The present work suggests several of the compounds have the potential that contribute towards inhibiting α-glucosidase and DPP (IV) and thus effective in lowering post-prandial hyperglycaemia.">

The total xanthone content in &lt;i&gt;G. mangostana&lt;/i&gt; was in the following order: pericarp &gt; calyx &gt; bark &gt; stalk &gt; stem &gt; leaves &gt; aril. The total xanthone content of pericarp was 100 times higher than the aril. Methanol extracts of the pericarp and calyx demonstrated the most potent inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.90 and 0.37 µg/mL, respectively. Statistical analysis showed a strong correlation between xanthone content and cholinesterase inhibition. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed α-mangostin and γ-mangostin of pericarp as the key metabolites contributing to cholinesterase inhibition. Due to the increasing demand of mangosteen products, repurposing of fruit waste (pericarp) has great potential for enhancement of the cognitive health of human beings.">

        <span class="abst" title="We have designed unprecedented cholinesterase inhibitors based on 1-deoxynojirimycin as potential anti-Alzheimer's agents. Compounds are comprised of three key structural motifs: the iminosugar, for interaction with cholinesterase catalytic anionic site (CAS); a hydrocarbon tether with variable lengths, and a fragment derived from 2-phenylethanol for promoting interactions with peripheral anionic site (PAS). Title compounds exhibited good selectivity towards BuChE, strongly depending on the substitution pattern and the length of the tether. The lead compounds were found to be strong mixed inhibitors of BuChE (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 and 1.9 µM). The presumptive binding mode of the lead compound was analysed using molecular docking simulations, revealing H-bond interactions with the catalytic subsite (His438) and CAS (Trp82 and Glu197) and van der Waals interactions with PAS (Thr284, Pro285, Asn289). They also lacked significant antiproliferative activity against tumour and non-tumour cells at 100 µM, making them promising new agents for tackling Alzheimer's disease through the cholinergic approach.">

Therefore, the current investigation aimed for the first time to determine the hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, and oxidative stress inhibitory effects of the aerial parts (stem and leaves) of &lt;i&gt;T. leucocladum&lt;/i&gt; hydrophilic (water) extract in streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic rats (65 mg/kg), given intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 mg/kg for 21 days. The rats were divided into four groups as control (C), control + &lt;i&gt;T. leucocladum&lt;/i&gt; extract (C + TL), diabetes (D), and diabetes + &lt;i&gt;T. leucocladum&lt;/i&gt; extract (D + TL). The antioxidant activity was analyzed using in vitro 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and in vivo methods by measuring the plasma and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels using a colorimetric assay. On the other hand, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme levels, serum paraoxonase (PON), and arylesterase (ARE) enzyme activities were assessed by utilizing standard biochemical kits. Besides, the blood glucose and serum insulin levels were assessed by a glucometer and Rat ELISA Kit, respectively. However, the autoanalyzer was used to evaluate the lipid profile. The diabetic rat group that administered &lt;i&gt;T. leucocladum&lt;/i&gt; extract showed the best reduction in the tissue and plasma MDA levels and an increase of insulin-releasing potentials. Besides, the serum PON and ARE activities and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase and whole blood glutathione peroxidase enzyme levels were significantly increased in all animals treated with &lt;i&gt;T. leucocladum&lt;/i&gt; extract. The current investigation demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;T. leucocladum&lt;/i&gt; manifests antihyperglycemic and antihyperlipidemic effects and also increased the antioxidative defense system and reduced the lipid peroxidation process in experimental diabetic rats.">

        <span class="abst" title="Non-Biological Complex Drugs (NBCDs) are complex non-biological drugs comprised of large high molecular weight molecules and, often, nanoparticular structures (including liposomes and block-copolymer micelles). In the case of NBCDs, the entire complex is the active pharmaceutical ingredient and its properties cannot be fully characterized by physicochemical analysis. Moreover, the manufacturing process is fundamental in creating the correct originator product. The same is true for generic versions of the product. A recent appraisal of approval procedures for NBCDs &quot;follow-on products&quot; approved in Europe shows a diversity of regulatory pathways. In fact, three different abridged application procedures, under European legislation, were used: the generic application procedure of Article 10(1), the hybrid application procedure of Article 10(3), and the biosimilar application procedure of Article 10(4). Three informed consent applications via Article 10(c) from innovator companies of glatiramer acetate and sevelamer carbonate were submitted shortly after the approval of the first follow-on products. Furthermore, a number of &quot;well-established use&quot; applications [via Article 10(a)] were approved for iron sucrose and iron dextran complexes. In order to protect patients from the increased risks of NBCD products and NBCD follow-on products, two complementary approaches should be considered: (i) improving the regulatory procedures and their guidance documents within the pre-registration phase, and (ii) not considering interchangeability whenever clinical data is not available. With regards to the latter, the need for adequate safety and efficacy data might also include risk management programmes within post-approval pharmacovigilance actions. This, however, would depend on a risk appraisal that must be considered for individual medicinal products, based on the nature of the submitted relevant set of safety/efficacy data.">

        <span class="abst" title="Water steam distillation is a classical method of rose oil production from the flowers of &lt;i&gt;Rosa damascena&lt;/i&gt; Mill. This process produces considerable amount of waste water. In this study, ion-exchange column chromatography (Amberlite was the stationary phase) was used to prepare polyphenol-enriched fraction of waste water with improved biological activity. Phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents were examined before and after using column. Antioxidant activities, DNA protection ability, xanthine oxidase inhibition, and cytotoxicity of this fraction were also determined. The use of Amberlite increased phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents in fraction compared to the sample before fractionation. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of various antioxidant assays comprises 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) which were 226.66 ± 1.25, 126.03 ± 0.11, and 241.43 ± 0.33 for waste water, and these values for fraction were 63.21 ± 0.90, 34.6 ± 0.17, and 50.59 ± 0.75 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. The Trolox equivalent values of fraction in oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay were 0.34 ± 0.04, and the EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in cellular antioxidant activity were 91.24 ± 0.32 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. The xanthine oxidase inhibition capacity of fraction (100 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml) was 96.4 ± 0.02% &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. The comet assay analysis showed that this fraction (25-100 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml) protects human lymphocytes against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced DNA damages significantly. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of cytotoxicity assay were 248.145 ± 35.56 and 227.14 ± 16.51 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml after 24 and 48 h, respectively. There has been great attention to the valorization of waste materials. Recovered fraction could be considered as a proper antioxidant, DNA damage-protection agent, and xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Using a nontoxic solid phase such as Amberlite is a fruitful way to concentrate bioactive ingredients which can be used in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry.">

        <span class="abst" title="Reliance on deep learning techniques has become an important trend in several science domains including biological science, due to its proven efficiency in manipulating big data that are often characterized by their non-linear processes and complicated relationships. In this study, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has been recruited, as one of the deep learning techniques, to be used in classifying and predicting the biological activities of the essential oil-producing plant/s through their chemical compositions. The model is established based on the available chemical composition's information of a set of endemic Egyptian plants and their biological activities. Another type of machine learning algorithms, Multiclass Neural Network (MNN), has been applied on the same Essential Oils (EO) dataset. This aims to fairly evaluate the performance of the proposed CNN model. The recorded accuracy in the testing process for both CNN and MNN is 98.13% and 81.88%, respectively. Finally, the CNN technique has been adopted as a reliable model for classifying and predicting the bioactivities of the Egyptian EO-containing plants. The overall accuracy for the final prediction process is reported as approximately 97%. Hereby, the proposed deep learning model could be utilized as an efficient model in predicting the bioactivities of, at least Egyptian, EOs-producing plants.">

This research aims to examine the anti-inflammatory and anti-ulcer attributes of okra extract against gastric lesions. Adult Sprague Dawley male albino rats were divided into five groups. The negative control (G1) received normal feed, positive control (G2) received ulcer-inducing drug aspirin 150 mg/kg of body weight (b.w), G3 group received reference drug omeprazole 20 mg/kg of b.w, G4 group received okra extract 250 mg/kg of b.w, and G5 group received 500 mg/kg of b.w. Acute gastric damage was induced in G1, G2, G3, and G4 using aspirin 150 mg/kg of b.w, during 14-day-long efficacy trials after that all the animals were sacrificed. Anti-ulcer parameters and histopathological analysis of stomachs were performed to evaluate the degree of recovery against tissue damage by the administration of okra extract. The obtained results indicated that the 500 mg/kg of b.w okra extract exerted a protective effect in aspirin-induced gastric ulcers by significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; .05) reducing ulcer score, ulcer area, total acidity, and gastric volume, and significantly (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;/i&gt;&lt; .05) increasing gastric pH. Moreover, histopathological observation revealed that gastric mucosa was normal in G1, G3, G4, and G5; however, disruptions in the gastric epithelium were observed in G2. Congestion was observed in all groups except G1 and G5. Gastric pits and gastric glands were increased in size in G2 and G4. A higher concentration of okra extract (500 mg/kg of b.w) showed almost similar results when compared to the reference drug omeprazole.">

The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization revealed that thymol (1.2%-86.4%), carvacrol (3.2%-52.4%), gamma-terpinene (0.0%-12.7%), para-cymene (3.2%-5.2%), geraniol (0.0%-14.5%), and spathulenol (0.0%-13.6%) are the major constituents of the essential oils. Gelatin-pectin composite incorporated with the essential oils exhibited acidic pH (2.40-3.04), low conductivity (265-278 µS/cm), low surface tension (19.0-23.5 mN/m), low Newtonian viscosity (23.7-28.5 mPa.s), negative zeta-potential (14.2-16.9 mV), and nanoscale particle size (313-336 nm). These rheological properties result in the production of globular gelatin-pectin nanoparticles with a size range of 500-700 nm. The FTIR spectra of gelatin-pectin and gelatin-pectin-essential oils to some extent were similar, suggesting the noncovalent interactions between them. Gelatin-pectin composite incorporated with the essential oils displayed antiglucose oxidation (130-150 µg/ml) antilipid peroxidation (120-130 µg/ml), antiprotein oxidation (150-168 µg/ml), and antiprotein glycation (145-170 µg/ml) as well as antiamylase (216-230 µg/ml), and antiglucosidase (212-238 µg/ml) activity. The essential oils strongly improved the antioxidant capacity of the gelatin-pectin composite so strongly which can be recommended as a natural compound for oxidative stress management.">

Thus, the consumption of foods rich in hydrolyzing enzyme inhibitors is recommended for diet therapy of diabetes. Whole cereal products have gained increasing interests for plasma glucose-reducing effects. However, the mechanisms for whole cereal benefits in relation to T2DM are not yet fully understood, but most likely involve bioactive components. Cereal-derived phenolic compounds, peptides, nonstarch polysaccharides, and lipids have been shown to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities. These hydrolyzing enzyme inhibitors seem to make whole cereals become nutritional strategies in managing postmeal glucose for T2DM. This review presents an updated overview on the effects provided by cereal-derived ingredients on carbohydrate digestibility. It suggests that there is some evidence for whole cereal intake to be beneficial in amelioration of T2DM through inhibiting α-glucosidase and α-amylase activities.">

This study aimed to isolate and identify foodborne &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; species from meat and to determine the antimicrobial activities of commercial essential oils and spices powder extracted from certain medicinal plants.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Sixty meat samples were collected in Assiut city and subdivided into raw meat and processed meat. &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp were isolated and identified according to their cultural characters, biochemical reactions, serological typing, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The antibacterial activity of essential oils and spices powder was measured by using well-diffusion and microbial count techniques.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. in the examined raw meat samples and processed meat samples was 13.34%, and 26.67%, respectively. There was a marked decrease in the total &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; species count after treatment of minced beef with essential oils and spices powder compared to the untreated one. Black seed oil was the most potent antibacterial essential oil among the tested oils present in this study.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Essential oils and spices powder of certain medicinal plants (cumin: &lt;i&gt;Cuminum cyminum&lt;/i&gt;, black seeds: &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt;, cloves: &lt;i&gt;Syzygium aromaicum&lt;/i&gt;, cinnamon: &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum zeylanicum&lt;/i&gt;, and Marjoram: &lt;i&gt;Origanum majorana&lt;/i&gt;) have a potential in vitro antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Nigella sativa&lt;/i&gt; oil exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt; spp.">

        <span class="abst" title="The widely used cancer treatment, chemotherapy, causes severe long-term neuropathic pain in 30-40% cases, the condition clinically known as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). Approved conventional analgesics are sometimes ineffective, while others like opioids have undesirable side effects like addiction, seizures, and respiratory malfunctioning. Tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants, although exhibit anti-allodynic effects in neuropathy, also have unpleasant side effects. Thus, alternative medicines are being explored for CIPN treatment. Despite scattered reports on different extracts from different plants having potential anti-allodynic effects against CIPN, no established medicine or formulation of herbal origin exists. In this study, efficacy of an herbal decoction, formulated based on ancient medicinal principles and protocols for treating neuropathic pain, Divya-Peedantak-Kwath (DPK), has been evaluated in a paclitaxel (PTX)-induced peripheral neuropathic mouse model. We observed that DPK has prominent anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effects and acts as a nociceptive modulator for CIPN. With exhibited antioxidative effects, DPK restored the redox potential of the sciatic nerves to the normal. On histopathological evaluation, DPK prevented the PTX-induced lesions in the sciatic nerve, in a dose-dependent manner. It also prevented inflammation by modulating the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in CIPN pathogenesis. Our observations evinced that DPK can alleviate CIPN by attenuating oxidative stress and concomitant neuroinflammation through immune modulation.">

The Schools' Manuscript Collection is one body of information that contains a wealth of ethnographic material, including that of an ethnomedicinal nature, collected by schoolchildren across Ireland in the 1930s, in an early example of Citizen Science. The collection has been digitized and is available online at Dúchas.ie. Furthermore, there is an on-going and related project, the Meitheal Dúchas.ie Community Transcription project that enables the database to be easily searched, and thus used for research purposes. This study analyses the user interface and functionality of the Dúchas database for ethnomedical research by utilizing probes in the form of plants, within the collection, that have been previously identified as used for medicinal purposes. Limitations and biases associated with both the original collection of the material and the Dúchas database, that impact on the quality and utility of extractable data have been identified, and where possible specific procedures adopted to counteract such limitations. This study provides an insight into; the use of Dúchas.ie for ethnographic research, the use of plants for medicinal purposes in post-famine Ireland and is the first tangible example of Citizen Science in ethnomedical research in Ireland.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Ruellia tuberosa&lt;/i&gt; L. (RTL) has been used as a folk medicine to cure diabetes in Asia. RTL was previously reported to alleviate hyperglycemia, insulin resistance (IR), abnormal hepatic detoxification, and liver steatosis. However, the potential bioactive compounds of RTL have still not been identified. The aim of this study was to investigate the bioactive compounds in RTL ethyl acetate (EA) fractions by using a glucose uptake assay in TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-treated mouse FL83B hepatocytes to discover a mechanism by which to improve IR. The bioactive compounds were identified by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Using the Sephadex LH20 gel packing chromatography column, the EAF5 fraction was isolated from RTL and significantly increased glucose uptake in TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-treated FL83B cells. Moreover, the MCI gel packing chromatography column separated EAF5 into five subfractions and had no significant cytotoxic effect in FL83B cells when treated at the concentration of 25 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml. Among the subfractions, EAF5-5 markedly enhanced glucose uptake in TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-treated FL83B cells. The possible bioactive compounds of the EAF5-5 fraction that were identified by the HPLC assay include syringic acid, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumaric acid, and cirsimaritin. The bioactive compound with the best effect of increasing glucose uptake was &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-coumaric acid, but its effect alone was not as good as the combined effect of all three compounds of the EAF5-5 fraction. Thus, we speculate that the antidiabetic effect of RTL may be the result of multiple active ingredients.">

        <span class="abst" title="A new coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged and with it, a global investigation of new antiviral treatments and supportive care for organ failure due to this life-threatening viral infection. Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) is one of the most ancient medical doctrines mostly known with the manuscripts of Avicenna and Rhazes. In this paper, we first introduce a series of medicinal plants that would potentially be beneficial in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection according to TPM textbooks. Then, we review medicinal plants based on the pharmacological studies obtained from electronic databases and discuss their mechanism of action in SARS-CoV-2 infection. There are several medicinal plants in TPM with cardiotonic, kidney tonic, and pulmonary tonic activities, protecting the lung, heart, and kidney, the three main vulnerable organs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some medicinal plants can prevent &quot;humor infection&quot;, a situation described in TPM which has similar features to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pharmacological evaluations are in line with the therapeutic activities of several plants mentioned in TPM, mostly through antiviral, cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Amongst the primarily-introduced medicinal plants from TPM, rhubarb, licorice, garlic, saffron, galangal, and clove are the most studied plants and represent candidates for clinical studies. The antiviral compounds isolated from these plants provide novel molecular structures to design new semisynthetic antiviral agents. Future clinical studies in healthy volunteers as well as patients suffering from pulmonary infections are necessary to confirm the safety and efficacy of these plants as complementary and integrative interventions in SARS-CoV-2 infection.">

DC. of five extracts from Palestine.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The antimicrobial activity was estimated using well diffusion method for &lt;i&gt;N. obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; plant of five extracts against eight ATCC (American Type Culture Collection) and clinical isolates. The cytotoxic effects for these extracts were evaluated against HeLa (cervical) carcinoma cells using MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay. Moreover, the lipase and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase inhibitory properties were determined using standard biomedical assays.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The acetone extract of &lt;i&gt;N. obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; plant showed a more potent &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase inhibitory compared with acarbose with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 25.7 ± 0.08 and 28.18 ± 1.22 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. Additionally, the acetone and methanol extracts revealed moderate antilipase activity compared to orlistat with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 30.19 ± 0.11, 33.11 ± 0.13, and 12.3 ± 0.35 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. The methylene chloride extract was found to inhibit the growth of all the tested bacterial and fungal strains and also found to have potential cytotoxic effect against HeLa cancer cell line.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This research work reports for the first time the biological activity of &lt;i&gt;N. obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; from Palestine, and the results were promising indicating that &lt;i&gt;N. obtusifolia&lt;/i&gt; extracts contain valuable bioactive molecules that have a potential anti-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase, antilipase, antibacterial, and antifungal cytotoxic potentials.

Traditionally in China, jujube is considered as a medicinal fruit that is being used in treating blood deficiency. In this review, the beneficial effects of jujubes on the hematopoietic functions are summarized and discussed. As illustrated in cell and animal models, the application of jujube extract possessed beneficial effects, including regulation of erythropoiesis via activation of hypoxia inducible factor-induced erythropoietin, potential capacity in recycling heme iron during erythrophagocytosis and bi-directional regulation of immune response. Thus, the blood-nourishing function of jujube is being proposed here. Flavonoid, polysaccharide and triterpenoid within jujube could serve as the potential active ingredients accounting for the aforementioned health benefits. Taken together, these findings provide several lines of evidence for further development of jujube as supplementary products for prevention and/or treatment of anemia.">

Even though there are several reports on the effect of spice or spice components on Alzheimer's disease, there are no studies on the effect of spice oleoresins. Hence, this study investigates the effect of pepper, chili, and turmeric oleoresins in Alzheimer's type of cognitive impairment in the rat model. The animals were grouped into six groups with six animals in each. They were (i) normal, (ii) scopolamine, (iii) scopolamine + pepper oleoresin, (iv) scopolamine + turmeric oleoresin, (v) scopolamine + chili oleoresin and (vi) scopolamine + donepezil for 13 days. Learning memory and acquisition memory were evaluated by a Morris water maze, and the locomotor activity was assessed by an actophotometer. Biochemical parameters such as AChE, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were studied. The brain histology was also studied. The scopolamine treatment significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) elevated the locomotor activity and escape latency time and reduced the time spent in the target quadrant, which was reversed in the case of the oleoresin treatment. Scopolamine-mediated changes in AChE, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were improved after the treatment with oleoresins. Among the three oleoresins, chili oleoresin were the most effective in behavioral activity, brain biomarkers, and recovery of antioxidant capacities when compared to the drug treatment. Chili and pepper oleoresins improved the protection against hippocampal damage. These oleoresins can be potent preventive/therapeutic agents against Alzheimer's disease. This study confirms the effect of spice oleoresins in Alzheimer's disease condition.">

We studied their antibacterial and anticandidal activities against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;. The activities of the aqueous extracts of the studied materials were measured using agar-well diffusion methods. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of treated microbial cells was conducted to identify affected proteins. The results showed both antibacterial and anticandidal activities for the myrtle extract (ME), while the shilajeet extract (SE) showed antibacterial activity only. The highest antimicrobial activity was observed against &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; among the microbes tested; therefore, it was taken as the model for the proteomic analysis to identify the antimicrobial mechanism of ME and SE using two-dimensional electrophoresis. Upregulation of expression of 42 proteins and downregulation of expression of 6 proteins were observed in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; treated with ME, whereas 12 upregulated and 104 downregulated proteins were detected in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; treated with SE, in comparison with the control. About 85% of identified expressed proteins were from the cytoplasm and 15% from microbial cell walls, indicating the penetration of extracts inside cells. A higher percentage of expressed proteins was recorded for enzymatic activity. Our findings suggest that the major targets of the antibacterial action were proteins involved in the outer membrane, oxidative stress, and metabolism. Our data might reveal new targets for antimicrobial agents.">

        <span class="abst" title="In recent years, there is emerging evidence that isoflavonoids, either dietary or obtained from traditional medicinal plants, could play an important role as a supplementary drug in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their reported pronounced biological effects in relation to multiple metabolic factors associated with diabetes. Hence, in this regard, we have comprehensively reviewed the potential biological effects of isoflavonoids, particularly biochanin A, genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and formononetin on metabolic disorders and long-term complications induced by T2DM in order to understand whether they can be future candidates as a safe antidiabetic agent. Based on in-depth in vitro and in vivo studies evaluations, isoflavonoids have been found to activate gene expression through the stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) (α, γ), modulate carbohydrate metabolism, regulate hyperglycemia, induce dyslipidemia, lessen insulin resistance, and modify adipocyte differentiation and tissue metabolism. Moreover, these natural compounds have also been found to attenuate oxidative stress through the oxidative signaling process and inflammatory mechanism. Hence, isoflavonoids have been envisioned to be able to prevent and slow down the progression of long-term diabetes complications including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Further thoroughgoing investigations in human clinical studies are strongly recommended to obtain the optimum and specific dose and regimen required for supplementation with isoflavonoids and derivatives in diabetic patients.">

In this study, eleven anti-coronavirus alkaloids were identified from the scientific literature and their potential therapeutic value against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is discussed. In this study, in silico studies showed an affinity of the alkaloids for binding to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, putatively preventing it from binding to the host cell. Lastly, several mechanisms for the known anti-coronavirus activity of alkaloids were discussed, showing that the alkaloids are interesting compounds with potential use as bioactive agents against SARS-CoV-2.">

While several studies focused on the activities of the essential oils, this study analysed the potential of spent &lt;i&gt;L. petersonii&lt;/i&gt; leaves as a natural food preservative.&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;We investigated the in vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of crude &lt;i&gt;L. petersonii&lt;/i&gt; extracts against activities of the purified isolated flavonoid, 6-methyltectochrysin, which was characterized using spectroscopic methods. The antioxidant assays followed ORAC, FRAP and TEAC tests. The antimicrobial activities of the extract and purified flavonoid were analysed against six multi-drug resistant microbial strains in broth dilution assays.&lt;h4&gt;Result&lt;/h4&gt;The results revealed that both the crude extracts and isolated 6-methyltectochrysin exhibited positive radical ion scavenging antioxidant potential, however the crude extract was about 6-fold more potent antioxidant than the purified 6-methyltectochrysin. The crude extract also showed strong antimicrobial activities against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt;, and even more potent antimicrobial agent than the reference ampicillin antibiotic against &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;pneumoniae.&lt;/i&gt; A higher resistance was observed for the tested Gram-negative strains than for the Gram-positive ones. 6-methyltectochrysin was generally inactive in the antimicrobial assays.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The crude methanolic extract showed significant bioactivity which validates the medicinal relevance of the plant. The observed biological activities, especially against a notorious strain of &lt;i&gt;B. cereus,&lt;/i&gt; suggest that &lt;i&gt;L. petersonii&lt;/i&gt; could be a promising natural source of food preservatives.">

The cytotoxicity of extracts was monitored by xCELLigence system in real time by using porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-1) and by measurement of changes in metabolic activity ((3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) assay). The antioxidant properties were measured by spectrophotometric methods and polyphenolic profiles were determined by HPLC-DAD for 50% ethanol extracts (10% &lt;i&gt;w/v&lt;/i&gt;). Strong cytotoxic effect was recorded for tansy and yarrow extracts (125-1000 µg/mL) by xCELLigence system and MTS assay. Conversely, a supportive effect on cell proliferation was recorded for goldenrod extracts (125 µg/mL) by the same methods (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001). The antioxidant activity was in good correlation with total polyphenolic content, and the highest value was recorded for goldenrod leaves, followed by tansy leaves, goldenrod flowers and yarrow leaf extracts. The goldenrod extracts were abundant with flavonoids, whereas phenolic acid derivatives predominated in the polyphenolic profile of tansy and yarrow.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Breynia retusa&lt;/i&gt; (Dennst.) Alston (also known as Cup Saucer plant) is a food plant with wide applications in traditional medicine, particularly in Ayurveda. Extracts obtained with four solvents (dichloromethane, methanol, ethyl acetate and water), from three plant parts, (fruit, leaf and bark) were obtained. Extracts were tested for total phenolic, flavonoid content and antioxidant activities using a battery of assays including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (phosphomolybdenum) and metal chelating. Enzyme inhibitory effects were investigated using acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), tyrosinase, α-amylase and α-glucosidase as target enzymes. Results showed that the methanolic bark extract exhibited significant radical scavenging activity (DPPH: 202.09 ± 0.15; ABTS: 490.12 ± 0.18 mg Trolox equivalent (TE)/g), reducing potential (FRAP: 325.86 ± 4.36: CUPRAC: 661.82 ± 0.40 mg TE/g) and possessed the highest TAC (3.33 ± 0.13 mmol TE/g). The methanolic extracts were subjected to LC-DAD-MS&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and NMR analysis. A two-column LC method was developed to separate constituents, allowing to identify and quantify forty-four and fifteen constituents in bark and fruits, respectively. Main compound in bark was epicatechin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-sulphate and isolation of compound was performed to confirm its identity. Bark extract contained catechins, procyanidins, gallic acid derivatives and the sulfur containing spiroketal named breynins. Aerial parts mostly contained flavonoid glycosides. Considering the bioassays, the methanolic bark extract resulted a potent tyrosinase (152.79 ± 0.27 mg kojic acid equivalent/g), α-amylase (0.99 ± 0.01 mmol acarbose equivalent ACAE/g) and α-glucosidase (2.16 ± 0.01 mmol ACAE/g) inhibitor. In conclusion, methanol is able to extract the efficiently the phytoconstituents of &lt;i&gt;B. retusa&lt;/i&gt; and the bark is the most valuable source of compounds.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Zilla spinosa&lt;/i&gt; is commonly used in traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal disorders and diabetes. In this study, aqueous ethanol (AE) and aqueous methanol (AM) extracts from aerial parts and roots of &lt;i&gt;Z. spinosa&lt;/i&gt; were investigated. The total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoid (TFC) contents and antioxidant capacities in terms of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging, hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were determined, and the correlations among the results were assessed using Pearson's correlation. The antimicrobial activity was assessed through agar disc diffusion and broth microdilution assays. Phytochemical screening showed that &lt;i&gt;Z. spinosa&lt;/i&gt; extracts had alkaloids, glycosides, saponins, triterpenoids, phenols, and flavonoids in different abundances. The aerial part-AE extract contained low TPC (30.17 ± 4.24 mg GAE/g) and TFC (7.40 ± 1.02 mg QE/g) and displayed significant antioxidant capacity in the DPPH (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 52.17 ± 7.30 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (91.22 ± 2.60 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL), and FRAP (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 98.70 ± 2.21 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) assays. By contrast, the root-AM extract contained high amounts of TPC (87.72 ± 7.75 mg GAE/g) and TFC (25.60 ± 1.57 mg QE/g). It showed significantly high antioxidant activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 12.33 ± 1.88 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL in the DPPH and 39.37 ± 2.59 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; assays, as well as reducing power capacity with an EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 20.82 ± 1.14 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL in the FRAP assay. Both TPC and TFC were exhibited negative correlations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values obtained in the applied antioxidant assays. The aerial part-AM extract showed the highest inhibitory activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (26.5 ± 0.20 mm), followed by &lt;i&gt;Shigella flexneri&lt;/i&gt; (19.4 ± 0.40 mm) and &lt;i&gt;Proteus mirabilis&lt;/i&gt; (17.7 ± 0.49 mm). &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; was the most affected microorganism with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 128 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL against the aerial part-AM extract. Interestingly, all evaluated extracts showed potent antifungal activity against &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;. However, aerial part-AM was the most effective, with an inhibition zone of 12.6 ± 0.17 mm. The results concluded that &lt;i&gt;Z. spinosa&lt;/i&gt; possesses different phytochemicals displaying significant antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, thus lending credence to its use in traditional medicine.">

The solvent-free microwave extraction method indicated a higher oil yield of 0.7 mL/200 g (0.35%) as compared to 0.59 mL/200 g (0.295%) obtained through hydrodistillation. GC-MS analysis of the oils revealed a total of 52 chemical components from both methods with the presence of 35 (96.52%) and 30 (71.15%) chemical constituents for HD and SFME, respectively. The major constituents observed in the essential oil extracted by SFME methods include &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-pinene (6%), D-limonene (11.27%), &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-ocimene (9.09%), &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-phellandrene (6.33%), &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-mycene (8.49%), caryophyllene (5.96%), and camphene (4.28%). However, in the hydrodistillation method, the oil was majorly composed of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;-pinene (4.41%), &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-pinene (10.68%), &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-ocimene (6.30%), germacrene-D (5.09%), humulene (5.55%), and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-elemene (6.18%). The SFME method was better in terms of saving energy (0.25 kWh against 4.2 kWh of energy consumed), reduced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission (200 g against 3360 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a higher yield, and better quality of essential oil due to the presence of higher valuable oxygenated compounds (8.52%) against that of the hydrodistillation method (2.96%). The SFME method is, therefore, a good alternative for extracting the oils of &lt;i&gt;H. arborescens&lt;/i&gt; leaves since the essential oil yield is higher with more oxygenated compounds, considerable energy savings, lower cost, and reduced environmental burden at substantially reduced extraction time (30 min as opposed to 180 min).">

        <span class="abst" title="Callus, suspension and bioreactor cultures of &lt;i&gt;Verbena officinalis&lt;/i&gt; were established, and optimized for biomass growth and production of phenylpropanoid glycosides, phenolic acids, flavonoids and iridoids. All types of cultures were maintained on/in the Murashige and Skoog (MS) media with 1 mg/L BAP and 1 mg/L NAA. The inoculum sizes were optimized in callus and suspension cultures. Moreover, the growth of the culture in two different types of bioreactors-a balloon bioreactor (BB) and a stirred-tank bioreactor (STB) was tested. In methanolic extracts from biomass of all types of in vitro cultures the presence of the same metabolites-verbascoside, isoverbascoside, and six phenolic acids: protocatechuic, chlorogenic, vanillic, caffeic, ferulic and rosmarinic acids was confirmed and quantified by the HPLC-DAD method. In the extracts from lyophilized culture media, no metabolites were found. The main metabolites in biomass extracts were verbascoside and isoverbascoside. Their maximum amounts in g/100 g DW (dry weight) in the tested types of cultures were as follow: 7.25 and 0.61 (callus), 7.06 and 0.48 (suspension), 7.69 and 0.31 (BB), 9.18 and 0.34 (STB). The amounts of phenolic acids were many times lower, max. total content reached of 26.90, 50.72, 19.88, and 36.78 mg/100 g DW, respectively. The highest content of verbascoside and also a high content of isoverbascoside obtained in STB (stirred-tank bioreactor) were 5.3 and 7.8 times higher than in extracts from overground parts of the parent plant. In the extracts from parent plant two iridoids-verbenalin and hastatoside, were also abundant. All investigated biomass extracts and the extracts from parent plant showed the antiproliferative, antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The strongest activities were documented for the cultures maintained in STB. We propose extracts from in vitro cultured biomass of vervain, especially from STB, as a rich source of bioactive metabolites with antiproliferative, antioxidant and antibacterial properties.">

The HPLC results exhibited increased concentration of vindoline in the dichloromethane and the ethylacetate extracts. Vindoline showed noticeable antioxidant activity when compared to ascorbic acid at &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05 and significantly improved the in vitro insulin secretion. The intracellular reactive oxygen species formation in glucotoxicity-induced cells was significantly reduced following treatment with vindoline, methanolic and the dichloromethane extracts when compared to the high glucose untreated control (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Plant extracts and vindoline showed weaker inhibitory effects on the activities of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes when compared to acarbose, which inhibited the activities of the enzymes by 80%.

        <span class="abst" title="In Southeast Asia, traditional medicine has a longestablished history and plays an important role in the health care system. Various traditional medicinal plants have been used to treat diseases since ancient times and much of this traditional knowledge remains preserved today. &lt;i&gt;Oroxylum indicum&lt;/i&gt; (beko plant) is one of the medicinal herb plants that is widely distributed throughout Asia. It is a versatile plant and almost every part of the plant is reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological activities. Many of the important bioactivities of this medicinal plant is related to the most abundant bioactive constituent found in this plant-the baicalein. Nonetheless, there is still no systematic review to report and vindicate the biological activities and therapeutic potential of baicalein extracted from &lt;i&gt;O. indicum&lt;/i&gt; to treat human diseases. In this review, we aimed to systematically present in vivo and in vitro studies searched from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Google Scholar database up to 31 March 2020 based on keywords &quot;&lt;i&gt;Oroxylum indicum&lt;/i&gt;&quot; and &quot;baicalein&quot;. After an initial screening of titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text analysis and validation, 20 articles that fulfilled all the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in this systematic review. The searched data comprehensively reported the biological activities and therapeutic potential of baicalein originating from the &lt;i&gt;O. indicum&lt;/i&gt; plant for anti-cancer, antibacterial, anti-hyperglycemia, neurogenesis, cardioprotective, anti-adipogenesis, anti-inflammatory and wound healing effects. Nonetheless, we noticed that there was a scarcity of evidence on the efficacy of this natural active compound in human clinical studies. In conclusion, this systematic review article provides new insight into &lt;i&gt;O. indicum&lt;/i&gt; and its active constituent baicalein as a prospective complementary therapy from the perspective of modern and scientific aspect. We indicate the potential of this natural product to be developed into more conscientious and judicious evidencebased medicine in the future. However, we also recommend more clinical research to confirm the efficacy and safety of baicalein as therapeutic medicine for patients.">

Herein, a nonionic surfactant (Tween 80) and chitosan cosurfactant were used as emulsifying agents. The &lt;i&gt;Cordyceps&lt;/i&gt; nanoemulsion (COR-NE) was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and field-emission transmission electron microscope (FE-TEM). The DLS analyses revealed that the NE droplets were 87.0 ± 2.1 nm in diameter, with a PDI value of 0.089 ± 0.023, and zeta potential of -26.20 ± 2. The small size, low PDI, and stable zeta potential highlighted the excellent stability of the NE. The NE was tested for stability under different temperature (4 °C, 25 °C, and 60 °C) and storage conditions for 3 months where 4 °C did not affect the stability. Finally, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity and anti-inflammatory activity were assessed. The results suggested that the NE was not toxic to RAW 264.7 or HaCaT (human keratinocyte) cell lines at up to 100 µL/mL. Anti-inflammatory activity in liposaccharides (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells was evident at 50 µg/mL and showed inhibition of NO production and downregulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression. Further, the NE exhibited good antioxidant (2.96 ± 0.10 mg/mL) activity and inhibited &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; bacterial growth. Overall, the COR-NE had greater efficacy than the free extract and added significant value for future biomedical and cosmetics applications.">

Wound healing is a complex process that involves multiple steps such as inflammation, proliferation and maturation and ends with scar formation. Since ancient times, a widely used option for treating skin wounds are plant- based treatments which currently have become the subject of modern pharmaceutical formulations. Triterpenes with tetracyclic and pentacyclic structure are extensively studied for their implication in wound healing as well as to determine their molecular mechanisms of action. The current review aims to summarize the main results of in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies conducted on lupane, ursane, oleanane, dammarane, lanostane and cycloartane type triterpenes as potential wound healing treatments.">

In this study, we evaluated the gastroprotective effects of Inulae Flos extract (IFE) against gastric mucosal lesions induced by hydrochloric acid (HCl)/ethanol in rats and explored its potential mechanisms by measuring antioxidant enzyme activity, mucus secretion, and prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) levels. Pretreatment with IFE at doses of 100 and 300 mg/kg significantly inhibited gastric lesions in HCl/ethanol-treated rats. IFE increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and the levels of glutathione and PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in gastric tissues. The administration of IFE also significantly increased the gastric wall mucus contents in HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesions. These findings suggest that IFE has gastroprotective effects against HCl/ethanol-induced gastric lesions and exerts these effects through increased antioxidant levels and gastric mucus secretion. Inulae Flos may be a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of gastritis and gastric ulcers.">

We investigated the chemical differences in the medicinal parts of &lt;i&gt;M. alba&lt;/i&gt; by analyzing a total of 57 samples (15 root barks, 11 twigs, 12 fruits, and 19 leaves). Twelve marker compounds, including seven flavonoids, two stilbenoids, two phenolic acids, and a coumarin, were quantitatively analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector and chemometric analyses (principal component and heatmap analysis). The results demonstrated that the levels and compositions of the marker compounds varied in each medicinal part. The leaves contained higher levels of six compounds, the root barks contained higher levels of four compounds, and the twigs contained higher levels of two compounds. The results of chemometric analysis showed clustering of the samples according to the medicinal part, with the marker compounds strongly associated with each part: mulberroside A, taxifolin, kuwanon G, and morusin for the root barks; 4-hydroxycinnamic acid and oxyresveratrol for the twigs and skimmin; chlorogenic acid, rutin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, and quercitrin for the leaves. Our approach plays a fundamental role in the quality evaluation and further understanding of biological actions of herbal medicines derived from various medicinal plant parts.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Bergenia&lt;/i&gt; (Saxifragaceae) genus is native to central Asia and encompasses 32 known species. Among these, nine are of pharmacological relevance. In the Indian system of traditional medicine (Ayurveda), &quot;Pashanabheda&quot; (stone breaker) is an elite drug formulation obtained from the rhizomes of &lt;i&gt;B. ligulata&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Bergenia&lt;/i&gt; species also possess several other biological activities like diuretic, antidiabetic, antitussive, insecticidal, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, anti-bradykinin, antiviral, antibacterial, antimalarial, hepatoprotective, antiulcer, anticancer, antioxidant, antiobesity, and adaptogenic. This review provides explicit information on the traditional uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacological significance of the genus &lt;i&gt;Bergenia&lt;/i&gt;. The extant literature concerned was systematically collected from various databases, weblinks, blogs, books, and theses to select 174 references for detailed analysis. To date, 152 chemical constituents have been identified and characterized from the genus &lt;i&gt;Bergenia&lt;/i&gt; that belong to the chemical classes of polyphenols, phenolic-glycosides, lactones, quinones, sterols, tannins, terpenes, and others. &lt;i&gt;B. crassifolia&lt;/i&gt; alone possesses 104 bioactive compounds. Meticulous pharmacological and phytochemical studies on &lt;i&gt;Bergenia&lt;/i&gt; species and its conservation could yield more reliable compounds and products of pharmacological significance for better healthcare.">

The present review will focus on the molecular mechanisms involved in the different activities of Ferutinin, starting from its antioxidant potential at low doses until its ionophoric property and the subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction induced through administration of high doses, which represent the key point of its anticancer action. Furthermore, we will summarize the data acquired from some experimental studies on different cell types and on several diseases. The results obtained showed an important antioxidant and phytoestrogenic regulation with lack of typical side effects related to estrogenic therapy. The preferential cell death induction for tumor cell lines suggests that ferutinin may have anti-neoplastic properties, and may be used as an antiproliferative and cytotoxic agent in an estrogen dependent and independent manner. Nevertheless, more data are needed to clearly understand the effect of ferutinin in animals before using it as a phytoestrogen or anticancer drug.">

Increasing reports suggest that this phenolic compound and its derivatives, collectively termed salicylates, not only regulate plant defense but also have beneficial effects on human health. Both natural and synthetic salicylates are known to have multiple targets in humans, thereby exhibiting various appreciating pharmacological roles, including anti-inflammatory, anticancer, neuroprotective, antidiabetic effects, and so on. The role of some salicylates, such as acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), 5-aminosalicylic acid (mesalazine), and amorfrutins in human diseases has been well studied in vitro. However, their clinical significance in different diseases is largely unknown. Based on recent studies, five natural salicylates, including amorfrutin, ginkgolic acid, grifolic acid, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, and cannabidiolic acid, showed potential roles in different challenging human diseases. This review summarizes together some of the recent information on multitarget regulatory activities of these natural salicylates and their pharmacological roles in human health.">

Their constituents are primary metabolites, non-toxic, biocompatible and sustainable. In this study four selected NADES were applied for the extraction of two medicinal plants: Sideritis scardica, and Plantago major as an alternative to water-alcohol mixtures, and the antimicrobial and genotoxic potential of the extracts were studied. The extraction efficiency was evaluated by measuring the extracted total phenolics, and total flavonoids. Best extraction results for total phenolics for the studied plants were obtained with choline chloride-glucose 5:2 plus 30% water; but surprisingly these extracts were inactive against all tested microorganisms. Extracts with citric acid-1,2-propanediol 1:4 and choline chloride-glycerol 1:2 showed good activity against S. pyogenes, E. coli, S. aureus, and C. albicans. Low genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were observed for all four NADES and the extracts with antimicrobial activity. Our results confirm the potential of NADESs for extraction of bioactive constituents of medicinal plants and further suggest that NADES can improve the effects of bioactive extracts. Further studies are needed to clarify the influence of the studied NADES on the bioactivity of dissolved substances, and the possibility to use such extracts in the pharmaceutical and food industry.">

In this study, a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system of buckwheat flavonoids was prepared for enhancing its antioxidant activity and oral bioavailability. A nanoemulsion of buckwheat flavonoids was developed and characterized, and its antioxidant, in vitro release, and in vivo bioavailability were determined. The nanoemulsion was optimized by the central composite design response surface experiment, and its particle size, polymer dispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and stability were evaluated. The antioxidant activity was tested by measuring its 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, and superoxide anion scavenging ability. In vitro release of buckwheat flavonoids nanoemulsion showed a higher cumulative release than the suspension, and the release fitting model followed the Ritger-Peppas and Weibull models. The effective concentration of the nanoemulsion was evaluated in vivo using a Wistar rat model, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of the buckwheat flavonoids nanoemulsion was 2.2-fold higher than that of the buckwheat flavonoid suspension. The Cmax of the nanoemulsion was 2.6-fold greater than that of the suspension. These results indicate that the nanoemulsion is a promising oral drug delivery system that can improve the oral bioavailability to satisfy the clinical requirements.">

Asari Radix et Rhizoma is derived from the dry roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides Fr. Schmidt var. mandshuricum, A. sieboldii Miq. var. seoulense, or A. sieboldii. In this study, fumigant toxicity and oviposition deterrent of volatile constituents from ARR, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, terpinolene, eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol were tested against P. operculella. The preliminary verification of preventive and control effects of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene and methyleugenol on P. operculella was carried out by simulating warehouse experiments. The results indicated that the six compounds above had fumigation toxic effects on the adults and eggs of P. operculella. Among them, δ-3-carene, γ-terpinene, and terpinolene had weaker fumigation effects than those of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol. The LC50 values of eucarvone, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene, and methyleugenol against adult P. operculella were 1.01, 1.78, 1.51 mg/liter air, respectively. The LC50 values against egg P. operculella were 1.09, 0.55, 0.30 mg/liter air, respectively. The oviposition deterrent experiment showed that only methyleugenol (at 5 and 1 mg/ml) and eucarvone (5 mg/ml) had a substantial oviposition deterrent effect. The simulated warehouse experiment verified that methyleugenol, eucarvone, and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene protected potatoes from P. operculella and demonstrated that methyleugenol had the best preventive and control effects. It was concluded that methyleugenol was the active ingredient with the most potential in the volatiles from ARR on P. operculella control and merit further study as botanic fumigant.">

This study aimed at investigating the chemical composition and cytotoxic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of acetone extracts of Moroccan &lt;i&gt;Evernia prunastri (E. prunastri), Ramalina farinacea&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;R. farinacea&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;Pseudevernia furfuracea (P. furfuracea). Materials and Methods&lt;/i&gt;. The phytochemical analysis was carried out by HPLC-UV. The cytotoxic effect was assessed on human prostate cancer (22RV1), human colon carcinoma (HT-29), human hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep-G2), and Hamster ovarian cancer (CHO) cells lines by WST1 assay. The antioxidant power was assessed by DPPH and FRAP assays. The antibacterial effect was obtained using the broth microdilution method.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The findings of phytochemical analysis showed that the lichens studied possess interesting bioactive molecules such as physodalic acid, evernic acid, and usnic acid, as well as protocetraric acid. According to the American National Cancer Institute guidelines, the WST-1 test showed that all crude extracts did not show significant cytotoxic effects against all concerous cell lines, and IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranged from 42.30 to 140.24 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. Regarding the antioxidant activity, &lt;i&gt;P. furfuracea&lt;/i&gt; extract showed the highest free-radical-scavenging ability (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 498.40 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL). The most potent antibacterial extract was recorded for &lt;i&gt;P. furfuracea&lt;/i&gt; extract with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 0.039 to 0.31 mg/mL.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;In this research work, we report that the studied lichen extracts exhibit an important biological effect, supporting that lichens represent a hopeful source of original natural products for the research of new bioactive molecules having a pharmaceutical interest.">

The goal of the present study was to compare the MMP inhibitory potential of two Aloe species, A. vera and A. arborescens.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Different types of extraction were tested and specific bioactive compounds were quantified. Cancer cell invasion inhibitory activities were measured in vitro using the wound healing assay in human colon cancer cells (HT29). Effects on gelatinase activities were further assessed by dye-quenched gelatin and gelatin zymography.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Different types of extraction yielded significantly different levels of bioactivities and of bioactive compounds, which might be due to a greater amount of extractable bioactive compounds such as anthraquinones. Both A. arborescens and A. vera have potential as inhibitory agents in cancer cell proliferation via MMP-9 and MMP-2 enzymatic activity inhibition, being able to reduce colon cancer cell proliferation and migration but A. arborescens showed to be a more effective inhibitor of cancer cell migration than A. vera.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This work opens novel perspectives on the mode of action of Aloe species in cancer cell migration and may provide clues as to why there are so many conflicting results on Aloe's activities.">

The rats were administered orally different doses of AFAL (100 and 200 mg/kg) for 7 days. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate weight, relative prostate weight, prostate protein content and oxidative stress indices of the rats were evaluated. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; It was observed that 200 mg/kg AFAL significantly reduced the PSA level, mean prostate weights and mean relative prostate weights of the test rats compared to the TP group, and the values were not significantly different from the normal control and group treated with a standard drug. The plant extract also significantly enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the test rats which were evidently compromised in the group that received the exogenous hormone alone. Histopathology of the prostate showed a marked recovery for the test rats after treatment with AFAL. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; Oral administration of acetogenin-rich fraction of &lt;i&gt;Annona muricata&lt;/i&gt; leaves ameliorated TP-induced BPH in rats and significantly enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the rats.">

In this study, exopolysaccharides (EPS) were produced by &lt;i&gt;Pleurotus pulmonarius&lt;/i&gt; in submerged culture supplemented with different agro-wastes. Functional groups in EPS were revealed using Fourier Transform-Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Antimicrobial activity of EPS was tested against microorganisms using agar well diffusion. Scavenging potentials of EPS was tested against 1, 1- diphenyl-2-picryhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl (OH), iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and nitric oxide (NO) radicals. &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; prebiotic activity of EPS was carried out. The highest yield (5.60 g/L) of EPS was produced by &lt;i&gt;P. pulmonarius&lt;/i&gt; in submerged culture supplemented with groundnut shell (20.0 g/L). The functional groups in EPS were hydroxyl (-OH), methyl (-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), ketone (-RCOH) and carbonyl group (-C=O). EPS displayed zones of inhibition (5.00-14.00 mm) against tested microorganisms. Scavenging activity of EPS ranged from 65.70-81.80% against DPPH. EPS supported the growth of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus thermophiles&lt;/i&gt; with values ranged from 3.04 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-3.40 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/ml and 2.50 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-2.81 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cfu/ml, respectively. Submerged culture of &lt;i&gt;P. pulmonarius&lt;/i&gt; with addition of agro-wastes enhanced yield of EPS. The EPS exhibited bio-functional properties like antimicrobial, antioxidant and prebiotic activities. Hence, agrowastes can be recycled in submerged fermentation with fungi to produce promising biomaterials for biopharmaceutical applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; species have been used traditionally to treat various ailments, such as fever, pain, and to control blood glucose level. This systematic review critically discusses studies regarding &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; species that exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, thus providing perspectives and instructions for future research of the plants as a potential source of new dietary supplements or medicinal agents. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; A literature search from internet databases of PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, e-theses Online Service, and ProQuest was carried out using a combination of keywords such as &quot;&lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt;,&quot; &quot;antioxidant,&quot; &quot;anti-inflammatory,&quot; or other related words. Research articles were included in this study if they were experimental (&lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;) or clinical studies on the antioxidant or anti-inflammatory effects of &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; species and if they were articles published in English. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Altogether, 27 studies on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; species were selected. The antioxidant effects of &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; species were manifested by inhibition of reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation, modulation of glutathione-related parameters, and enzymatic antioxidant production or activities. The anti-inflammatory effects of &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; species were through the modulation of inflammatory cytokine production, inhibition of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitric oxide production, cellular inflammatory-related parameters, and inflammation in animal models. The potential anti-inflammatory signaling pathways modulated by &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; species are glycogen synthase kinase-3, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, PPARγ, MAPK, NF-κB, and PI3K/Akt. However, most reports on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the plants were on crude extracts, and the chemical constituents contributing to bioactivities were not clearly understood. There is a variation in quality of studies in terms of design, conduct, and interpretation, and in-depth studies on the underlying mechanisms involved in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the plants are in demand. Moreover, there is limited clinical study on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; species. &lt;b&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/b&gt; This review highlighted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of genus &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt; and supported their traditional uses to treat oxidative stress and inflammatory-related diseases. This review is expected to catalyze further studies on genus &lt;i&gt;Gynura&lt;/i&gt;. However, extensive preclinical data need to be generated from toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies before clinical studies can be pursued for their development into clinical medicines to treat oxidative stress and inflammatory conditions.">

Ramson (&lt;i&gt;Allium ursinum&lt;/i&gt;) is recognized as a medicinal plant with a long history of use in traditional medicine due to its antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. In this study the influence of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; gastrointestinal digestion on the cytotoxic activity of &lt;i&gt;A. ursinum&lt;/i&gt; extracts against human malignant cell lines was demonstrated. Seven sulfur compounds, the degradation products of thiosulfinates, including diallyl disulfide were shown to inhibit proliferation of malignant cells by inducing accumulation within G2/M phase as well as to induce apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and mitochondrial signaling pathway. Further, the &lt;i&gt;A. ursinum&lt;/i&gt; microbiota, particularly LAB with potential probiotic effects, was analyzed by culture-dependent method and culture-independent method [denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)]. The obtained results revealed that the most abundant genera were &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus&lt;/i&gt; genus was mainly represented by &lt;i&gt;L. fermentum.&lt;/i&gt; The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed the presence of two PFGE pulsotypes. The probiotic potential of the strain &lt;i&gt;L. fermentum&lt;/i&gt; BGSR163 belonging to PFGE pulsotype 1 and the strain &lt;i&gt;L. fermentum&lt;/i&gt; BGSR227 belonging to the PFGE pulsotype 2 was characterized. The results revealed that both strains are safe for human use, successfully survive the simulated gastrointestinal conditions, have potential to transiently colonize the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and have a protective immunomodulatory effect, inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokine IL17 and regulatory cytokine IL10, while decreasing the production of proinflammatory cytokine IFN-γ. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that consumption of &lt;i&gt;A. ursinum&lt;/i&gt; might have health-promoting properties, including anticancer effects, while &lt;i&gt;L. fermentum&lt;/i&gt; strains isolated from &lt;i&gt;A. ursinum&lt;/i&gt; leaves could be used as probiotics for human consumption.">

        <span class="abst" title="Terpenoids are a large diverse group of natural products which play important roles in plant metabolic activities. Monoterpenoids are the main components of plant essential oils and the active components of some traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. Some monoterpenoids are widely used in medicine, cosmetics and other industries, and they are mainly obtained by plant biomass extraction methods. These plant extraction methods have some problems, such as low efficiency, unstable quality, and high cost. Moreover, the monoterpenoid production from plant cannot satisfy the growing monoterpenoids demand. The development of metabolic engineering, protein engineering and synthetic biology provides an opportunity to produce large amounts of monoterpenoids eco-friendly using microbial cell factories. This mini-review covers current monoterpenoids production using &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. The monoterpenoids biosynthetic pathways, engineering of key monoterpenoids biosynthetic enzymes, and current monoterpenoids production using &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; were summarized. In the future, metabolically engineered &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; may provide one possible green and sustainable strategy for monoterpenoids supply.">

        <span class="abst" title="The residents of the Eastern part of Indonesia, specifically, Papua and West Papua provinces, are dependent on traditional medicines with the use of plants, which includes treating malaria. However, there are limited information on the diversity of medicinal plants in Papua Island. Hence, the Indonesian Ministry of Health put together a database of all the natural plant-based raw materials in Indonesia, to address part of the issues encountered as a result of the limited information on the diversity of plants. Based on this background, the aim of the research was to analyze the information on medicinal plants used by the traditional healers in Papua Island based on the results of research on medicinal plants and Jamu (RISTOJA), especially in treating malaria. Data were obtained through ethnomedicine research conducted in 2012 and 2017 involving 54 ethnicities in Papua. Based on the results, 72 species of medicinal plants from 67 genera and 40 families were used traditionally in treating malaria on Papua Island. The most common medicinal plants used as traditional antimalarial concoction are &lt;i&gt;Alstonia scholaris&lt;/i&gt; (L.) R. Br., &lt;i&gt;Carica papaya&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Andrographis paniculata&lt;/i&gt; (Burm. f.) Nees, and &lt;i&gt;Physalis minima&lt;/i&gt; L. Similar to other ethnobotany research, the leaves were the most used plant parts in preparing the various traditional concoctions.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Streblus asper&lt;/i&gt; (SA) belonging to the Moraceae family is well known as a folk medicinal plant in Asian countries. This study aimed to investigate the antilipoxygenase activity and the anti-inflammatory effects of the SA leaf extract. An in vitro antilipoxygenase study was performed using a lipoxygenase assay, and the oxidation of linoleic acid into 13-hydroperoxy linoleic acid (HPODE) was detected with a UV spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 234 nm. In the animal study, twenty-five male ICR mice were induced as ear edema by topical xylene, and the ear thickness of the mice was measured. The lipoxygenase assay results showed that the IC50 values of diclofenac sodium and SA were 0.0015 and 37.96 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, respectively. In the animal study, mice that received diclofenac sodium exhibited significantly reduced ear edema induced by xylene from 30 min onward, while mice that received 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg SA exhibited significantly reduced ear edema compared with the control group 45 min after induction with xylene. These results suggested that the SA leaf extract had anti-inflammatory activity. However, further studies are required to evaluate these effects and the additional potential of the plant that might be beneficial for the development of pharmaceutical products that prevent and treat inflammation.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Diploknema butyracea&lt;/i&gt; (Roxb.) H.J. Lam is a multipurpose tree used by the Nepalese indigenous people for medicinal purposes such as rheumatism, asthma, and ulcer and other purposes such as cooking and lighting. However, there is no scientific evidence for the medicinal uses of this plant. The present study aimed to explore the phytochemical constituents, estimate the total phenolic content, evaluate antioxidant activity, and investigate the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities of aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;Diploknema butyracea&lt;/i&gt; (Roxb.) H.J. Lam bark (ADBB). Phytochemical screening was performed using standard methods. The total phenolic content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant activity was determined using 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay and nitric oxide radical scavenging assay. For the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies, the plant extract was given in three different doses (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight) to male albino Wistar rats. Anti-inflammatory and analgesic studies were carried out using the carrageenan-induced rat paw edema and the hot plate method, respectively. Results revealed the presence of different phytoconstituents such as flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, terpenoids, and carbohydrates together with a considerable amount of phenolic compounds. Antioxidant assays indicated the potent antioxidant activity of the plant extracts. The higher dose of &lt;i&gt;D. butyracea&lt;/i&gt; (200 mg/kg) exhibited a maximum and significant inhibition (53.20%) of rat hind paw edema volume at 4 h and showed a greater increment in latency time (12.15 ± 1.81 sec) in the hot plate test at 120 min. The present study demonstrated the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic potential of ADBB, which supports its traditional medicinal use.">

Study reports were reviewed for study designs, demographics, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and safety laboratory results above the 1.5-fold of the upper limit of normal (aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), amylase, lipase, glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin, and creatinine in serum), and data were analyzed.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;12 out of 16 studies were included. Indications for development were cardiovascular (7), pulmonary (3), kidney (1), and hematological (1) diseases. 496 healthy male subjects (mean age 33.8 years, mean BMI of 24.7 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) received treatment (370 active, 126 placebo). 293 subjects had at least 1 TEAE (59.1%): 231 (62.4%) after active treatment and 126 (49.2%) after placebo. Subjects with a maximum TEAE intensity of moderate did not differ between active and placebo. The only severe TEAE was unrelated to the study, the only serious TEAE on active treatment was not considered drug-related. Subjects had a significantly higher relative risk on active treatment versus placebo to experience an overall TEAE. No relevant differences between active and placebo for the analyzed laboratory increases were seen.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Subjects were not exposed to an undue risk in the analyzed studies. Adverse events and laboratory value increases occur frequently under placebo treatment. The results can help in the risk stratification for and interpretation of other phase I studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Natural-based drugs are believed to be safe, effective and economical. Based on the medicinal importance of the genus Eryngium and unexplored nature of &lt;i&gt;Eryngium caeruleum&lt;/i&gt;, we have evaluated its antidiabetic and antioxidant potentials. Both &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; assays have been carried out for antidiabetic assays. The antioxidant activity was determined by using different free radicals [i.e., 1,1-diphenyl,2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azinobis[3-ethylbenzthiazoline]-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), and hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Moreover, different phytoconstituents were identified in the most active solvent fraction by GC-MS analysis. Furthermore, comparative fingerprints of methanolic extract and chloroform fraction were also analyzed via High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Diode Array Detector (HPLC-DAD). The crude methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;E. caeruleum&lt;/i&gt; (Ec.Cr) and its sub-fractions [i.e., &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane (Ec.Hex), chloroform (Ec.Chf), ethyl acetate (Ec.EtAc), and aqueous (Ec.Aq) were employed in this study]. In the α-glucosidase inhibition assay, a concentration-dependent inhibitory response was observed against the enzyme. The most active sample was Ec.Chf which revealed an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 437 μg/ml in comparison to the standard acarbose (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 25 μg/ml). The rest of the samples showed moderate inhibition of α-glucosidase. In antioxidant assays, Ec.Chf and Ec.Cr exhibited a considerable scavenging effect against all the free radicals. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values recorded for Ec.Chf were 112, 109, and 150 μg/ml against DPPH, ABTS, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively. Based on the &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; potential of Ec.Chf, this was subjected to the &lt;i&gt;in-vivo&lt;/i&gt; model experiment. The Ec.Chf lowered the blood glucose level up to 10.3 mmol/L at 500 μg/Kg. The Ec.Chf was also subjected to GC-MS analysis. The GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of 60 compounds. The identified phytoconstituents consist of some essential compounds previously reported with antidiabetic and antioxidant studies, which include thymol, tocopherol, phytol, nerolidol, (I)-neophytadiene, linolenic acid, and falcarinol. Similarly, the HPLC-DAD chromatograms of Ec.Cr and Ec.Chf exhibited a variety of peaks, which further demonstrates the possibility of important phytochemicals. In a nutshell, we can conclude that &lt;i&gt;Eryngium caeruleum&lt;/i&gt; is a potential source of bioactive compounds which may be beneficial for the management of ailments like diabetes and free radicals mediated disorders. Molecular docking was performed to explore the possible role of all the identified bioactive compounds in the chloroform fraction of &lt;i&gt;Eryngium caeruleum&lt;/i&gt; into active sites of the homology model of α-glucosidase.">

In support of this observation their cytotoxicity and molecular docking studies have been performed against lanosterol 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1) and &lt;i&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/i&gt; (1R51). Significant binding affinities were observed against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (7BQY) considering hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as standard. ADMET predictions were investigated to evaluate their absorption, metabolism and toxic properties. Most of the uridine esters showed better results than that of the HCQ. Overall, the present study might be useful for the development of uridine-based novel MDR antimicrobial and COVID-19 drugs.">

Furthermore, to verify whether the obtained STS inhibitors are able to pass through the cellular membrane effectively, cell line experiments have been carried out. We found that the lowest STS activities were measured in the presence of compound &lt;b&gt;3L&lt;/b&gt; (remaining STS activity of 5.22%, 27.48% and 99.0% at 100, 10 and 1 nM concentrations, respectively). The measured STS activities for &lt;i&gt;Irosustat&lt;/i&gt; (used as a reference) were 5.72%, 12.93% and 16.83% in the same concentration range. Moreover, a determined IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 15.97 nM for &lt;b&gt;3L&lt;/b&gt; showed that this compound is a very promising candidate for further preclinical investigations.">

Despite their significant importance in treatments of various health issues, only a few local species have been reported for their pharmacological potentials.

Survival and inhibition rates were analyzed by 3-(4, 5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y-l)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) while monitoring changes on cellular shapes by inverted phase contrast microscopy. Survival rates of MRC5 cells were observed to be significantly higher than A549 after treatments with various concentrations of polypore extracts. MRC5 cells showed excellence in survival performance when treated with hot and cold aqueous extracts. Cold aqueous extract showed higher cytotoxicity activities compared to hot aqueous extract (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.0001) with inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values of 414.29 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml and &gt;1000 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. Treatments with tamoxifen as a control exhibited necrotic features in both cell lines. The results suggest that &lt;i&gt;D. mellea&lt;/i&gt; possesses pharmacological potentials that can be utilized for human consumption as a new bioresource alternative, thus encouraging research advancement in mycological and nutraceutical studies.">

To evaluate the antimalarial effect of the &lt;i&gt;A. polystachyus&lt;/i&gt; extract, &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium berghei&lt;/i&gt; ANKA strain (chloroquine sensitive) was used to infect the mice in three different experimental protocol: suppressive, curative, and prophylactic test models.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The leaves extract of &lt;i&gt;Acanthus polystachyus&lt;/i&gt; significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05-0.0001) suppressed the parasitemia in all experimental protocol. The extract exhibited a chemosupression of 27.64%, 33.67% and 49.25% in 4-day suppressive test; 33.76%, 39.24% and 53.59% in curative test, and 25%, 32.84% and 50% in prophylactic tests at dose of 100, 200, and 400mg/kg, respectively. The extract also extended the mean survival time, prevented the bodyweight loss and body temperature drop, and packed cell volume significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05) as compared to the negative control. Dose-dependent antioxidant activity was shown by the leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;A. polystachyus&lt;/i&gt; with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 9.37µg/mL.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The current finding showed that the leaves extract of &lt;i&gt;Acanthus polystachyus&lt;/i&gt; has revealed promising antimalarial effects. Thus, this finding supports the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;A. polystachyus&lt;/i&gt; for the treatment of malaria.">

Currently, there are mainly interferons and nucleoside analogues treatment of hepatitis B in the clinic, which have certain therapeutic effects on hepatitis B, but their side effects and drug resistance are increasingly prominent. Therefore, it is urgently needed to discover and develop new anti-HBV drugs, especially natural products, which have novel, high efficiency, and low toxicity anti-HBV compounds with novel antiviral mechanisms. In this manuscript, the natural products (polysaccharides and 165 compounds) with the activity of antihepatitis B virus are discussed according to their chemical classes, including 14 phenylpropanoids, 8 flavonoids,12 xanthones, 13 anthroquinones, 47 terpenoids, 6 alkaloids, 15 enediynes, 11 aromatics, 18 phenylalanine dipeptides compounds, and 13 others. In addition, the anti-HBV mechanism and targets of natural product were also discussed. The aim of this review is to report new discoveries about anti-HBV natural products and to provide reference for researchers.">

The present study aimed to evaluate the diuretic activity of a crude extract and solvent fractions of the root bark of &lt;i&gt;C. myricoides&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Methodology&lt;/i&gt;. The coarsely powdered root bark of &lt;i&gt;C. myricoides&lt;/i&gt; was extracted by a cold maceration method using 80% methanol. A portion of the extract was fractionated based on the polarity index of solvents to obtain chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions. To investigate the diuretic activity of the plant, rats were divided into fifteen groups. The normal control groups received either water or 2% tween 80, the standard group received furosemide (10 mg/kg), and the test groups were administered the hydromethanolic extract and solvent fractions at the doses of 100, 200, and 400 mg/kg by the oral route. The urine volume, urine pH, urine, and serum electrolytes were determined and compared with the standard and normal control groups.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The crude hydromethanolic extract, ethyl acetate, and chloroform fractions induced significant diuresis at a dose of 400 mg/kg (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) compared to the aqueous fraction. The hydromethanolic extract at 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg also caused noticeable diuresis (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) compared to the standard, furosemide. Rats treated with hydromethanolic extract, ethyl acetate, and chloroform fractions showed delayed onset and prolonged diuresis in a dose-dependent fashion compared to the aqueous fraction (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). The hydromethanolic extract and solvent fractions produced the highest saliuretic and natriuretic index compared to the standard, furosemide. The crude hydromethanolic extract also failed to produce any sign of toxicity up to 2000 mg/kg.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;From this study, the hydromethanolic extract and ethyl acetate fraction of the root bark of &lt;i&gt;C. myricoides&lt;/i&gt; produced a prominent diuretic effect in rats.">

Some of them are economically valuable, as their roots frequently contain a purple-red dye used in the cosmetic industry. Furthermore, dried roots of &lt;i&gt;Arnebia euchroma&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;A. guttata&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Lithospermum erythrorhizon&lt;/i&gt;, which have been designated Lithospermi Radix, are used as traditional Korean herbal medicine. This study is the first report on the floral micromorphology and complete chloroplast (cp) genome sequences of &lt;i&gt;A. guttata&lt;/i&gt; (including &lt;i&gt;A. tibetana&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;A. euchroma&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;L. erythrorhizon&lt;/i&gt;. We reveal great diversity in floral epidermal cell patterns, gynoecium, and structure of trichomes. The cp genomes were 149,361-150,465 bp in length, with conserved quadripartite structures. In total, 112 genes were identified, including 78 protein-coding regions, 30 tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes. Gene order, content, and orientation were highly conserved and were consistent with the general structure of angiosperm cp genomes. Comparison of the four cp genomes revealed locally divergent regions, mainly within intergenic spacer regions (&lt;i&gt;atpH-atpI&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;petN-psbM&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rbcL-psaI&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ycf4-cemA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ndhF-rpl32&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ndhC-trnV-UAC&lt;/i&gt;). To facilitate species identification, we developed molecular markers &lt;i&gt;psaA&lt;/i&gt;- &lt;i&gt;ycf3&lt;/i&gt; (PSY), &lt;i&gt;trnI-CAU- ycf2&lt;/i&gt; (TCY), and &lt;i&gt;ndhC&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;trnV-UAC&lt;/i&gt; (NCTV) based on divergence hotspots. High-resolution phylogenetic analysis revealed clear clustering and a close relationship of &lt;i&gt;Arnebia&lt;/i&gt; to its &lt;i&gt;Lithospermum&lt;/i&gt; sister group, which was supported by strong bootstrap values and posterior probabilities. Overall, gynoecium characteristics and genetic distance of cp genomes suggest that &lt;i&gt;A. tibetana&lt;/i&gt;, might be recognized as an independent species rather than a synonym of &lt;i&gt;A. guttata&lt;/i&gt;. The present morphological and cp genomic results provide useful information for future studies, such as taxonomic, phylogenetic, and evolutionary analysis of Boraginaceae.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Artemisia copa&lt;/i&gt; Phil. (Asteraceae) (known as copa-copa) is a native species of Chile used as an infusion in traditional medicine by Atacameños people in the Altiplano, highlands of northern Chile. In this research, we have investigated for the first time the cholinesterase inhibition potential against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and the chemical profiling of the infusions prepared from the aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;A. copa&lt;/i&gt; by high resolution spectrometry. In addition, total phenolic, total flavonoid content, antioxidant (DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC) and antiprozoal activity were tested. &lt;i&gt;Artemisia copa&lt;/i&gt; showed good inhibitory activity against AChE and BChE (3.92 ± 0.08 µg/ml and 44.13 ± 0.10 µg/ml). The infusion displayed a total phenolics content of 155.6 ± 2.9 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g and total flavonoid content of 5.5 ± 0.2 mg quercetin equivalents/g. Additionally, trypanocidal activity against &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt; was found (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 131.8 µg/ml). Forty-seven metabolites were detected in the infusion of &lt;i&gt;A. copa&lt;/i&gt; including several phenolic acids and flavonoids which were rapidly identified using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis (UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS) for chemical profiling. The major compounds identified in the infusions were studied by molecular docking against AChE and BChE. The UHPLC-MS fingerprints generated can be also used for the authentication of these endemic species. These findings reveal that &lt;i&gt;A. copa&lt;/i&gt; infusions can be used as beverages with protective effects.">

Hsiao, known as &quot;Huangqi&quot; in Chinese, has been used as a traditional herbal medicine or food in China for more than 2,000 years and is now consumed globally. Unfortunately, the increasing demand for RA has led to the overexploitation of its wild stock, as well as quality problems, including adulteration and contamination. Therefore, the sustainable cultivation of RA is urgently needed. In the present research, semi-structured interviews and key informant interviews were conducted, over a 2-year period, to collect data from stakeholders in the main production areas; moreover, a targeted chemical analysis-based quality assessment strategy was applied to understand the quality of RA. Accordingly, 10 different types of value chains (VCs) were identified in RA production; meanwhile, the contents of the main active ingredients (astragaloside and calycosin-7-O-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-D-glucoside) were analyzed by HPLC-ELSD-UV and the yield of medicinal material was demined and further analyzed using &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means clustering analysis. The results show that the tight relationship between quality of the RA and stakeholders' revenues among the VCs, which reflects a more general trend in the production system. Over the past few decades, vertical coordination has emerged increasingly in VCs of RA, which leads to a more coherent traceability system and rigorous regulations in the supply chains. &lt;i&gt;Daodi&lt;/i&gt; herbs can be considered to be a standard that is distinctive with good quality characteristics that emphasize the origins of the medicinal plants. We find that the suitability of geographical areas and vertical integration can improve the VCs of RA, which further contributes to its quality control, as well as its sustainable production.">

The hydrodistillation essential oil from A. repens was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and 17 compounds were identified. All extracts showed good inhibitory activities against disease-related enzyme acetylcholinesterase and α-amylase, with the lowest IC50 for acetonic extract. Extracts of A. repens exhibited inhibiting activities against the Gram-positive bacteria, with the most effect of acetone extract.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Our findings suggest A. repens as a promising source of natural antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-cholinesterase and anti-amylase agents for the management of oxidative damage, and pharmaceutical, food, and cosmeceutical purposes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Hypertension is a dominant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular, kidney, and eye diseases. In Africa, it increasingly leads to hospitalisation and a strain on the public health system. However, rather than modern medicine, African traditional healers are the first choice for most South Africans. Therefore, this study is aimed at gathering information on herbal remedies traditionally used for the treatment of high blood pressure in Vhavenda, South Africa, and comparing this information with reports in the literature regarding plants used to manage high blood pressure. An ethnobotanical survey was carried out in Vhembe district and its environs with 53 herbalists and indigenous people aged between 36 and 66 years from January to October 2019 using a semistructured questionnaire. The plants were collected with each respondent; they were authenticated and kept in herbarium. A total of 51 different plants were mentioned as being most commonly used for hypertension treatment. Of these, 44 plants were identified, with those from the Fabaceae family followed by plants from the Celastraceae family being commonly mentioned. Of these, the &lt;i&gt;Elaeodendron transvaalense&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Tabernaemontana elegans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Elephantorrhiza elephantina&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Aloe vossii&lt;/i&gt; were commonly cited species. According to the literature data, most of the identified plants are yet to be scientifically investigated for the treatment of hypertension, whereas only preliminary investigations have been carried out on other plants, suggesting that these preliminary investigations may have highlight promising antihypertensive activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; that are indicative of their potential as antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, there is a need to scientifically investigate the antihypertensive potentials of these plants as a potential source of antihypertensive treatment and compounds.">

One of them is age-related macular degeneration, which causes progressive loss of vision due to retina degeneration. Treatment of age-related macular degeneration focuses on antioxidant agents and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor compounds, among others, that prevent/diminish oxidative stress and reduce neovascularisation respectively. The phytochemicals, medicinal plants and/or plant-diet supplements might be a useful adjunct in prevention or treatment of age-related macular degeneration owing to their antioxidant and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor properties. This review article presents the most investigated plants and natural products in relation to age-related macular degeneration, such as saffron, ginkgo, bilberry and blueberry, curcuma or turmeric, carotenoids, polyphenols, and vitamins C and E.

Identifying effective and safe herbal formulations that are locally available is viewed as a priority for sustainable development in a region. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Thai herbal formulation-6 (THF-6) in comparison with oral diclofenac in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the knee.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;This randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, noninferiority trial randomly assigned patients with osteoarthritis of the knee to receive either THF-6 or diclofenac for four weeks. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in knee pain as measured by a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures included knee stiffness, a stair climb test, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, and safety parameters. Outcomes were assessed on a biweekly basis. Modified intention-to-treat (MITT) and perprotocol (PP) analyses were applied.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 200 patients were enrolled of whom 175 (87.5%) were included in the MITT analysis and 153 (76.5%) in the PP analysis. The mean change in VAS pain did not differ between the two groups, and the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for comparison between the two groups was within the prespecified margin of 10 mm for noninferiority (MITT analysis: mean difference = 0.86, 95% CI = -4.39 to 6.10, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.748; PP analysis: mean difference = 1.98, 95% CI = -3.61 to 7.56, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.486). Significant improvement was observed in all the efficacy parameters in both groups. Dyspepsia was the most common adverse event: 23 patients in the THF-6 group and 28 in the diclofenac group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.417).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;THF-6 offers an alternative to oral diclofenac for the short-term treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. It was shown to be noninferior to oral diclofenac in relieving knee pain. This trial is registered with ChiCTR-IPR-15007213.">

This study aimed to demonstrate the wound healing activity of a cream formulation of &lt;i&gt;Jatropha gaumeri&lt;/i&gt; Greenm. latex in a murine model, provide a histological assessment of its scarring effects, and identify the family of phytochemicals involved in these effects.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;Latex was obtained from the cut stalk leaves and young stems of &lt;i&gt;J. gaumeri&lt;/i&gt; and stored in sterile tubes with protection from light. Chloroform, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions of the latex were obtained. Fifty male Balb/c mice aged 10-12 weeks were divided into10 groups of five mice: Group 1 corresponded to healthy mice with wounds; Group 2 corresponded to mice with wounds and treated with A-Derma&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;; and from Group 3 to group 10 corresponded to mice treated with a different latex fraction. A circular skin wound of about 1 cm was made on the paravertebral region of each mouse under anesthetized and aseptic conditions. The wounds were topically treated every 24 h with the respective extracts for 22 days, after which skin tissue specimens were obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome. The efficiency of healing was measured by quantifying the tensile strength of the scars. The phytochemicals in the latex were elucidated using thin chromatography.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The aqueous latex fraction produced the best wound healing activity and was superior to the positive control. Reepithelialization at the histological level resulted in tissue that resembled healthy skin in terms of the appearance of collagen, the regeneration of hair follicles, and cellularity of the dermis, which showed organized epithelialization. A wound healing efficacy of 97% was observed, and it seems that alkaloids were the phytochemicals mostly likely responsible for these effects.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;J. gaumeri&lt;/i&gt; latex exhibited wound healing activity, possibly mediated by phytochemicals such as alkaloids in the aqueous fraction.">

The current study, therefore, focused on the diuretic activity of aqueous and 80% methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;F. sur&lt;/i&gt; Forssk. leaves in rats.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Rats were randomly assigned into eight groups each consisting of six rats. Test groups received either 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, or 400 mg/kg of aqueous or 80% methanol leaves extract. The negative control group and positive control were treated with 2 mL/100 g of distilled water and furosemide (10 mg/kg), respectively. Thereafter urine volume was recorded every hour until the end of the fifth hour, and cumulative urine volume of each rat was measured. Then, diuretic activity, diuretic index, saliuretic index, natriuretic index and carbonic anhydrase inhibition index in each group were calculated, and results were compared among the groups.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The middle (200 mg/kg) and the highest (400 mg/kg) doses of both extracts significantly increased diuresis at the fifth hour (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) compared to the negative control, although the diuretic activity was less than that of the positive control. Regarding electrolyte excretion, all dose levels of both extracts showed significant natriuresis (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) and chloriuresis (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.01) compared to the negative control. Aqueous extract displayed more significant diuretic effect than 80% methanol extract. The aqueous and 80% methanol extracts produced alkaline urine.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The crude leaves extracts of &lt;i&gt;F. sur&lt;/i&gt; increased urinary excretion and concentration of urinary electrolytes in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are in agreement with the traditional claim for use of &lt;i&gt;F. sur&lt;/i&gt; as diuretic agent.">

Therefore, inhibition of such proteins has become a validated and attractive target for anticancer drug discovery. In this manner, the present studies developed a series of novel isatin-indole conjugates (&lt;b&gt;7a-j&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9a-e&lt;/b&gt;) as potential anticancer Bcl2 and BclxL inhibitors. The progression of the two examined colorectal cancer cell lines was significantly inhibited by all of the prepared compounds with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ranges132-611 nM compared to IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.6 µM for &lt;b&gt;5FU&lt;/b&gt;, against HT-29 and IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ranges 37-468 nM compared to IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.5 µM for &lt;b&gt;5FU&lt;/b&gt;, against SW-620. Thereafter, compounds &lt;b&gt;7c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;7g&lt;/b&gt; were selected for further investigations. Interestingly, both compounds exhibited selective cytotoxicity against both cell lines with high safety to normal fibroblast (HFF-1). In addition, both compounds &lt;b&gt;7c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;7g&lt;/b&gt; induced apoptosis and inhibited Bcl2 and BclxL expression in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, the high potency and selective cytotoxicity suggested that conjugates &lt;b&gt;7c&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;7g&lt;/b&gt; could be a starting point for further optimisation to develop novel pro-apoptotic and antitumor agents towards colon cancer.">

On the other hand, the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; -substituted oxindole derivatives, &lt;b&gt;series 7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;, showed moderate to weak cytotoxic activity on both breast cancer cell lines. CDK2 and GSK-3β enzyme inhibition assay of &lt;b&gt;series 5&lt;/b&gt; revealed that compounds &lt;b&gt;5d&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5f&lt;/b&gt; are showing potent dual CDK2/GSK-3β inhibitory activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 37.77 and 52.75 nM, respectively, on CDK2 and 32.09 and 40.13 nM, respectively, on GSK-3β. The most potent compounds &lt;b&gt;5d-f&lt;/b&gt; caused cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase in MCF-7 cells inducing cell apoptosis because of the CDK2/GSK-3β inhibition. Molecular docking studies showed that the newly synthesised &lt;i&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; -unsubstituted oxindole hybrids have comparable binding patterns in both CDK2 and GSK-3β. The oxindole ring is accommodated in the hinge region interacting through hydrogen bonding with the backbone CO and NH of the key amino acids Glu81 and Leu83, respectively, in CDK2 and Asp133 and Val135, respectively, in GSK-3β. Whereas, in series &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; -substitutions on the oxindole nucleus hinder the compounds from achieving these key interactions with hinge region amino acids what rationalises their moderate to low anti-proliferative activity.">

The lipase was purified to homogeneity with a yield of 6.13% and specific activity of 502.76 U/mg, and its molecular weight was determined to be approximately 87 kDa. SCNL maintained above 80% of its initial activity at a wide range of temperatures (20-50 °C) and pH values (6-11), with an optimal temperature at 40 °C and optimal pH at 9.0 with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl palmitate as a substrate. SCNL exhibited a higher residual activity than the other staphylococcal lipases in the presence of common enzyme inhibitors and commercial detergents. The lipase activity was enhanced by organic solvents (isooctane, glycerol, DMSO and methanol) and metal ions (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;).

The enzyme showed a preference for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-NP stearate, tributyrin and canola oil.

        <span class="abst" title="Beta cell apoptosis induced by proinflammatory cytokines is one of the hallmarks of diabetes. Small molecules which can inhibit the cytokine-induced apoptosis could lead to new drug candidates that can be used in combination with existing therapeutic interventions against diabetes. The current study evaluated several effects of bergenin, an isocoumarin derivative, in beta cells in the presence of cytokines. These included (i) increase in beta cell viability (by measuring cellular ATP levels) (ii) suppression of beta cell apoptosis (by measuring caspase activity), (iii) improvement in beta cell function (by measuring glucose-stimulated insulin secretion), and (iv) improvement of beta cells mitochondrial physiological functions. The experiments were carried out using rat beta INS-1E cell line in the presence or absence of bergenin and a cocktail of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon- gamma) for 48 hr. Bergenin significantly inhibited beta cell apoptosis, as inferred from the reduction in the caspase-3 activity (IC50 = 7.29 ± 2.45 μM), and concurrently increased cellular ATP Levels (EC50 = 1.97 ± 0.47 μM). Bergenin also significantly enhanced insulin secretion (EC50 = 6.73 ± 2.15 μM) in INS-1E cells, presumably because of the decreased nitric oxide production (IC50 = 6.82 ± 2.83 μM). Bergenin restored mitochondrial membrane potential (EC50 = 2.27 ± 0.83 μM), decreased ROS production (IC50 = 14.63 ± 3.18 μM), and improved mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (EC50 = 1.39 ± 0.62 μM). This study shows for the first time that bergenin protected beta cells from cytokine-induced apoptosis and restored insulin secretory function by virtue of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. To sum up, the above mentioned data highlight bergenin as a promising anti-apoptotic agent in the context of diabetes.">

Schiff base derivatives were designed to possess an heterocyclic moiety on one side to enhance the coordination ability towards metals. To investigate the biological assay of the newly synthesized compounds, their DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging, metal chelating, reducing power, antibacterial and DNA binding activities were tested. &lt;b&gt;A6&lt;/b&gt; (63.1%) showed the maximum free radical scavenging activity among all.

In addition, &lt;b&gt;P3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;A6&lt;/b&gt; showed antibacterial activity against all bacteria tested and both compounds were very well bound to CT-DNA. Density functional theory method with B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) basis set was performed to get information about the structural and electronic properties of the present compounds.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;Malaria is an important parasitic disease that affects mostly the African continent. Traditional medicine is very important in Mozambique and traditional healers play a key role in the primary health care services, particularly in rural areas. We aim to report the results of an ethnobotanical survey undertaken in Mogovolas district, northern region of Mozambique. We recorded and identified the medicinal plants used by traditional healers for treatment of malaria, as well as the mode of preparation and administration.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The study was conducted in 14 villages from Mogovolas between June and August 2015. Sixteen traditional healers were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Under their guidance, we collected medicinal plants and prepared herbarium specimens that were sent and kept at Eduardo Mondlane University Herbarium for scientific identification. We searched for information on the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies of the cited plants for antiplasmodial activity.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Traditional healers from Mogovolas district reported the use of 37 plants to treat malaria, belonging to 22 families. The most used species are &lt;i&gt;Ochna kirkii&lt;/i&gt; Oliv. (5 citations), &lt;i&gt;Ehretia amoena&lt;/i&gt; Klotzsch and &lt;i&gt;Pteleopsis myrtifolia&lt;/i&gt; (M.A.Lawson) Engl. &amp; Diels (both with 3 citations). These plants belong to Ochnaceae, Boraginaceae and Combretaceae families, respectively. The herbal remedies are prepared using leaves (22/37), roots (18/37), stem barks (16/37) and stems (3/37). The administration of the herbal remedies was made essentially by oral route and bathing.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The ethnobotanical data resulted from this study can be the starting point for further chemical and pharmacological studies aiming to identify medicinal species with antimalarial activity, thus, open the insights for the discovery of new antimalarial substances, as well as better integration of the traditional medicine into the national health systems, particularly in developing countries, as the health system coverage is limited.">

The present study therefore investigates the restorative potential of its leaves extract on hepatic and renal assault induced by CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and rifampicin respectively. Eight groups (I-VIII) containing five animals each were created for the experiments. Group I were fed with normal commercial pellet only, while group II were exposed to single intraperitoneal injection of 3 ml/kg b.w. of CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; only. Groups III, IV and V animals were administered 3 ml/kg b/w of CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and treated with 50, 100 mg/kg b. w. of &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; and 100 mg/kg b.w of silymarin respectively. Group VI animals were orally exposed to 250 mg/kg b/w of rifampicin only while groups VII and VIII were treated with 50 and 100 mg/kg b. w. &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; respectively for 14 days after the initial exposure to 250 mg/kg b/w rifampicin &lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Liver and kidney function tests such as alanine amino transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, urea and uric acid were determined in the serum and organs homogenates. Moreover, malonidialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) as well as lipid profile were also measured. Results showed that exposure to rifampicin and CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; respectively caused a marked derangement in lipid profile as well as decrease in SOD and CAT activity relative to the negative control. Administration of both toxicants also caused a marked increase in serum ALT, AST, ALP, urea, uric acid and creatine kinase compared to the negative control. Treatment with &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; attenuated the toxicity imposed by rifampicin and CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on the liver and kidney in a dose-dependent fashion. All biochemical indices measured were restored to values comparable with animals treated with silymarin. Histopathological results of the hepatic and renal tissues from the various groups of experimental animals gave credence to the curative effects of &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract on damaged liver and kidney cells. Put together, &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; is a potential medicinal plant with similar potency to conventional drugs currently in use for the treatment liver and kidney diseases. Hence, it is a viable therapeutic alternative that can be exploited for the treatment of renal and hepatic diseases.">

Extracellular crude extract of &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; KD155 displayed significant antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; (MTCC 441) and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MTCC 7443) in comparison to tetracycline and ketoconazole. The resistance of extracellular crude chloroform extract to DPPH scavenging activity was also observed with 77.49% inhibition rate reflecting strong antioxidant activity. In addition, HP-TLC, FT-IR and GC-MS analysis of extracellular chloroform crude extract was done which revealed phenolic compound (quercetin) as major bioactive metabolite being produced by our isolate KD155. Further, the stability of 16S rRNA sequence of the strain was studied using bioinformatics tools viz. mfold and NEB cutter indicating the thermodynamic stability of its gene sequence.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants have been utilized as medicines to treat various ailments since ancient times. Formulations made by plant materials have been used in traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine and remain widespread in both developing and developed countries. In developing countries, traditional medicines are widely practiced due to its accessibility and affordability, while in developed countries, complementary and alternative medicine are widely popular due to the adverse effects of chemical drugs. &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; Linn. (family: Euphorbiaceae) is a highly used medicinal plant used in both Sri Lankan and Indian traditional medical systems. Since this plant is a weed, it is being extensively destroyed due to the lack of knowledge regarding the medicinal value of this plant. Hence, the objective of this study was to collect data on the medicinal value of this plant by correlating its scientifically validated biological activities with its ethnopharmacological uses. An attempt was made to gather as much information available regarding the ethnopharmacological uses and scientifically validated biological activities of &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; through authentic traditional texts, scientific journals, and other authentic texts regarding medicinal plants. Thus, the review provides an insight to the capability of &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; to be used as a monoherbal formulation for diseases pertaining to multiple systems of the body. With all the scientifically validated biological activities and the ethnopharmacological uses, &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; may qualify as a potent candidate to be developed into a phytomedicine to be utilized as both a preventive and as a therapeutic agent.">

Their number has varied throughout the years with a significant decrease after 2012. Incidents mainly covered safety (56%) and quality (34%) issues or a combination thereof (5%). The majority (70%) were notified by EU regulators and involved centrally and nationally authorized product in similar proportions. A referral was recommended as the assessment pathway for 47% of the issues while lines-to-take were the most frequent communication measure (the sole measure in 65% cases). Forty-six per cent of the issues resulted in a variation, whereas 22% resulted in maintenance of the marketing authorization.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The EU-IMP is underpinned by a robust regulatory framework with defined processes and clear roles and responsibilities and offers a platform to coordinate actions and communication at EU level, rapidly pool expertise, minimize duplications, and address public health incidents.">

        <span class="abst" title="Adaptogens comprise a category of herbal medicinal and nutritional products promoting adaptability, resilience, and survival of living organisms in stress. The aim of this review was to summarize the growing knowledge about common adaptogenic plants used in various traditional medical systems (TMS) and conventional medicine and to provide a modern rationale for their use in the treatment of stress-induced and aging-related disorders. Adaptogens have pharmacologically pleiotropic effects on the neuroendocrine-immune system, which explain their traditional use for the treatment of a wide range of conditions. They exhibit a biphasic dose-effect response: at low doses they function as mild stress-mimetics, which activate the adaptive stress-response signaling pathways to cope with severe stress. That is in line with their traditional use for preventing premature aging and to maintain good health and vitality. However, the potential of adaptogens remains poorly explored. Treatment of stress and aging-related diseases require novel approaches. Some combinations of adaptogenic plants provide unique effects due to their synergistic interactions in organisms not obtainable by any ingredient independently. Further progress in this field needs to focus on discovering new combinations of adaptogens based on traditional medical concepts. Robust and rigorous approaches including network pharmacology and systems pharmacology could help in analyzing potential synergistic effects and, more broadly, future uses of adaptogens. In conclusion, the evolution of the adaptogenic concept has led back to basics of TMS and a new level of understanding of holistic approach. It provides a rationale for their use in stress-induced and aging-related diseases.">

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has selected six compounds to evaluate their antiproliferative activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; against 60 human cancer cells lines. Preliminary screening of the examined compounds indicated promising anticancer activity against number of cell lines. The enzyme inhibitory activity against VEGFR-2 was evaluated and IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of the tested compounds ranged from 0.57 µM to 1.48 µM. The most potent derivatives &lt;b&gt;Vd&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ve&lt;/b&gt; were subjected to further investigations. A cell cycle analysis showed that both compounds mainly arrest HCT-116 cell cycle in the G2/M phase. Annexin V-FITC apoptosis assay showed that &lt;b&gt;Vd&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ve&lt;/b&gt; induced an approximately 18.7-fold and 21.2-fold total increase in apoptosis compared to the control.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of THCs in patients suffering from canker sore and gingivitis designed as an exploratory clinical trial.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;This is an open label prospective pilot clinical trial carried out at two clinical centers: Noble Hospital, Pune, Maharashtra, and Sri Venkateshwara Hospital, Bangalore, Karnataka in India. Participants were assigned to 21 days of treatment with chewable oral THCs supplement. Patients were instructed to self-administer one chewable tablet containing 100 mg of THCs twice daily for up to 21 days. This clinical trial was registered at a public Clinical Trial Registry in India (http://www.ctri.nic.in). Thirty-one canker sore and twenty-nine gingivitis patients participated in this study. Body mass index, throat numbness/relief, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score, canker sore lesions, gingival appearance, inflammation and bleeding were assessed before and after treatment, at 14 and 21 days. Vital signs and laboratory parameters were assessed for safety.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;THCs treatment significantly reduced the reddening at the site, difficulty in chewing, swallowing, and VAS pain score in the canker sore patients. Further, both single and multiple lesions were completely healed. In gingivitis patients, gingival appearance, bleeding, and inflammation were significantly reduced. No adverse effects were observed during the study.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Overall, the findings of this study show that supplementation of THCs for 21 days reduced the pain and prevented the progression of the disease in patients suffering from canker sore and gingivitis without adverse side effects.">

The objective of this work was to evaluate the antioxidant capacity (ABTS+ and DPPH), antimicrobial activity, and polyphenol compounds of methanolic and aqueous extracts of &lt;i&gt;Jacaranda mimosifolia&lt;/i&gt; flowers. The antimicrobial activity against &lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 10876&lt;i&gt;, Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 6633&lt;i&gt;, Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 51299&lt;i&gt;, Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25922&lt;i&gt;, Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 19115&lt;i&gt;, Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 27853&lt;i&gt;, Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 14028, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25923, and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 25175, was determined using the Kirby Bauer technique. The results of polyphenolic compounds showed a high amount of total flavonoids in the methanolic and aqueous extracts (503.3 ± 86.5 and 245. 7 ± 27.8 mg Rutin Equivalents/g DW, respectively). Quercetin, gallic acid, caffeic acid, and rutin were identified by the HPLC-DAD technique, while in the GC-MS analysis, esters, fatty acids, organic compounds, as well as monosaccharides were identified. Higher antioxidant capacity was detected by the ABTS technique (94.9% and 62.6%) compared to DPPH values (52.5% and 52.7 %) for methanolic and aqueous extracts, respectively. The methanolic extract showed a greater inhibitory effect on gram-positive bacteria, with a predominant higher inhibition percentage on &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus mutans&lt;/i&gt; (86% for both). In conclusion, &lt;i&gt;Jacaranda&lt;/i&gt; flower extracts could be a natural antimicrobial and antioxidant alternative due to the considerable amount of polyphenolic compounds, and serve as a sustainable alternative for the isolation of active ingredients that could help in agriculture, aquaculture, livestock, pharmaceutics, and other industrial sectors, to remediate problems such as oxidative stress and antimicrobial abuse.">

Illumina paired-end reads data were used to assemble the complete chloroplast (cp) genome. 16,898,032 raw paired-end reads and the length distribution in 150,602 bp, including a large single-copy (LSC) region of 81,844 bp, a small single-copy (SSC) region of 17,022 bp and a pair of inverted repeats (IRs) of 25,868 bp. Besides, nine protein-coding genes (PCGs) genes and six tRNA genes possess a single intron, while clpP and ycf3 have a couple of introns. Based on the concatenated coding sequences of cp PCGs, the phylogenetic analysis showed that &lt;i&gt;S. dichotoma&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudostellaria palibiniana&lt;/i&gt; (MK309611) are closely related to each other within the family Caryophyllaceae.">

The potential contribution of wild food plants to the nutrition of the Karen and Lawa communities remains poorly understood. Wild food plants, with a focus on leafy vegetables, were ranked by the Cultural Food Significance Index (CFSI) based on semi-structured interviews. Twelve wild plant species were highly mentioned and widely consumed. The importance of the wild vegetables was mainly related to taste, availability, and multifunctionality of the species. Their contents of proximate and minerals (P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) were analyzed using standard methods. The proximate contents were comparable to most domesticated vegetables. The contents of Mg (104 mg/100 g FW), Fe (11 mg/100 g FW), and Zn (19 mg/100 g FW) in the wild leafy vegetables were high enough to cover the daily recommended dietary allowances of adults (19-50 years), whereas a few species showed Mn contents higher than the tolerable upper intake level (&gt;11 mg/100 g edible part). The wild leafy vegetables, therefore, are good sources of minerals and we recommend their continued usage by indigenous people. Further research on these wild leafy vegetables' contents of antioxidants, vitamins, heavy metals, anti-nutrient factors, and food safety is recommended.">

        <span class="abst" title="Smallholder farmers play a major role in crop production towards household food security, particularly in resource-poor communities. Maize is a common crop produced in smallholder farming and it is cultivated from seeds that has been stored and re-used for years. Spoilage of stored grains is a major challenge, which leads to yield loss and poor seed quality. The objectives of this study were to evaluate in vivo antifungal activity of selected plant extracts against &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; pathogens on maize seeds, and to evaluate their phytotoxicity on seed germination and seedling growth. Fresh leaves collected from eight medicinal plants were dried and selectively extracted with water, ethyl acetate or acetone. The dried extracts were evaluated for antifungal activity against &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; pathogens (&lt;i&gt;F. proliferatum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. oxysporum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. subglutinans&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. verticilloides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. semitectum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. chlamydosporum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. solani&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. equisite&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;F. graminearum&lt;/i&gt;) inoculated on maize seeds. &lt;i&gt;Melia azedarach&lt;/i&gt; acetone extract showed strong antifungal activity (97% inhibition) against &lt;i&gt;F. proliferatum&lt;/i&gt; while combined acetone extracts from &lt;i&gt;Combretum erythrophyllum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt; exhibited 96%, 67% and 56% inhibition against &lt;i&gt;F. verticilloides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. proliferatum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;F. solani&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. With the exception of &lt;i&gt;Quercus acutissima&lt;/i&gt; ethyl acetate, none of the extracts significantly inhibited seed germination when compared to untreated seeds. This study showed that plant extracts could control &lt;i&gt;Fusarium&lt;/i&gt; diseases without any adverse effects on maize seed germination or plant growth.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Dactylorhiza hatagirea&lt;/i&gt; (Orchidaceae) is a perennial herb inhabiting sub-alpine to alpine regions, ranging at elevations between 2500 and 5000 m.a.s.l. With palmately lobed rhizome and lanceolate leaves having a sheathing leaf base, it bears pink flowers with purple-colored notches and a curved spur. It finds wide use in ayurveda, siddha, unani, and folk medicine in curing disorders of the circulatory, respiratory, nervous, digestive, skeletal, and reproductive systems, besides boosting the immune system to fight infectious diseases. Secondary metabolites such as dactylorhins A-E, dactyloses A-B, and others exhibit a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities (antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiseptic, anticancer, and immune enhancing activities). Its use as a dietary supplement was found to be beneficial in increasing testosterone levels, resulting in improved sexual desire and arousal. Incessant overexploitation of this medicinally important herb has resulted in the dwindling of its populations in the wild, which has resulted in its classification as a critically endangered plant species. Efforts involving mass reproduction through in vitro (through tissue culture) and in vivo (by vegetative propagation) means are currently being made to maintain the germplasm of this critically endangered orchid. Holding immense significance in clinical research and drug discovery, work on the genomic front (transcriptomics) has recently been carried out to discover the wealth of unexplored genetic information for this perennial herb. The present study is aimed at reviewing different aspects of the orchid to present collective (summarized) information on this medicinally important herb in the present, particularly its botany, ethnobotanical uses, phytochemistry, and pharmacognosy, along with the strategies that need to be adopted to prevent its overexploitation in natural habitats.">

Their function in pathogen-derived infectious diseases has been well established, which has led to the development of small molecule therapeutics. The applicability of ARS inhibitors for other human diseases, such as fibrosis, has recently been explored in the clinical setting. There are active studies to find small molecule therapeutics for cancers. Studies on central nervous system (CNS) disorders are burgeoning as well. In this regard, we present a concise analysis of the recent development of ARS inhibitors based on small molecules from the discovery research stage to clinical studies as well as a recent patent analysis from the medicinal chemistry point of view.">

GC-MS (gas chromatography mass spectrometry) analysis of silylated samples of Methanol-Dicloromethane (50:50) extracts of both plants led to the identification of nine compounds in &lt;i&gt;M. myristica&lt;/i&gt; and seven compounds in &lt;i&gt;X. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;M. myristica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;X. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; had the same minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 0.625 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL on &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. However, &lt;i&gt;M. myristica&lt;/i&gt; had better activity than &lt;i&gt;X. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, while &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; was more susceptible to &lt;i&gt;X. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;M. myristica&lt;/i&gt;. The lowest MIC value was 0.1325 mg/mL, exhibited by &lt;i&gt;M. myristica&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;. Both extracts showed good antibiofilm activity. On &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, at the same concentration, &lt;i&gt;M. myristica&lt;/i&gt; had better antibiofilm activity than &lt;i&gt;X. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt;.

The anti-motility activity by swimming and swarming inhibition on &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; PA01 was low at test concentrations and in both models, &lt;i&gt;M. myristica&lt;/i&gt; showed higher motility inhibition than &lt;i&gt;X. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt;.

We present a large-scale analysis of compound promiscuity including two major components. First, high-confidence datasets of compounds with multi- and corresponding single-target activity were extracted from biological screening data. Positive and negative assay results were taken into account and data completeness was ensured. Second, these datasets were investigated using diagnostic machine learning to systematically distinguish between compounds with multi- and single-target activity. Models built on the basis of chemical structure consistently produced meaningful predictions. These findings provided evidence for the presence of structural features differentiating promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds. Machine learning under varying conditions using modified datasets revealed a strong influence of nearest neighbor relationship on the predictions. Many multi-target compounds were found to be more similar to other multi-target compounds than single-target compounds and vice versa, which resulted in consistently accurate predictions. The results of our study confirm the presence of structural relationships that differentiate promiscuous and non-promiscuous compounds.">

In the experiments with caraway essential oil, concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% were used, and concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% were used with L-carvone. We assessed whether, in what concentrations and after what exposure time the substances acted on &lt;i&gt;S. oryzae&lt;/i&gt; as repellents and/or insecticides. The laboratory tests were carried out at 29 ± 1 °C with 60 ± 5% relative humidity (RH). The deterrence, mortality and abundance of insects were noted after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 24 and 48 h. For caraway essential oil and L-carvone, the highest repellency was not shown in the highest concentrations that were used in the tests but in the lower concentrations of 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively. In all used concentrations, caraway essential oil showed repellent effects on &lt;i&gt;S. oryzae&lt;/i&gt;. The highest repellency (60-98%) was caused by 0.5% caraway essential oil after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 h of research and by 0.1% L-carvone (16-100%). The highest mortality of &lt;i&gt;S. oryzae&lt;/i&gt; was caused by 0.5% caraway essential oil and 1% L-carvone. L-carvone at a concentration of 0.05% did not cause mortality in &lt;i&gt;S. oryzae.&lt;/i&gt; In conclusion, the greatest repellent effects on &lt;i&gt;S. oryzae&lt;/i&gt; were caused by lower doses of caraway essential oil and L-carvone. These compounds do not show the normal relationship described in the previous literature on warehouse pests, in which the repellency increased with increasing concentrations of the tested plant material.">

The aerial parts of European goldenrod have long been used for urinary tract conditions and as an anti-inflammatory agent in the traditional medicine of different peoples. Its main chemical constituents are flavonoids (mainly derived from quercetin and kaempferol), C6-C1 and C6-C3 compounds, terpenes (mostly from the essential oil), and a large number of saponin molecules (mainly virgaureasaponins and solidagosaponins). Published research on its potential activities is critically reviewed here: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, spasmolitic, antihypertensive, diuretic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasite, cytotoxic and antitumor, antimutagenic, antiadipogenic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, and antisenescence. The evidence concerning its potential benefits is mainly derived from non-clinical studies, some effects are rather modest, whereas others are more promising, but need more confirmation in both non-clinical models and clinical trials.">

Natural compounds with antioxidant activities have emerged as a rich source of HO-1 inducers with marginal toxicity. Here we discuss the therapeutic role of HO-1 in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis, Parkinson's disease and hepatic fibrosis, and present important signaling pathway components that lead to HO-1 expression. We provide an updated, comprehensive list of natural HO-1 inducers in foodstuff and medicinal herbs categorized by their chemical structures. Based on the continued research in HO-1 signaling pathways and rapid development of their natural inducers, HO-1 may serve as a preventive and therapeutic target for metabolic and neurological disorders.">

The diets included an unsupplemented control diet (CON) and the CON further supplemented with Hmix, Zn, or both Hmix + Zn. Antioxidant enzymes activities, lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and microelement (Zn, Cu, Fe, Mn) concentrations were analyzed in serum, liver, kidney, and intestinal mucosa. Zinc treatment elevated the superoxide dismutase activities in the duodenal mucosa and ileal TAC. Intake of Hmix resulted in higher kidney and ileal catalase activity and also influenced the TAC of the liver and intestinal mucosa. The inclusion of Hmix or Zn alone into the diet increased glutathione peroxidase activity in the blood, liver and duodenal mucosa. Tissue mineral uptake was not affected by herbal supplementation. Organic Zn intake increased the serum and liver Zn levels and influenced the Cu concentration in duodenal mucosa.

        <span class="abst" title="The subgenus &lt;i&gt;Bryophyllum&lt;/i&gt; includes about 25 plant species native to Madagascar, and is widely used in traditional medicine worldwide. Different formulations from &lt;i&gt;Bryophyllum&lt;/i&gt; have been employed for the treatment of several ailments, including infections, gynecological disorders, and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, neurological and neoplastic diseases. Two major families of secondary metabolites have been reported as responsible for these bioactivities: phenolic compounds and bufadienolides. These compounds are found in limited amounts in plants because they are biosynthesized in response to different biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, novel approaches should be undertaken with the aim of achieving the phytochemical valorization of &lt;i&gt;Bryophyllum&lt;/i&gt; sp., allowing a sustainable production that prevents from a massive exploitation of wild plant resources. This review focuses on the study of phytoconstituents reported on &lt;i&gt;Bryophyllum&lt;/i&gt; sp.; the application of plant tissue culture methodology as a reliable tool for the valorization of bioactive compounds; and the application of machine learning technology to model and optimize the full phytochemical potential of &lt;i&gt;Bryophyllum&lt;/i&gt; sp. As a result, &lt;i&gt;Bryophyllum&lt;/i&gt; species can be considered as a promising source of plant bioactive compounds, with enormous antioxidant and anticancer potential, which could be used for their large-scale biotechnological exploitation in cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical industries.">

        <span class="abst" title="Over the last century, endophytic fungi have gained tremendous attention due to their ability to produce novel bioactive compounds exhibiting varied biological properties and are, therefore, utilized for medicinal, pharmaceutical, and agricultural applications. Endophytic fungi reside within the plant tissues without showing any disease symptoms, thus supporting the physiological and ecological attributes of the host plant. Ground breaking lead compounds, such as paclitaxel and penicillin, produced by endophytic fungi have paved the way for exploring novel bioactive compounds for commercial usage. Despite this, limited research has been conducted in this valuable and unique niche area. These bioactive compounds belong to various structural groups, including alkaloids, peptides, steroids, terpenoids, phenols, quinones, phenols, and flavonoids. The current review focuses on the significance of endophytic fungi in producing novel bioactive compounds possessing a variety of biological properties that include antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiparasitic, antioxidant, immunosuppressant, and anticancer functions. Taking into consideration the portal of this publication, special emphasis is placed on the antimicrobial and antiviral activities of metabolites produced by endophytes against human pathogens. It also highlights the importance of utilization of these compounds as potential treatment agents for serious life-threatening infectious diseases. This is supported by the fact that several findings have indicated that these bioactive compounds may significantly contribute towards the fight against resistant human and plant pathogens, thus motivating the need enhance the search for new, more efficacious and cost-effective antimicrobial drugs.">

The first written records on the plants used in natural medicine, referred to as &quot;medicinal plants&quot;, go back to about 2600 BC. A thorough and complete understanding of medicinal plants encompasses a multiplex of overlapping and integrated sciences such as botany, pharmacognosy, chemistry, enzymology and genetics. &lt;i&gt;Psophocarpus tetragonolobus&lt;/i&gt;, a member of &lt;i&gt;Fabaceae&lt;/i&gt; family also called winged bean, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tuberous roots and its winged pod twinning and a perennial legume rich in proteins, oils, vitamins and carbohydrates. Besides nutrients, winged bean also contains bioactive compounds that have therapeutic activities like anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antibacterial, antifungal, antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity, a few of which already been reported. This plant can also be used as a medicinal plant for future benefits. With this concept in mind, the present review is designed to shed the light on the interests in the various phytochemicals and pharmacological pharmacognostical aspects of &lt;i&gt;Psophocarpus tetragonolobus&lt;/i&gt;.">

Structure elucidation of the compounds was carried out by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS spectra. In vitro enzyme assays showed that the compounds had significant inhibitory potential against hCA I, hCA II, and AChE enzymes at nanomolar levels. Ki values were in the range of 4.07 ± 0.38 - 29.70 ± 3.18 nM for hCA I and 10.68 ± 0.98 - 37.16 ± 7.55 nM for hCA II while Ki values for AChE were in the range of 8.91 ± 1.65 - 34.02 ± 5.90 nM. The most potent inhibitors &lt;b&gt;3g&lt;/b&gt; (Ki = 4.07 ± 0.38 nM, hCA I), &lt;b&gt;3c&lt;/b&gt; (Ki = 10.68 ± 0.98 nM, hCA II &lt;b&gt;)&lt;/b&gt; , and &lt;b&gt;3f&lt;/b&gt; (Ki = 8.91 ± 1.65 nM, AChE) can be considered as lead compounds of this study with their promising bioactivity results. Secondary sulfonamides showed promising enzyme inhibitory effects on AChE while primary sulfonamide derivative was generally effective on hCA I and hCA II isoenzymes.">

The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial behavior of thiazole coumarin derivatives through in vitro and in silico studies. All the compounds showed activity against both antibacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, except &lt;b&gt;5d&lt;/b&gt; . Similarly, the compounds &lt;b&gt;5a&lt;/b&gt; , &lt;b&gt;5b&lt;/b&gt; , and &lt;b&gt;5d&lt;/b&gt; were found to be active against Trichoderma harzianum. The compound &lt;b&gt;5d&lt;/b&gt; of this series was found to have a higher activity with MIC 125 mg/ml against Trichoderma harzianum. Molecular studies showed the high activities of these compounds are due to the presence of strong H-bonding and π-π interaction with their respective targets. A good correlation was observed between computational and in vitro studies.">

Because of its nontoxic grapheme, it is widely utilized in numerous biochemical, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and industrialized applications. The modern SwissADME is a web tool that stretches free admittance to a pool of hasty, yet solid, clarifying models for physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic science.

The binding of p-sulfonylphenoxy moieties to the phthalocyanine structure favors excellent solubilities in water, as well as providing an inhibition effect on carbonic anhydrase (CA) I and II isoenzymes and paraoxonase (PON1) enzyme. According to biological activity results, both complexes inhibited hCA I, hCA II, and PON1. Whereas &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; showed moderate hCA I and hCA II (off-target cytosolic isoforms) inhibitory activity (Ki values of 26.09 µM and 43.11 µM for hCA I and 30.95 µM and 33.19 µM for hCA II, respectively), they exhibited strong PON1 (associated with high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) inhibitory activity (Ki values of 0.37 µM and 0.27 µM, respectively). The inhibition kinetics were analyzed by Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plots. It revealed that &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; were noncompetitive inhibitors against PON1, hCA I, and hCA II. These complexes can be more advantageous than other synthetic CA and PON inhibitors due to their water solubility. Docking studies were carried out to examine the interactions between hCA I, hCA II, and PON1 inhibitors and metal complexes at a molecular level and to predict binding energies.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Laggera tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; Sch. Bip. ex Oliv. et Hiern (Asteraceae), an endemic Ethiopian medicinal plant, is traditionally used to treat various ailments. Previously, the chemical constituents of the essential oil (EO) of its leaves and inflorescence were documented. However, no data about the chemical compositions of other parts of the EOs of the plant have been reported to date. Moreover, there are no previous biological activity reports on any parts of the EOs of this plant. Thus, in this study, the EOs were isolated from the stem bark and roots of this plant by hydrodistillation and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify their components. In addition, antibacterial potentials of the oils were evaluated using the disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide methods were also employed to assess their antioxidant properties. Oxygenated monoterpenes (71.82% and 77.51%), of which 2,5-dimethoxy- &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; -cymene (57.28% and 64.76%) and thymol methyl ether (9.51% and 8.93%) were identified as major components in the EOs of stem bark and roots of &lt;i&gt;L. tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; and the oils, were the most potent in the DPPH (IC50, 0.33 ± 1.10 and 0.39 ± 0.97 mg/mL) assay, respectively. Moreover, the EOs demonstrated appreciable activity towards the gram+ ( &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt; ) bacteria. Among these oils, the oil of the stem bark showed the greatest activity to the gram+ (MIC = 0.625 mg/mL) bacteria. Therefore, the overall results suggested that the EOs of &lt;i&gt;L. tomentosa&lt;/i&gt; may be a promising prospect for pharmaceutical, food, and other industrial applications.">

Indigenously, extracts of different parts of the plant have been used to improve blood circulation and treat allergy, inflammation, rheumatism, and liver diseases. LO is a rich source of therapeutically beneficial antioxidative phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, butenolides, lignans and neolignans. Moreover, recent studies have unravelled the pharmacological properties of several newly found active constituents of LO, such as anti-inflammatory antioxidants (+)-syringaresinol, linderin A, anti-atherosclerotic antioxidant (+)-episesamin, anti-melanogenic antioxidants quercitrin and afzelin, cytotoxic 2-(1-methoxy-11-dodecenyl)-penta-2,4-dien-4-olide, (2&lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-(11-dodecenylidene)-3-hydroxy-4-methyl butanolide, anti-allergic koaburaside, (6-hydroxyphenyl)-1-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside and 2,6-dimethoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-1-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside and the antiplatelet-activity compound Secolincomolide A. These findings demonstrate that LO can be a potential source of antioxidants and other prospective therapeutically active constituents that can lead to the development of oxidative stress-mediated diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, allergies, inflammation, hepatotoxicity, and cancer. Here, the antioxidant properties of different species of &lt;i&gt;Lindera&lt;/i&gt; genus are discussed briefly. The traditional use, phytochemistry, antioxidative and pharmacological properties of LO are also considered to help researchers screen potential lead compounds and design and develop future therapeutic agents to treat oxidative stress-mediated disorders.">

This annual herb grows in temperate and tropical climates, and has a rich chemical composition of biologically active substances and chemical elements. Medicinal plants, and the phytopreparations obtained from them, are becoming more and more popular in world practice as they are used to successfully treat human diseases. Their therapeutic effect is due to the presence in them, of a variety of natural compounds and biologically important trace elements, especially in higher concentrations present in higher doses. &lt;i&gt;T. terrestris&lt;/i&gt; is becoming more and more popular for the treatment of diseases of the human genital area and sexual dysfunctions. The elemental content in the tissues of leaf, flower, and fruit of &lt;i&gt;T. terrestris&lt;/i&gt; was determined by using multi-element instrumental epithermal neutron activation analysis. For the first time, 26 essential and trace elements were observed in the plant species collected in Russia (from cultivated) and China (wild growing). It was confirmed that the elemental composition of &lt;i&gt;T. terrestris&lt;/i&gt; grass varies depending on the habitat (geographic zones).

Kurz (Acanthaceae) (&lt;i&gt;Rn&lt;/i&gt;) is an herbaceous shrub native to Thailand and much of South and Southeast Asia. It has several synonyms and local or common names. The root of &lt;i&gt;Rn&lt;/i&gt; is used in Thai traditional medicine to treat snake bites, and the roots and/or leaves can be made into a balm and applied to the skin for the treatment of skin infections such as ringworm, or they may be brewed to form an infusion for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. &lt;i&gt;Rn&lt;/i&gt; leaves are available to the public for purchase in the form of &quot;tea bags&quot; as a natural herbal remedy for a long list of disorders, including diabetes, skin diseases (antifungal, ringworm, eczema, scurf, herpes), gastritis, raised blood pressure, improved blood circulation, early-stage tuberculosis antitumor activity, and as an antipyretic. There have been many studies investigating the roles of &lt;i&gt;Rn&lt;/i&gt; or compounds isolated from the herb regarding diseases such as Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, diabetes and infection with bacteria, fungi or viruses. There have, however, been no clinical trials to confirm the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;Rn&lt;/i&gt; in the treatment of any of these disorders, and the safety of these teas over long periods of consumption has never been tested. This review assesses the recent research into the role of &lt;i&gt;Rn&lt;/i&gt; and its constituent compounds in a range of diseases.">

Despite its potential, the scientific proof in relation to this plant is still lacking. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase inhibitors in &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;malayana&lt;/i&gt; leaf extracts using a metabolomics approach and to elucidate the ligand-protein interactions through in silico techniques. The plant leaves were extracted with methanol and water at five various ratios (100, 75, 50, 25 and 0% &lt;i&gt;v/v&lt;/i&gt;; water-methanol). Each extract was tested for &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase inhibition, followed by analysis using liquid chromatography tandem to mass spectrometry. The data were further subjected to multivariate data analysis by means of an orthogonal partial least square in order to correlate the chemical profile and the bioactivity. The loading plots revealed that the &lt;i&gt;m/z&lt;/i&gt; signals correspond to the activity of &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase inhibitors, which led to the identification of three putative bioactive compounds, namely 5'-hydroxymethyl-1'-(1, 2, 3, 9-tetrahydro-pyrrolo (2, 1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) quinazolin-1-yl)-heptan-1'-one (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-terpinyl-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), and machaeridiol-A (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). Molecular docking of the identified inhibitors was performed using Auto Dock Vina software against the crystal structure of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; isomaltase (Protein Data Bank code: 3A4A). Four hydrogen bonds were detected in the docked complex, involving several residues, namely ASP352, ARG213, ARG442, GLU277, GLN279, HIE280, and GLU411. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; showed binding affinity values of -8.3, -7.6, and -10.0 kcal/mol, respectively, which indicate the good binding ability of the compounds towards the enzyme when compared to that of quercetin, a known &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-glucosidase inhibitor. The three identified compounds that showed potential binding affinity towards the enzymatic protein in molecular docking interactions could be the bioactive compounds associated with the traditional use of this plant.">

Oncology healthcare professionals may lack the knowledge needed to guide their patients on the safe and effective use of herbal medicinal products, a number of which have potentially harmful effects, which include direct toxicity and negative herb-drug interactions. The current review addresses the prevalence and expectations of oncology patients from herbal medicine, as well as evidence for the beneficial or harmful effects of this practice (potential and actual), especially when the herbal products are used in conjunction with anticancer agents. Models of integrative oncology care are described, in which open and effective communication among oncologists, pharmacists, and integrative physicians on the use of herbal medicine by their patients occurs. This collaboration provides patients with a nonjudgmental and multidisciplinary approach to integrative medicine, echoing their own health-belief models of care during conventional cancer treatments. The role of the integrative physician is to facilitate this process, working with oncologists and pharmacists in the fostering of patient-centered palliative care, while ensuring a safe and effective treatment environment. &lt;b&gt;Case scenario:&lt;/b&gt; W. is a 56 year old female artist who was recently diagnosed with localized hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Following lumpectomy and sentinel node dissection, she is scheduled to begin adjuvant chemotherapy with a regimen which will include adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel (AC-T protocol). She is worried about developing peripheral neuropathy and its impact on her ability to paint, and she asks about a number of dietary supplements which she heard could prevent this from happening: omega-3, vitamin E, alpha-lipoic acid, and acetyl-l-carnithine. She is concerned, however, that the supplements may negatively interact with her chemotherapy regimen.">

Thus, this study aimed to develop an in vitro technique, through the induction and proliferation of calli, for production of plant fresh weight, and to compare the PDMC profile obtained from the plants versus in vitro calli of &lt;i&gt;Phyllanthus amarus&lt;/i&gt;. It was successfully possible to obtain and proliferate two types of calli, one with a beige color and a friable appearance, obtained in the dark using Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium plus 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and a second type with a green color, rigid consistency, and nonfriable appearance obtained under light conditions and MS medium plus 6-benzyladenine (6-BA). In vitro micropropagated plants that gave rise to calli were also acclimatized in a greenhouse and cultivated until obtaining the mass for PDMC analysis and used as a control. While the micropropagated-derived plants concentrated the lignans niranthin, nirtetralin, and phyllanthin, the &lt;i&gt;Phyllanthus amarus&lt;/i&gt; calli proliferated in vitro concentrated a completely different biochemical profile and synthesis of compounds, such as betulone, squalene, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol, in addition to others not identified by GC-MS database. These results demonstrate the possibility of applying the calli in vitro from &lt;i&gt;Phyllanthus amarus&lt;/i&gt; for production of important PDMCs unlike those obtained in cultures of differentiated tissues from field plants.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cognitive impairment, associated with ageing, stress, hypertension and various neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, is a major health issue. The present review focuses on Alzheimer's disease (AD), since it is the most important cause of cognitive impairment. It is characterized by progressive memory loss, language deficits, depression, agitation, mood disturbances and psychosis. Although the hallmarks of AD are cholinergic dysfunction, β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle formation, it is also associated with derangement of other neurotransmitters, elevated levels of advanced glycation end products, oxidative damage, neuroinflammation, genetic and environmental factors. On one hand, this complex etiopathology makes a response to commonly used drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine less predictable and often unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it supports the use of herbal medicines due to their nonspecific antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and specific cholinesterase inhibitory activity. The popularity of herbal medicines is also increasing due to their perceived effectiveness, safety and affordability. In the present article, the experimental and clinical evidence have been reviewed for various Indian herbal medicines such as &lt;i&gt;Centella asiatica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacopa monnieri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clitoria ternatea&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Withania somnifera&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Celastrus paniculatus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Evolvulus alsinoides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Desmodium gangeticum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eclipta alba&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Convolvulus pluricaulis,&lt;/i&gt; which have shown potential in cognitive impairment. Some commonly available herbal formulations for memory impairment in India have also been reviewed.">

However, health awareness has increased over the past decades creating a massive on-going demand for new low/non-caloric natural sweeteners that have a high potential and are safer for consumption than artificial ones. The current study aims to investigate the nutritional properties, in vitro toxicological profile, total/individual polyphenols content, and the antioxidant, anti-cariogenic, and antimicrobial activity of two newly obtained vegan and sugar-free chocolate (VHC1 and VHC2). The energy values for the two finished products were very similar, 408.04 kcal/100 g for VHC1 and 404.68 kcal/100 g for VHC2. Both products, VHC1 and VHC2 present strong antioxidant activities, whereas antimicrobial results show an increased activity for VHC1 compared to VHC2, because of a higher phenolic content. In vitro toxicological evaluation revealed that both samples present a safe toxicological profile, while VHC2 increased cellular turnover of dermal cell lines, highlighting its potential use in skin treatments. The current work underlines the potential use of these vegetal mixtures as sugar-free substitutes for conventional products, as nutraceuticals, as well as topic application in skin care due to antimicrobial and antioxidant effects.">

The rapid spread of this deadly virus at incredible speed has stunned the planet and poses a challenge to global scientific and medical communities. Patients with COVID-19 are at an increased risk of co-morbidities associated with liver dysfunction and injury. Moreover, hepatotoxicity induced by antiviral therapy is gaining importance and is an area of great concern. Currently, alternatives therapies are being sought to mitigate hepatic damage, and there has been growing interest in the research on bioactive phytochemical agents (nutraceuticals) due to their versatility in health benefits reported in various epidemiological studies. Therefore, this review provides information and summarizes the juncture of antiviral, immunomodulatory, and hepatoprotective nutraceuticals that can be useful during the management of COVID-19.">

        <span class="abst" title="7-Isopentenyloxycoumarin is among the most widespread naturally occurring prenyloxy umbelliferone derivatives. This secondary metabolite of mixed biosynthetic origin has been typically isolated from plants belonging to several genera of the Rutaceae and Apiaceae families, comprising widely used medicinal plants and in general plants with beneficial effects on human welfare, as well as edible fruits and vegetables. Although known for quite a long time (more than 50 years), only in the last two decades has this natural compound been revealed to exert powerful and promising pharmacological properties, such as active cancer chemopreventive, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antioxidant properties, among the activities best outlined in the recent literature. The aim of this comprehensive miniature review article is to detail the novel natural sources and the effects described during the last decade for 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin and what has been reported on the mechanisms of action underlying the observed biological activities of this oxyprenylated secondary metabolite. In view of the herein described data, suggestions on how to address future research on the abovementioned natural product and structurally related derivatives in the best ways according to the authors will be also provided.">

Hence, establishment of &lt;i&gt;P. bullata&lt;/i&gt; callus culture is hoped to assist in mass production of secondary metabolites. Leaf and midrib were explants for callus induction. Both of them were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) and Woody Plant Medium (WPM) containing different types and concentrations of auxins (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), picloram, and dicamba). The callus produced was further multiplied on MS and WPM supplemented with different concentrations of 2,4-D, NAA, picloram, dicamba, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) media. The quantification of total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant capacity was further carried out on &lt;i&gt;P. bullata&lt;/i&gt; callus, and the results were subjected to correlation analysis. Among the media, the WPM + 16.56 µM picloram (53.33 ± 22.06%) was the best for callus induction while MS + 30 µM dicamba was the best for callus multiplication. The TPC, TFC, and EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of DPPH scavenging activity were determined at 0.657 ± 0.07 mg GAE/g FW, 0.491 ± 0.03 mg QE/g, and 85.59 ± 6.09 µg/mL in &lt;i&gt;P. bullata&lt;/i&gt; callus, respectively. The positive correlation between DPPH scavenging activity with TPC was determined at r = 0.869, and that of TFC was at r = 0.904. Hence, the &lt;i&gt;P. bullata&lt;/i&gt; callus has an ability to accumulate antioxidants. It therefore can be a medium for secondary metabolites production.">

MO has been used in the traditional treatment of various diseases including cancer. This study aimed to perform bioassay-guided fractionation and identification of bioactive compounds from MO leaf against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. MO leaf was sequentially extracted with hexane, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and ethanol. The most effective extract was subjected to fractionation. MO extract and its derived fractions were continuously screened for anti-cancer activities. The strongest fraction was selected for re-fractionation and identification of bioactive compounds using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis. The best anticancer activities were related to the fraction no. 7-derived crude EtOAc extract. This fraction significantly reduced cell viability and clonogenic growth and increased cells apoptosis. Moreover, sub-fraction no. 7.7-derived fraction no. 7 was selected for the identification of bioactive compounds. There were 10 candidate compounds tentatively identified by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Three of identified compounds (7-octenoic acid, oleamide, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol) showed anticancer activities by inducing cell cycle arrest and triggering apoptosis through suppressed Bcl-2 expression which subsequently promotes activation of caspase 3, indicators for the apoptosis pathway. This study identified 10 candidate compounds that may have potential in the field of anticancer substances.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recent developments in chemotherapy focus on target-specific mechanisms, which occur only in cancer cells and minimize the effects on normal cells. DNA damage and repair pathways are a promising target in the treatment of cancer. In order to identify novel compounds targeting DNA repair pathways, two key proteins, 53BP1 and RAD54L, were tagged with fluorescent proteins as indicators for two major double strand break (DSB) repair pathways: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). The engineered biosensor cells exhibited the same DNA repair properties as the wild type. The biosensor cells were further used to investigate the DNA repair activities of natural biological compounds. An extract from &lt;i&gt;Phyllosticta&lt;/i&gt; sp., the endophyte isolated from the medicinal plant &lt;i&gt;Garcinia cowa&lt;/i&gt; Roxb. ex Choisy, was tested. The results showed that the crude extract induced DSB, as demonstrated by the increase in the DNA DSB marker γH2AX. The damaged DNA appeared to be repaired through NHEJ, as the 53BP1 focus formation in the treated fraction was higher than in the control group. In conclusion, DNA repair-based biosensors are useful for the preliminary screening of crude extracts and biological compounds for the identification of potential targeted therapeutic drugs.">

The classical extraction techniques used to date to obtain metabolites from this fungal species require high consumption of resources and energy and, in the end, prove to be expensive and inefficient, especially on a biomedical scale. The aim of this research is based on the development of an ultrasonic extraction (UE) method for the identification and extraction of biological compounds with high antioxidant activity from the mycelia of &lt;i&gt;H. erinaceus&lt;/i&gt; biomass developed through a solid cultivation process. The extraction process was optimized by varying parameters to determine the best extraction yield of metabolites involved in such antioxidant activity, using the response surface methodology (RSM). The physicochemical analyses were oriented towards the investigation of polyphenols, flavonoids, and the diterpenoid erinacine A. It is highlighted that there is a very good mutual connection between the concentration of polyphenols and flavonoids in the extracts studied and the diterpenoid erinacine A. Also, this study describes an efficient and qualitative extraction method for extracting natural antioxidants from the &lt;i&gt;H. erinaceus&lt;/i&gt; mushroom, since toxic solvents were not used in the developed extraction procedure. This biomass can be used both as a food source and as a possible phytotherapeutic tool in the prevention or treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders that require drugs with strong antioxidant activity.">

These phytochemicals, which are pharmacologically important for clinical use, primarily consist of polyphenols, followed by terpenoids and alkaloids. There are numerous published reports indicating the primary role of phytochemicals proven to possess therapeutic potential against several diseases. However, not all phytochemicals possess significant medicinal properties, and only some of them exhibit viable biological effects. Naringenin, a flavanone found in citrus fruits, is known to improve immunity, repair DNA damage, and scavenge free radicals. Despite the very low bioavailability of naringenin, it is known to exhibit various promising biological properties of medicinal importance, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. This review focuses on the various aspects related to naringenin, particularly its physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties. Furthermore, various pharmacological activities of naringenin, such as anticancer, antidiabetic, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, nephroprotective, and gastroprotective effects, have been discussed along with their mechanisms of action.">

The bioactive compounds were identified as a known styryllactone, (+)-altholactone ((2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3a&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,7a&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3-hydroxy-2-phenyl-2,3,3a,7a-tetrahydrobenzo-5(4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-5-one) (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), a new styryllactone, (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,3&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,3a&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,7a&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-3-hydroxy-2-phenyl-2,3,3a,7a-tetrahydrobenzo-5(4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-5-one) (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;) as well as a new alkaloid, 2,6-dimethoxyisonicotinaldehyde (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;) and a new alkenyl-5-hydroxyl-phenyl benzoic acid (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; showed broad-spectrum anti-bacterial activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as acid-fast model selected for this study. Compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; only demonstrated activities against Gram-positive bacteria whilst &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; displayed selective inhibitory activities against Gram-positive bacterial strains. Additionally, their mechanisms of anti-bacterial action were also investigated. Using &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium smegmatis&lt;/i&gt; as a fast-growing model of tubercle bacilli, compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated inhibitory activities against whole-cell drug efflux and biofilm formation; two key intrinsic mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Interestingly, the amphiphilic compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; exhibited inhibitory activity against the conjugation of plasmid pKM101 in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; using a plate conjugation assay. Plasmid conjugation is a mechanism by which Gram-positive and Gram-negative-bacteria acquire drug resistance and virulence. These results indicated that bioactive compounds isolated from &lt;i&gt;Goniothalamus longistipetes&lt;/i&gt; can be potential candidates as 'hits' for further optimisation.">

The present investigation was performed to determine the effect of &lt;i&gt;Rhododendron arboreum&lt;/i&gt; (RAP) on inflammatory parameters in the animal model. The RAP (100 and 200 mg/kg) were pre-treated for animals, given orally for one week, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Body temperature, burrowing, and open field behavioral changes were assessed. Biochemical parameters (AST, ALT, LDH, BIL, CK, Cr, BUN, and albumin) were done in the plasma after 6 h of LPS challenge. Oxidative stress markers SOD, CAT, and MDA were measured in different organs. Levels of inflammatory markers like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) and, interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as VEGF, a specific sepsis marker in plasma, were quantified. The plasma enzymes, antioxidant markers and plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly restored (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.5) by RAP treatment, thus preventing the multi-organ and tissue damage in LPS induced rats. The protective effect of RAP may be due to its potent antioxidant potential. Thus, RAP can prevent LPS induced oxidative stress, as well as inflammatory and multi-organ damage as reported in histopathological studies in rats when administered to the LPS treated animals. These findings indicate that RAP can benefit in the management of systemic inflammation from LPS and may have implications for a new treatment or preventive therapeutic strategies with an inflammatory component.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recently, increasing public concern about hygiene has been driving many studies to investigate antimicrobial and antiviral agents. However, the use of any antimicrobial agents must be limited due to their possible toxic or harmful effects. In recent years, due to previous antibiotics' lesser side effects, the use of herbal materials instead of synthetic or chemical drugs is increasing. Herbal materials are found in medicines. Herbs can be used in the form of plant extracts or as their active components. Furthermore, most of the world's populations used herbal materials due to their strong antimicrobial properties and primary healthcare benefits. For example, herbs are an excellent material to replace nanosilver as an antibiotic and antiviral agent. The use of nanosilver involves an ROS-mediated mechanism that might lead to oxidative stress-related cancer, cytotoxicity, and heart diseases. Oxidative stress further leads to increased ROS production and also delays the cellular processes involved in wound healing. Therefore, existing antibiotic drugs can be replaced with biomaterials such as herbal medicine with high antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant activity. This review paper highlights the antibacterial, antiviral, and radical scavenger (antioxidant) properties of herbal materials. Antimicrobial activity, radical scavenger ability, the potential for antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer agents, and efficacy in eliminating bacteria and viruses and scavenging free radicals in herbal materials are discussed in this review. The presented herbal antimicrobial agents in this review include clove, portulaca, tribulus, eryngium, cinnamon, turmeric, ginger, thyme, pennyroyal, mint, fennel, chamomile, burdock, eucalyptus, primrose, lemon balm, mallow, and garlic, which are all summarized.">

Three experimental groups (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) received the extract while morphine 10 mg/kg and aspirin 150 mg/kg were used as a positive control for analgesic and anti-inflammatory tests accordingly. Distilled water (10 mL/kg) was used as negative control.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;From the experimental groups, OI400 displayed significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001). In acetic acid induced writhing tests, the number of writhes decreased significantly (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) in all experimental groups. Similarly, OI400 reduced the mean paw edema significantly in carrageenan and formalin induced paw edema (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.05 and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001, respectively).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;In general, the results obtained in this study demonstrated that the extract exhibited significant analgesic and anti-inflammatory potential in mice.">

        <span class="abst" title="On January 2, 2020, The National Health Commission and the State Administration for Market Regulation listed Panacis Quinquefolii Radix (PQR) as a medicinal and food homologous product. PQR is the dry root of &lt;i&gt;Panax quinquefolium&lt;/i&gt; L., which has the functions of replenishing qi and nourishing Yin, clearing heat and producing body fluid. It is often used for qi deficiency and Yin deficiency, heat exhaustion, asthma and phlegm, dry mouth and pharynx. PQR is sweet, slightly bitter and cool in nature, and enter the heart, lung and kidney meridian exerts the remedial and hygienical effect. At present, active components such as saponins, flavonoids, fatty acids, polyalkynes, volatile oils and other nutrients such as amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins and trace elements have been isolated from PQR. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that PQR has the effects of hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, anti fatigue, anti-oxidation, anti-tumor, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective and so on. In addition, PQR is recognized as a health care product to strengthen the body and dispel diseases. It is not only the raw material of Traditional Chinese medicine preparations, but also the treasure of dietary therapy and herbal cuisine. This study not only reviewed the botany, phytochemistry and pharmacology of PQR, but also summarized its quality control, toxicity and industrial applications for the first time. This paper not only summarizes the development status of PQR, but also analyzes the shortcomings of the current research on PQR, and puts forward the corresponding solutions, in order to provide reference for future scholars to study PQR.">

We review and synthesize the scientific literature to assess 50-y global trends across a broad range of nature's contributions. We distinguish among trends in potential and realized contributions of nature, as well as environmental conditions and the impacts of changes in nature on human quality of life. We find declining trends in the potential for nature to contribute in the majority of material, nonmaterial, and regulating contributions assessed. However, while the realized production of regulating contributions has decreased, realized production of agricultural and many material commodities has increased. Environmental declines negatively affect quality of life, but social adaptation and the availability of substitutes partially offset this decline for some of nature's contributions. Adaptation and substitutes, however, are often imperfect and come at some cost. For many of the contributions of nature, we find differing trends across different countries and regions, income classes, and ethnic and social groups, reinforcing the argument for more consistent and equitable measurement.">

The current study is aimed at assessing the phytoconstituents, antilipase, antiamylase, antimicrobial, and cytotoxic characters of the Pellitory plant (&lt;i&gt;Parietaria judaica&lt;/i&gt; (PJ)). Phytochemical screening and procyanidin detection were conducted according to the standard phytochemical procedures. Porcine pancreatic lipase and &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase inhibitory activities were carried out using &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-nitrophenyl butyrate and dinitrosalicylic acid assays, respectively. In addition, antimicrobial activity was determined utilizing a microdilution assay against several bacterial and fungal strains. Besides, the cytotoxic effect against HeLa cell line was tested employing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. The quantitative test results revealed that the methanol fraction of PJ contains 18.55 ± 0.55 mg of procyanidin and has a potential &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase inhibitory activity compared with the antidiabetic drug Acarbose with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 15.84 ± 2.25 and 28.18 ± 1.22 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. Also, it has a potential antilipase activity compared to the commercial antiobesity drug, Orlistat, with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 38.9 ± 0.29 and 12.3 ± 0.35 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/ml, respectively. The acetone, hexane, and methanol fractions have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against the screened bacterial strains, while the acetone fraction has shown anticandidal activity with a MIC value of 0.195 mg/ml. The PJ hexane and acetone fractions decreased HeLa cell viability significantly (&lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt; value &lt; 0.0001) by approximately 90% at the concentration of 0.625 mg/ml. The revealed outcomes showed that the methanol fraction has strong &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-amylase and lipase inhibitory characters. Besides, acetone, hexane, and methanol fractions have broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, while the acetone fraction revealed potent antifungal activity against &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, at low concentrations, hexane and acetone fractions have potent cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity against HeLa cancer cells. Nevertheless, PJ acetone, hexane, and methanol fractions can serve as an effective source of natural products to develop new antiobesity, antidiabetic, antimicrobial, and anticancer agents.">

They can play a role in supporting the immune system and are highly beneficial as resources. Suaeda monoica Forssk is a wild edible plant that grows in Iraq and it's biological activities have not yet reported.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Saueda monoica Forssk bioactive compounds were extracted by a microwave-assisted extraction method using ethanol as a solvent, and its chemical composition was analyzed by GC-MS. The biological activities were evaluated via antioxidant, anti-liver-cancer, antibacterial, and toxicity tests in vitro.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The results of GC-MS analysis showed that there were about 20 bioactive compounds. The most abundant compound was N,N-Dimethylglycine methyl ester, followed by 9,12,15-Octadecatrienoic acid, n-Hexadecanoic acid, and N,N-Dimethylglycine. The antioxidant activity of the ethanol extract of the plant showed a significant IC50. The extract of S. monoica against liver cancer cells (HCAM) showed significant toxicity. Flow cytometric analysis showed a significant induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrested at G1 phase.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The results indicated the significance of the components of Iraqi S. monoica Forssk by MAE method as a potential food supplement in nutrition systems to prevent liver cancer and enhance the liver's defense against diseases.&lt;br /&gt;.">

Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the hypoglycemic and antidiabetic activity of &lt;i&gt;Ajuga integrifolia&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Ajuga integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; roots' crude extract and solvent fractions were prepared. The doses of 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg, and 400 mg/kg of crude root extract and solvent fractions were used on normoglycemic, oral glucose loaded, and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice models to determine their hypoglycemic and antihyperglycemic activities. The crude extract and solvent fractions' effect on bodyweight was also evaluated on streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. A standard drug in all cases was glibenclamide (5 mg/kg), and the blood glucose level was measured by using a glucose meter. Data analysis was performed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21. One-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc multiple comparison test was used to analyze the data. &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Hydromethanolic crude extract and its aqueous fraction of &lt;i&gt;Ajuga integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; root showed a considerable blood glucose lowering activity at all doses. Both the repeated daily doses of the crude extract and the repeated daily doses of the aqueous fraction of &lt;i&gt;Ajuga integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; root extract revealed the similar effect in lowering the fasting blood glucose level in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice models. It was also found that groups treated with the &lt;i&gt;Ajuga integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; at the doses of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg showed significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) bodyweight improvement at the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day of treatment compared to the respective baseline bodyweight, and the diabetic control group showed significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) reduction in bodyweight at the 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day compared to the baseline. This study revealed that crude extract and solvent fractions of &lt;i&gt;Ajuga integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; root possess significant antidiabetic activity which supports its traditional use for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.">

The study was designed to determine the anthelmintic and analgesic properties of the aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;Trachyspermum khasianum&lt;/i&gt; H. Wolff (Family Apiaceae). The aqueous and ethanol extract of &lt;i&gt;T. khasianum&lt;/i&gt; H.

Analgesic potential of the extracts was evaluated using Eddy's hot plate method to understand the analgesic activity in rats (Wistar rats) at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight doses and compared with the standard reference (Diclofenac sodium 10 mg/kg of animals).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The extracts showed a significant dose-dependent anthelmintic effect at the different concentrations (10, 20, and 40) mg/ml, compared to that of the standard drug (20 mg/ml). Also, the results suggested that the plant extracts possess significantly analgesic activity in rats.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The studies indicate that &lt;i&gt;Trachyspermum khasianum&lt;/i&gt; shows anthelmintic and potent analgesic activities. Further research should be carried out to identify the specific phytoconstituents responsible for both analgesic and anthelmintic activities and its possible mechanism of action.">

Eleven compounds were synthesized and characterized by 1H and 13C NMR and mass spectrophotometry. The synthesized compounds were also docked on an HIV reverse transcriptase binding site (PDB: 4I2P); most of these compounds showed good binding interactions with the active domain of the receptor.

There were found thirty two compounds: twenty phloroglucinol derivatives (isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol, macrocarpals, sideroxylonals, etc.), eight ursane type triterpenoids (loxanic acid, dehydroursolic acid lactone, dehydroursolic acid lactone acetate, two isomers of p-coumaroyl-dehydroursolic acid lactone and two isomers of feruloyl-dehydroursolic acid lactone), sequiterpenoid (S)-β-macrocarpene and three unknown phenolics. The major compounds of the LCP were pharmacologically active macrocarpals A and B, dehydroursolic acid lactone and its derivatives.

The present study reports the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activities of &lt;i&gt;Terminalia bellirica&lt;/i&gt; (Tb) fruit aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts and its bioactive compound ellagic acid (EA) against DCF-induced toxicity. &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant activities were measured by ABTS and FRAP assays while anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by the albumin denaturation method. The adverse effects of DCF and hepatoprotective potential of Tb extracts and EA were assessed in serum and liver tissue of rats after oral administration for 21 days. Silymarin was used as standard hepatoprptective agent for comparison. Hepatic markers analyzed in serum included ALP, GPT, GOT, LDH, γ-glutamyl transferase, total protein, creatinine, and uric acid while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were analyzed in liver tissue. The EA exhibited superior ABTS radical scavenging, FRAP, and anti-inflammatory activities as compared to fruit extracts. DCF treatment led to rise in the levels of most of the serum hepatic markers with decline in total serum protein as well as SOD and CAT in liver tissue. The supplementation of extracts, EA and silymarin in DCF treated rats significantly reduced the adverse effects of DCF on serum and tissue markers. Histopathology of the liver indicated that extracts and EA significantly decreased the degree of liver fibrosis. The hepatoprotective ability of EA was comparable to the silymarin but activity of Tb fruit extracts was little lower. Among fruit extracts ethyl acetate extract exhibited better activity than aqueous extract. The results revealed that ellagic acid and &lt;i&gt;T. bellirica&lt;/i&gt; fruit extracts have potential to mitigate oxidative stress and hepatotoxicity produced by long term use of diclofenac.">

        <span class="abst" title="Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 19) pandemic, researchers have been trying to investigate several active compounds found in plants that have the potential to inhibit the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The present study aimed to evaluate bioactive compounds found in plants using a molecular docking approach to inhibit the main protease (M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;) and spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. The evaluation was performed on the docking scores calculated using AutoDock Vina (AV) as a docking engine. A rule of five (Ro5) was calculated to determine whether a compound meets the criteria as an active drug orally in humans. The determination of the docking score was performed by selecting the best conformation of the protein-ligand complex that had the highest affinity (most negative Gibbs' free energy of binding/Δ&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;). As a comparison, nelfinavir (an antiretroviral drug), chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate (antimalarial drugs recommended by the FDA as emergency drugs) were used. The results showed that hesperidin, nabiximols, pectolinarin, epigallocatechin gallate, and rhoifolin had better poses than nelfinavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as spike glycoprotein inhibitors. Hesperidin, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, and nabiximols had about the same pose as nelfinavir but were better than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate as M&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; inhibitors. This finding implied that several natural compounds of plants evaluated in this study showed better binding free energy compared to nelfinavir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which so far are recommended in the treatment of COVID-19. From quantum chemical DFT calculations, the ascending order of chemical reactivity of selected compounds was pectolinarin &gt; hesperidin &gt; rhoifolin &gt; morin &gt; epigallocatechin gallate. All isolated compounds' C=O regions are preferable for an electrophilic attack, and O-H regions are suitable for a nucleophilic attack. Furthermore, Homo-Lumo and global descriptor values indicated a satisfactory remarkable profile for the selected compounds. As judged by the RO5 and previous study by others, the compounds kaempferol, herbacetin, eugenol, and 6-shogaol have good oral bioavailability, so they are also seen as promising candidates for the development of drugs to treat infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. The present study identified plant-based compounds that can be further investigated in vitro and in vivo as lead compounds against SARS-CoV-2.">

Follow-up data were taken up to day 21. Different morphological characteristics of the wound and wound contraction (length and width) were recorded weekly. Samples were collected on days 1, 2, and 3 to test the antimicrobial effects and on days 1, 3, and 7 for histopathological studies.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Treatment with marigold leaf paste and turmeric paste resulted in a swelled wound area of 11.78 ± 0.38 mm and 11.52 ± 0.27 mm, respectively. The wound areas were comparatively lower than that of the control group (11.44 ± 0.20 mm). Moreover, the least elevation (2.44 ± 0.12 mm) of the sutured line from the skin surface was noted and compared between the marigold leaf paste and normal saline (2.74 ± 0.13 mm). Bacterial colonies in the nutrient agar medium cultured with swabs from the normal saline-treated group's wound area were found on day 1. On the contrary, bacterial colonies were absent on days 2 and 3 of treatment in the groups treated with both the paste of marigold leaves and turmeric. Less intense tissue reactions and higher keratinization of epithelium were shown in the group treated with marigold leaf paste than turmeric paste and saline-treated groups.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Marigold leaf paste showed less tissue reaction and healed the wounds effectively. Thus, this paste could be used for the treatment of superficial wounds in sheep.">

Polysaccharides and triterpenoids are the two major components responsible for the bioactivity of this fungus. In the present study, the ultrasonic-assisted co-extraction (UACE) of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from G. lucidum was optimized using response surface methodology with a desirability function, with the equal importance for the two components. Following single factor experiments, the optimal conditions were determine as ultrasonic power of 210 W, extraction temperature of 80C, ratio of liquid to solid of 50 mL/g, and 100 min extraction time, using aqueous ethanol (50%, v/v) as the extracting solvent. Under the optimal conditions, the extraction yields of polysaccharides and triterpenoids reached 0.63% and 0.38%, respectively. On the basis of the scavenging capacity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and evaluation of reducing power, the antioxidant capacities of the polysaccharides obtained by optimal UACE process were higher than those of polysaccharides extracted using traditional hot water extraction, whereas the triterpenoid-rich extracts showed antioxidant activities similar to those obtained using the ethanol maceration method. The present study is the first report on the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from G. lucidum. The developed UACE process could be useful in preparation of a polysaccharide- and triterpenoid-rich ingredient that holds great promise for application in the Ganoderma industry.">

In Ethiopia, it has several vernacular names including Abelbila, Ashenda, Amelmela, Yeznjero Ageda, Shemetmetie and Yezinjero Ageda. The plant is endemic to Ethiopian highlands, where its rhizomes are traditionally used for the treatment of malaria, abdominal cramps and wound healing. In the present study, the 80% methanol extract of K. foliosa rhizomes and its constituents are tested against Plasmodium berghei in mice.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Isolation was carried out using column and preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC). The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by spectroscopic methods (ESI-MS, 1D and 2D-NMR). Peters' 4-day suppressive test against P. berghei in mice was utilized for in vivo anti-malarial evaluation of the test substances.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Two compounds, namely knipholone and dianellin were isolated from the 80% methanolic extract of K. foliosa rhizomes, and characterized. The hydroalcoholic extract (400 mg/kg) and knipholone (200 mg/kg) showed the highest activity with chemosuppression values of 61.52 and 60.16%, respectively. From the dose-response plot, the median effective (ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) doses of knipholone and dianellin were determined to be 81.25 and 92.31 mg/kg, respectively. Molecular docking study revealed that knipholone had a strong binding affinity to Plasmodium falciparum l-lactate dehydrogenase (pfLDH) target.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Results of the current study support the traditional use of the plant for the treatment of malaria.">

        <span class="abst" title="Designing anticoronavirus disease 2019 (anti-COVID-19) agents is the primary concern of medicinal chemists/drug designers nowadays. Repurposing of known active compounds against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new effective and time-saving trend in anti-COVID-19 drug discovery. Thorough inhibition of the coronaviral-2 proteins (i.e., multitarget inhibition) is a possible powerful favorable strategy for developing effectively potent drugs for COVID-19. In this new research study, I succeeded to repurpose the two antioxidant polyhydroxy-1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the first multitarget coronaviral protein blockers with extremely higher potencies (reach about 65 and 304 times, for CoViTris2020, and 20 and 93 times, for ChloViD2020, more potent than remdesivir and favipiravir, respectively). These two 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles were computationally studied (through molecular docking in almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins) and biologically assessed (through a newly established robust in vitro anti-COVID-19 assay) for their anticoronaviral-2 bioactivities. The data obtained from the docking investigation showed that both ligands promisingly exhibited very strong inhibitory binding affinities with almost all docked enzymes (e.g., they displayed extremely lower binding energies of - 12.00 and - 9.60 kcal/mol, respectively, with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase &quot;RdRp&quot;). The results of the biological assay revealed that CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 significantly displayed very high anti-COVID-19 activities (anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.31 and 1.01 μM, respectively). Further in vivo/clinical studies for the development of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as anti-COVID-19 medications are required. In brief, the ascent of CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 as the two lead members of the novel family of anti-COVID-19 polyphenolic 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives represents a promising hope in COVID-19 therapy. CoViTris2020 and ChloViD2020 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 life cycle with surprising EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.31 and 1.01 μM, respectively. CoViTris2020 strongly inhibits coronaviral-2 RdRp with exceptionally lower inhibitory binding energy of - 12.00 kcal/mol.">

Similarly, the extracts of A. indica showed activity against all tested species though at higher concentrations, and higher activity was recorded against Streptococcus pyogenes isolates at all concentrations. However, the extract of A. aspera showed the lowest activity against all tested species except Streptococcus pyogenes isolates. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was recorded with the extract of L. inermis against E. coli isolate and S. aureus ATCC 25923.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Methanol extracts of L. inermis, A. indica, and A. aspera leaves exhibited antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial isolates involved in wound infections, of which the methanol extracts of L. inermis exhibited the highest activity. The results of the present study support the traditional use of plants against microbial infections, which could potentially be exploited for the treatment of wound infections associated with lymphoedema.">

        <span class="abst" title="Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which selectively degrade targeted proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, have emerged as a novel therapeutic technology with potential advantages over traditional inhibition strategies. In the past few years, this technology has achieved substantial progress and two PROTACs have been advanced into phase I clinical trials. However, this technology is still maturing and the design of PROTACs remains a great challenge. In order to promote the rational design of PROTACs, we present PROTAC-DB, a web-based open-access database that integrates structural information and experimental data of PROTACs. Currently, PROTAC-DB consists of 1662 PROTACs, 202 warheads (small molecules that target the proteins of interest), 65 E3 ligands (small molecules capable of recruiting E3 ligases) and 806 linkers, as well as their chemical structures, biological activities, and physicochemical properties. Except the biological activities of warheads and E3 ligands, PROTAC-DB also provides the degradation capacities, binding affinities and cellular activities for PROTACs. PROTAC-DB can be queried with two general searching approaches: text-based (target name, compound name or ID) and structure-based. In addition, for the convenience of users, a filtering tool for the searching results based on the physicochemical properties of compounds is also offered. PROTAC-DB is freely accessible at http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/protacdb/.">

This has led to establishment of tissue transplantation as a successful practice worldwide; however, a great variability between countries remains in terms of donation levels, safety, quality of grafts and their efficacy. Tissue transplantation requires coordination of different agencies involved in the implementation of procurement, processing, storage and distribution of tissues and cells from different hospital units that perform surgical procedures with graft-type input requirements. This biomaterial-like requirement has led to the constant development of the area and today these graft products of human origin can be the starting point for new and more advanced biotechnological products. For long-term sustainability and successful transplantation units, a process management comparable to the pharmaceutical industry in terms of quality management systems must be established to produce safe and high-quality human-derived products. This review aims to update the current concepts of tissue transplant services for its application for developing countries using the current Chilean scenario as a case study. We summarize our findings proposing a set of guidelines/actions that should be followed to ensure smooth tissue transplant services implementations with high efficiency and safe use.">

Due to the ongoing escalation of antimicrobial resistance, there is an increasing demand for the appropriate wound care and hence, the present study was initiated to investigate the wound healing effects of the leaf extract ointments of &lt;i&gt;A. schimperi&lt;/i&gt; in mice and its in-vitro antioxidant activity.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The crude extract was prepared as 5% and 10% w/w ointments for topical use in mice. Wound contraction and epithelialization period were determined in excision and infected models, whereas tensile strength was determined in an incision model. Besides, its antioxidant activity was evaluated using the DPPH method.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In this study, the 10% w/w extract ointment did not cause toxicity at the 2000 mg/kg limit dose. In the excision model, the 10% w/w ointment exhibited a significant wound contraction effect starting from day 6 to 14 with a complete epithelization shown on day 13. Besides, the 5%w/w ointment showed a significant wound contraction effect starting from day 6 onwards, and a significant decrease in the epithelization period observed on day 16. Conversely, both the 10% w/w and 5% w/w ointments showed significant wound contraction effects starting from day 4 and onwards in the infected model. However, a complete epithelization period was observed on days 14 and 18 in the 10%w/w and 5% w/w/extract ointment treated groups, respectively. In the incision model, the 10% (w/w) and 5% (w/w) extract ointments showed a significant increase in tensile strength by 36.80 and 32.23%, respectively. Moreover, the antioxidant activity of the extract was concentration-dependent with an IC50 value of 5.49± 0.38 µg/µL.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The potential wound healing effects of this plant may provide a candidate source in the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of wounds.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recently, the design and development of a modern health policy in the field of regenerative medicine leads to the formation of a new and integrated cognitive field, which requires systematic research and study in order to produce innovative answers and best practices. Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) is a new product category, which is at the heart of concern since it has to deal with diseases in which traditional medicine has proven to be ineffective so far. The aim of this review is to provide evidence for the state of the art ATMPs and their modern applications in the field of regenerative medicine. The ATMPs are characterized by a great heterogeneity and variation in methods of isolation, which cover the entire spectrum from a single intravenous injection to a surgical placement. Clinical development of ATMP encounters specific challenges due to the nature of the product and the limited availability of non-clinical data. The gold standard of a controlled, randomized, clinical trial may not be feasible or ethically justified for all indications, particularly in life-threatening diseases, where there is no satisfactory standard of care. Therefore, the European Commission (EC) took initiatives in order to set standards and operating rules concerning authorization and supervision of ATMPs and on pharmacovigilance in relation to them. The European Union (EU) Regulation 1394/2007 provides the possibility of exceptions. In particular, the &quot;hospital exemption&quot; allows for the administration of an ATMP without a license on certain conditions. Although the Regulation 1394/2007 has led to the commercial exploitation of ATMPs, the reality today, 11 years after its first implementation, is completely different. While the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) has already registered 285 products as ATMPs, only 10 licenses were granted which only remained six (the rest related to products withdrawn). The key players in the development and delivery of ATMPs still remain the academic/research centers and small and medium-sized enterprises; while the involvement of pharmaceutical companies is focusing on recent developments in the treatment of oncological incidents with &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; modified cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells.">

The foods rich in polysaccharides with immunomodulation properties are among the most highly rated to be used as immune response modulators. Thus, the use of polysaccharides obtained from food offers an innovative strategy to prevent serious side effects of viral infections.&lt;h4&gt;Scope and approach&lt;/h4&gt;This review revisits the current studies on the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2, its characteristics, target cell interactions, and the possibility of using polysaccharides from functional foods as activators of the immune response. Several natural foods are explored for the possibility of being used to obtain polysaccharides with immunomodulatory potential. And finally, we address expectations for the use of polysaccharides in the development of potential therapies and vaccines.&lt;h4&gt;Key findings and conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The negative consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic across the world are unprecedented, thousands of lives lost, increasing inequalities, and incalculable economic losses. On the other hand, great scientific advances have been made regarding the understanding of the disease and forms of treatment. Polysaccharides, due to their characteristics, have the potential to be used as potential drugs with the ability to modulate the immune response. In addition, they can be used safely, as they have no toxic effects, are biocompatible and biodegradable. Finally, these biopolymers can still be used in the development of new therapies and vaccines.">

They proved their relative safety with high selectivity towards MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Measurement of the radiosensitizing activity for &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; revealed that they could sensitize the tumour cells after being exposed to a single dose of 8 Gy gamma radiation. Compound &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; was able to induce apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle at the G2-M phase. Molecular docking of &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; in the active site of EGFR was performed to gain insight into the binding interactions with the key amino acids.">

In this study, we investigated the anti-atherosclerotic activity of raw danshen root extract prepared using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) at 550 MPa for 5 min and hot water extraction. This method was useful for elimination of bacteria from cultured danshen plants and for better extraction yield of active principles. The HHPtreated danshen extract (HDE) inhibited proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and induced autophagy that was assessed by LC3 conversion and p62 degradation. HDE suppressed foam cell formation in oxLDL-induced RAW264.7 macrophages; lysosomal activity simultaneously increased, measured by acridine orange staining. HDE also reduced atherosclerotic plaque development in vivo in apolipoprotein E knock-out (ApoE-/-) mice fed a high cholesterol diet. Taken together, these results indicated that HDE exhibited anti-atherosclerotic activity via autophagy induction. [BMB Reports 2020; 53(12): 652-657].">

It is one of the easily found plants used traditionally in treating cancer. In many tropical countries, especially in Southeast Asia, &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; is popular for its edible fruit and medicinal merits. In this study, the complete chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; was sequenced, assembled, and annotated. The chloroplast genome of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; was found to be a double strand ring structure with the size of 196,038 bp that consists of four regions: a large single-copy region of 75,339 bp, a small single-copy region of 3105 bp, and two inverted repeat regions of 58,797 bp. The GC content of the whole chloroplast genome was 39.92%. It was found that 111 protein-coding genes, one Pseudogene, 38 tRNA genes, and eight rRNA genes were annotated in the chloroplast genome, and the total number of genes was 158. DNA sequences of the chloroplast genomes of 19 species which belonged to three families of Magnoliales order were analyzed and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The result indicated that &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Annona cherimola&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Uvaria macrophylla&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Greenwayodendron suaveolens,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Chieniodendron hainanense&lt;/i&gt; had a close phylogenetic relationship. The findings also provided abundant basic data for the genomics study of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata.&lt;/i&gt;">

        <span class="abst" title="The use of plants as a source of sedative or treatment for cancer is reasonably widespread worldwide. &lt;i&gt;Annona muricata&lt;/i&gt; Linn exhibits a vast array of medicinal and ethno-pharmaceutical benefits, attributed by different plant parts. The activity of this plant is regarded to the bio-production of secondary metabolites like alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, and most unique group of compounds, namely, annonaceous acetogenins. Whilst this plant is gaining popularity as an anticancer treating plant, this study was undertaken to verify the plausible anticancer effect of leaf methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;A. muricata&lt;/i&gt; (LEAM). Acute toxicity study was carried to obtain safe dose in mice models using haematological, biochemical, and histological evaluations in Swiss albino mice. &lt;i&gt;In-vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity towards Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites (DLA) and Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cell lines were determined by trypan blue exclusion method. &lt;i&gt;In-vivo&lt;/i&gt; antitumour activity of LEAM (100, 200, and 500mg/kg b.wt.) was evaluated using DLA induced solid carcinoma and EAC induced ascites carcinoma models and its comparison with standard drug Cisplatin. Acute toxicity studies did not exhibit significant variations in treated mice suggesting diminutive side effects of LEAM. Statistical analysis revealed the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for DLA and EAC cell lines as 85.56 ± 5.28 and 68.07 ± 7.39 µg/mL, respectively, indicating better cytotoxic activity against EAC than DLA cells. LEAM decreased the tumour burden in dose-dependent manner. In comparison, with different concentrations tested, treatment with LEAM (200 mg/kg b.wt. and 500 mg/kg b.wt.) significantly reduced the solid tumour volume development by 58.11% and 65.70%, respectively. While lifespan was prolonged up to 51.43% in 500 mg/kg b.wt. LEAM treated ascites tumour-induced mice. This study thus indicates that LEAM possesses potent cytotoxic and antineoplastic activity and calls for more methodical safety assessments and other end-points of anti-tumourigenesis. &lt;b&gt;Abbreviations&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;b&gt;LEAM&lt;/b&gt;: Leaf methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;Annona&lt;/i&gt; muricata; &lt;b&gt;DLA&lt;/b&gt;: Dalton's Lymphoma Ascites; &lt;b&gt;EAC&lt;/b&gt;: Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma; &lt;b&gt;IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; : Half maximal inhibitory concentration; &lt;b&gt;CPCSEA&lt;/b&gt;: Committee for the Purpose of Control Supervision of Experiments on Animal; &lt;b&gt;IAEC&lt;/b&gt;: Institutional Animal Ethics Committee; &lt;b&gt;ARRIVE&lt;/b&gt;: Animal Research: Reporting &lt;i&gt;In-vivo&lt;/i&gt; Experiments; &lt;b&gt;DMSO&lt;/b&gt;: Dimethyl sulphoxide; &lt;b&gt;LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/b&gt; : Lethal Dose, 50%; &lt;b&gt;SD&lt;/b&gt;: Standard Deviation; &lt;b&gt;Hb&lt;/b&gt;: Haemoglobin; &lt;b&gt;RBC&lt;/b&gt;: Red blood cells; &lt;b&gt;WBC&lt;/b&gt;: White blood cells; &lt;b&gt;HCT&lt;/b&gt;: Hematocrit; &lt;b&gt;MCV&lt;/b&gt;: Mean cell volume; &lt;b&gt;MCH&lt;/b&gt;: Mean cell haemoglobin; &lt;b&gt;MCHC&lt;/b&gt;: Mean cell haemoglobin concentration; &lt;b&gt;SALP&lt;/b&gt;: Serum alkaline phosphatase; &lt;b&gt;SGPT&lt;/b&gt;: Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase; &lt;b&gt;SGOT&lt;/b&gt;: Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase; &lt;b&gt;ATP&lt;/b&gt;: Adenosine triphosphate; &lt;b&gt;EGFR&lt;/b&gt;: Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.">

LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and MNLC (maximal non-lethal concentration) were determined. Lipophilicity-dependent structure-toxicity relationships were established. The results clearly indicated that the majority of test molecules are safe for zebrafish individuals and simultaneously are less toxic than an anticancer agent - pemetrexed. The subsequent aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of antiproliferative activity of the most selective compounds. Substantially increased activation of caspase-6 and -8 in cancerous cell lines confirmed the proapoptotic action of molecules examined. Considering the safety for zebrafish individuals, the title compounds as inducers of apoptosis are promising drug candidates in the preclinical phase of drug development.">

An equally important function of this system is the regulation of the expression of many proteins by the transcription factor NF-κB or the apoptosis regulating kinase (ASK-1). Since it has been shown that the Trx-dependent system can contribute to both the enhancement of tumour angiogenesis and growth as well as apoptosis of neoplastic cells, the search for compounds that inhibit the level/activity of Trx and/or TrxR and thus modulate the course of the neoplastic process is ongoing. It has been shown that many naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds inactivate elements of the thioredoxin system. In addition, the effectiveness of Trx is inhibited by imidazole derivatives, while the activity of TrxR is reduced by transition metal ions complexes, dinitrohalobenzene derivatives, Michael acceptors, nitrosourea and ebselen. In addition, research is ongoing to identify new selective Trx/TrxR inhibitors.">

The BALB/c mice (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 72) were divided into four groups: (1) negative control that received base ointment (NCG), (2) positive control that daily received Mupirocin&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; (MG), (3) therapeutic ointment containing 2% ZMEO and (4) therapeutic ointment containing 4% ZMEO, for 21 days. Wound contraction, total bacterial count, histopathological parameters, antioxidant activity, qRT-PCR analysis for expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, VEGF, IGF-1, TGF-β, IL-10, and FGF-2 mRNA levels were assessed on days 3, 7, and 14 following the wounding.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Topical administration of ZMEO significantly decreased the total bacterial count and wound area and also expression of IL-1β and TNF-α compared to the control groups (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) in all days. This could also increase significantly the expression of TGF-β, IL-10 IGF-1, FGF-2, and VEGF, and also angiogenesis, fibroblasts, fibrocytes, epithelialization ratio, and collagen deposition and improve antioxidant status compared to the control group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05).&lt;h4&gt;Discussion and conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;ZMEO accelerated the healing process of infected wounds by shortening the inflammatory factors and increasing proliferative phase. Applying ZMEO only and/or in combination with chemical agents for the treatment of wound healing could be suggested.">

(Lamiaceae) on the effects of free radicals using different model systems. The extracts were characterized on the basis of the contents of total phenolics, phenolic acids, flavonoids and flavonols, and also using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. Antioxidant activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; was assessed using DPPH assay. The genoprotective properties were tested using plasmid relaxation assay on pUC19 &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; XL1-Blue, while SOS/&lt;i&gt;umuC&lt;/i&gt; assay on &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; TA1535/pSK1002 and Comet assay on human lung fibroblasts were used to assess the antigenotoxicity of the extracts. Ethanolic extracts had the most phenolics (up to 236.20 mg GAE/g at 0.5 mg/mL), flavonoids (up to 42.47 mg QE/g at 0.5 mg/mL) and flavonols (up to 16.56 mg QE/g at 0.5 mg/mL), and they exhibited the highest DPPH activity (up to 92.16% at 0.25 mg/mL). Interestingly enough, aqueous extracts provided the best protection of plasmid DNA (the lowest IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value was 0.17 mg/mL). Methanolic extracts, on the other hand, most efficiently protected the prokaryotic DNA, while all the extracts had a significant impact against genomic damages inflicted on human fibroblasts. &lt;i&gt;O. vulgare&lt;/i&gt; extracts are considered to be the most promising in preserving the overall DNA integrity against oxidative genomic damages. Moreover, HPLC-DAD analysis highlighted rosmarinic acid as the most abundant in the investigated samples (551.45 mg/mL in total in all the extracts), followed by luteolin-7-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside (150.19 mg/mL in total), while their presence correlates with most of the displayed activities. The novelty of this study is reflected in the application of a prokaryotic model for testing the antigenotoxic effects of Lamiaceae species, as no previous reports have yet been published on the genoprotective potential of these species.">

The analgesic studies of the plant have been performed by acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced licking tests respectively, whereas the antidiarrheal experiment was done by castor oil-induced diarrheal test. Besides, antioxidant, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, thrombolytic evaluations were performed by DPPH scavenging with phenol content determination, brine shrimp lethality, disc diffusion and clot lysis methods respectively. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; study of the phytoconstituents was carried out by molecular docking and ADME/T analysis. The methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;Millettia peguensis&lt;/i&gt; (MEMP) revealed significant biological activity in the analgesic and antidiarrheal test (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001) compared to the standards. Antioxidant assay displayed promising IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values (15.96 μg/mL) with the total phenol content (65.27 ± 1.24 mg GAE/g). In the cytotoxicity study, the LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value was found to be 1.094 μg/mL. Besides, MEMP was highly sensitive to the bacteria but less liable to clot lysis. Furthermore, phytoconstituents exposed potential binding affinity towards the selected receptors, whereas the ADME/T properties indicated the drug likeliness of the plant. The outcomes of these findings suggest the therapeutic potential of this plant against pain, diarrhea, inflammation, and tissue toxicity.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Viruses cause many life threatening human diseases. Recently, COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health care systems worldwide. As a disease preventive approach and to bring relief to the severity of the symptoms, a infusion termed as Bhabha Anti-Viral Infusion-23 ('BhAVI-23') was conceptualized and formulated which comprised of 23 selected spices and herbals.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;The present study was conducted to assess the in vitro antiviral potential of the formulation, BhaAVI-23.&lt;h4&gt;Material and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The in-vitro anti-viral potential of BhAVI-23 was assessed through inhibition of HIV1 reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as through a novel P1 (virulent) bacteriphage based screening assay system. Anti-diabetic potential was assessed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin and the bioactive volatile components were detected through headspace gas chromatography followed by molecular docking analysis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The infusion displayed prominent anti-viral activity as evident from significant (57%) inhibition of the HIV1-RT as well as through reduction in the infectivity of P1 (virulent) bacteriophage. The infusion also exerted profound protection (∼64%) to non-enzymatic glycosylation of haemoglobin. Headspace gas chromatography and mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the presence of at least 47 major compounds. Docking analysis indicated possible interaction of α-pinene and eugenol with SARS-CoV spike protein.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;This 'BhAVI-23' infusion displayed prominent in-vitro anti-viral and anti-diabetic potential in different model systems. These attributes have relevance as diabetic patients are more prone to COVID-19 morbidity. 'BhAVI-23' opens the avenue for its potential inclusion as a supportive health care system upon due regulatory approval during the current pandemic.">

Due to pharmaceutical demands its lost natural habitat. At this juncture we describe a resourceful protocol for micropropagation of water hyssop plant. Surface sterilized leaf and nodal explants were inoculated on basal MS semi-solid medium added with PGRs; auxins, cytokinins. Highest calli formation from leaf explants was obtained on NAA (2.5 mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and showed (94.22%) accompanied via 2,4-D showed (2.5 mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; 82.43%), maximum calli formation in nodal explants was obtained on 2,4-D showed (2.5 mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; 71.14%) followed by NAA (2.5 mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) showed (62.15%), in internodes explants uppermost calli formation was obtained from 2,4-D showed (2.5 mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; 65.21%) followed by NAA (2.5 mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) showed (52.14%).

Antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity were tested by MIC and microplate biofilm methods on antibiotic resistant bacteria. While the antioxidant activity of the extract was evaluated by DPPH, metal chelating, plasma lipid peroxidation and total phenolic content, the antigenotoxicity and cytotoxicity were established by Comet test and the WST-1 Cell proliferation assay kit respectively. The MIC values were found to be ≥ 125 µg.mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and a biofilm inhibition of 3-5% against only &lt;i&gt;S. epidermidis&lt;/i&gt; was observed. Total phenolic compounds were determined as 23.26 mg/g. The results of DPPH assay, chelating and plasma lipid peroxidation activity were found to be 15%, 3% and 4% respectively.

        <span class="abst" title="Ethnobotanical and phytochemical studies are useful to discover new drugs. Phytochemical screening is an important step in the detection of the bioactive components existing in medicinal plants that are used in traditional medicine. Very few phytochemical studies investigating medicinal plants used in traditional medicine exist in Saudi Arabia. Eighty-five medicinal plants used in traditional medicine in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia are investigated here for the first time. This research aims to screen of 85 medicinal plants used in traditional medicine in Jeddah for the presence of secondary metabolites, and to answer the following question: Is the ethnomedicinal importance of medicinal plants used in Jeddah conform to their secondary metabolite content. Ethnobotanical fieldwork took place in Jeddah from August 2018 to September 2019. Eighty-five different plant species belonging to 37 families were identified. Screening of 85 medicinal plants was performed for the presence of alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and resins using standard methods. The most commonly distributed phytochemical compounds among medicinal plants used were glycosides (82%; 70 species), tannins (68%; 58 species), alkaloids (56%; 48 species), saponins (52%, 44 species) and flavonoids (35%; 30 species). On the other hand, the least commonly distributed compounds were resins (31%; 26 species). All the six groups of secondary metabolites were found in seeds of &lt;i&gt;Cuminum cyminum&lt;/i&gt; L., &lt;i&gt;Pimpinella anisum&lt;/i&gt; L. and &lt;i&gt;Trigonella foenum-graecum&lt;/i&gt; L. It can be said that the ethnomedicinal importance of these 85 medicinal plants used in Jeddah conform to their secondary metabolite content. More research should be carried out on the quantitative analysis of phytochemicals in these 85 medicinal plants used in traditional medicine in Jeddah. Furthermore, there is a need to focus phytochemical screening on ethnobotanical studies to complete research into traditional medicine which leads to the discovery of new drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="The outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to affect millions of people around the world. The absence of a globally distributed effective treatment makes the exploration of new mechanisms of action a key step to address this situation. Stabilization of non-native Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) of the nucleocapsid protein of MERS-CoV has been reported as a valid strategy to inhibit viral replication. In this study, the applicability of this unexplored mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is analyzed. During our research, we were able to find three inducible interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 N protein NTD, compare them to the previously reported MERS-CoV stabilized dimers, and identify those residues that are responsible for their formation. A drug discovery protocol implemented consisting of docking, molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA enabled us to find several compounds that might be able to exploit this mechanism of action. In addition, a common catechin skeleton was found among many of these molecules, which might be useful for further drug design. We consider that our findings could motivate future research in the fields of drug discovery and design towards the exploitation of this previously unexplored mechanism of action against COVID-19.

This study aimed to evaluate proximate, vitamin, and mineral compositions of &lt;i&gt;A. trifoliatus&lt;/i&gt; leaf samples together with antioxidant and anticancer activities of ethanolic leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;A. trifoliatus&lt;/i&gt;. For leaf samples, quantitative determination of proximate composition was evaluated comprising moisture, crude protein, total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, ash, as well as energy. Quantitative determination of vitamin and mineral composition including Vitamin A, Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, Vitamin C, calcium, sodium, and iron was also assessed. For ethanolic leaf extract, antioxidant activity was investigated using oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. Anticancer activity was determined against human ductal, bronchogenic, liver, gastric, and colon cancer cell lines using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method. Proximate composition of &lt;i&gt;A. trifoliatus&lt;/i&gt; was found to be 74.62 ± 0.38, 5.01 ± 0.05, 0.95 ± 0.04, 16.47 ± 0.40, 8.54 ± 0.06, and 2.95 ± 0.04 g/100 g sample, respectively, and energy was found to be 94.48 ± 1.30 kcal/100 g sample. Vitamin and mineral composition was found to be 428.47 ± 3.00 μg/100 g sample, 0.41 ± 0.01, 0.17 ± 0.00, 11.95 ± 0.86, 675.35 ± 46.57, 13.46 ± 0.95, and 4.79 ± 0.15 mg/100 g sample, respectively. &lt;i&gt;A. trifoliatus&lt;/i&gt; ethanolic leaf extract revealed antioxidant capacity with ORAC value of 9057.29 ± 43.08 μmol TE/100 g and FRAP value of 1230.88 ± 19.51 μmol TE/100 g. Its extract also showed cytotoxic potential against all tested cancer cell lines. &lt;i&gt;A. trifoliatus&lt;/i&gt; leaf is a good source of essential nutrients, which had antioxidant and anticancer potential.">

They are sources of phytochemicals that applications for esthetic and healthcare. The aim of this research was to examine the phytochemical constituents and anti-aging potential of these plants. The phytochemical compounds were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The anti-aging activities were evaluated by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sunfonic acid) (ABTS), anti-collagenase, and anti-elastase assays. The main interest phytochemical compounds of ethanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;C. asiatica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N. nucifera&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;H. sabdariffa&lt;/i&gt; were ethanol, 2-(-Octadecenyloxy), γ-sitosterol and hexadecanoic acid, and ethyl ester, respectively. The DPPH half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) results of &lt;i&gt;C. asiatica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N. nucifera, and H. sabdariffa&lt;/i&gt; were 0.32 ± 0.01, 0.34 ± 0.00, and 0.35 ± 0.01 mg/mL, respectively. The ABTS result of &lt;i&gt;H. sabdariffa&lt;/i&gt; extract showed high inhibitory activity at IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of the extract was 0.62 ± 0.12 mg/mL. The percentage of collagenase inhibition of &lt;i&gt;C. asiatica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N. nucifera&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;H. sabdariffa&lt;/i&gt; at 1.0 mg/mL was 78.13 ± 4.42, 85.94 ± 2.21, and 90.63 ± 0.00, respectively. The &lt;i&gt;C. asiatica&lt;/i&gt; extract had a high percentage of elastase inhibition. Consequently, these research results suggest that phytochemicals may also provide a range of esthetic and health benefits. The phytochemical constituent could be used as anti-aging active ingredient for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industrials.">

Thus, quantitative and qualitative analysis of the petroleum ether fraction was conducted by GC-MS. Among identified components, four unsaturated fatty acids had never been reported in natural products before, together with 19 known components. In addition, 17 compounds were isolated and elucidated from other active fractions.

        <span class="abst" title="This study aimed to investigate the potential targets and pathways of qi-replenishing, spleen-strengthening, phlegm-dispelling, and blood-nourishing Fufang in the treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). The composition of Fufang was identified, followed by screening of the active components using ADME. The targets of active components were predicted and screened based on the TCMSP and BATMAN databases and were cross-validated using the CTD database and DisGeNET. A functional enrichment analysis was performed using the ClueGO + CluePedia plugins and clusterProfiler in the R package. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database and Cytoscape. Finally, a pharmacological network was constructed. A total of 27 overlapping targets were obtained after cross-validation. ALB, IL-6, and TNF were the hub genes in the PPI network. The pharmacological network included 59 nodes and 189 relation pairs. Among the 59 nodes, there were 2 herbal medicine nodes (&lt;i&gt;Salvia miltiorrhiza&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Astragalus mongholicus&lt;/i&gt;), 8 chemical component nodes (magnesium lithospermate B, neocryptotanshinone II, heteratisine, daphneolone, tanshinone IIA, tanshinone IIB, soyasapogenol B, and astragaloside II), 27 target protein nodes (such as ALB, TNF, IL-6, NFKB1, APOA1, APOA2, CYP1A1, and CYP1A2), and 22 pathway nodes (such as the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway). Therefore, we found that the genes TNF, IL-6, NFKB1, ALB, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, APOA1, and APOA2 might be important targets of the key active compounds neocryptotanshinone II and astragaloside II. These genes targeted by the key active compounds might regulate inflammation-related pathways and the level of albumin and cholesterol in CHD.">

About 1 ml/kg body weight (b.w) of CCl4 was induced to experimental mice by intraperitoneal way for 14 days. The methanol and chloroform extracts (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg b.w) were administered to experimental animals for 14 days along with standard drug Silymarine (100 mg/kg b.w). The extracts alone showed no evidence of hepatic toxicity but animals exposed to CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; without the treatment with &lt;i&gt;B. Variegata&lt;/i&gt; presented variations in levels of liver enzymes, antioxidant enzymes, proteins and blood cells as well as injuries in liver cells were also observed during histopathological study. However, after the treatments especially with 300 mg/kg b.w of methanol flower extracts levels of liver markers (ALT, AST and ALP), antioxidant enzymes and blood cells decreases and turned towards normal levels. Whereas level of total proteins and bilirubin was improved and damaged liver cells were repaired. The curative activity of flower extracts can be correlated to the higher potential of antioxidants and occurrence of Quercetin and some other organic compounds those were investigated from flower extracts of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Variegata&lt;/i&gt; during HPLC and GC-MS analysis.

It is well known for its health-promoting role in several clinical and pathologic outcome due to abundance of betalains and other bioactive compounds. The purpose of study was to interpret bioactivity of of &lt;i&gt;B. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; leaves (BvLM) and roots (BvRM) extracts for finding natural cure of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs).&lt;h4&gt;Experimental approach&lt;/h4&gt;BvLM and BvRM extracts were evaluated for phytochemical composition, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticholinesterase potential using standard protocols with modifications.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Phytochemicals analysis of BvLM and BvRM extracts depicted the presence of flavonoids, phenols, alkaloids, saponins and glycosides. The IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for free radical scavenging activity for BvRM and BvLM showed that BvLM (DPPH: 2.20 ± 0.72 μg/mL, H2O2 : 0.0519 ± 1.02 μg/mL) is more significant as compared to BvRM (DPPH: 2.312 ± 0.72 μg/mL, H2O2 : 2.668 ± 0.49 μg/mL). BvLM showed significant protection against heat induced hemolysis of HRBCs and protein denaturation (2.322 ± 0.1 &gt; 2.324 ± 0.06 μg/mL) as compared to BvRM (8.572 ± 0.2 &gt; 50.18 ± 1.0 μg/mL).

        <span class="abst" title="Miracle fruit plant or Miracle berry plant (&lt;i&gt;Synsepalum dulcificum&lt;/i&gt;) is a peculiar medicinal plant because of the unique taste-modifying property of its fruit which is due to the presence of the glycoprotein, miraculin. This property has been known for centuries to the people of tropical Western and Central Africa who also employ different parts of the plant in the management of various ailments. Scientific investigations have unravelled several pharmacological properties of the plant which include antidiabetic, blood cholesterol-lowering, anti-hyperuricaemia, antioxidant, anticonvulsant and anticancer properties. Also, subacute administration of the plant extract up to 200 mg/kg was not found to be toxic in rats. Apart from miraculin, other pharmacologically active compounds have been identified in the plant including alkaloids (dihydro-feruloyl-5-methoxytyramine, N-cis-caffeoyltyramine, N-cis-feruloyl-tyramine), lignins (+-syringaresinol, +-epi-syringaresinol), phytosterols, triterpenoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and amino acids. The plant has also been credited with notable nutritional benefits. Proper documentation of available information on folkloric use, biological activity, constituent phytocompounds, and nutritional benefits of ethnobotanicals will go a long way in affording optimal benefits from their therapeutic potentials. This can also aid in the conservation of species at risk of extinction. This work presents an up-to-date review of the ethnobotany, phytochemistry, biological and nutritional properties of &lt;i&gt;Synsepalum dulcificum&lt;/i&gt;.">

        <span class="abst" title="The COVID-19 has now been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. No approved drug is currently available; therefore, an urgent need has been developed for any antiviral therapy for COVID-19. Main protease 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; of this novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) play a critical role in the disease propagation, and hence represent a crucial target for the drug discovery. Herein, we have applied a bioinformatics approach for drug repurposing to identify the possible potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main proteases 3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt; (6LU7). In search of the anti-COVID-19 compound, we selected 145 phyto-compounds from Kabasura kudineer (KK), a poly-herbal formulation recommended by AYUSH for COVID-19 which are effective against fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath (similar to SARS-CoV2-like symptoms). The present study aims to identify molecules from natural products which may inhibit COVID-19 by acting on the main protease (3CL&lt;sup&gt;pro&lt;/sup&gt;). Obtained results by molecular docking showed that Acetoside (-153.06), Luteolin 7 -rutinoside (-134.6) rutin (-133.06), Chebulagic acid (-124.3), Syrigaresinol (-120.03), Acanthoside (-122.21), Violanthin (-114.9), Andrographidine C (-101.8), myricetin (-99.96), Gingerenone -A (-93.9), Tinosporinone (-83.42), Geraniol (-62.87), Nootkatone (-62.4), Asarianin (-79.94), and Gamma sitosterol (-81.94) are main compounds from KK plants which may inhibit COVID-19 giving the better energy score compared to synthetic drugs. Based on the binding energy score, we suggest that these compounds can be tested against Coronavirus and used to develop effective antiviral drugs.">

In this current study we sought to assess the anxiolytic, sedative and analgesic activity of &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; L. leaves extract.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;We first performed a phytochemical screening test of the leaves extracts following standard phytochemical screening protocols. We next examined the anxiolytic and sedative activity of crude methanol (TIME), ethyl acetate (TIEAE) and n-Hexane (TIHE) extract of &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; L. leaves using mouse behavioral models such as elevated plus-maze test and pentobarbital-induced sleeping time test, respectively. Likewise, we evaluated the analgesic activity using acetic acid induced writhing test and formalin induced paw licking test. Additionally, we performed a quantitative analysis of heavy metals content of &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; L. leaves by overnight digestion in concentrated nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Phytochemical screening demonstrated that TIME, TIEAE and TIHE contain flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, phenols, terpenoids and sterols. Administration of these extracts resulted in higher number of open arm entry, lower number of close arm entry and higher time spent in open arm compared to control treatment (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, these treatments decreased the onset of sleep time and increased the duration of sleep compared to control treated mice (all p &lt; 0.05). Likewise, extracts treated mice exhibited decreased number of writhing as well as lower acute phase and late phase duration compared to control treatment (all p &lt; 0.05). The average level of As and Fe in &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; L. leaves was 5.16 ± 0.012 ppm and 2.76 ± 0.015 ppm, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Results from this study support that &lt;i&gt;Tragia involucrata&lt;/i&gt; L. leaves extracts exhibit an anxiolytic, sedative and analgesic activity in mice.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Angelica biserrata&lt;/i&gt; is an important medicinal plant in Chinese traditional medicine. Its roots, which are known as &lt;i&gt;Duhuo&lt;/i&gt; in Chinese, are broadly applied to treat inflammation, arthritis, and headache. With increasing market demand, the wild resources of &lt;i&gt;A. biserrata&lt;/i&gt; have been overexploited, and conservation, assessment of genetic resources and breeding for this species is needed. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome of &lt;i&gt;A. biserrata&lt;/i&gt; and developed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from it to construct a core collection based on 208 samples collected from Changyang-related regions. A total of 132 alleles were obtained for 17 SSR loci used with the polymorphic information content (&lt;i&gt;PIC&lt;/i&gt;) ranging from 0.44 to 0.83. Abundant genetic diversity was inferred by Shannon's information index (1.51), observed (0.57) and expected heterozygosity (0.72). The clustering analysis resulted into two sample groups and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed only 6% genetic variation existed among populations. A further metabolic analysis of these samples revealed the main coumarin contents, such as osthole and columbianadin. According to the genetic and metabolic data, we adopted the least distance stepwise sampling strategy to construct seven preliminary core collections, of which the 20CC collection, which possessed 42 &lt;i&gt;A. biserrata&lt;/i&gt; individuals accounting for 90.20% of the genetic diversity of the original germplasm, represented the best core collection. This study will contribute to the conservation and management of &lt;i&gt;A. biserrata&lt;/i&gt; wild germplasm resources and provide a material basis for future selection and breeding of this medicinal plant.">

In this study, we determined the cytotoxic effect of PPD on human keratinocytes and evaluated the protective effect of &lt;i&gt;Rhus semialata&lt;/i&gt; M. extracts (RSE) on PPD induced cytotoxicity for the first time. We observed that RSE is a strong inhibitory agent against PPD-induced toxicity in human keratinocytes. The results indicated that RSE pretreatment significantly could suppress PPD induced cytotoxic effects, including decrease of cell viability, accumulation in subG1 phase of cells, and relocation of phosphatidylserine on keratinocytes. Also, we found that PPD caused cytotoxicity was associated with mitochondrial membrane potential loss and subsequent activation of caspase and PARP degradation. However, pretreatment of RSE showed preventive activities against PPD induced mitochondrial membrane potential loss and ROS production in keratinocytes. In conclusion, the results of present study suggest that RSE was able to protect the skin from several cytotoxic effects of PPD and could be a meaningful material in many industries using PPD.">

        <span class="abst" title="Intercropping fodder plants with medicinal plants, in addition to enhancing productivity, can remarkably reduce the population of weeds, pests and diseases and for naturally meeting of livestock medicinal needs. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate biological yield, essential oil (EO) composition and yield of sweet basil (&lt;i&gt;Ocimum basilicum&lt;/i&gt; L.) treated with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixing bacteria in additive intercropping with forage maize during the 2018 and 2019. Treatments were arranged in factorial split-plot-in time in randomized complete block design with three replications. The factors were 100% chemical fertilizer (N), N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixing bacteria (&lt;i&gt;Azospirillum brasilense&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Azotobacter chroococcum&lt;/i&gt;), integration of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixing bacteria + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer and control. The cropping pattern factor included of sole cropping basil and the additive intercropping of maize + 25% basil, maize + 50% basil, maize + 75% basil, and maize + 100% basil. The results indicated that the highest essential oil yield (30.8 kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and essential oil percentage (0.75%) were obtained in sole cropping with &lt;i&gt;A. brasilense&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. chroococcum&lt;/i&gt; + 50% chemical nitrogen fertilizer application in second harvest in 2019. In both cropping systems, the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixing bacteria application significantly increased fresh and dry yield and land equivalent ratio (LER) as compared to control plants. In both years of experiments could remarkably vary depending on type of treatment. In both years, eight constituents including methyl chavicol (17.24-51.28%), Z-citral (neral) (8.33-24.3%), geranial (10.2-31.3%), (E)-caryophyllene (1.05-5.64%), α-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-bergamotene (0.53-1.7%), α-humulene (0.4-1.69%), germacrene-D (0.2-1.88%), and (Z)-α- bisabolene (1.16-3.86%) were the main constituents of EO. The highest content of methyl chavicol was found through sole cropping of sweet basil with nitrogen chemical fertilizer followed by sole cropping of sweet basil with an integration of &lt;i&gt;A. brasilense&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. chroococcum&lt;/i&gt; + 50% nitrogen chemical fertilizer in 2018 and 2019. Intercropping system and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixing bacteria can be effective in reducing chemical fertilizer consumption and environmental pollution and achieving the sustainable agriculture goals.">

        <span class="abst" title="The West African country Nigeria features highly diverse vegetation and climatic conditions that range from rain forest bordering the Atlantic Ocean in the South to the Desert (Sahara) at the Northern extreme. Based on data from the World Conservation Monitoring Center of the United Nations Environmental Protection, Nigeria, with ~5,000 documented vascular plants, ranks amongst the top 50 countries in terms of biodiversity. Such a rich biodiversity implies that the country is rich in diverse secondary metabolites-natural products/unique chemicals produced by the plant kingdom to confer selective advantages to them. Like many tropical countries, Nigeria is also endemic to numerous infectious diseases particularly those caused by parasitic pathogens. These phytochemicals have been exploited for the treatment of diseases and as a result, a new branch of chemistry, natural product chemistry, has evolved, to try to reproduce and improve the therapeutic qualities of particular phytochemicals. In this review, we have compiled a compendium of natural products, isolated from Nigerian flora, that have been reported to be effective against certain protozoan parasites with the aim that it will stimulate interests for further investigations, and give impetus to the development of the natural products into registered drugs. In total 93 structurally characterized natural compounds have been identified with various levels of anti-parasite activity mainly from Nigerian plants. The synthesis protocol and molecular target for some of these natural anti-parasite agents have been established. For instance, the anti-plasmodial compound fagaronine (&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;), a benzophenanthridine alkaloid from Fagara zanthoxyloides has been successfully synthesized in the laboratory, and the anti-trypanosomal compound azaanthraquinone (&lt;b&gt;55&lt;/b&gt;) elicits its effect by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transfer in trypanosomes. This review also discusses the barriers to developing approved drugs from phytochemicals, and the steps that should be taken in order to accelerate the development of new antiparasitics from the highlighted compounds.">

The flora is determined by complex historical and environmental factors occurring since the Tertiary period. The originality of this sector is due to the presence of the argan tree (Argania spinosa (L.) Skeels), Moroccan gum (Acacia gummifera Willd), olive trees (Olea europaea L. subsp. maroccana (Greuter &amp; Burdet) P. Vargas &amp; al.), a thermophilic flora adapted to an arid climate with several endemic species. This flora constitutes the final barrier against the desert and is of environmental and socioeconomical interest. Leaves and fruits provide forage material, while wood is used for fuel. Argan fruits are collected for their oily constitutes and for nutritional, cosmetic, and medicinal properties. Additionally, many species of Argan ecosystems are used in medicine and cosmetics. Recognizing its ecological value and local economic importance, the Argan region was declared a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1998. Despite their biogeographical, historical, and socioeconomic value, vegetation structures in west-central Morocco are vulnerable and threatened by human activities. They exhibit high levels of degradation due to increasing clearance, overgrazing, and overexploitation. The area requires high conservation priority and sustainable management strategies for key species and genetic diversity.">

The Docking study was performed by Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE). About 20 Compounds were screened in this study; these compounds were selected based on classification of their chemical origin and their antiviral activity from literature. These compounds might be used to inhibit COVID-19 infection. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this screening strategy, which can lead to rapid drug discovery in response to new infectious diseases. The results showed that many compounds isolated from medicinal plants such as; Gallic acid (- 17.45), Quercetin (- 15.81), Naringin (- 14.50), Capsaicin (- 13.90), and Psychotrine (- 13.5) are important sources for novel antiviral drugs targeting COVID-19.">

Reaction of compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; with aryl isothiocyanates produced thiosemicarbazides &lt;b&gt;3a-d&lt;/b&gt;, which were reacted with ethyl chloroacetate to give thiazolidinone derivatives &lt;b&gt;4a-d&lt;/b&gt;. Pyrano thiazolecarbonitrile derivatives &lt;b&gt;5a&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;f&lt;/b&gt; were prepared by heating a mixture of compounds &lt;b&gt;4a&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;4c&lt;/b&gt;, aryl aldehydes, and malononitrile utilizing distilled water in the presence of catalytic amount of potassium hydrogen phthalate. Also, treatment of &lt;b&gt;4a&lt;/b&gt; with DMF-DMA under solvent-free conditions gave enaminone derivative &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, which condensed with ethyl acetoacetate or acetylacetone or malononitrile or cyanothioacetamide to give compounds &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. Finally, reaction of the enaminone &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; with 2-aminoimidazol or 2-aminothiazol in the presence of glacial acetic acid produced derivatives &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;, respectively. Cytotoxic evaluation of eleven compounds, against MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines, was estimated. Results revealed that five of the examined compounds &lt;b&gt;5a&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5d&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;5e&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;3d&lt;/b&gt; showed potent cytotoxic activities recording, IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values; 0.93 ± 0.02, 1.76 ± 0.04, 2.36 ± 0.06, 2.83 ± 0.07, and 3.73 ± 0.09 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M, respectively, which were more potent than the reference used (Saturosporin, IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;6.08 ± 0.15 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;M). The new products were also examined towards normal epithelial breast cells (MCF10A). All of them showed very good safety profile with different degrees and were safer than the reference drug used. Compound &lt;b&gt;5a&lt;/b&gt; was the most effective against MCF-7 cells and was less toxic than Saturosporin by about 18.45-folds towards MCF01A normal cells. All the new compounds were fully characterized by the different spectral and analytical tools. Herein, detailed syntheses, spectroscopic, and biological data are reported.">

After diabetes induction, animals were orally treated with &lt;i&gt;L. regularis&lt;/i&gt; extract for 4 weeks. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total cholesterol (TC), total triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were estimated. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), caspase-3, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) were estimated in serum. In liver, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) and reduced glutathione (GSH) as well as the proinflammatory cytokines and enzymatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reeducates (GR), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) were assayed. Finally, the degree of hepatic tissue damage was evaluated histologically. Treatment of the diabetic rats with &lt;i&gt;L. regularis&lt;/i&gt; extract markedly reduced the elevated serum levels of glucose, ALT, AST, TC, TG, LDL, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, IL-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, IL-6, caspase-3, NO, and PGE-2. &lt;i&gt;L. regularis&lt;/i&gt; extract also improved serum levels of insulin and HDL. The elevated TBARS, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, IL-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, and IL-6 levels in hepatic tissue of diabetic animals were reduced by &lt;i&gt;L. regularis&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;L. regularis&lt;/i&gt; extract significantly restored the diminished hepatic GSH level and enzymatic activities of SOD, CAT, GPx, GR, and GST in diabetic animals. The biochemical protective effects of &lt;i&gt;L. regularis&lt;/i&gt; were associated with improved histological hepatocellular integrity and architecture. Taken together, &lt;i&gt;L. regularis&lt;/i&gt; has therapeutic effects against diabetic-induced hepatic complications. The restored liver functions and cellular damage might be mediated through free radicals scavenging and proinflammatory cytokine inhibition.">

This study investigated acute and repeated-dose toxicity of &lt;i&gt;E. kebericho&lt;/i&gt; M. essential oils (EOs). The study was conducted in Swiss albino mice. Organ weight, histopathology and clinical chemistry were analyzed. The dose and duration of treatment were defined in accordance with Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline. No mortality was observed in acute oral dose toxicity study up to 2000 mg/kg per body weight. Compared to control group, treated groups did not show significant abnormalities in body weight and most parameters of clinical chemistry parameters and relative organ weight in repeated-dose toxicity study. However, urea, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, and relative organ weight of right kidney showed variations in treated groups compared to control group. All treated groups and control group showed normal histology except lymphocytic infiltrates observed on the kidney with 200 mg/kg treated female group. The current study revealed that EO of &lt;i&gt;E. kebericho&lt;/i&gt; M. could be considered well tolerated in acute and repeated-dose exposure. Further, teratogenic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, and sub-chronic and chronic toxicity studies are warranted.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Enzyme assays have widespread applications in drug discovery from plants to natural products. The appropriate use of blanks in enzyme assays is important for assay baseline-correction, and the correction of false signals associated with background matrix interferences. However, the blank-correction procedures reported in published literature are highly inconsistent. We investigated the influence of using different types of blanks on the final calculated activity/inhibition results for three enzymes of significance in diabetes and obesity; α-glucosidase, α-amylase, and lipase. This is the first study to examine how different blank-correcting methods affect enzyme assay results. Although assays targeting the above enzymes are common in the literature, there is a scarcity of detailed published protocols. Therefore, we have provided comprehensive, step-by-step protocols for α-glucosidase-, α-amylase- and lipase-inhibition assays that can be performed in 96-well format in a simple, fast, and resource-efficient manner with clear instructions for blank-correction and calculation of results.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In the three assays analysed here, using only a buffer blank underestimated the enzyme inhibitory potential of the test sample. In the absorbance-based α-glucosidase assay, enzyme inhibition was underestimated when a sample blank was omitted for the coloured plant extracts. Similarly, in the fluorescence-based α-amylase and lipase assays, enzyme inhibition was underestimated when a substrate blank was omitted. For all three assays, method six [Raw Data - (Substrate + Sample Blank)] enabled the correction of interferences due to the buffer, sample, and substrate without double-blanking, and eliminated the need to add substrate to each sample blank.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The choice of blanks and blank-correction methods contribute to the variability of assay results and the likelihood of underestimating the enzyme inhibitory potential of a test sample. This highlights the importance of standardising the use of blanks and the reporting of blank-correction procedures in published studies in order to ensure the accuracy and reproducibility of results, and avoid overlooked opportunities in drug discovery research due to inadvertent underestimation of enzyme inhibitory potential of test samples resulting from unsuitable blank-correction. Based on our assessments, we recommend method six [RD - (Su + SaB)] as a suitable method for blank-correction of raw data in enzyme assays.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Candida infections are becoming more drug resistant; it is necessary to search for alternative medications to treat them. Therefore, the present study estimates the anticandidal activity of &lt;i&gt;Vitex agnus-castus&lt;/i&gt; (VA-C) leaf extracts.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We used the agar well diffusion method to assess the anticandidal activity of three different VA-C leaf extracts (ethanol, methanol, and water) against three &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species (&lt;i&gt;Candida tropicalis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Candida ciferrii&lt;/i&gt;). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was estimated using the two-fold dilution method and the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) was determined using the classic pour plate technique. The MFC/MIC ratio was calculated to estimate the microbicidal or microbiostatic activity. A gas chromatography mass spectrometer was used to screen the phytochemicals of the VA-C leaf extracts (ethanol, methanol, and water).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;All VA-C extracts ethanol, methanol, and water were significantly inhibited the growth of the test &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species and the inhibition activity depended on the solvent used and the &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species. The results showed that &lt;i&gt;C. tropicalis&lt;/i&gt; was the most highly inhibited by all extracts followed by &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;C. ciferrii&lt;/i&gt;. The MIC values were 12.5-25 µg/ml, and MFC values were 25-100 µg/ml. The ratios of MFC/MIC were two-fold to four-fold which was considered candidacidal activity. Ninety-five phytochemical compounds were identified by the GC-MS assay for the VA-C leaf extracts. The total number of compounds per extract differed. Methanol had 43 compounds, ethanol had 47 compounds, and water had 52 compounds. The highest compound concentrations were: 4,5-Dichloro-1,3-dioxolan-2-one in ethanol and methanol, 1H-Indene, 2,3-dihydro-1,1,2,3,3-pentamethyl in ethanol, Isobutyl 4-hydroxybenzoate in methanol, and Benzoic acid and 4-hydroxy- in water. These phytochemical compounds belong to different bioactive chemical group such as polyphenols, fatty acids, terpenes, terpenoids, steroids, aldehydes, alcohols, and esters, and most of which have anticandidal activity.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;VA-C leaf extracts may be useful alternatives to anticandidal drugs, based on their effectiveness against all test &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species at low concentrations. However, appropriate toxicology screening should be conducted before use.">

On the contrary, similar compounds having short (methyl, ethyl, or propoxyethyl) chains in the ester groups in positions 3 and 5 lack cytotoxicity in the cancer cells HT-1080 and MH-22A even at high doses. Inclusion of fluorine atoms in the alkyl chains in positions 3 and 5 of the DHP cycle decreases the cytotoxicity of the mentioned compounds. Structurally related dihydropyridones with a polar head group are substantially more toxic to normal and cancerous cells than the DHP analogues. Open-chain analogues of DHP lipids comprise the same conjugated aminovinylcarbonyl moiety and possess anticancer activity, but they also have high basal cytotoxicity. Electrochemical oxidation data demonstrate that oxidation potentials of selected compounds are in the range of 1.6-1.7 V for cationic 1,4-DHP, 2.0-2.4 V for cationic 3,4-dihydropyridones, and 1.2-1.5 V for 2-amino-3-alkoxycarbonylalkylammonium derivatives. Furthermore, the tested cationic 1,4-DHP amphiphiles possess antiradical activity. Molecular topological polar surface area values for the tested compounds were defined in accordance with the main fragments of compound structures. The determined log&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were highest for dodecyl ester groups in positions 3 and 5 of the 1,4-DHP and lowest for short alkyl chain-containing amphiphiles.">

Hallier f., an ethnomedicinally important plant, used in the tribal areas to treat various ailments including fever, headache, eye inflammation, rheumatism, dysentery, jaundice and urinary diseases. The present study explored the biological efficacy of the aqueous fraction of M. vitifolia leaves (AFMV) through in vitro and in vivo experimental models. The thrombolytic and anti-arthritic effects of AFMV were evaluated by using the clot lysis technique and inhibition of protein denaturation technique, respectively. The anti-nociceptive activity of AFMV was investigated in Swiss Albino mice by acetic acid-induced writhing test and formalin-induced paw licking test. The antioxidant activities of AFMV, including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical and total reducing power, were also tested. The qualitative phytochemical assays exhibited AFMV contains secondary metabolites such as alkaloid, carbohydrate, flavonoid, tannin, triterpenoids and phenols. In addition, AFMV showed strong antioxidant effects with the highest scavenging activity (IC50 146.61 µg/mL) and reducing power was increased with a dose-dependent manner. AFMV also revealed notable clot lysis effect and substantial anti-arthritic activity at higher doses (500 µg/mL) as compared with the control. The results demonstrated a promising reduction of the number of writhing and duration of paw licking in acetic acid-induced writhing test and formalin-induced paw licking test in a dose-dependent manner, respectively. In conclusion, AFMV provides the scientific basis of its folkloric usage, suggesting it as the vital source of dietary supplement.">

The test was conducted in the microbiology laboratory of the &lt;i&gt;Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal&lt;/i&gt;. The essential oil was prepared by steam distillation, which means that the pressure steam enters in connection with the plant cells and breaks them, releasing the essence and trapping it in drops of water. Cinnamon essential oil was obtained using the hydrodistillation method, subsequently the oil obtained was dehydrated with sodium sulfate and then filtered at 0.22 µm. Then the vials were stored at a temperature of 4°C. Finally, &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 10231 was used as the biological material. Antifungal efficacy was measured by the Kirby-Bauer method (disk diffusion).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;It was found that in the 24-h group the concentration that had the greatest antifungal effect was 100% EOC with a mean of 22.1 ± 11 mm; however, the lowest antifungal activity was seen in the 25% EOC with 17.9 ± 1.6 mm. On the contrary, in the 48-h group, it was shown that the highest antifungal efficacy was also observed in the 100% EOC with an average of 31.2 ± 3.2 mm, but the lowest antifungal activity was in the 25% EOC with 22.6 ± 1.7 mm. Although in both groups, both at 24 and 48h, nystatin was the one with the lowest antifungal efficacy 15.1 ± 1.0 and 19.9 ± 0.1 mm, respectively.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;EOC had a better statistically significant antifungal effect compared to nystatin. Otherwise, on analysis of the results in different concentrations, the EOC showed a directly proportional antifungal effectiveness as the concentration against the strains of &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 10231 increased, compared to nystatin, suggesting its potential use as a possible attractive therapeutic alternative for the control of diseases caused by strains of &lt;i&gt;C. albicans&lt;/i&gt; resistant to nystatin.">

        <span class="abst" title="Patchouli (&quot;Guanghuoxiang&quot;) or scientifically known as Pogostemon cablin Benth, belonging to the family Lamiaceae, has been used in traditional Chinse medicine (TCM) since the time of the Eastern Han dynasty. In TCM theory, patchouli can treat colds, nausea, fever, headache, and diarrhea. Various bioactive compounds have been identified in patchouli, including terpenoids, phytosterols, flavonoids, organic acids, lignins, glycosides, alcohols, pyrone, and aldehydes. Among the numerous compounds, patchouli alcohol, β-patchoulene, patchoulene epoxide, pogostone, and pachypodol are of great importance. The pharmacological impacts of these compounds include anti-peptic ulcer effect, antimicrobial effect, anti-oxidative effect, anti-inflammatory effect, effect on ischemia/reperfusion injury, analgesic effect, antitumor effect, antidiabetic effect, anti-hypertensive effect, immunoregulatory effect, and others.For this review, we examined publications from the previous five years collected from PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. This review summarizes the recent progress in phytochemistry, pharmacology, and mechanisms of action and provides a reference for future studies focused on clinical applications of this important plant extract.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Nymphaea lotus L. (N. lotus) is an aquatic plant with anecdotal reports suggesting its use in the traditional management of cancer. However, there is a paucity of data on the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties of N. lotus in relation to its phytochemical and elemental contents. This study aimed at determining the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic properties of the hydro-ethanolic extract of N. lotus leaves (NLE), and its phenolic, flavonoid and elemental constituents.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The antioxidant property of NLE was determined using total phenolic and flavonoid, DPPH radical scavenging, lipid peroxidation and reducing power assays. The anti-inflammatory activity of NLE (100-250-500 mg/kg), diclofenac and hydrocortisone (positive controls) were determined by paw oedema and skin prick tests in Sprague Dawley rats. Also, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was determined by Westergren method. The macro/micro-elements content was determined by the XRF method. The cytotoxic property of NLE was determined by the MTT assay, on two cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and Jurkat) and compared to a normal cell line (Chang liver). Inhibitory concentrations were determined as IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values (±SEM).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The extract had appreciable levels of phenolic and flavonoids compounds and was two-fold more potent in scavenging DPPH radicals than Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). However, NLE was three- and six-fold less potent than ascorbic acid and BHT, respectively, in reducing Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; to Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The extract was six-fold more potent than gallic acid in inhibiting lipid peroxidation. The extract caused a dose-dependent decrease in rat paw oedema sizes, comparable to diclofenac, and a significant decrease in wheel diameters and ESR. The elemental analysis revealed relevant concentrations of Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, P&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, S&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cd&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The extract exhibited cytotoxic activity on both MCF-7 (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 155.00 μg/ml) and Jurkat (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 87.29 μg/ml), with higher selectivity for Jurkat cell line. Interestingly, the extract showed low cytotoxicity to the normal Chang liver cell line (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 204.20 μg/ml).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;N. lotus leaves extract exhibited high antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cancer-cell-specific cytotoxic properties. These aforementioned activities could be attributed to its phenolic, flavonoid and elemental constituents.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;In Indonesia, many occupations and industries involve a variety of hazardous and toxic materials. The ILO estimates that about 21.1% of the tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer deaths among men were attributable to workplace hazardous substances. This study investigated the relationship between occupations or workplace exposure and the risk of lung cancer in the country. The results will help determine how Indonesia can best mitigate the risk for its workers.&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;This case-control study utilizes the Indonesian Standard of Industrial Classification (IndSIC) 2015 with the aim of exploring the risk of lung cancer among Indonesian workers.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The study included patients aged 35 years old or older receiving thoracic CT at the radiology department of Persahabatan Hospital. The cases were histological-confirmed primary lung cancers, while the controls were negative thoracic CT scan for lung cancer. The subjects' job titles and industries were classified according to IndSIC 2015 and blind to the patient's grouping as a case or control. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds ratios for lung cancer among all sections and some divisions or groups of IndSIC 2015.&lt;h4&gt;Findings&lt;/h4&gt;The mean age was 58.1 (±10.23) years for lung cancer patients and 54.5 (±10.23) years for controls. The majority of subjects (19.6%) worked in Section G (Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycle). After adjusting for age, gender, level of education, and smoking habit, the risk of lung cancer was nearly three-times higher (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.11-7.02) in workers of Division A01 (crop, animal production, and hunting) and two-times higher (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.05-3.46) in workers of Section F (construction) compared to the workers in other sections or divisions.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The excess risk of lung cancer among certain categories of workers confirms the need for improved policy, monitoring, and control of occupational exposure for primary cancer prevention and workers' compensation purposes.">

        <span class="abst" title="The fungus &quot;Fuling&quot; has been used in Chinese traditional medicine for more than 2000 years, and its sclerotia have a wide range of biological activities including antitumour, immunomodulation, anti-inflammation, antioxidation, anti-aging etc. This prized medicinal mushroom also known as &quot;Hoelen&quot; is resurrected from a piece of pre-Linnean scientific literature. Fries treated it as &lt;i&gt;Pachyma hoelen&lt;/i&gt; Fr. and mentioned that it was cultivated on pine trees in China. However, this name had been almost forgotten, and &lt;i&gt;Poria cocos&lt;/i&gt; (syn. &lt;i&gt;Wolfiporia cocos&lt;/i&gt;), originally described from North America, and known as &quot;Tuckahoe&quot; has been applied to &quot;Fuling&quot; in most publications. Although Merrill mentioned a 100 years ago that Asian &lt;i&gt;Pachyma hoelen&lt;/i&gt; and North American &lt;i&gt;P. cocos&lt;/i&gt; are similar but different, no comprehensive taxonomical studies have been carried out on the East Asian &lt;i&gt;Pachyma hoelen&lt;/i&gt; and its related species. Based on phylogenetic analyses and morphological examination on both the sclerotia and the basidiocarps which are very seldomly developed, the East Asian samples of &lt;i&gt;Pachyma hoelen&lt;/i&gt; including sclerotia, commercial strains for cultivation and fruiting bodies, nested in a strongly supported, homogeneous lineage which clearly separated from the lineages of North American &lt;i&gt;Wolfiporia cocos&lt;/i&gt; and other species. So we confirm that the widely cultivated &quot;Fuling&quot; &lt;i&gt;Pachyma hoelen&lt;/i&gt; in East Asia is not conspecific with the North American &lt;i&gt;Wolfiporia cocos&lt;/i&gt;. Based on the changes in Art. 59 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, the generic name &lt;i&gt;Pachyma&lt;/i&gt;, which was sanctioned by Fries, has nomenclatural priority (ICN, Art. F.3.1), and this name well represents the economically important stage of the generic type. So we propose to use &lt;i&gt;Pachyma&lt;/i&gt; rather than &lt;i&gt;Wolfiporia&lt;/i&gt;, and subsequently &lt;i&gt;Pachyma hoelen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pachyma cocos&lt;/i&gt; are the valid names for &quot;Fuling&quot; in East Asia and &quot;Tuckahoe&quot; in North America, respectively. In addition, a new combination, &lt;i&gt;Pachyma pseudococos&lt;/i&gt;, is proposed. Furthermore, it seems that &lt;i&gt;Pachyma cocos&lt;/i&gt; is a species complex, and that three species exist in North America.">

        <span class="abst" title="Medicinal mushrooms are widely used in East Asia for the treatment of various diseases, especially in complementary cancer care. While there is a growing interest in medicinal mushrooms in Western countries and an increasing number of pre-clinical studies indicate distinct anti-cancer and regenerative properties, little is known about their potential relevance for clinical practice. This review aims to provide an overview of the clinical evidence, significance and potential role of medicinal mushrooms in complementary cancer care. Scientific databases for (randomized) controlled clinical trials evaluating whole spectrum formulations of medicinal mushrooms (mushroom powder and mushroom extracts) in cancer patients during and/or after conventional oncological treatment were searched. Eight studies met our inclusion criteria (eight randomized controlled trials, one controlled clinical trial). The medicinal mushrooms investigated were &lt;i&gt;Agaricus sylvaticus&lt;/i&gt; (two trials), &lt;i&gt;Agaricus blazei murill&lt;/i&gt; (two trials), &lt;i&gt;Antrodia cinnamomea&lt;/i&gt; (one trial), &lt;i&gt;Coriolus versicolor&lt;/i&gt; (one trial) and &lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/i&gt; (three trials); all were compared to placebo and administered orally. A variety of cancer entities, outcomes and treatment durations were observed. Study results suggested beneficial effects of medicinal mushrooms, particularly quality of life and reduction of adverse effects of conventional therapies. Also, positive effects on antitumor activity and immunomodulation were reported, e.g., an increased activity of natural killer cells. In addition, results might suggest a longer survival of cancer patients receiving mushroom preparations, although in most studies this was not significant when compared to placebo. Adverse events of treatment with medicinal mushrooms were poorly reported; gastrointestinal reactions and a decrease in platelet cell count occurred in some cases. The methodological quality of most studies was generally unsatisfying and most results were insufficiently reported in several respects. Medicinal mushrooms may have a therapeutic potential for cancer patients during and after conventional oncological care with regards to quality of life, reduction of adverse effects of conventional care and possibly other surrogate parameters like immune function. There is an urgent need to investigate the safety and possible interactions of medicinal mushrooms. High-quality clinical research is warranted in order to clarify the potential of medicinal mushrooms in cancer therapy.">

The compound was also tested for its in vivo antidiabetic potential using Sprague-Dawley rats as experimental animals. The effects of various doses of catechin in STZ (Streptozotocin) induced diabetic rats on fasting blood glucose level, body weight, lipid parameters, hepatic enzymes, and renal functions were evaluated using the reported protocols. The CTN exhibited the highest percent antioxidant for free radical scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS free radicals, and inhibited the activity of carbohydrate digestive enzymes (with percent inhibition values: 79 ± 1.5% α-amylase and 80 ± 1.1% α-glucosidase). Administration CTN and standard glibenclamide significantly decreased the fasting blood glucose level and increased the body weight in STZ-induced diabetic rats. CTN significantly decreased the different lipid parameters, hepatic, and renal function enzyme levels along with Hb1c level in diabetic rats, while significantly increasing the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level with values comparable to the standard glibenclamide. Further, the altered levels of glutathione and lipid peroxides of liver and kidney tissues were restored (by CTN) to levels similar to the control group. CTN significantly increased the antioxidant enzyme activities, total content of reduced glutathione, and reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in rat liver and kidney tissues homogenates, and also corrected the histopathological abnormalities, suggesting its antioxidant potential.">

They are considered a waste product resulting from guava cultivation. The leaves are very rich in essential oils (EOs) and volatiles. This work represents the detailed comparative chemical profiles of EOs derived from the leaves of six guava varieties cultivated in Egypt, including Red Malaysian (RM), El-Qanater (EQ), White Indian (WI), Early (E), El-Sabahya El-Gedida (ESEG), and Red Indian (RI), cultivated on the same farm in Egypt. The EOs from the leaves of guava varieties were extracted by hydro-distillation and analyzed with GC-MS. The EOs were categorized in a holistic manner using chemometric tools. The hydro-distillation of the samples yielded 0.11-0.48% of the EO (&lt;i&gt;v/w&lt;/i&gt;). The GC-MS analysis of the extracted EOs showed the presence of 38 identified compounds from the six varieties. The sesquiterpene compounds were recorded as main compounds of E, EQ, ESEG, RI, and WI varieties, while the RM variety attained the highest content of monoterpenes (56.87%). The sesquiterpenes, &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene (11.21-43.20%), and globulol (76.17-26.42%) were detected as the major compounds of all studied guava varieties, while &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-nerolidol (0.53-10.14) was reported as a plentiful compound in all of the varieties except for the RM variety. A high concentration of D-limonene was detected in the EOs of the RM (33.96%), WI (27.04%), and ESEG (9.10%) varieties. These major compounds were consistent with those reported for other genotypes from different countries. Overall, the EOs' composition and the chemometric analysis revealed substantial variations among the studied varieties that might be ascribed to genetic variability, considering the stability of the cultivation and climate conditions. Therefore, this chemical polymorphism of the studied varieties supports that these varieties could be considered as genotypes of &lt;i&gt;P. guajava&lt;/i&gt;. It is worth mentioning here that the EOs, derived from leaves considered to be agricultural waste, of the studied varieties showed that they are rich in biologically active compounds, particularly &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-caryophyllene, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-nerolidol, globulol, and D-limonene. These could be considered as added value for pharmacological and industrial applications. Further study is recommended to confirm the chemical variations of the studied varieties at a molecular level, as well as their possible medicinal and industrial uses.">

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of &lt;i&gt;Allium senescens&lt;/i&gt; L. (A.S.) extract on cell survival and IL-2-mediated inflammation in human T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) Jurkat cells. Our results showed that A.S. extract induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of Jurkat cells with no significant cytotoxicity in the normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A.S. extract induced ROS generation through the activation of MAPK p38 phosphorylation. It also inhibited IL-2 mRNA expression and NF-κB signaling mediated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and phytohemagglutinin. Combined treatment with A.S. extract and axitinib/dovitinib exerted enhanced inhibitory effects on T-ALL cell growth and IL-2 production. These results provide novel information on the potential use of A.S. extract as a therapeutic herbal agent for the treatment and prevention of T-ALL.">

        <span class="abst" title="The green biosynthesis of nanoparticles by plant extracts is an attractive and promising technique for medicinal applications. In the current study, we chose one of the daisy plants, &lt;i&gt;Aaronsohnia factorovskyi&lt;/i&gt; (which grows in the Najd region, Saudi Arabia), to investigate its anti-microbial efficacy, in combination with silver nanoparticles. The biosynthesized nanoparticles were evaluated for antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;subtilis&lt;/i&gt; (Gram-positive), &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli,&lt;/i&gt; (Gram-negative) using the disc diffusion method, while the antifungal activity was assessed against &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Helminthosporium&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;rostratum, and Alternaria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;alternata.&lt;/i&gt; The potential phytoconstituents of the plant extracts were identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques, the Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, and Zeta potential analysis. The current study revealed the ability of the tested plant extract to convert silver ions to silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 104-140 nm. Biogenic &lt;i&gt;Aaronsohnia factorovskyi&lt;/i&gt;-silver nanoparticles (AF-AgNPs) showed significant antibacterial activity against &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; with inhibition zone diameter to 19.00 ± 2.94 mm, and antifungal activity against &lt;i&gt;Fusarium solani,&lt;/i&gt; which reduced the growth of fungal yarn to 1.5 mm. The innovation of the present study is that the green synthesis of NPs, which is simple, cost-effective, provides stable nano-materials, and can be an alternative for the large-scale synthesis of silver nanoparticles.">

Such broad effects are achieved by the taro health-influencing compounds displaying antitumoral, antimutagenic, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-hyperglycemic, and anti-hyperlipidemic activities. Taro bioactivities are attributed to the combination of tarin, taro-4-I polysaccharide, taro polysaccharides 1 and 2 (TPS-1 and TPS-2), A-1/B-2 α-amylase inhibitors, monogalactosyldiacylglycerols (MGDGs), digalactosyldiacylglycerols (DGDGs), polyphenols, and nonphenolic antioxidants. Most of these compounds have been purified and successfully challenged in vitro and in vivo, proving their involvement in the aforementioned activities. Although these health-promoting effects have been recognized since ancient times, as well as other valuable features of taro for food profit, such as hypo-allergenicity, gluten-free, and carbohydrates with medium-glycemic index, taro crop remains underexploited. The popularization of taro intake should be considered a dietary intervention strategy to be applied to improve the overall health status of the organism and as supportive therapy to manage tumorigenesis.">

In this study, a five-step polarity-stepwise elution counter-current chromatography (CCC) was developed using methanol/water (1:5, &lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) as the stationary phase and different ratios of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane, ethyl acetate, and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-butanol as mobile phases to separate the compounds from the 70% methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;M. volcanica,&lt;/i&gt; by which six compounds with a wide range of polarities were separated in a single run of CCC and were identified as gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, 4,4'-dihydroxy-3,3'-imino-di-benzoic acid, rutin, quercitrin, and quercetin. Then, two compounds from the fractions of stepwise elution CCC were separated using conventional high-speed CCC, pH-zone-refining CCC, and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography, and identified as shikimic acid and miquelianin. These compounds are reported from &lt;i&gt;M. volcanica&lt;/i&gt; for the first time. Notably, except for shikimic acid, all other compounds showed anti-diabetic potentials via antioxidant, antiglycation, and aldose reductase inhibition. The results suggest that the polarity-stepwise elution CCC can be used to efficiently separate or fractionate compounds with a wide range of polarities from natural products. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;M. volcanica&lt;/i&gt; and its bioactive compounds are potent anti-diabetic agents.">

As antidiabetic activity, the alcoholic extract exerted the most inhibition on the activity of yeast α-glucosidase, with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 76.8 µg/mL. The &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane fraction showed cytotoxic activity against hepatocarcinoma (HepG-2), breast carcinoma (MCF-7), and prostate carcinoma (PC-3) cell lines with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 51.8, 90.8 and 62.2 µg/mL, respectively.

        <span class="abst" title="The negative impact that oxidative stress has on health is currently known. The complex mechanism of free radicals initiates a series of chain reactions that contribute to the evolution or development of different degenerative disorders. Likewise, these disorders are usually accompanied by inflammatory processes and, therefore, pain. In this sense, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to promote the nociceptive process, but effective treatment of pain and inflammation still represents a challenge. Over time, it has been learned that there is no single way to relieve pain, and as long as there are no other alternatives, the trend will continue to apply multidisciplinary management, such as promote the traditional use of the &lt;i&gt;Erythrina&lt;/i&gt; genus to manage pain and inflammation. In this sense, the &lt;i&gt;Erythrina&lt;/i&gt; genus produces a wide range of secondary metabolites, including flavanones, isoflavones, isoflavones, and pterocarpans; these compounds are characterized by their antioxidant activity. Phenolic compounds have demonstrated their ability to suppress pro-oxidants and inhibit inflammatory signaling pathways such as MAPK, AP1, and NFκB. Although there is preclinical evidence supporting its use, the pharmacological effect mechanisms are not entirely clear. Nowadays, there is a fast advancement in knowledge of the disciplines related to drug discovery, but most of nature's medicinal potential has not yet been harnessed. This review analyzes the decisive role that the &lt;i&gt;Erythrina&lt;/i&gt; genus could play in managing inflammatory pain mediated by its compounds and its uses as an antioxidant.">

(Ecuador) were chemically characterized through gas-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detector (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array-mass spectrometry detectors (HPLC-DAD-MS) and studied for their in vitro biological activity. The radical scavenger activity, performed by spectrophotometric 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays, highlighted significant IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values for the EO, extracts and their main constituents (eugenol and rosmarinic acid). EO (and eugenol) showed noteworthy activity against &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas syringae&lt;/i&gt; pv. &lt;i&gt;syringae&lt;/i&gt; and a moderate effect against clinical &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; strains, with possible synergism in association to fluconazole against the latter microorganisms. The extracts and pure molecules exhibited weak cytotoxic activity against the HaCat cell line and no mutagenicity against &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; TA98 and TA100 strains, giving indication of safety. Instead, EO showed a weak activity against adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549). The above-mentioned evidence leads us to suggest a potential use of the crude drug, extracts, and EO in cosmetic formulation and food supplements as antioxidant agents. In addition, EO may also have a possible application in plant protection and anti-&lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; formulations.">

In Ayurveda point of view, COVID-19 is a &lt;i&gt;Janapadodhwamsa vikara&lt;/i&gt; (epidemic disease), a situation where the environment-air, water, land, and seasons-is vitiated, causing a simultaneous manifestation of a disease among large populations. The aim of this study is to identify the active compounds of selected Ayurveda medicines recommended for COVID-19.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The selected preparations are traditionally recommended for the management of various kinds of fever including the infectious ones and to enhance the immunity. HPTLC analysis of the same showed presence of many active molecules like umbelliferone, scopoletin, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, piperine, curcumin, berberine, and palmatine.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The study provided valuable scientific data regarding the active ingredients of the selected medicines with proven therapeutic potentials like anti-viral, immunomodulatory, and anti-inflammatory activities.">

Ayurveda, the age old practice of treating human ailments in India, can be considered against SARS-CoV-2. Attempt was made to provide preliminary evidences for interaction of 35 phytochemicals from two plants (&lt;i&gt;Phyllanthus amarus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Andrographis paniculata&lt;/i&gt; used in Ayurveda&lt;i&gt;)&lt;/i&gt; with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (open &amp; closed state S protein, 3CLpro, PLpro and RdRp) through in silico docking analysis. The nucleotide analogue remdesivir, being used in treatment of SARS-CoV-2, was used as a positive control. The results revealed that 18 phytochemicals from &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; and 14 phytochemicals from &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt; shown binding energy affinity/dock score &lt; - 6.0 kcal/mol, which is considered as minimum threshold for any compound to be used for drug development. Phytochemicals used for docking studies in the current study from &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt; showed binding affinity up to - 9.10 kcal/mol and - 10.60 kcal/mol, respectively. There was no significant difference in the binding affinities of these compounds with closed and open state S protein. Further, flavonoids (astragalin, kaempferol, quercetin, quercetin-3-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-glucoside and quercetin) and tannins (corilagin, furosin and geraniin) present in &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; have shown more binding affinity (up to - 10.60 kcal/mol) than remdesivir (up to - 9.50 kcal/mol). The pharmacokinetic predictions suggest that compounds from the two plants species studied in the current study are found to be non-carcinogenic, water soluble and biologically safe. The phytochemicals present in the extracts of &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt; might have synergistic effect with action on multiple target sites of SARS-CoV-2. The information generated here might serve as preliminary evidence for anti SARS-CoV-2 activity of phytochemicals present from &lt;i&gt;P. amarus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. paniculata&lt;/i&gt; and the potential of Ayurveda medicine in combating the virus.&lt;h4&gt;Supplementary information&lt;/h4&gt;The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-020-02578-7.">

Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were detected. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with NHJ and SHJ extracts (50, 100 or 200 μg/mL) for 24 h, followed by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL, 20 μg/mL) for 2 h &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.

SHJ (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=19.9 mg/mL) suppressed HUVEC growth stronger than NHJ (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=186.7 mg/mL).

A group of healthy rats served as normal control. The femoral bones were excised and scanned &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) for histomorphometric analysis. The serum levels of insulin, oxidative stress, and bone turnover markers were determined by ELISA assays.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Treatment of diabetic rats with &lt;i&gt;F. deltoidea&lt;/i&gt; could significantly increase bone mineral density (BMD) (from 526.98 ± 11.87 to 637.74 ± 3.90).

The oral treatment of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity of 3 g/kg using three different concentrations of &lt;i&gt;P. odoratissimus&lt;/i&gt; (300, 600 and 900 mg/kg), and silymarin (200 mg/kg) groups were administered once a day for 14 days. Enzyme activities and protein levels in serum were determined in rats at the end of the treatments. The histopathology of rat livers was observed under an electron microscope with 10× magnification.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pandanus odoratissimus&lt;/i&gt; significantly decreased the serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activities in induced-paracetamol rat serum (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Moreover, &lt;i&gt;P. odoratissimus&lt;/i&gt; significantly decreased total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). It significantly blocked the decline of serum albumin and protein levels (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05). Histopathological changes amplified paracetamol-induced liver damage and the hepatoprotective effect of &lt;i&gt;P. odoratissimus&lt;/i&gt; in the liver.&lt;h4&gt;Discussion and conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pandanus odoratissimus&lt;/i&gt; improved the hepatoprotective effect in a concentration-dependent manner by reducing related hepatic enzyme and protein markers, suggesting as a useful agent in hepatotoxicity treatment, and it can be generalized to a broader study population in different hepatotoxic animal models.">

Moreover, the target hybrids were examined against six bronchitis causing-bacteria. Most derivatives exhibited excellent antibacterial activity. K. pneumonia emerged as the most sensitive strain with MIC range: 0.49-7.81 µg/mL.

Particularly, the tested NPs are generated from the NPFF precursor (pro-NPFF (A)): NPFF (FLFQPQRF) and NPAF (AGEGLSSPFWSLAAPQRF). The results show that IDE is able to cleave NPFF and NPAF, generating specific cryptic peptides. As IDE is also responsible for the processing of many other peptides in the brain (amyloid beta protein among the others), we have also performed competitive degradation assays using mixtures of insulin and the above mentioned NPs. Data show that insulin is able to slow down the degradation of both NPs tested, whereas, surprisingly, NPAF is able to accelerate insulin degradation, hinting IDE as the possible link responsible of the mutual influence between insulin and NPs metabolism.">

Compounds and standard drugs (doxorubicin, staurosporine and vandetanib) were tested on three human lung cancer cell lines A549, HCC827 and NCI-H358. We tested compounds in MTS citotoxicity assay and in BrdU proliferative assay performed on 2 D and 3 D assay format. Because benzmidazole scaffold is similar to natural purines, we tested the most active compounds for ability to induce cell apoptosis of A549 by binding to DNA in comparison with doxorubicin and saturosporine. Additionally, the ADME properties of the most active benzothiazole/benzimidazole and non-active compounds were determined to see if the different ADME properties are the cause of different activity in 2 D and 3 D assays, as well as to see if the tested active compounds have drug like properties and potency for further profilation. ADME characterisation included solubility, lipophilicity, permeability, metabolic stability and binding to plasma proteins. In general, the benzothiazole derivatives were more active in comparison to their benzimidazole analogues. The exception was 2-phenyl substituted benzimidazole &lt;b&gt;6a&lt;/b&gt; being active with very pronounced activity especially towards HCC827 cells. All active compounds have similar mode of action on A549 cell line as standard compound doxorubicin, which binds to nucleic acids with the DNA double helix. Tested active benzothiazole compounds were characterised by moderate to good solubility, good metabolic stability, low permeability and high binding to plasma proteins. One tested active benzimidazole derivative showed ADME properties, but lower lipophilicity resulted in low PPB and higher metabolic instability. In addition, no significant difference was observed in ADME profile between active and non-active compounds.">

The estimation of cell cycle arrest, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and caspases-3/7/9 activity in the HeLa cells treated with the compound was done by flow cytometry and luminometric technique. DNA damage in the cells was estimated by immunofluorescence staining and the comet assay with etoposide as a positive control.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The compound had strong effect on the cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.55 μg/mL) by the suppression of HeLa cells proliferation in G2/M phase of cell cycle and induction of cell death through double-stranded DNA damage and reactive oxygen species overproduction. Furthermore, we did not observe an increase in the activity of caspase-3/7/9 in the treated cells as well as a decrease in cellular mitochondrial membrane potential. Gene expression analysis revealed the overexpression of NF-Kappa-B inhibitors genes (&gt;2-fold higher than control) in the treated cells.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate induces cell cycle arrest and caspase-independent cell death through double-stranded DNA damage. These results are an important step in further studies on cell death signalling pathways induced by bufadienolides.">

The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) composition was analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID. The anticancer activity associated with the oil was assessed against colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT-116) and compared to its cytotoxicity on the human skin fibroblast. Multivariate analysis was used to determine relationship of the fatty acid composition with that of the anticancer activity.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The results demonstrated that fatty acid composition of &lt;i&gt;Citrullus colocynthis&lt;/i&gt; seed oil chiefly contains Linoleic acid, denoted as C18:2n6 (75%), followed by Palmitic acid C16:0 (8%), Stearic acid C18:0 (5%), and Oleic acid C18:1n9 (9%). It is demonstrated as an excellent source of essential fatty acids omega-6 (e.g., Linoleic acid), whereas omega-3 (e.g., α-Linolenic acid) and hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids are found at small level. Interestingly, the oil exhibited reasonable anticancer effects against colorectal cancer cell lines with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values varying between 4 and 7 mg/ml. The correlation test revealed a relationship between the fatty acid composition and the effectiveness on treatments.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Handal plant from Jordan appears to have very high level of Linoleic acid compared to other oils measured in different geographic locations and that there appears to be some anticancer activities associated with the fatty acid content of Handal seed oil.">

Thus, we evaluated in vitro immune-enhancing activity of &lt;i&gt;H. moellendorffii&lt;/i&gt; through macrophage activation using RAW264.7 cells. &lt;i&gt;Heracleum moellendorffii&lt;/i&gt; Root extracts (HMR) increased the production of immunomodulators such as NO, iNOS, IL-1β, IL-6 IL-12, TNF-α, and MCP-1 and activated phagocytosis in RAW264.7 cells. Inhibition of TLR2 and TLR4 reduced the production of immunomodulators induced by HMR. Inhibition of MAPK signaling attenuated the production of immunomodulators induced by HMR, but inhibitions of NF-κB or PI3K/AKT signaling did not affect HMR-mediated production of immunomodulators. HMR activated MAPK signaling pathway, and activation of MAPK signaling pathways by HMR was reversed by TLR2 and TLR4 inhibition. Based on the results of this study, HMR is thought to activate macrophages through the production of immunomodulators and phagocytosis activation through TLR2/4-dependent MAPK signaling pathway. Therefore, it is thought that HMR has the potential to be used as an agent for enhancing immunity.">

        <span class="abst" title="The main objective of current study was to evaluate the antioxidant potential and nutritional composition of milk thistle with special reference to silymarin. For the purpose, different varieties of milk thistle were procured from three different cities of Pakistan. The study was comprised of three different phases. In 1st phase, nutritional composition, that is, moisture, fat, protein, fiber, and nitrogen free extract, was determined according to their respective methods. Moreover, antioxidant potential and quantification of silymarin content were explored in 2nd phase. Furthermore, in last phase, milk thistle seeds tea was developed and evaluated for nutritional and sensorial characteristics. At last, data obtained from each parameter was subjected to appropriate statistical design to determine the level of significance. Results showed significant difference in the nutritional and chemical composition of different milk thistle varieties as well as locations. Moreover, moisture content, ash content, fat content, fiber content, protein content, and NFE varied from 6.27% to 5.01%, 2.37 to 1.25%, 23.19 to 19.74%, 7.4 to 4.39%, 30.09 to 20.74%, and 45.42 to 34.13%, respectively. Furthermore, silymarin content quantified though HPLC ranged from 1669.5 mg/g to 1607.6 mg/g for soxhlet extract whereas, 1,840.6 mg/g to 1765.9 mg/g for microwave-assisted extraction extract. Conclusively, it was depicted from the results that in case of variety, Blue was the best than White whereas, Islamabad was best in case of location.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/i&gt; is a zoonotic parasite of worldwide importance, responsible for toxoplasmosis in homeotherms. Although treatment options are readily available, most drugs often cause serious side effects. Extracts of &lt;i&gt;Dracocephalum kotschyi&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;D. kotschyi&lt;/i&gt;) have shown significant pharmacological activity against various parasites, viruses, and bacteria. In this study, we evaluated the anti-&lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; activity in vitro and in vivo of &lt;i&gt;D. kotschyi&lt;/i&gt; essential oil. The thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method was used to assess the anti-&lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; activity and cytotoxicity of the essential oil. The presence of &lt;i&gt;T. gondii&lt;/i&gt; was observed by Giemsa staining, and the viability was evaluated by the trypan blue staining method. Furthermore, the survival rate of acutely infected mice was evaluated by intraperitoneal injecting of the essential oil (50, 100, and 200 mg kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; day&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) for five days after infection with 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; tachyzoites. Essential oil, negative, and positive controls that showed the best toxoplasmacidal activity were assayed in triplicate at each concentration. The essential oil exhibited the highest anti-&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 9.94 ± 0.38 µg, with a selectivity index of 2.463. On Vero cells, the CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of the oil was 24.49 ± 0.96 µg and exhibited a significant anti-&lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; activity. Moreover, the treatment by essential oil significantly increased the survival rate compared to untreated infected control. In conclusion, the essential oil might be a useful compound, and with more testing, it may be an excellent alternative to standard chemical drugs in the treatment of toxoplasmosis.">

The anticancer activity against the U87MG glioblastoma and A549 lung carcinoma cells was determined by the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay. Bacterial endophytes that were successfully isolated from &lt;i&gt;C. macowanii&lt;/i&gt; leaves include &lt;i&gt;Raoultella ornithinolytica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter guillouiae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; sp., &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas palleroniana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Bacillus safensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Enterobacter asburiae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas cichorii&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter pascens&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas cichorii&lt;/i&gt; exhibited broad antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria while &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter pascens&lt;/i&gt; displayed the least MIC of 0.0625 mg/mL. &lt;i&gt;Bacillus safensis&lt;/i&gt; crude extracts were the only sample that showed notable cell reduction of 50% against A549 lung carcinoma cells at a concentration of 100 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. Metabolite profiling of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus safensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas cichorii&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter pascens&lt;/i&gt; crude extracts revealed the presence of known antibacterial and/or anticancer agents such as lycorine (1), angustine (2), crinamidine (3), vasicinol (4), and powelline. It can be concluded that the crude bacterial endophyte extracts obtained from &lt;i&gt;C. macowanii&lt;/i&gt; leaves can biosynthesize bioactive compounds and can be bioprospected for medical application into antibacterial and anticancer agents.">

In this study, the red betel leaves extract (RBLE) protective effect against APAP-induced HepG2 cells was determined. APAP-induced HepG2 as hepatotoxicity cell model was treated with RBLE at 25 and 100 μg/mL. Protective effects of RBLE toward hepatotoxicity were evaluated by several parameters: tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, live cells percentage, apoptotic cells percentage, necrotic cells percentage, death cells percentage, CYP2E1 and GPX gene expression. The RBLE treatments (both 25 and 100 μg/mL) increased CYP2E1 and GPX gene expression also live cells percentage, while decreased ROS level, TNF-α concentration, also the percentage of death and necrotic cells. Red Betel leaves ethanol extract has hepatoprotective effect via anti-inflammatory, anti-necrotic, and antioxidant potency in liver injury model.">

        <span class="abst" title="Fagonia indica (L.) is an important medicinal plant with multitude of therapeutic potentials. Such application has been attributed to the presence of various pharmacological important phytochemicals. However, the inadequate biosynthesis of such metabolites in intact plants has hampered scalable production. Thus, herein, we have established an in vitro based elicitation strategy to enhance such metabolites in callus culture of F. indica. Cultures were exposed to various doses of UV radiation (UV-C) and grown in different photoperiod regimes and their impact was evaluated on biomass accumulation, biosynthesis of phytochemicals along antioxidant expression. Cultures grown under photoperiod (16L/8D h) after exposure to UV-C (5.4 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) accumulated optimal biomass (438.3 g/L FW; 16.4 g/L DW), phenolics contents (TPC: 11.8 μgGAE/mg) and flavonoids contents (TFC: 4.05 μgQE/mg). Similarly, HPLC quantification revealed that total production (6.967 μg/mg DW) of phytochemicals wherein kaempferol (1.377 μg/mg DW), apigenin (1.057 μg/mg DW), myricetin (1.022 μg/mg DW) and isorhamnetin (1.022 μg/mg DW) were recorded highly accumulated compounds in cultures at UV-C (5.4 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) dose than other UV-C radiations and light regimes.. The antioxidants activities examined as DPPH (92.8%), FRAP (182.3 µM TEAC) and ABTS (489.1 µM TEAC) were also recorded highly expressed by cultures under photoperiod after treatment with UV-C dose 5.4 kJ/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, same cultures also expressed maximum % inhibition towards phospholipase A2 (sPLA2: 35.8%), lipoxygenase (15-LOX: 43.3%) and cyclooxygenases (COX-1: 55.3% and COX-2: 39.9%) with 1.0-, 1.3-, 1.3- and 2.8-fold increased levels as compared with control, respectively. Hence, findings suggest that light and UV can synergistically improve the metabolism of F. indica and could be used to produce such valuable metabolites on commercial scale.">

        <span class="abst" title="Sanguinarine (SAN) and chelerythrine (CHE) have been widely used as substitutes for antibiotics for decades. For a long time, SAN and CHE have been extracted from mainly Macleaya cordata, a plant species that is a traditional herb in China and belongs to the Papaveraceae family. However, with the sharp increase in demand for SAN and CHE, it is necessary to develop a new method to enhance the supply of raw materials. Here, we used methyl jasmonate (MJ), salicylic acid (SA) and wounding alone and in combination to stimulate aseptic seedlings of M. cordata at 0 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h and then compared the differences in metabolic profiles and gene expression. Ultimately, we found that the effect of using MJ alone was the best treatment, with the contents of SAN and CHE increasing by 10- and 14-fold, respectively. However, the increased SAN and CHE contents in response to combined wounding and MJ were less than those for induced by the treatment with MJ alone. Additionally, after MJ treatment, SAN and CHE biosynthetic pathway genes, such as those encoding the protopine 6-hydroxylase and dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase enzymes, were highly expressed, which is consistent with the accumulation of SAN and CHE. At the same time, we have also studied the changes in the content of synthetic intermediates of SAN and CHE after elicitor induction. This study is the first systematic research report about using elicitors to increase the SAN and CHE in Macleaya cordata.">

The species with the greatest potential for popularization considering the attributes accessed from local knowledge and perception were Psidium guineense Sw., Genipa americana L., Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L.) Schott and Dioscorea trifida L.f. However, the high variation in local knowledge on wild food plants suggests that species that are not frequently cited can also be promising.

It is also a key initial step of research for active principles, which could be then isolated and tested on more advanced models, becoming new pharmacologically active lead molecules. The crucial aspect which has not been so far addressed in this context, is the presence of pyrogens in plant preparations. The aim of this study was the examination of pyrogens interference with in vitro evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of plant extracts using human primary neutrophils model together with introduction of effective method of interfering factors elimination. The obtained results showed that chosen plant extracts contained pyrogens, which were responsible for concentration-dependent stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines production by human neutrophils in vitro in the same extent as LPS did. The ultrafiltration method was successfully applied for pyrogens elimination, which effectiveness was confirmed using LAL test. The determined interference of pyrogens implies the necessity of their consideration and removal when in vitro studies include direct addition of plant extracts to the cell culture, what can be obtained by ultrafiltration, which does not affect extract composition.">

AD is of unknown etiology and currently, no cure is available. Present medication is restricted to treating symptoms; thus, a need exists for the development of effective remedies. Medicinal plants constitute a large pool, from which active compounds of great pharmaceutical potential can be derived. Various &lt;i&gt;Salvia&lt;/i&gt; spp. are considered as neuroprotective, and here, the ability of &lt;i&gt;Salvia fruticosa&lt;/i&gt; (SF) to protect against toxic effects induced in an AD cell model was partly assessed. Two of AD's characteristic hallmarks are the presence of elevated oxidative stress levels and the cytotoxic aggregation of amyloid beta (A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) peptides. Thus, we obtained SF extracts in three different solvents of increasing polarity, consecutively, to evaluate (a) their antioxidant capacity with the employment of the free radical scavenging assay (DPPH&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;), of the ferric reducing ability of plasma assay (FRAP), and of the cellular reactive oxygen species assay (DCFDA) and (b) their neuroprotective properties against A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sub&gt;25-35&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cell death with the use of an MTT assay. All three SF extracts showed a considerable antioxidant capacity, with the methanol (SFM) extract being the strongest. The results of the total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) of the extracts and of the FRAP and the DCFDA assays showed a similar pattern. In addition, and most importantly, the dichloromethane (SFD) and the petroleum ether (SFP) extracts had an effect on A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; toxicity, exhibiting a significant neuroprotective potential. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SF extracts demonstrating neuroprotective potential against A&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; toxicity. In combination with their antioxidant capacity, SF extracts may be beneficial in combating AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="The current study describes ethnobotanical (EB) and traditional ethnomedicinal (TEMs) uses of medicinal plants (MPs) of Tehsil Samahni area of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. Indigenous inhabitants of the area mostly reside in remote mountainous areas and depend on wild plants for life necessities and treatment of different diseases. This paper presents first quantitative ethnobotanical study describing the popularity level of MPs in indigenous communities by using relative popularity level (RPL) and rank order of priority (ROP) indices. The data of TEMs and EB uses were collected from 200 interviewees consisting of traditional herbal practioners (110) and farmers (90) from study area using structured and semi-structured interview methodology during year 2019. It was found that illiterate peasants have more knowledge and practice of TEMs than other people. A total of 150 plant species belonging to 58 families with botanical and local names, parts used, mode of recipes preparation, administration mechanism and TEMs uses were documented in systematic manner. It was explored that highest number (7.69%) of plants of Moraceae were used in TEMs and followed by species of Asteraceae (6.29%). The ethnobotanical data was analyzed by using quantitative ethnobotanical tools viz: informant consensus factor (ICF), fidelity level (FL), relative frequency of citation (RFC), use value index (UVI), relative importance of plants (RIP), relative populatiry level (RPL) and rank order of popularity (ROP). The leaf ranked first (36.49%) and fruit 2nd (12.07%) being used in TEMs while prevalent use-form was decoction (29.28%), followed by tea (23.05%) and preferably taken as oral (46.66%). ICF analysis proved that diabetes, hypertension, rabies, snake sting and joint pains were the most prevalent occurring infirmities. The highest RFC (0.95) was found for Acacia modesta, followed by Boerhavia procumbens (RFC:0.87) and Berberis lycium (RFC:0.85). The relative importance of MPs was calculated by using UVI and Moringa oleifera showed highest (1.38), followed by Zanthoxylum armatum (1.25) and Withania somnifera (1.24) use-values. High UVI of plants depicts that these species are predominantly used in local health care system. The plants Phyllanthus emblica, Morus macruora, Justicia adhatoda and Melia azedarach depicted high values (1.00) of FL and RPL proving that these taxa are commonly used in indigenous medicines by local inhabitants and have better potential for drug discovery by ethnopharmacological analysis. Out of total, 26 species had more than 50% ROP index and Phyllanthus emblica and Flacourtia indica (ROP = 100) followed by Morus macruora (ROP: 97) were used to cure 'hypertension and hyperlipidemia' and 'cough, chest infection', respectively. It was found that 30% of total species were previously reported as medicinal while 70% plants were first time reported to be used in TEMs and authenticated by using of quantitative ethnobotanical tools. Ethnopharmacological potential of indigenous plants was confirmed by RIP and RPL indices which had been used to cure one or more body systems and were promulgated in the local herbal medicine system. The research provides clues to screen these plant species by using latest phytochemical and pharmacological analysis for novel drug discovery. This study will also be useful for conservation of bioculture traditional knowledge of indigenous communities and the most important is to conserve medicinal plants of the study area for future generations.">

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the radical scavenging properties of &lt;i&gt;Coccinia&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract and its ability to ameliorate a migration process in vitro. &lt;i&gt;Coccinia&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal plant that was used in ancient times for relieving insect bite itching and swelling. However, the role of &lt;i&gt;Coccinia&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract as an antioxidant related to the process of wound healing has never been studied. In this study, we demonstrated that the leaf extract possessed antioxidant properties that acted as a proton donor to neutralize reactive oxygen species with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 4.85 mg/mL of the extract. It could chelate iron with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 21.39 mg/mL of the extract. The leaf extract protected the human fibroblasts and keratinocytes from hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress by increasing cell survival rate by more than 20% in all test doses. The protective property was dose-dependently correlated with the decrease in reactive oxygen species formation. In addition, the leaf extract enhanced the cell migration rate of fibroblasts and keratinocytes up to 23% compared with vehicle control. The results suggested that &lt;i&gt;Coccinia&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract may be a potential herb for increasing the wound healing process with its antioxidant capacity and can be used as an herbal ingredient for the utilization of skincare products.">

In this study, the effect of Zisheng Shenqi Decoction (ZSD) on a rat model of MSU-induced GA was investigated. ZSD obviously diminished the right paw thickness, the degree of the swelling of the paw, and the infiltration of the inflammatory cell, as well as cartilage erosion, and widened the joint space in MSU-treated rats. Besides, MSU remarkably elevated the release of tumor necrosis factor-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; (TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;), interleukin-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; (IL-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;), IL-6, and IL-18; however, ZSD treatment dose dependently lowered these levels and resulted in a significant decrease in articular elastase activity. Also, ZSD administration increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) but declined malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitrogen monoxide (NO) contents. Importantly, western blotting analysis revealed that NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1, IL-1&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in the cytoplasm, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamyclin (p-mTOR), and p62 expressions were downregulated, whereas the levels of nuclear Nrf2, phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), Beclin-1, and LC3II/I were upregulated by ZSD. Immunofluorescence assay indicated that ZSD evidently promoted nuclear translocation of LC3. Taken together, ZSD inhibited inflammation and oxidative stress and facilitated autophagy through the activation of the AMPK pathway and suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway, demonstrating its potential for preventing and curing GA.">

A negotiated immune system is a common risk factor for all viral infections, including COVID-19. To date, no specific therapies or vaccines have been approved for coronavirus. In these circumstances, antiviral and immune boosting foods may ensure protection against viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2 by reducing risk and ensuring fast healing of SARS-CoV-2 illness.&lt;h4&gt;Scope and approach&lt;/h4&gt;In this review, we have conducted an online search using several search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct) to find out some traditional foods (plant, animal and fungi species), which have antiviral and immune-boosting properties against numerous viral infections, particularly coronaviruses (CoVs) and others RNA-virus infections. Our review indicated some foods to be considered as potential immune enhancers, which may help individuals to overcome viral infections like COVID-19 by modulating immune systems and reducing respiratory problems. Furthermore, this review will provide information regarding biological properties of conventional foods and their ingredients to uphold general health.&lt;h4&gt;Key findings and conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We observed some foods with antiviral and immune-boosting properties, which possess bioactive compounds that showed significant antiviral properties against different viruses, particularly RNA viruses such as CoVs. Interestingly, some antiviral and immune-boosting mechanisms were very much similar to the antiviral drug of COVID-19 homologous SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). The transient nature and the devastating spreading capability of COVID-19 lead to ineffectiveness of many curative therapies. Therefore, body shielding and immune-modulating foods, which have previous scientific recognition, have been discussed in this review to discern the efficacy of these foods against viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2.">

In this study, three salt treatments (including 21, 42 and 63 ds/m NaCl/kg dry soil) and four Si (silicon) concentrations (including 0, 1.4, 2.8 and 4.2 ds/m SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kg K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in dry soil) were tested using G. uralensis as the plant material in a pot experiment with three replications. The results showed that the application of various concentrations of Si increased sucrose synthetase (SS), sucrose phosphate synthetase (SPS) and glutamine synthetase (GS), as well as nitrate reductase (NR) activities, and promoted carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Si application also increased the root dry weight of G. uralensis. Multilevel comparative analysis showed that the application of 2.8 ds/m SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was the optimum rate for improved growth and yield of G. uralensis under different salt levels.

Nowadays, patients frequently use medicinal herbs as complementary or alternative options to conventional drug treatments. These patients may benefit from treatment of thyroid dysfunctions with Potentilla alba L. preparations. While it has been reported that Potentilla alba preparations have low toxicity, nothing is known about their ability to affect reproductive functions in patients of childbearing age.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Male Wistar rats were orally treated with a thyrotrophic botanical drug, standardized Potentilla alba Dry Extract (PADE), at doses 8 and 40 times higher than the median therapeutic dose recommended for the clinical trials, for 60 consecutive days. Male Wistar rats receiving water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) were used as controls. After completing treatment, half of the PADE-treated and control males were used to determine PADE gonadotoxicity, and the remaining half of PADE-treated and control males were mated with intact females. Two female rats were housed with one male for two estrus cycles. PADE effects on fertility and fetal/offspring development were evaluated.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Herein, we report that oral treatment of male Wistar rats with PADE before mating with intact females instigated marked effects on male reproductive organs. Treatment significantly decreased the motility of the sperm and increased the number of pathological forms of spermatozoa. Additionally, a dose-dependent effect on Leydig cells was observed. However, these PADE effects did not significantly affect male fertility nor fetal and offspring development when PADE-treated males were mated with intact females.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;PADE treatment of male rates negatively affected sperm and testicular Leydig cell morphology. However, these changes did not affect male fertility and offspring development. It is currently not known whether PADE treatment may affect human male fertility and offspring development. Therefore, these results from an animal study need to be confirmed in humans. Results from this animal study can be used to model the exposure-response relationship and adverse outcomes in humans.">

        <span class="abst" title="Diabetes mellitus is a major metabolic disorder worldwide. Several herbs are being tested for the management of diabetes. &lt;i&gt;Cassia auriculata&lt;/i&gt; is one of those herbs known for its nutritional value and health benefits. However, limited scientific evidence has been shown on the elucidation of its root bioactives as well as biological activity. This study attempted to identify and characterize phenolic compounds from the potent root extract and to evaluate its antioxidant as well as antidiabetic properties in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models. The results revealed that the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents were highest in the methanolic extract. The methanolic extract of the &lt;i&gt;C. auriculata&lt;/i&gt; root showed the highest antioxidant and antidiabetic activities &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; than other extracts. These biological activities may be because the extract is rich in coumaric acid and -OH groups as revealed by high-performance liquid chromatography and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, respectively. Further, the antidiabetic activity of the methanolic extract was studied in a diet-induced type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) C57BL/6 mouse model. A significant increase in fasting blood glucose and decreased plasma insulin levels in T2DM mice confirmed the development of the diabetic condition. In addition, the T2DM mice showed oxidative stress in the plasma as well as muscle tissue and significant alterations in the plasma biochemistry, &lt;i&gt;viz&lt;/i&gt;., lipid profile, liver, and renal function tests. However, the administration of the ethanolic extract of the &lt;i&gt;C. auriculata&lt;/i&gt; root (150 mg/kg body weight) to T2DM mice normalized the condition comparable to that of control mice. Thus, the extract can be used as a potent antioxidant and antidiabetic agent in pharmaceutical companies.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Fernandoa adenophylla&lt;/i&gt; (Wall. ex G.

This study was designed to assess the antinociceptive, muscle relaxant, and molecular docking properties of a novel compound, namely, (5a&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,5a1&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,6&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,7a&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,14b&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,15&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)15-hydroxy-7a-methyl-6-(2-methylprop-1-en-1-yl)-7,7a,14b,15-tetrahydro-5&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-t-5a,15methanobenzo[g]benzo[5,6]azuleno[1,8-&lt;i&gt;bc&lt;/i&gt;]chromene-5,9,14,16(5a1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;,6&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)- tetraone (peshawaraquinone), isolated from the methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;F. adenophylla&lt;/i&gt; in an animal model. The chemical structure of the isolated compound was elucidated using advanced spectroscopic techniques and further confirmed by XRD analysis. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was tested against hot plate-induced noxious stimuli at various doses (2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg i.p.). The muscle relaxation potency of compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was evaluated in the inclined and traction test, while the open-field test was used for the determination of sedative potential. The isolated compound was also subjected to acute toxicity analysis. The compound was then subjected to molecular docking analysis to determine the exact mechanism of action. Compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; demonstrated significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) analgesic effect in a dose-dependent manner. A noticeable muscle relaxant effect was observed with the passage of time in both experimental models. The compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; showed a significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) sedative effect, and in an acute toxicity study, the compound &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; was devoid of any noxious effects. The docking studies showed preferential affinity for μ-opioid and GABAA receptors. Hence, the prospective antinociceptive and muscle relaxant and sedative properties are probably mediated through these two target interactions.">

        <span class="abst" title="Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its emergence, the COVID-19 pandemic has not only distressed medical services but also caused economic upheavals, marking urgent the need for effective therapeutics. The experience of combating SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has shown that inhibiting the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) blocks the replication of the virus. Given the well-studied properties of FDA-approved drugs, identification of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors in an FDA-approved drug library would be of great therapeutic value. Here, we screened a library consisting of 774 FDA-approved drugs for potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors, using an intramolecularly quenched fluorescence (IQF) peptide substrate. Ethacrynic acid, naproxen, allopurinol, butenafine hydrochloride, raloxifene hydrochloride, tranylcypromine hydrochloride, and saquinavir mesylate have been found to block the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The inhibitory activity of these repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro highlights their therapeutic potential for treating COVID-19 and other Betacoronavirus infections.">

However, there was no report on its modulatory role in inflammation.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;This study investigates anti-inflammatory effect of &lt;i&gt;S. brevipes&lt;/i&gt; in various inflammation models.&lt;h4&gt;Materials and methods&lt;/h4&gt;The aerial part of &lt;i&gt;S. brevipes&lt;/i&gt; was extracted with 95% ethanol to produce Sb-EE. RAW264.7 cells pre-treated with Sb-EE were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and Griess assay and PCR were performed. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, luciferase assay, Western blotting and kinase assay were employed. C57BL/6 mice (10 mice/group) were orally administered with Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) once a day for five days, and peritonitis was induced by an intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg). ICR mice (four mice/group) were orally administered with Sb-EE (20 or 200 mg/kg) or ranitidine (positive control) twice a day for two days, and EtOH/HCl was orally injected to induce gastritis.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Sb-EE suppressed nitric oxide (NO) release (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;=34 µg/mL) without cytotoxicity and contained flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol). Sb-EE (200 µg/mL) reduced the mRNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Sb-EE blocked the activities of Syk and Src, while inhibiting interleukin-1 receptor associated kinases (IRAK1) by 68%. Similarly, orally administered Sb-EE (200 mg/kg) suppressed NO production by 78% and phosphorylation of Src and Syk in peritonitis mice. Sb-EE also decreased inflammatory lesions in gastritis mice.&lt;h4&gt;Discussion and conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of Sb-EE on the inflammatory response, suggesting that Sb-EE can be developed as a potential anti-inflammatory agent.">

We conducted a questionnaire for beekeepers that set up their hives in the prefectures and provinces of the region, and we have studied the pharmacological evidence of the most preferred plants by beekeepers to assess its medicinal values. The results indicate that honey, bee pollen, bee bread, royal jelly, propolis, bee wax, bee venom, and bee queens are produced in this region with different percentages, and 102 plants belonging to 32 families were obtained in the inventory of melliferous plants; the most represented families were Asteraceae and Lamiaceae (13.73% each) followed by Rosaceae (8.82%). Among these 102 plants identified, 79 plants provide nectar and pollen for bees, 16 plants provide only pollen, 3 plants provide only nectar, 35 plants are resinous, and 6 plants provide honeydew for bees. The outcome of this study will contribute to the valuation of melliferous plants and help to establish a practical guide for the development of the beekeeping sector as an agricultural economic approach.">

The comparative cytotoxic activities of the wild and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;-raised protocorms were evaluated in human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and human glioblastoma (U251) cell lines by MTT assay. In &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, the methanol extracts of &lt;i&gt;D. chryseum&lt;/i&gt; showed significant cytotoxic activities. Significant growth inhibition (%) and potent IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were demonstrated in HeLa cell lines (49.79% (210.5 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) for &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;-raised &lt;i&gt;Dendrobium chryseum&lt;/i&gt; (DCT) versus 46.97% (226.5 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) for wild &lt;i&gt;Dendrobium chryseum&lt;/i&gt; (DCW)). Similarly, activities against U251 cell lines exhibited also significant inhibition (28.76% (612.54 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) for DCW and 17.15% (1059.92 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL) for DCT). The cytotoxic activities of both, wild and tissue-cultured samples, were superior in HeLa cells. In U251 cells, the wild sample was more active than the tissue-cultured one with a moderate cytotoxic effect. Hence, protocorm culture may therefore be a promising future tool for producing pharmacologically bioactive compounds in medicinal orchids. Such sustainable technology approach will minimize the pressure on the natural population of threatened but commercially important medicinal orchids.">

Malignant disease is widely prevalent and considered to be the major challenges of this century, which concerns the medical community all over the world. Consequently, investigating small molecule antitumor agents, which could decrease drug resistance and reduce unpleasant side effect is more desirable. 2-aminothiazole scaffold has emerged as a promising scaffold in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery research. This nucleus is a fundamental part of some clinically applied anticancer drugs such as dasatinib and alpelisib. Literature survey documented that different 2-aminothiazole analogs exhibited their potent and selective nanomolar inhibitory activity against a wide range of human cancerous cell lines such as breast, leukemia, lung, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, renal, and prostate.

        <span class="abst" title="DNA barcoding is currently an effective and widely used tool that enables rapid and accurate identification of plant species. The Orchidaceae is the second largest family of flowering plants, with more than 700 genera and 20,000 species distributed nearly worldwide. The accurate identification of Orchids not only contributes to the safe utilization of these plants, but also it is essential to the protection and utilization of germplasm resources. In this study, the DNA barcoding of 4 chloroplast genes (matK, rbcL, ndhF and ycf1) were used to provide theoretical basis for species identification, germplasm conservation and innovative utilization of orchids. By comparing the nucleotide replacement saturation of the single or combined sequences among the 4 genes, we found that these sequences reached a saturation state and were suitable for phylogenetic relationship analysis. The phylogenetic analyses based on genetic distance indicated that ndhF and ycf1 sequences were competent to identification at genus and species level of orchids in a single gene. In the combined sequences, matK + ycf1 and ndhF + ycf1 were qualified for identification at the genera and species levels, suggesting the potential roles of ndhF, ycf1, matK + ycf1 and ndhF + ycf1 as candidate barcodes for orchids. Based on the SNP sites, candidate genes were used to obtain the specific barcode of orchid plant species and generated the corresponding DNA QR code ID card that could be immediately recognized by electronic devices. This study provides innovative research methods for efficient species identification of orchids. The standardized and accurate barcode information of Orchids is provided for researchers. It lays the foundation for the conservation, evaluation, innovative utilization and protection of Orchidaceae germplasm resources.">

This report aims to address this debilitating issue. A natural polyphenolic compound, Ellagic acid (EA) is having numerous potential medicinal properties. In this present study nephroprotective effects of EA has been evaluated in a rodent model with lead-induced toxicity.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Rats were treated with EA doses of 50 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg and simultaneously co-administered with lead acetate (60 mg/kg) for 2 months through oral route. The extent to which EA treatment provides nephroprotective effect was estimated by measurement of serum biomarkers, tissue antioxidants, inflammatory mediators, apoptosis, autophagy pathway and histological examination.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;EA treatment caused significant restoration in the level of serum biomarkers, tissue antioxidants and histological architecture of renal tissue. Treatment with either of the doses of EA causes restoration of pro-inflammatory mediators to approximately pre-exposure concentration. This phenomena is caused by suppression of expression levels of inflammatory molecules like tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), as well as functional expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Moreover, it was also observed that EA suppressed apoptotic and autophagic pathway by reduction of expression of light chain 3B (LC3B) level which are the oxidative DNA damage markers of renal tissue.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;It can be safely concluded that EA provides protection against lead-induced nephrotoxicity to a significant degree.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;In some countries, including Poland, nurses have acquired autonomy from being a designated &quot;ancillary staff&quot; to &quot;professional staff&quot; only in recent decades. No prior published studies have examined, however, whether the actual nursing practice in primary health care (PHC) has evolved with the advancement of education and professional autonomy. The aim of this study is to assess the scope of practice of a PHC nurses and their actual work activities.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A cross-sectional study design using an investigator-developed survey was conducted in Poland, in 2018. The survey was sent to professionally active PHC nurses in Poland. Of the 225 questionnaires distributed, 202 (89.8%) were returned.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Out of 44 work activities examined, the most often performed activity was administering medications. Less frequent activities included recognizing patients' nursing needs and health problems and monitoring, assessing, and interpreting basic vital signs. A correlation was found between the length of work experience and the following three activities: performing nursing care, issuing referrals for specific diagnostic tests, and ordering of specific treatments, medications, and nutritional supplements. The longer was the work experience, the more often the nurses performed nursing care (r = 0.15; p = 0.035) but less often issued referrals for diagnostic tests (r = - 0.24; p = 0.001) or orders within their scope of practice (r = - 0.23; p = 0.002).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;While nurses in general are most likely to carry out physician orders, junior nurses tend to be more likely to work toward professional autonomy and pursuing new challenges. PHC nurses in Poland perform work associated more with carrying out physicians' orders and less with what they were prepared to do. Engaging nursing students in interprofessional education, dissemination of nursing research, and advocacy of nursing professional organizations on behalf of the profession may be an effective strategy to overcome the current barriers for PHC nurses to work the top of their license.">

        <span class="abst" title="Recently, yogurt has been extensively studied to further enhance its functions using edible plant extracts. This study was conducted to investigate whether safflower petal (SP) as a natural food additive can be used to develop functional yogurt with improved health benefits. SPs were extracted with ethanol (SPE) and hot water (SPW), and then safflower yogurt was prepared by adding 0%-1.0% of those extracts to plain yogurt. With an increase in the fermentation duration, the pH of SPE and SPW yogurt samples was decreased, whereas titratable acidity and microbial counts were increased. The concentration of total polyphenols and total flavonoids, the activity of antioxidants, and the inhibitory effect on reactive oxygen species (ROS) were higher in SPW yogurt than SPE yogurt. Furthermore, α-glucosidase and lipase activity inhibitory effects of SPW yogurt were higher than those of SPE yogurt. In particular, free radical-scavenging activities, ROS inhibitory effect, and α-glucosidase activity inhibitory effects were significantly increased in SPW yogurt in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, these results suggest that SP extract possesses antioxidant activities and that it can downregulate α-glucosidase and lipase activities. The SP extract may have potential benefits as a natural food additive for the development of functional yogurt.">

Seven literature databases were systematically searched for eligible in vitro and clinical trials. Selected articles were screened for biological activity, botanical species, phytochemical composition, study design, and methodological quality. A total of 26 articles were included in the review, of which 21 were in vitro studies and 5 clinical trials. The most promising EOs were obtained from &lt;i&gt;Allium tubeorosum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum cassia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cinnamomum zeylanicum&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Coriandrum sativum&lt;/i&gt; L. Among the phytochemicals, citral and thymol were the most active. Clinical trials indicated that the EOs from &lt;i&gt;Pelargonium graveolens&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Zataria multiflora&lt;/i&gt; are potentially effective to treat oral candidiasis. Further nonclinical and clinical studies with these EO are warranted to determine their potential use and safety for the treatment of oral candidiasis.">

The animals were daily treated with the aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;C. europaea&lt;/i&gt; at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight for 14 days. CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; was injected (1 ml/kg, &lt;i&gt;i.p&lt;/i&gt;.) two times, on the 7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; days. At the end of the experimental period, all rats were anesthetized to collect blood for the assessment of biochemical parameters and then sacrificed to collect the liver for weighing. Hepatotoxicity was evaluated by measuring the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin (total and direct), malondialdehyde (MDA), total protein (TP), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-c ), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), urea, creatinine, and uric acid. Based on the results obtained in this study, the administration of &lt;i&gt;C. europaea&lt;/i&gt; before exposure to the administration of CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conferred favorable hepatoprotective effect in rats. The treatment with AECe (250 mg/kg) exhibits a significant hepatoprotective effect by ameliorating CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-induced alterations of these biochemical parameters. Hence, &lt;i&gt;C. europaea&lt;/i&gt; could be a potential medicinal herb that can be used in the future to prevent liver intoxication.">

The plant is famous for the anti-cancerous activity, low back pain treatment, and muscle strengthening, which may be attributed to the withanolide alkaloids. &lt;i&gt;W. somnifera&lt;/i&gt; is also rich in numerous valued secondary metabolites such as steroids, alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, saponins, and glycosides. A wide range of preclinical trials such as cardioprotective, anticancer, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, anti-depressant, and hypoglycemic have been attributed to various parts of the plant. Different parts of the plant have also been evaluated for the clinical trials such as male infertility, obsessive-compulsive disorder, antianxiety, bone and muscle strengthening potential, hypolipidemic, and antidiabetic.

This study evaluated the effect of PBE-beverage blends (including 1% and 2 % cocoa powder) sweetened with honey on blood glucose levels, antioxidant status, and carbohydrate hydrolysing enzyme activities in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Animals were selected at random and distributed into 7 groups (n=7), as follows: normal control (NC), untreated diabetic rats, diabetic rats treated with acarbose (STZ-ACA), diabetic rats administered PBE (STZ- PBE), diabetic rats administered honey and PBE (STZ-HPBE), diabetic rats administered 1% cocoa powder-with HPBE blend (STZ-CHPBE-1), and diabetic rats administered 2% cocoa powder with HPBE blend (STZ-CHPBE-2). Compared with the controls, untreated diabetic rats exhibited increased blood glucose levels and hydrolysing enzyme activities, and significant decreases in the activities of antioxidant (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase) enzyme and non-enzymatic (glutathione) antioxidants. However, changes in activities were comparatively reversed in all rats administered plantain bulb formulations. CHPBE-2 was slightly more effective than CHPBE-1. Overall, both blends could serve as nutraceutical and/or functional drinks in the management of diabetes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pharmaceutical legislation provides a legal framework to ensure the safe and effective use of medicines. This framework requires national regulatory authorities (NRAs) to establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system (PV system) stating and enforcing the regulatory commitments that key stakeholders, including marketing authorisation holders (MAHs), are required to fulfil. In recent years, national legislative bodies and NRAs across the world have issued a significant amount of legislation and guidance enforcing the obligation to perform pharmacovigilance activities. In countries where the NRA is a member of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), safety management requirements are generally consistent with ICH guidelines. In a number of countries beyond this scope, requirements may deviate from internationally agreed standards, adding a substantial complexity and increasing burden on the stakeholders involved, whilst the benefit for patients' safety may not be evident. Committed to fulfilling safety-regulatory obligations in any country where a product licence is held, global pharmaceutical companies have accumulated a broad and deep experience acquired whilst meeting the expectations of a large array of diverse PV systems across the world. These range from sub-optimal frameworks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Benchmarking Tool, to highly effective resource-optimised PV systems. In order to support countries creating or further developing their PV systems, especially where infrastructure and resources are limited, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) International Pharmacovigilance Group (IPVG) has developed consensus recommendations consistent with harmonised standards for the development and step-wise implementation of key PV system components. These recommendations endorsed by the EFPIA membership constitute the focus of this review article.">

The aim of this study is to describe post-authorisation introductions of new aRMMs and discontinuations of existing aRMMs for medicines authorised in the European Union (EU).&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We performed a retrospective cohort study that included all new active substances authorised through the EU centralised procedure between January 1st 2006 and December 31st 2017. Data was extracted from European Public Assessment Reports available on the website of the European Medicines Agency (ema.europa.eu). Medicines were followed up from the date of marketing authorisation (MA) until first introduction or discontinuation of aRMMs, excluding Direct Healthcare Professional Communications (DHPCs), withdrawal/suspension/revocation of the MA, or July 1st 2018, when data extraction took place. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse frequency data, and survival analysis was used to calculate 5- and 10-year probability of introduction or discontinuation of aRMMs.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 476 medicines were authorised during the study period. The probability of getting aRMMs after authorisation for products authorised without aRMMs was 3.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-5.7] within 5 years after authorisation and 6.9% (95% CI 2.6-11) within 10 years after authorisation. For products authorised with aRMMs, the probability of discontinuation of aRMMs was 0.9% (95% CI 0-2.6) within 5 years and 8.3% (95% CI 0-16.1) within 10 years after authorisation.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;We found low probabilities of introduction and discontinuation of aRMMs (excluding DHPCs) during the product life cycle for medicines authorised between 2006 and 2017. The low rate of discontinuation may potentially be due to a lack of robust data on effectiveness of aRMMs. Further research is needed to get more insight into the dynamics of aRMMs during the medicine life cycle.">

Honey samples were collected from underground soils through an excavation of natural nests from four representative districts (Wolmera, Jeldu, Toke Kutaye and Chalyia). About 120 honey samples (0.35-1.5 lit volumes) were collected and pooled for each respective area (district) for analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) of pollen data and GPS were used to categorize the botanical origin and geographical location of honey sample sources, respectively. Consecutively, the physico-chemical characters were evaluated for the moisture content (MC), electrical conductivity (EC), pH, ash, total acidity (TA), hydroxyl methyl furfuraldhyde (HMF), insoluble materials (IM), and proline. The study results showed that the mean values of parameters for honey samples were: MC (29 ± 1.45), EC (0.22 ± 0.03), pH (3.73 ± 0.13), Ash (0.41 ± 1.1), TA (7.3 ± 0.36), HMF (18 ± 3.45), IM (0.70 ± 0.3) and proline (214.5 ± 15). There was no mean significance differences &lt;i&gt;(P &gt; 0.05)&lt;/i&gt; observed among the sampled districts for the analyzed parameters, except for proline. The values were compared against the standard physico-chemical parameters of &lt;i&gt;Apis mellifera&lt;/i&gt; honey of Ethiopia and these values significantly varied for moisture content, total acidity and HMF. This is the first study investigated on composition property of stingless bee honey in Ethiopia and recall for further study on its nutritional and medicinal values so as to create a specific standardization.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Momordica dioica&lt;/i&gt; have proven medicinal potential of antidiabetic, antiviral and immune stimulating properties. Flavonoids and triterpenoids from &lt;i&gt;M. dioica&lt;/i&gt; were more extensively investigated for antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory activities. In this present study, we have predicted the reported bioactive flavonoids and triterpenoids of the plant against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) receptor through molecular docking and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; ADME predictions methods. According to the binding affinities, the two triterpenoids, hederagenin and oleanolic acid exhibited the best docking scores with these proteins than the catechin and quercetin with compared to standard remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; protein-drug studies have also showed significant interaction of catechin and quercetin compounds than standard drugs. The &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; binding studies correlated with the &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; binding studies. Further, &lt;i&gt;M. dioica&lt;/i&gt; being used as antidiabetic and its metabolite had significant interaction with DDP4, a comorbidity protein involved in aiding the viral entry. Out of all the natural ligands, quercetin was reported relatively good and safe for humans with high gastrointestinal tract permeability and poor blood brain barrier crossing abilities. Hence, &lt;i&gt;M. dioica&lt;/i&gt; phytocompounds reflects promising therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 infections under comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and kidney disorders.

        <span class="abst" title="Salvia macrosiphon Boiss. is an aromatic perennial herb belonging to the family Lamiaceae. Phytochemical studies and biological activities of this plant have been rarely documented in the literature. The current study aimed to investigate antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of different fractions of aerial parts of S. macrosiphon. Also, we tried to isolate and identify cytotoxic compounds from the plant. In this respect, the hydroalcoholic extract of the corresponding parts of the plant was fractionated into four fractions. Then, antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of each fraction were examined. It was found that the chloroform fraction had a good antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The most potent cytotoxicity was also obtained by the n-hexane fraction comparing with etoposide as the reference drug which was selected for the study and characterization of secondary metabolites. Accordingly, 13-epi manoyl oxide (1), 6α-hydroxy-13-epimanoyl oxide (2), 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyflavone (3), and β-sitosterol (4) were isolated and evaluated for their cytotoxic activity. Among them, compound 1 revealed significant cytotoxicity against A549, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231. It merits mentioning that it showed high selectivity index ratio regarding the low cytotoxic effects on Human Dermal Fibroblast which can be considered as a promising anticancer candidate.">

Malaysia is a country that is rich in medicinal plant species. Hence, this research aims to explore the secondary metabolites, antioxidant, and antiproliferative activities of &lt;i&gt;Dioscorea bulbifera&lt;/i&gt; leaf collected from Endau Rompin, Johor, Malaysia. Antioxidant activity was assessed using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2'-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) assays, while the cytotoxicity of &lt;i&gt;D. bulbifera&lt;/i&gt; on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were assessed using flow cytometry analysis. Phytochemical profiling was conducted using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results showed that methanol extract had the highest antioxidant activity in DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS assays, followed by ethyl acetate and hexane extracts. &lt;i&gt;D. bulbifera&lt;/i&gt; tested against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines showed a pronounced cytotoxic effect with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 8.96 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, 6.88 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, and 3.27 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL in MCF-7 and 14.29 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, 11.86 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, and 7.23 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL in MDA-MB-231, respectively. Cell cycle analysis also indicated that &lt;i&gt;D. bulbifera&lt;/i&gt; prompted apoptosis at various stages, and a significant decrease in viable cells was detected within 24 h and substantially improved after 48 h and 72 h of treatment. Phytochemical profiling of methanol extract revealed the presence of 39 metabolites such as acetic acid, n-hexadecanoic acid, acetin, hexadecanoate, 7-tetradecenal, phytol, octadecanoic acid, cholesterol, palmitic acid, and linolenate. Hence, these findings concluded that &lt;i&gt;D. bulbifera&lt;/i&gt; extract has promising anticancer and natural antioxidant agents. However, further study is needed to isolate the bioactive compounds and validate the effectiveness of this extract in the In &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; model.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases caused by protozoan parasites, which remains a burden for developing countries. The lack of a vaccine as well as the emergence of resistance toward the recommended drugs pose a challenge for the control of the disease. This urges the demand for new antileishmanial agents to prevent and treat this disease. Consequently, four Ethiopian plants were selected and tested for their antileishmanial activity against two Leishmanial parasites.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Methanol (80%) was used to macerate the plant materials. In vitro antipromastigote activity of the crude extracts was then tested against promastigotes and axenically cultured amastigotes of &lt;i&gt;Leishmania aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leishmania donovani&lt;/i&gt; clinical isolates using Alamar Blue assay, and cell viability was measured fluorometrically. 1% DMSO and the media were used as a negative control while amphotericin B was used as a positive control. Furthermore, preliminary phytochemical analysis of the extracts was performed.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;From the four plants' extracts, &lt;i&gt;Ferula communis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Otostegia integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; showed better activity with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 11.38±0.55 and 13.03±0.87 µg/mL against &lt;i&gt;L. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. However, the same plant extracts exhibited lower activity against &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 23.41±2.32 and 17.24±1.29 µg/mL, respectively. &lt;i&gt;O. integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; exhibited highest effect against amastigotes of &lt;i&gt;L. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 16.84±0.65) and &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;:14.55±0.38). &lt;i&gt;F. communis&lt;/i&gt; resulted second highest in growth inhibition against amastigotes of &lt;i&gt;L. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 14.32±0.54 and 31.12±0.19, respectively. The phytochemical analysis of the extracts indicated the presence of phenol, flavonoids, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, and alkaloids.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The findings from this study demonstrate that crude extracts of &lt;i&gt;F. communis&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;O. integrifolia&lt;/i&gt; showed promising antileishmanial activity against &lt;i&gt;L. aethiopica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; that may be attributed to the presence of different secondary metabolites.">

The experimental rats were induced by intra-peritoneal injection of Alloxan monohydrate at a dose of 180 mg/kg after dissolving in normal saline. Clinical biochemistry such as AST, ALT, ALP, urea, creatinine, and cholesterol, blood glucose level, histopathological and preliminary phytochemical screening were evaluated.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Phytochemical tests revealed the presence of different secondary metabolites. Alkaloid, flavonoid, tannin, saponin, phytosteroids, phenols and terpenoids. &lt;i&gt;Moringa stenopetala&lt;/i&gt; (Baker f.) leaves aqueous extract (250 and 500mg/kg) improved the body weight of rats, showed remarkable reduction in blood glucose concentration (P&lt;0.05), and significantly decreased serum urea, creatinine, ALT, AST and ALP (P &lt; 0.05). Levels of serum cholesterol remained unaltered in the experimental groups when compared with diabetic control. Histopathology of non-treated rats showed deterioration of insulin producing pancreas cells; nevertheless, β-cells restoration was observed due to administration of &lt;i&gt;Moringa stenopetala&lt;/i&gt; (Baker f.) aqueous leaves extract.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;It is possible to conclude that oral administration of &lt;i&gt;Moringa stenopetala&lt;/i&gt; (Baker f.) aqueous leaf extracts (250mg/kg and 500mg/kg) for 28 days showed beneficial effects on antihyperglycemia, improved body weight and Alloxan damaged pancreatic β-cells, and restored biochemical changes.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Enhydra fluctuans&lt;/i&gt;, a popular vegetable in Bangladesh, is used in folk medicine to treat diseases of the nervous system. The objective of this study was to investigate the phytochemical profile and cholinesterase inhibitory and antioxidant potential of the extracts of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fluctuans&lt;/i&gt;. Among the four tested extracts, the chloroform extract was found to exert the highest inhibition against both the acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (concentration required for 50% inhibition) values of 83.90 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL and 48.14 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, respectively. Likewise, the chloroform extract showed the highest radical scavenging activity and reducing power. In DPPH radical scavenging assay, the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value was found to be 113.27 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL, and in reducing power assay, the absorbance was found to be 1.916 at a concentration of 50 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL. Phytochemical analyses revealed that the chloroform extract contained 19.16 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract of phenolics and 41.84 mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g extract of flavonoids, which appeared to be the highest among the extracts. A significant correlation was observed between phenolic content and butyrylcholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant activity, while a moderate correlation was seen between flavonoid content and cholinesterase inhibition and antioxidant activity. These findings suggest that &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;fluctuans&lt;/i&gt; is a natural source of cholinesterase inhibitors and antioxidants, which could be utilized as functional foods for Alzheimer's disease management.">

The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the sequestration method of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, the cytotoxic activity was evaluated using &lt;i&gt;Artemia salina&lt;/i&gt;, the larvicidal bioassay was performed with larvae in the third stage of development of the &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquito, and the identification of the metabolites was performed by gas chromatography coupled to the mass spectrometer (GC-MS). The phytochemical oil analysis showed the presence of 20 compounds, with thymol and &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-terpinene being the main ones. It presented antioxidant activity with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of 194.51 &lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;g mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, demonstrating antioxidant activity in the highest concentrations tested.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Alternaria solani&lt;/i&gt;, a plant pathogenic fungus causes significant economical losses of potato crop. The disease is controlled primarily through some traditional methods and most commonly via the application of chemical fungicides. Fungicides treatment is not protected as chemicals pollute environment, effect health vulnerability in humans and when these harmful chemicals enter into the food chain become hazardous to all living entities. Recent efforts have focused on developing environmentally safe, long-lasting, and effective biocontrol methods for the management of plant diseases. Present research focus on screening of crude and partially purified leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;Thevetia peruviana&lt;/i&gt; for the presence of antifungal efficacy against &lt;i&gt;Alternarai solani&lt;/i&gt;. It was observed that 100% alcoholic crude and alcoholic fraction of partially purified extract showed maximum inhibitory activity which is due to the presence of different secondary metabolites, revealed by phytochemical screening. Active column fraction (possess best antifungal activity against &lt;i&gt;Alternaria solani&lt;/i&gt;) was subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GS-MS) analysis. On the basis of peaks matching of GC-MS chromatogram with available data base showed the presence of benzoic acid and oxo-benzoate in active fraction of &lt;i&gt;Thevetia peruviana&lt;/i&gt; leaf extract which is already known chemical among the phytochemicals described for antimicrobial activity. Further research on development of herbal formulation from the same would be very helpful environment friendly approach to manage concern crop disease.">

The structural characteristics were established by UV absorption, FT-IR, HPGPC and GC-MS. Biological studies were carried out, such as &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antioxidant, anticoagulant, anti-tumour and antibacterial activities. The sulfation process changed its physicochemical and biological characteristics. Compared with P3a, the molecular weight of SP3a is reduced. P3a and SP3a are composed of galactose, xylose, arabinose with different molar percentages. Sulfated derivatives have strong antioxidant and anticoagulant properties. Compared with P3a, SP3a showed obvious cytotoxicity to Jurkat and HeLa cells. SP3a showed a higher inhibition zone for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. This article demonstrates that sulfation is an effective way to enhance biological activity, especially SP3a is a promising candidate for bioactive macromolecules and has great potential for industrial and biomedical applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="Acute alcoholism (AAI) is a common emergency. Currently, there is a lack of preventive and therapeutic drugs with superior safety and efficacy. &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Panax ginseng&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pueraria lobata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pueraria&lt;/i&gt; flower, and &lt;i&gt;Hovenia dulcis&lt;/i&gt; Thunb., which are the components of compound turmeric recipe (CTR), are, respectively, used in China as adjuvant therapeutic agents for AAI and alcoholic liver injury, respectively. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of traditional compound turmeric recipe in anti-inebriation treatment and to identify its underlying mechanisms. The mice were administered with CTR mixture, and ethanol was subsequently given to mice by gavage. The effects of CTR on the righting reflex, 24-hour survival, drunken behavior, blood ethanol concentration, and pathological changes of liver are depicted. The activities of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were detected. Besides, the activities of tumor necrosis factor-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; (TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;), interleukin-8 (IL-8), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), cytochrome P450 (P450), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver and the levels of &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-endorphin (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-EP) and leucine enkephalin (LENK) in the brain were also measured. Our results demonstrated that CTR can increase the activities of ADH, ALDH, P450, and SOD and decrease the contents of TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, IL-8, and MDA in the liver. In addition, it can decrease the activities of ALT, AST, and ALP in serum and &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-EP and LENK activities in the brain. CTR showed effects on prevention of acute alcoholism, promoting wakefulness, and alleviating alcoholic liver injury, which were likely mediated by the above mechanisms.">

        <span class="abst" title="Currently, antiviral drugs and/or vaccines are not yet available to treat or prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this review, we narrated the available data, from credible publishers, regarding the possible role of polyphenols and natural extracts-containing polyphenols in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and their immune-boosting properties. It was revealed that polyphenols could be considered as promising biologically active substances for the prevention of COVID-19. The underlying potential mechanism behind this action is mostly due to the antiviral activities and the immune-regulation functions of polyphenols against COVID-19-infections. Antivirus polyphenolic-based medications can mitigate SARS-CoV-2-enzymes, which are vital for virus duplication and infection. It was also found that triterpenoid, anthraquinone, flavonoids, and tannins are possible keys to scheming antiviral therapies for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-proteases. The identified pharmacophore structures of polyphenols could be utilized in the explanation of novel anti-COVID-19 designs. The advantage of using mixtures containing polyphenols is related to the high-safety profile without having major side-effects, but further randomized controlled trials are required in the upcoming studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;Treatment of leishmaniasis with conventional synthetic drugs is a major global challenge. This study was designed to explore the leishmanicidal activity and apoptotic profile of three leaf extracts on &lt;i&gt;Leishmania tropica&lt;/i&gt; stages.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The plants of &lt;i&gt;Quercus velutina, Calotropis procera&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana tabacum&lt;/i&gt; were gathered from Anbarabbad county, in the southeastern part of Kerman province and extracted by maceration method using methanol alcohol. Various concentrations of the extracts (1, 10, 100 and 1000 μg/mL) were used against L. &lt;i&gt;tropica&lt;/i&gt; stages to evaluate the inhibitory effect by colorimetric assay, macrophage model and flow cytometry. The MTT assay was conducted to determine the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values in promastigotes and J774-A1 macrophages, respectively. For intra-macrophage amastigotes, the leishmanicidal activity was evaluated by calculating the mean number of amastigotes in each macrophage and also IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values. The promastigote or amastigote stages with no drug and complete medium without organisms were considered as positive and negative controls, respectively. Meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime) was also used as standard drug. Also, annexin V was used to assess the apoptotic profile. All treatment settings were incubated for a standard time of 72 h in triplicates. Data were analyzed by &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test and ANOVA.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The findings showed that all plant extracts inhibited the proliferation rate of promastigotes and amastigotes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; ˂ 0.001); especially, &lt;i&gt;Q. velutina&lt;/i&gt; represented the lowest IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; in both stages. Besides, &lt;i&gt;Q. velutina&lt;/i&gt; showed the least number of amastigotes in each macrophage compared to the other groups (4.5 μg/mL). The percentage of parasitic apoptosis at 1000 μg/mL of &lt;i&gt;Q. velutina, C. procera, N. tabacum&lt;/i&gt; and Glucantime® were 37.4, 18.6, 8.5 and 52.4, respectively. Amastigotes (clinical stage) were significantly more susceptible to extracts and also Glucantime® than promastigotes (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.001).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;This study revealed that all three extracts of &lt;i&gt;Q. velutina, C. procera and N. tabacum&lt;/i&gt; exhibited an effective antileishmanial activity and induced apoptosis against the L. &lt;i&gt;tropica&lt;/i&gt; promastigotes. Further investigations are essential to isolate and analyze the chemical compositions and their biological properties.">

It exists in two isomeric forms i.e. 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,3-triazole and is used as core molecule for the design and synthesis of many medicinal compounds. 1,2,4-Triazole possess broad spectrum of therapeutically interesting drug candidates such as analgesic, antiseptic, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-urease, anti-inflammatory, diuretics, anticancer, anticonvulsant, antidiabetic and antimigraine agents.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The structures of all synthesized compounds were characterized by physicochemical properties and spectral means (IR and NMR). The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (B. subtilis), Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa and E. coli) bacterial and fungal (C. albicans and A. niger) strains by tube dilution method using ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin and fluconazole as standards. In-vitro antioxidant and anti-urease screening was done by DPPH assay and indophenol method, respectively. The in-vitro anticancer evaluation was carried out against MCF-7 and HCT116 cancer cell lines using 5-FU as standards.&lt;h4&gt;Results, discussion and conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The biological screening results reveal that the compounds T&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (MIC&lt;sub&gt;BS, EC&lt;/sub&gt; = 24.7 µM, MIC&lt;sub&gt;PA&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;CA&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.3 µM) and T&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt; (MIC&lt;sub&gt;AN&lt;/sub&gt; = 27.1 µM) exhibited potent antimicrobial activity as comparable to standards ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin (MIC&lt;sub&gt;Cipro&lt;/sub&gt; = 18.1 µM, MIC&lt;sub&gt;Amo&lt;/sub&gt; = 17.1 µM) and fluconazole (MIC&lt;sub&gt;Flu&lt;/sub&gt; = 20.4 µM), respectively.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Nowadays, medical cannabis still remains inaccesible for patients in the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Even registered medicinal products based on herbal or synthetic cannabinoids, like Sativex, are practically unavailable due to their high cost and narrow scope of application (for example, in Lithuania). However, before the absolute prohibition of medical cannabis in the USSR, in line with Single Convention of 1961, the State Pharmacopoeia of the USSR (eighth edition) published monographs on such medicinal products as &quot;Herba Cannabis indicae&quot;, &quot;Extractum Cannabis indicae spissum&quot; and &quot;Fructus Cannabis&quot;, which could be prescribed by physicians with precaution.&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;Formation of a holistic approach aimed at the creation of appropriate conditions for the development of medical cannabis market and the improvement of life quality and health of Ukrainian patients.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We analyzed legislation and regulation mechanisms for medical cannabis in the USSR, and the present availability of these products for patients in the former USSR, such as Lithuania, Georgia, Estonia, Russian Federation, and Ukraine. Four hundred thirty-five Ukrainian pharmacy students participated in the quantitative analysis (a survey) that took place on April-May, 2019 at Bogomolets National Medical University (Kyiv, Ukraine). They were surveyed about legalization of medical cannabis in Ukraine, advisability of including cannabis and cannabinoids related data into educational programs, and other issues. Qualitative analysis we applied consisted of the stakeholder analysis and Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) analysis. We classified the key stakeholders into the patients, healthcare professionals, legislative and regulatory bodies, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, etc., and ranked them based on their power and interest in the development of potential medical cannabis market in Ukraine. We also identified their expectations and goals. SWOT analysis allows us to evaluate predictable risks and opportunities, as well as strong and weak aspects of the effective development of medical cannabis industry in Ukraine.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;According to the survey among pharmacy students, about 80% support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes. However, two-thirds of them think that there is a risk of illicit turnover. Nearly half of the respondents are not informed or poorly informed about cannabis therapeutic properties. At the same time, nearly 90% consider that materials on medicinal properties of cannabis and cannabinoids should be included in the training program. Nowadays, such stakeholders as legislative and regulatory bodies have the highest power over the development of potential medical cannabis market in Ukraine: more than two million Ukrainian patients still cannot access an effective cannabinoids based treatment. There are over 20 thousand children among them suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy due to the lack of adequate legislation. Moreover, a lot of stakeholders with high level of interest, such as growers, manufacturers of cannabidiol (CBD) products, pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies, higher education institutions, even scientists and healthcare professionals are still waiting for the legalization of cannabis for medical and scientific purposes in Ukraine. SWOT analysis shows that present business structures, educational and scientific institutions, regulatory bodies, and the competency of domestic specialists are strong enough to develop a new market of cannabis-based medicinal products in Ukraine. However, a long-term ban on medical cannabis requires more time for creating the entire ecosystem. This market can be quite attractive in Ukraine. It is characterized by high growth rates, low entry barriers and a substantial demand. Yet, its advancement depends significantly on the appropriate regulatory framework, high level of awareness among health professionals and society as a whole, and involvement in scientific study to become a part of the global medical cannabis market.&lt;h4&gt;Discussion&lt;/h4&gt;The holistic approach is aimed to improve health and life quality of Ukrainian patients through cannabis-based medicinal products. It consists of three components: changes in legislation and regulation procedures; changes to value orientations in society; observance of stakeholders' interests and purposes. Specific recommendations are worked out to realize this approach in Ukraine.">

        <span class="abst" title="Date palm (&lt;i&gt;P. dactylifera&lt;/i&gt;) plays a vital role in ethnomedicinal practices in several parts of the world. There are over 2000 cultivars of date palm that differ in chemical composition and extent of bioactivity. The present study was undertaken to comparatively evaluate the antioxidant potential of three cultivars of date palm (Ajwah, Safawy and Sukkari) from Saudi Arabia and analyze their phenolic constituents in order to draw a rationale for their activity. Antioxidant activities of the date cultivars were evaluated by different quantitative methods including 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radical scavenging assay, total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, total phenolic (TPC), flavonoid (TFC) and tannin content (TTC), while qualitative phenolic composition was determined using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadropole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). All the three date extracts showed good DPPH radical scavenging (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 103-177 μg/mL) and hydroxyl radical scavenging (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 1.1-1.55 mg/mL) activity and total antioxidant capacity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 87-192 μg/mL). The reducing power was also comparable to that of ascorbic acid, used as standard in above experiments. All the three samples contain significant amount of major antioxidant components (phenolic, flavonoid and tannin) that successfully correlates with the results of radical scavenging assays. UPLC-QTOF-MS revealed a total of 22 compounds in these date cultivars classified into common phenolics, flavonoids, sterols and phytoestrogens. Significant variation in the degree of antioxidant activity of these three date cultivars can be attributed to the difference in the content and composition of phenolic compounds.">

This study thus, investigated the antivenom activities of different extract partitions of &lt;i&gt;M. oleifera&lt;/i&gt; leaves against &lt;i&gt;N. haje&lt;/i&gt; envenoming&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Forty five male rats were divided into nine groups (n = 5). Groups 2 to 9 were envenomed with 0.025 mg/kg (LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;. haje&lt;/i&gt; venom while group 1 was given saline. Group 2 was left untreated, while group 3 was treated with polyvalent antivenom, groups 4, 6 and 8 were treated with 300 mg/kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of N-hexane, ethylacetate and ethanol partitions of &lt;i&gt;M. oleifera,&lt;/i&gt; respectively. Groups 5, 7 and 9 were also treated with 600 mgkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;of the partitions&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; respectively. Ethanol extract and ethyl acetate partition of &lt;i&gt;M. oleifera&lt;/i&gt; significantly improved haematological indices following acute anaemia induced by the venom. Likewise, haemorrhagic, haemolytic and anti-coagulant activities of &lt;i&gt;N. haje&lt;/i&gt; venom were best inhibited by ethanol partition. Envenoming significantly down-regulated Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) with the consequent elevation of antioxidant enzymes activities in the serum and brain. Treatment with extract partitions however, elevated Nrf2 levels while normalising antioxidant enzyme activities. Furthermore, there were reduction in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and interleukin-1β) in tissues of treated envenomed rats. This study concludes that ethanol partition of &lt;i&gt;M. oleifera&lt;/i&gt; was most effective against &lt;i&gt;N. haje&lt;/i&gt; venom and could be considered as a potential source for antivenom metabolites.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Wounds are major problems of developing countries that can be managed alternatively using traditional medicinal plants. Since majority of currently available drugs for wound management are expensive and pose problems such as allergy and drug resistance, it is pivotal for the world to have intensified inquiries on the claimed medicinal plants to come up with wound healing chemicals being affordable, effective and safe. Ethiopian traditional healers recruit a wide range of medicinal plants with wound healing activities. Root bark juice of &lt;i&gt;Brucea antidysentrica&lt;/i&gt;, the leaves of &lt;i&gt;Rhamnus prinoides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dodonaea angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; are claimed among others in the folklore medicine. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo wound healing activities of the root bark juice of &lt;i&gt;Brucea antidysentrica&lt;/i&gt;, the leaves of &lt;i&gt;Rhamnus prinoides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dodonaea angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; in mice.&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;The root bark juice of &lt;i&gt;Brucea antidysentrica&lt;/i&gt;, the leaves of &lt;i&gt;Rhamnus prinoides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Dodonaea angustifolia&lt;/i&gt; were collected, dried, ground to coarse powders. Then the crude extract was obtained by macerating with 80% methanol. The filtrate was dried, reconstituted in appropriate solvent and the wound healing activity was evaluated using excision and incision wound models.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;On the last day of treatment, 80% methanol extracts from the selected medicinal plants showed a significant wound healing activity against control as supported by an increase in % wound contraction and a decrease in Epithelialization period. Ten percent of &lt;i&gt;Rhamnus prinoides&lt;/i&gt; showed significant wound contraction against the control (P &lt; 0.05) on days 2 and 4. But on day 6; except 5% extracts of &lt;i&gt;Brucea antidysentrica&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rhamnus prinoides&lt;/i&gt;; all doses of extracts contracted the wound significantly (P &lt; 0.05). Extracts of Dodonea angustifolia (5% &amp; 10%) and 10% of &lt;i&gt;Rhamnus prinoides&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Brucea&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;antidysentrica&lt;/i&gt; increases wound contraction rate with increasing significant level on days 8 &amp; 10 (P &lt; 0.01) and 12 &amp;14 (P &lt; 0.001). Among the extracts, 10% of Dodonea angustifolia showed maximum percent (99.9%; P &lt; 0.001) of wound contraction followed by 5% Dodonea angustifolia (99.15%; P &lt; 0.001) and 10% &lt;i&gt;Rhamnus prinoides&lt;/i&gt; (99.00%; P &lt; 0.001) on the last day of treatment. In addition; significantly shorter healing time was attained by 5% &amp;10% leaves of Dodonea angustifolia (P &lt; 0.01), 10% leaves &lt;i&gt;Rhamnus prinoides&lt;/i&gt; &amp; root barks &lt;i&gt;Brucea antidysentrica&lt;/i&gt; (P &lt; 0.05).

Biosynthesis of AuNPs using plant extract is considered a simple, low-cost, and eco-friendly approach. Brazilian Red Propolis (BRP), a product of bees, exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. Here, we described the biosynthesis of AuNPs using BRP extract (AuNP&lt;sub&gt;extract&lt;/sub&gt;) and its fractions (AuNP&lt;sub&gt;hexane&lt;/sub&gt;, AuNP&lt;sub&gt;dichloromethane&lt;/sub&gt;, AuNP&lt;sub&gt;ethyl acetate&lt;/sub&gt;) and evaluated their structural properties and their potential against microorganisms and cancer cells. AuNPs showed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 535 nm. The sizes and morphologies were influenced by the BRP sample used in the reaction. FTIR and TGA revealed the involvement of bioactive compounds from BRP extract or its fractions in the synthesis and stabilization of AuNPs. AuNP&lt;sub&gt;dichloromethane&lt;/sub&gt; and AuNP&lt;sub&gt;hexane&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited antimicrobial activities against all strains tested, showing their efficacy as antimicrobial agents to treat infectious diseases. AuNPs showed dose-dependent cytotoxic activity both in T24 and PC-3 cells. AuNP&lt;sub&gt;dichloromethane&lt;/sub&gt; and AuNP&lt;sub&gt;extract&lt;/sub&gt; exhibited the highest in vitro cytotoxic effect. Also, the cytotoxicity of biogenic nanoparticles was induced by mechanisms associated with apoptosis. The results highlight a potential low-cost green method using Brazilian red propolis to synthesize AuNPs, which demonstrated significant biological properties.">

In several reports, there are findings related to the use of this plant extract that demonstrate its therapeutic value. However, very few attempts have been made to identify the extensive metabolite composition of this plant. Here, we performed metabolite profiling and identification from the bark of &lt;i&gt;A. salviifolium&lt;/i&gt; by extracting the sample in organic and aqueous solvents. The organic and aqueous extracts were fraction-collected using the Agilent 1260 Analytical Scale Fraction Collection System. Each of the fractions was analyzed on Liquid Chromatogaphy/Quadrupole Time-of-Flight LC/Q-TOF and Gas Chromatography/Quadrupole Time-of-Flight GC/instruments. The Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) analyses were performed using Hydrophilic Ineraction Liquid Chromatography (HILIC), as well as reversed-phase chromatography using three separate, orthogonal reverse phase columns. Samples were analyzed using an Agilent Jet Stream (AJS) source in both positive and negative ionization modes. The compounds found were flavonoids, fatty acids, sugars, and terpenes. Eighty-one secondary metabolites were identified as having therapeutic potential. The data produced was against the METLIN database using accurate mass and/or MS/MS library matching. Compounds from &lt;i&gt;Alangium&lt;/i&gt; that could not be identified by database or library matching were subsequently searched against the ChemSpider) database of over 30 million structures using MSMS data and Agilent MSC software.In order to identify compounds generated by GC/MS, the data were searched against the AgilentFiehn GCMS Metabolomics Library as well as the Wiley/NIST libraries.">

Among them, compound &lt;b&gt;4c&lt;/b&gt; was identified as the most potent AChE inhibitor (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 3.3 µM) and showed the highest selectivity for AChE over BuChE (ratio &gt;30:1). Molecular docking studies suggested that compound &lt;b&gt;4c&lt;/b&gt; interacts with both the peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic anionic site (CAS) regions of AChE. ADMET analysis confirmed the therapeutic potential of compound &lt;b&gt;4c&lt;/b&gt; based on its blood-brain barrier penetrating.

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Dodonaea viscosa&lt;/i&gt; is a medicinal plant which is being used to treat various diseases in humans. The available safety data suggest that the plant does not produce any side effects, or toxicity, in tested adult experimental animals. However, the influence of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; on fetus or embryonic development is largely not known. This study was conducted in order to find out the reproductive toxicity of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; in experimental animals. Zebrafish embryos were used as the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; developmental toxicity animal model. Methanolic crude extract, hexane, chloroform, and butanol fractions were prepared from the leaves of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt;. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to serial dilution of crude extract and other fractions. The crude extract and hexane fraction induced higher level of toxicity in zebrafish embryos as compared to chloroform and butanol fractions. The phenol and flavonoid estimation revealed that crude leaves extract and hexane fractions had lower content of phenol and flavonoid. Two major compounds, phytol and methyl ester, of hexadecanoic acid were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS) analysis. More detailed studies are needed to check the toxicity of &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; in pregnant experimental animals; however, the results from this study have shown that &lt;i&gt;D. viscosa&lt;/i&gt; possesses reproductive toxicity and its use and doses must be carefully monitored in pregnant patients.">

However, the purification/detoxification and incineration techniques for all minerals/metals are not mentioned in Vatikaaprakarana, and these techniques were collected from journal articles published between 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; January 2000 and 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; June 2020 through searching PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, USA), Science Direct (RELX Group, Netherlands), and Semantic Scholar (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, USA).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Ten herbo-mineral formulations were selected, and purification/detoxification or incineration techniques were described in brief for copper sulphate, aluminum sulfate, borex powder, sulphur, sodium chloride, cinnabar, arsenicals, realgar, orpiment, ammonium chloride, magnesium silicate, zinc, and mercury.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The review has demonstrated different types of purification/detoxification or incineration techniques of minerals used in herbo-mineral preparations. In addition, there is an urgent need for comprehensive survey or evaluation to check whether purification/detoxification or incineration techniques of metals/minerals are practiced properly in the country.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Background&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Asphodelus tenuifolius&lt;/i&gt; Cav. (Asphodelaceae) is widely used in Pakistan traditional medicine as a hypotensive and diuretic agent. Despite the cardioprotective effects described for &lt;i&gt;A. tenuifolius&lt;/i&gt;, the mechanisms involved in its probable hypotensive and diuretic effects have never been evaluated. Firstly, different extracts from &lt;i&gt;A. tenuifolius&lt;/i&gt; seeds were obtained, and their antioxidant profiles and chemical constituents by LC-DAD-were determined, including molecular networking by the GNPS platform. Then, to evaluate changes in blood pressure, different groups of anesthetized normotensive rats were intravenously treated with the crude extract (AT-Cr, 1-50 mg/kg), aqueous (AS-AT, 1-25 mg/kg), n-butanol (BS-AT, 1-50 mg/kg), and dichloromethane fraction (DS-AT, 1-80 mg/kg). The diuretic effects of AT-Cr, AS-AT, BS-AT, and DS-AT at 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg, p.o. doses, were also evaluated in comparison with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ, 10 mg/kg, p.o). The urinary volume, sodium, potassium, and pH were estimated in the sample collected for 6 h from saline-loaded rats. Using pharmacological antagonists or inhibitors, we determine the involvement of acetylcholine, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide in &lt;i&gt;A. tenuifolius&lt;/i&gt;-induced hypotensive and diuresis action. In addition, the activities of angiotensin-converting enzyme, erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, and renal Na+/K+/ATPase were evaluated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Acute treatment with crude extract and fractions of &lt;i&gt;A. tenuifolius&lt;/i&gt; exhibited significant hypotensive and diuretic potential in normotensive rats. However, AS-AT produced the most potent and significant dose-dependent hypotension and diuretic effects in normotensive rats. Previous treatment with atropine significantly reduced the hypotensive and diuretic action of AS-AT, but pretreatment with indomethacin or L-NAME did not affect these effects. Moreover, the 7-day treatment with AS-AT did not reduce activities of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme, erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, and renal Na+/K+/ATPase. AS-AT showed four major compound node clusters, which included sugars, alkaloids, nucleoside, amino acid, and glycosylated flavonoids. This research supports and extends the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;A. tenuifolius&lt;/i&gt; as a hypotensive and diuretic agent. The results showed that AS-AT from &lt;i&gt;A. tenuifolius&lt;/i&gt; could present compounds responsible for hypotensive and diuretic activities through the activation of muscarinic receptors.">

        <span class="abst" title="In ethnopharmacological research, many field assessment tools exist. Yet, these miss that critical point of how to really determine which species merit the costly lab studies, e.g., evaluation of traditional use via pharmacological assays and isolation of bioactive secondary metabolites. This gap can be filled with the introduction of a new tool for literature assessment: the Degrees of Publication (DoPs). In this study, its application is illustrated through an extensive bibliographic assessment of 16 medicinal plant species that were recently identified in the Greater Mpigi region of Uganda as being frequently used by local traditional healers in the treatment of medical disorders (namely, &lt;i&gt;Albizia coriaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cassine buchananii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Combretum molle&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Erythrina abyssinica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ficus saussureana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Harungana madagascariensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Leucas calostachys&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Microgramma lycopodioides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Morella kandtiana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Plectranthus hadiensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Securidaca longipedunculata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sesamum calycinum&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;angustifolium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Solanum aculeastrum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Toddalia asiatica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Warburgia ugandensis,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Zanthoxylum chalybeum&lt;/i&gt;). These species are suspected to be understudied, and a thorough bibliographic assessment has not been previously performed. Thus, the objectives of our study were to undertake a comparative assessment of the degree to which each of these plant species has been studied in the past, including evaluation of the quality of the journals where results were published in. The determination of the DoPs enabled successful assessment of the degrees to which each individual plant species has been studied so far, while also taking into account the methodological &quot;research chain of ethnopharmacology&quot; from ethnobotanical studies (&quot;traditional use&quot;) to pharmacological assays (&quot;bioactivity&quot;) and finally to pharmacognostic research (&quot;structure elucidation&quot;). The significance of a research paper was assessed by determining whether its journal and publishing house were members of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). In total, 634 peer-reviewed publications were reviewed covering the period of 1960-2019, 53.3% of which were published in journals and by publishing houses affiliated with COPE (338 publications). The literature assessment resulted in the identification of understudied plants among the selected species. The majority of plants reviewed have not been sufficiently studied; six species were classified as being highly understudied and three more as being understudied: &lt;i&gt;C. buchananii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;F. saussureana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;L. calostachys&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;M. lycopodioides&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;M. kandtiana&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;S. calycinum&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;angustifolium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A. coriaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. hadiensis,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. aculeastrum,&lt;/i&gt; respectively. The newly introduced DoPs are a useful tool for the selection of traditionally used species for future laboratory studies, especially for pharmacological bioassays, isolation procedures, and drug discovery strategies.">

        <span class="abst" title="The present study investigated the effects of hot water extracts of 22 medicinal plants used traditionally to treat diabetes on Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) activity both in vitro and in vivo in high-fat fed (HFF) obese-diabetic rats. Fluorometric assay was employed to determine the DPP-IV activity. For in vivo studies, HFF obese-diabetic rats were fasted for 6 h and blood was sampled at different times before and after the oral administration of the glucose alone (18 mmol/kg body weight) or with either of the four most active plant extracts (250 mg/5 ml/kg, body weight) or established DPP-IV inhibitors (10 μmol/5 ml/kg). DPP-IV inhibitors: sitagliptin, vildagliptin and diprotin A, decreased enzyme activity by a maximum of 95-99% (P&lt;0.001). Among the 22 natural anti-diabetic plants tested, AnogeissusLatifolia exhibited the most significant (P&lt;0.001) inhibitory activity (96 ± 1%) with IC50 and IC25 values of 754 and 590 μg/ml. Maximum inhibitory effects of other extracts: Aegle marmelos, Mangifera indica, Chloropsis cochinchinensis, Trigonella foenum-graecum and Azadirachta indica were (44 ±7%; 38 ± 4%; 31±1%; 28±2%; 27±2%, respectively). A maximum of 45% inhibition was observed with &gt;25 μM concentrations of selected phytochemicals (rutin). A.latifolia, A. marmelos, T. foenum-graecum and M. indica extracts improved glucose tolerance, insulin release, reduced DPP-IV activity and increased circulating active GLP-1 in HFF obese-diabetic rats (P&lt;0.05-0.001). These results suggest that ingestion of selected natural anti-diabetic plants, in particular A. latifolia, A. marmelos, T. foenum-graecum and M. indica can substantially inhibit DPP-IV and improve glucose homeostasis, thereby providing a useful therapeutic approach for the treatment of T2DM.">

This tree grows naturally in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. Local inhabitants use fruits, leaves, roots, stem and root bark of the species for the treatment of various ailments. Several research studies demonstrate that extracts and phytochemicals isolated from desert date display antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective and molluscicidal activities. Mesocarp of fruits, seeds, leaves, stem and root bark are rich sources of saponins. These tissues are also rich in phenolic acids, flavonoids, coumarins, alkaloids and polysterols. Some constituents show antioxidant, anticancer and antidiabetic properties. The objective of this review is to summarize studies on diverse bioactive compounds and the beneficial properties of &lt;i&gt;B. aegyptiaca&lt;/i&gt;.">

Centaury is an emerging model in plant developmental biology due to its vigorous regenerative potential and great developmental plasticity when cultured in vitro. Hereby, we review nearly two decades of research on somatic embryogenesis (SE) in centaury. During SE, somatic cells are induced by suitable culture conditions to express their totipotency, acquire embryogenic characteristics, and eventually give rise to somatic embryos. When SE is initiated from centaury root explants, the process occurs spontaneously (on hormone-free medium), directly (without the callusing phase), and the somatic embryos are of unicellular origin. SE from leaf explants has to be induced by plant growth regulators and is indirect (preceded by callusing). Histological observations and culture conditions are compared in these two systems. The changes in antioxidative enzymes were followed during SE from the leaf explants. Special focus is given to the role of arabinogalactan proteins during SE, which were analyzed using a variety of approaches. The newest and preliminary results, including centaury transcriptome, novel potential SE markers, and novel types of arabinogalactan proteins, are discussed as perspectives of centaury research.">

Among them, the so-called &quot;antioxidants&quot; have a major potentiality to increase human wellness. Antioxidants are important components in the signaling and defense mechanisms in some plants, where they are precursors of compounds of greater complexity, the modulator of plant growth, and the defensive system against pathogenic organisms and predators. The extraordinary variety of chemical structure and substitution present in the different plant antioxidants make them an inestimable source of interesting compounds, with the ability to counter reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and to stimulate the activation of signal cascade inside the cells. The mechanisms by which antioxidants detoxify these dangerous compounds are complex and involve either direct or indirect interaction with radicals. Antioxidants inhibit or quench free radical reactions mainly based on their reducing capacity or hydrogen atom-donating capacity, their solubility, and chelating properties. Moreover, their ability to modulate key metabolic enzymes and activate/block gene transcription also has remarkable importance.">

Chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods were used for the analysis of polyphenols and the antioxidant capacity was assessed in vitro with DPPH&lt;sup&gt;●&lt;/sup&gt; (2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazil) and FRAP (ferric-reducing antioxidant power) tests. The cardio-protective effects of &lt;i&gt;Cichorii&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;herba&lt;/i&gt; tincture on myocardial ischemia induced by isoprenaline and nephroprotection on renal failure induced by gentamicin were evaluated on rats. Also, aspartate aminotrasferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and creatinine clearance (CrCl) were measured. The antioxidant effect was evaluated by determining total oxidative stress (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondyaldehide (MDA), total thiols (SH) and total nitrites and nitrates (NOx). Cichoric acid was the main polyphenolic compound. The extracts had moderate in vitro antioxidant activity but the in vivo antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects were significant and associated with myocardial and renal dysfunction improvement. The results were attributed to the content of polyphenols in the extracts, for which reason &lt;i&gt;C. intybus&lt;/i&gt; may be considered an important raw material for pharmaceuticals formulations recommended in the prevention or treatment of heart or kidney diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="While dengue virus (DENV) infection imposes a serious challenge to the survival of humans worldwide, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) remains the most devastating pandemic in human history. A significant number of studies have shown that plant-derived substances could serve as potential candidates for the development of safe and efficacious remedies for combating these diseases. Different scientific databases were used to source for literature on plants used against these infections. Thirty-five studies described the traditional use of 25 species from 20 families for treating DENV infection with &lt;i&gt;Carica papaya&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Euphorbia hirta&lt;/i&gt; were the most widely used across different regions. 13 in vivo studies, 32 in vitro studies, and eight clinical studies were conducted on 30 species from 25 families against different DENV serotypes, while plants from 13 families were reported to inhibit different forms of SARS-CoV, all of which were investigated through in vitro studies. Phytoconstituents belonging to various chemical classes were identified to show a wide range of antiviral activity against these infections. Extensive studies on the potentials of medicinal plants are needed to confirm their efficacy. This paper reveals the capabilities of medicinal plants and their phytochemicals in inhibiting DENV and SARS-CoV infections.">

Preclinical and clinical studies have reported the predominant anti-inflammatory activity of several &lt;i&gt;Curcuma&lt;/i&gt; species. This review provides an overview of the anti-inflammatory effects of different extracts, preparations, and bioactive components in this genus. This analysis may provide a scientific basis for developing new and alternative methods for the isolation of a single entity from this genus to attenuate inflammatory conditions.

Frequent mutations in its genome structure often result in resistance to standard medications. Thus, new generations of treatments are critical to combat this ever-evolving infection. Plant materials and active compounds have been tested for many years, including, more recently, active compounds like flavonoids. Quercetin is a compound belonging to the flavonols class and has shown therapeutic effects against influenza virus. The focus of this review includes viral pathogenesis as well as the application of quercetin and its derivatives as a complementary therapy in controlling influenza and its related symptoms based on the targets. We also touch on the potential of this class of compounds for treatment of SARS-COV-2, the cause of new pandemic.">

For this purpose, total phenols, flavonoids, carotenoids, and chlorophyll contents were quantified. The antioxidant effect was investigated by using different in vitro tests (β-carotene, ferric reducing ability power (FRAP), 2,2'-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), whereas the potential inhibitory activity of key enzymes linked to obesity was screened against lipase, α-amylase, and α-glucosidase. Generally, the phytochemical content followed the trend: fresh &gt; blanching water &gt; blanched samples. The same trend was observed in the antioxidant activity independently of the applied test as well as in the inhibition of lipase and carbohydrates-hydrolysing enzymes. In particular, fresh &lt;i&gt;Hypochaeris laevigata&lt;/i&gt; (HL1) showed the lowest inhibitory concentration 50% (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) values of 31.3 and 42.7 μg/mL, against α-glucosidase and α-amylase, respectively, whereas fresh &lt;i&gt;Hyoseris radiata&lt;/i&gt; (HRA1) showed the most promising hypolipidemic activity (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 39.8 μg/mL). Collectively, these results support the health effect of these wild plants and demonstrated that blanching water should be reused in food preparation since it is a good source of bioactive compounds and its consumption should be recommended in order to increase the uptake of micronutrients.">

The maximum productivity of IAA was recorded for &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt; BI-8 and &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; BI-10 with values of 117 ± 6 and 108 ± 4.6 μg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, in the presence of 5 mg mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; tryptophan after 10 days. These two isolates had a high potential in phosphate solubilization and ammonia production, and they showed enzymatic activities for amylase, protease, xylanase, cellulase, chitinase, and catalase. In vitro antagonistic investigation showed their high efficacy against the three phytopathogens &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Alternaria alternata&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pythium ultimum&lt;/i&gt;, with inhibition percentages ranging from 20% ± 0.2% to 52.6% ± 0.2% (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.05).

The purpose of this study is to enrich the information on the composition of the Bulgarian &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria&lt;/i&gt; species in terms of both polyphenolic content as well as primary metabolites such as mono-, oligosaccharides and organic acids. An aerial part of three &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria&lt;/i&gt; species growing in four low mountain regions of Southern Bulgaria was used. The flavonoids scutellarin, baicalin, baicalein, wogonin, wogonoside, luteolin, chrysin and a caffeoyl phenylethanoid glycoside-verbascoside have been identified via HPLC in different extracts from &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria altissima, Scutellaria albida&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria galericulata&lt;/i&gt;. The antioxidant activity of the extracts has been evaluated. The &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria altissima&lt;/i&gt; from Mezek and &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria galericulata&lt;/i&gt; from Parvenets we studied, which are the richest in flavonoids (represented mainly by baicalin, scutellarin and wogonoside), show the highest Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity. Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity of &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria albida&lt;/i&gt; from Mezek and &lt;i&gt;Scutellaria altissima&lt;/i&gt; from Bachkovo is the most pronounced, probably due to the content of scutellarin and luteolin and chrysin, respectively. Antioxidant activity of aqueous, methanolic and 70% and 96% ethanol extracts were also determined by the electrochemical method.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Heliotropium&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most important plant genera to have conventional folklore importance, and hence is a potential source of bioactive compounds. Thus, the present study was designed to explore the therapeutic potential of &lt;i&gt;Heliotropium crispum&lt;/i&gt; Desf., a relatively under-explored medicinal plant species. Methanolic extracts prepared from a whole plant of &lt;i&gt;H. crispum&lt;/i&gt; were studied for phytochemical composition and possible in vitro and in silico biological properties. Antioxidant potential was assessed via six different assays, and enzyme inhibition potential against key clinical enzymes involved in neurodegenerative diseases (acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE)), diabetes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase), and skin problems (tyrosinase) was assayed. Phytochemical composition was established via determination of the total bioactive contents and reverse phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (RP-UHPLC-MS) analysis. Chemical profiling revealed the tentative presence of 50 secondary metabolites. The plant extract exhibited significant inhibition against AChE and BChE enzymes, with values of 3.80 and 3.44 mg GALAE/g extract, respectively. Further, the extract displayed considerable free radical scavenging activity against DPPH and ABTS radicals, with potential values of 43.19 and 41.80 mg TE/g extract, respectively. In addition, the selected compounds were then docked against the tested enzymes, which have shown high inhibition affinity. To conclude, &lt;i&gt;H. crispum&lt;/i&gt; was found to harbor bioactive compounds and showed potent biological activities which could be further explored for potential uses in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries, particularly as a neuroprotective agent.">

        <span class="abst" title="Plants and their constituents have been used to treat diverse ailments since time immemorial. Many plants are used in diverse external and internal formulations (infusions, alcoholic extracts, essential oils (EOs), etc.) in the treatment of inflammation-associated diseases, such as those affecting the respiratory tract or causing gastrointestinal or joint problems, among others. To support the traditional uses of plant extracts, EOs have been assessed for their alleged anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of EOs on the release of cytokines and chemokines has been much less reported. Considering their traditional use and commercial relevance in Portugal and Angola, this study evaluated the effect of EOs on the in vitro inhibition of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells). Twenty EOs extracted from eighteen species from seven families, namely from Amaranthaceae (&lt;i&gt;Dysphania ambrosioides&lt;/i&gt;), Apiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Foeniculum vulgare&lt;/i&gt;), Asteraceae (&lt;i&gt;Brachylaena huillensis&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Solidago virgaurea&lt;/i&gt;), Euphorbiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Spirostachys africana&lt;/i&gt;), Lamiaceae (&lt;i&gt;Lavandula luisieri&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mentha cervina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Origanum majorana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Satureja montana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymbra capitata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus mastichina&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Thymus zygis&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;zygis&lt;/i&gt;), Myrtaceae (&lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/i&gt; subsp. &lt;i&gt;maidenii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus radiata&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus viminalis&lt;/i&gt;) and Pinaceae (&lt;i&gt;Pinus pinaster&lt;/i&gt;) were assayed for the release of CCL2 and TNF-α by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. &lt;i&gt;B. huillensis, S. africana, S. montana, Th. mastichina&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Th. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt; EOs showed toxicity to THP-1 cells, at the lowest concentration tested (10 μg/mL), using the tetrazolium dye assay. The most active EOs in reducing TNF-α release by LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells were those of &lt;i&gt;T. capitata&lt;/i&gt; (51% inhibition at 20 μg/mL) and &lt;i&gt;L. luisieri&lt;/i&gt; (15-23% inhibition at 30 μg/mL and 78-83% inhibition at 90 μg/mL). &lt;i&gt;L. luisieri&lt;/i&gt; EO induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of CCL2 release by LPS‑stimulated THP-1 cells (23%, 54% and 82% inhibition at 10, 30 and 90 μg/mL, respectively). These EOs are potentially useful in the management of inflammatory diseases mediated by CCL2 and TNF‑α, such as atherosclerosis and arthritis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Treatment of wounds is essential as the wound can also be lethal at some point in time if not healed properly. Ethnomedicinal plants can treat wounds as they have no side effects, whereas, in the case of chemical drugs, the side effects are on the rise. In this study, seeds of &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; which is the essential ethnomedicinal plant, were studied for wound healing efficacy. The study was planned for the assessment of in vitro (antioxidant and antimicrobial activities) and in vivo (excision and incision wound healing models) wound healing efficacy of n-hexane extract and hydrogels of &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; seeds. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities were assessed by DPPH free radical scavenging assay and Agar well diffusion method, respectively. In excision and incision wound models, Swiss albino mice were used for wound healing efficacy of hydrogels, i.e., 5% and 10% hexane extracts of &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; seeds. The n-hexane extract showed antioxidant as well as antibacterial activities. Moreover, the hydrogels formulated using n-hexane extract of &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; seeds showed significant wound healing activity compared to both control and standard until the end of the protocol in both the models. Furthermore, the histopathological investigation confirmed the findings of accelerated regeneration of tissue accompanied by a decrease in inflammatory cells and increased vascularity of the immediate skin. The results (both in vitro and in vivo) claimed conclusively that our n-hexane hydrogel formulation of &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt; seeds might serve as an alternative therapy in skin restoration during wound healing.">

The results of the present study indicated that black seed supplementation significantly increased growth performance and muscles protein contents of rohu over un-supplemented ones. Lipid peroxidation levels significantly decreased in all the studied tissues (liver, gills, kidney and brain) of black seed fed rohu, whereas the antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase and reduced glutathione) activities were increased in all the studied tissues of black seed supplemented rohu at each sampling day. The hepatic-nephric marker enzymes levels were decreased for black seed fed rohu. The present study showed that tested black seed levels are safe for rohu. Black seed is cheaply available in local markets of Pakistan; therefore, based on the results of the present study, it is suggested that black seed has potential to be used as natural growth promoter and antioxidant in the diet of rohu.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Andropogon virginicus&lt;/i&gt; is an invasive weed that seriously threatens agricultural production and economics worldwide. In this research, dried aerial parts of &lt;i&gt;A. virginicus&lt;/i&gt; were extracted, applying Soxhlet and liquid-liquid phase methods to acquire the total crude (T-Anvi), hexane (H-Anvi), ethyl acetate (E-Anvi), butanol (B-Anvi), and water (W-Anvi) extracts, respectively. In which, T-Anvi contains the highest total phenolic and flavonoid contents (24.80 mg gallic acid and 37.40 mg rutin equivalents per g dry weight, respectively). Via anti-radical (ABTS and DPPH), and reducing power assays, E-Anvi exhibits the most potent activities (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 13.96, 43.59 and 124.11 µg/mL, respectively), stronger than butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a standard antioxidant, while the lipid peroxidation inhibitory effect of E-Anvi (LPI = 90.85% at the concentration of 500 µg/mL) is close to BHT. E-Anvi shows the most substantial inhibition (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.58 mg/mL) on tyrosinase. Notably, α-amylase is significantly suppressed by H-Anvi (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.72 mg/mL), over twice stronger than the positive control, palmitic acid. In the cytotoxic assay, E-Anvi is the strongest extract inhibiting K562 cells (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 112.01 µg/mL). Meanwhile, T-Anvi shows the highest prevention on Meg-01 expansion (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 91.40 µg/mL). Dominant compounds detected in E-Anvi by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) are identified as flavonoids. However, among four major compounds identified in H-Anvi by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), palmitic acid and phytol are the most abundant compounds with peak areas of 27.97% and 16.42%, respectively. In essence, this is the first report describing that &lt;i&gt;A. virginicus&lt;/i&gt; is a potential natural source of antioxidants, tyrosinase and α-amylase inhibitors, and anti-chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) agents which may be useful in future therapeutics as promising alternative medicines.">

It can adapt to regions affected by climate change, such as the Mediterranean basin, since it is a crop with a great resistance to high temperatures. In this study an in-depth bibliographical review was carried out by consulting different databases (Science Direct, FSTA, Scielo, Riunet, and Google Scholar) in order to find published scientific studies on the characteristics of this crop and its agronomic requirements. According to the information found, all parts of the &lt;i&gt;Moringa oleifera&lt;/i&gt;, namely the leaves, pods, seeds, roots and flowers, can be used in different industrial sectors such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, human food, animal feed, and water treatment since they have a nutritional profile rich in high biological value proteins, vitamins A and C, antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and minerals: calcium, iron, potassium, and phosphorous.">

Linds is an extensively used species in traditional medicinal systems in several areas of the world due to some important medicinal properties such as antioxidant, antibacterial, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities. In East Timor, different parts of this fern are used either as remedies or as food. The ingestion of a broth made from its rhizome improves lactation, and young fronds of this fern are boiled and eaten with rice by the locals. Nevertheless, its chemical profile is far from being established. The present work aims to establish the chemical profile of both rhizomes and leaves &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane extracts by Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed the leaves richness in fatty acids with interesting nutritional values (ω-6/ω-3 = 0.68, AI = 0.59, TI = 0.30), being linolenic acid (253.71 ± 0.93 mg/g dry leaves) and palmitic acid (237.27 ± 0.59 mg/g dry leaves) the significant compounds in the extract. Whereas the rhizome extract is mostly rich in terpenoids, such as steroid, cycloartane, and hopanoid derivatives, being hop-16-ene (166.45 ± 0.53 mg/g dry rhizome) and β-sitosterol (50.76 ± 0.11 mg/g dry rhizome) the major compounds. Several compounds are reported for the first time in the species, and the data herein reported contributes to confirming the species nutritional value.">

Furthermore, we determined the expression of antioxidant genes (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD1 and SOD2) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) by qRT-PCR. In vivo, we investigated the neuroprotective effect of LRE, not only against an Aβ-induced deficit in chemotaxis behavior (Alzheimer model) but also against PolyQ40 formation (model for Morbus Huntington) in transgenic &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Only LRE significantly reduced both apoptosis and intracellular ROS levels and significantly increased the expression of antioxidant genes after glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 cells. In addition, LRE significantly improved the Chemotaxis Index (CI) in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and significantly decreased PolyQ40 aggregation. Altogether, the LRE exhibited neuroprotective properties both in vitro and in vivo.">

The honeys exhibited standard moisture content (&lt;20%), electrical conductivity (&lt;0.8 mS/cm), acidic pH, and monosaccharides (&gt;60%), except olive honey (&lt;60% total monosaccharides). They all expressed non-Newtonian behavior and 05 typical regions of the FTIR spectra as those of natural ones. Guggul and arjuna, manuka honeys showed the highest phenolic contents, correlating with their significant antioxidant activities. Arjuna, guggul and manuka honeys demonstrated the agreement of total cholesterol reduction and the transcriptional levels of &lt;i&gt;AMPK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SREBP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;HCMGR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;LDLR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;LXRα&lt;/i&gt;. Jiaogulan honey showed the least antioxidant content and activity, but it was the most cytotoxic. Both jiaogulan and olive honeys modulated the tested gene in the pattern that should lead to a lower TC content, but this reduction did not occur after 24 h. All 2% concentrations of tested honeys elicited a clearer effect on &lt;i&gt;NQO1&lt;/i&gt; gene expression. In conclusion, the new honeys complied with international norms for natural honeys and we provide partial evidence for the protective effects of manuka, arjuna and guggul honeys amongst the tested ones on key biomarkers of oxidative stress and cholesterol homeostasis, pending further studies to better understand their modes of action.">

Mainly due to the polyphenols contained in &lt;i&gt;S. hortensis&lt;/i&gt; L., this plant exhibits multiple biological effects. However, therapeutic effects on cells, including skin tumors, have not yet been studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the composition and the resulting antioxidant as well as biological properties [on melanocytes and melanoma cells] of summer, savory growing in botanical garden of Vytautas Magnus University in middle Lithuania climatic conditions, collected during various phases of vegetation. It has been shown that the budding phase alcohol extract of this plant contains the largest amounts of polyphenols, including rutin and rosemary acid, which promote the radical scavenging activity and antioxidant properties. In contrast, the extract from the massive flowering phase already at a concentration of 12.5 µg/mL reduces the survival of melanoma cells to 60% with 90% melanocytes survival. In addition, extracts from beginning of flowering and end of flowering at a concentration of 25 µg/mL, containing significantly less rutin and rosmarinic acid, in combination with irradiation of cells with UVB, significantly increased the lipid peroxidation process, particularly in melanoma cells. These data indicate the possibility of using extracts from &lt;i&gt;S. hortensis&lt;/i&gt; L. to modulate/differentiate the metabolism of normal and tumor skin cells.">

This review provides an up-to-date and comprehensive summary of research findings on its bioactive constituents, potential health benefits and major structural characteristics. Since the discovery of the D-fraction more than three decades ago, many other polysaccharides, including β-glucans and heteroglycans, have been extracted from the &lt;i&gt;G. frondosa&lt;/i&gt; fruiting body and fungal mycelium, which have shown significant antitumor and immunomodulatory activities. Another class of bioactive macromolecules in &lt;i&gt;G. frondosa&lt;/i&gt; is composed of proteins and glycoproteins, which have shown antitumor, immunomodulation, antioxidant and other activities. A number of small organic molecules such as sterols and phenolic compounds have also been isolated from the fungus and have shown various bioactivities. It can be concluded that the &lt;i&gt;G. frondosa&lt;/i&gt; mushroom provides a diverse array of bioactive molecules that are potentially valuable for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications. More investigation is needed to establish the structure-bioactivity relationship of &lt;i&gt;G. frondosa&lt;/i&gt; and to elucidate the mechanisms of action behind its various bioactive and pharmacological effects.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The free list, also written &quot;freelist&quot;, or &quot;free recall&quot;, is an ethnographic method that characterizes the local knowledge of a population about a given cultural domain. However, there is still much to elucidate about the variables that can influence the number of items that participants cite using this technique. This study applied a casual-comparative experimental design to analyze whether 3 months' time, age, and external stimuli influence the similarity of plant free lists applied at different times.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;Data was collected from 103 farmers from the rural community Alto dos Canutos, in the municipality of Picos, Piauí state, Brazil. Two free lists were conducted at two different times, with an interval of three months between them. Subsequently, the similarity between the first and second free lists of each participant was calculated using the Jaccard Similarity Index. The generalized linear model (GLM) with binomial errors and stepwise approach was used to analyze the effects of age and external stimuli on information collection when comparing free lists applied at different times.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Participants' age influenced the information that the free lists collected, demonstrating that the older the participants, the lower the similarity among the free lists. Among the external stimuli analyzed, only the presence of third parties influenced the content of the free lists at the time of the interview. However, contrary to expectations, third-party presence positively influenced the similarity of the lists.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;The results show that the studied variables age and third-party presence can influence the capture of knowledge. These findings warrant future research into the influences' causes and their potential mitigation, e.g., by isolation or by breaking the medicinal plant domain into focused sub-domains and conducting simpler, successive free-lists, which can mitigate memory issues.">

To document the remaining knowledge, we conducted an ethnobotanical survey on the most important medicinal plant species and diseases treated with them, as well as plants with therapeutic potential. We also checked for the cultural similarity in medicinal plant knowledge between the two territories and how knowledge about Kongo medicinal plants differs between different social groups.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;From June 2017 until February 2018 and from February 2019 until April 2019, we conducted a survey with 188 phytotherapists, selected using the snowball method and surveyed using semi-structured interviews. Voucher specimens were taken for identification. Ethnobotanical data were analyzed using medicinal use value (UVs), informant agreement ratio (IARs), informant consensus factor (ICF), and species therapeutic potential (STP). Rahman's similarity index was used for ethno-cultural comparison of medicinal plant knowledge between the two communities. Medicinal knowledge between different social groups was analyzed using non-parametric tests and Poisson regression.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;A total of 231 plants (i.e., 227 botanical species, representing 192 genera and 79 families) were reportedly used to treat 103 diseases. Most abundant taxa were reported for the Fabaceae family (including 11.9% of species and 10.9% of genera). Most reported species (45.0%) were from anthropized areas. Leaves (39.4%), herbs (37.1%), decoction (41.7%), and oral ingestion (72%) were the most frequently cited plant part, botanical form, preparation, and administration method, respectively. Four of all inventoried species showed high UV&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; (&gt; 0.05), whereas eight had an IAR of one. According to ICF, 31 diseases were mentioned. Highest ICF (≥ 0.4) was observed for hemorrhoids (0.44), amoebiasis (0.43), and itchy rash (0.42). Fifty-four plant species were identified as likely possessing an interesting therapeutic potential. Low ethno-cultural similarity in medicinal knowledge (RSI = 16.6%) was found between the two territories. Analysis of the Kongo medicinal plant knowledge showed that the mean number of reported species and diseases vary considerably depending on gender, type, and residence of therapists (P &lt; 0.05).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Results prove that the Kongo phytopharmacopeia makes use of interesting medicinal plant species that could be further studied for conservation and pharmacological applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="Mushrooms, the fruiting bodies of fungi, are known for a long time in different cultures around the world to possess medicinal properties and are used to treat various human diseases. Mushrooms that are parts of traditional medicine in Asia had been extensively studied and this has led to identification of their bioactive ingredients. North America, while home to one of the world's largest and diverse ecological systems, has not subjected its natural resources especially its diverse array of mushroom species for bioprospecting purposes: Are mushrooms native to North America a good source for drug discovery? In this review, we compile all the published studies up to September 2020 on the bioprospecting of North American mushrooms. Out of the 79 species that have been investigated for medicinal properties, 48 species (60%) have bioactivities that have not been previously reported. For a mere 16 selected species, 17 new bioactive compounds (10 small molecules, six polysaccharides and one protein) have already been isolated. The results from our literature search suggest that mushrooms native to North America are indeed a good source for drug discovery.">

        <span class="abst" title="Silphion was an ancient medicinal gum-resin; most likely obtained from a &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species growing in the Cyrene region of Libya ca. 2500 years ago. Due to its therapeutic properties and culinary value, silphion became the main economic commodity of the Cyrene region. It is generally believed that the source of silphion became extinct in the first century AD. However, there are a few references in the literature about the cultivated silphion plant and its existence up to the fifth century. Recently, a rare and endemic &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species that produces a pleasant-smelling gum-resin was found in three locations near formerly Greek villages in Anatolia. Morphologic features of this species closely resemble silphion, as it appears in the numismatic figures of antique Cyrenaic coins, and conform to descriptions by ancient authors. Initial chemical and pharmacological investigations of this species have confirmed the medicinal and spice-like quality of its gum-resin supporting a connection with the long-lost silphion. A preliminary conservation study has been initiated at the growth site of this rare endemic &lt;i&gt;Ferula&lt;/i&gt; species. The results of this study and their implications on the regional extinction event, and future development of this species will be discussed.">

However, the accumulation of ammonia in fishponds regularly occurs in intensive aquaculture systems, resulting in reduced growth rates and poor health conditions. The inclusion of yucca extract is recognized as a practical solution for adsorbing the waterborne ammonia. Yucca has abundant amounts of polyphenolics, steroidal saponins, and resveratrol and can be used as a solution or as a powder. In this context, this review aimed to investigate the possible regulatory roles of yucca extract on aquatic animals' performances. Concurrently, the feed utilization, growth performance, and physiological status of aquatic species can be improved. Additionally, the yucca application resulted in enhancing the antioxidative, immunological, and anti-inflammatory responses in several aquatic animals. Exclusively, the present review proposed a protective solution through the application of yucca extract in the aquafeed and rearing water of aquatic animals suffering from ammonia accumulation. Furthermore, it shows how yucca could enhance the growth, survival rates, blood biochemical quality, immunological indices, and the antioxidative capacity of aquatic animals in light of the relevant published data.">

Sweet as a reducing and capping agent. Different characterization techniques were used to characterize the synthesized nanoparticles such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Transmission electron microscope (TEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction technique confirmed the purity and crystallinity of the Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. The average size of the nanoparticles ranged from 17 to 42 nm. The antibacterial activity of the green synthesized nanoparticles was evaluated against four different bacterial strains, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;B. bronchiseptica&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt; using agar well diffusion and a live/dead staining assay. The anticancer activities were determined against Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) cancer cells using MTT and a live/dead staining assay. Antioxidant activity was investigated in the linoleic acid system. Moreover, the cytobiocompatibility was analyzed against the Vero cell lines using MTT and a live/dead staining assay. The results demonstrated that the green synthesized Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles exhibited superior antibacterial activity in terms of zones of inhibition (ZOIs) against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria compared to plant extracts and chemically synthesized Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (commercial), but comparable to the standard drug (Leflox). The green synthesized Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles exhibited significant anticancer and antioxidant activities against MCF-7 cancerous cells and the linoleic acid system, respectively, compared to chemically synthesized Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. Moreover, cytobiocompatibility analysis displayed that they presented excellent biocompatibility with Vero cell lines than that of chemically synthesized Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles. These results suggest that the green synthesized Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles' enhanced biological activities might be attributed to a synergetic effect. Hence, green synthesized Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles could prove to be promising candidates for future biomedical applications.">

The research conducted in recent years has shown that these plants contain biologically active compounds, mainly polyphenols, that relate to the prevention of inflammatory processes, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular disorders as well as to antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antiparasitic properties. Throughout the years, many researchers have deeply studied polyphenols and volatile compounds in medicinal and aromatic plants, particularly those associated with consumer's choices or with their beneficial properties. In this context, the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the presence of volatile and nonvolatile compounds in some of the most economically relevant and consumed vegetables and medicinal and aromatic plants, with an emphasis on bioactive polyphenols, polyphenols as prebiotics, and, also, the most important factors that affect the contents and profiles of the volatile and nonvolatile compounds responsible for the aromatic features of vegetables and MAPs. Additionally, the new challenges for science in terms of improving polyphenol composition and intensifying volatile compounds responsible for the positive characteristics of vegetables and medicinal and aromatic plants are reported.">

The determination of the chemical composition of CPS has revealed that it contains mostly carbohydrates, while proteins or phenolics are present only in trace amounts. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR and GC-MS methods were used for the structural analysis of CPS. Biological activity including anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of CPS was investigated. CPS was found to be non-toxic to normal human colon epithelial CCD841 CoN cells. Simultaneously, they destroyed membrane integrity as well as inhibited the proliferation of human colon cancer cell lines: Caco-2, LS180 and HT-29. Antioxidant activity was determined by various methods and revealed the moderate potential of CPS. The enzymatic assays revealed no influence of CPS on xanthine oxidase and the inhibition of catalase activity. Moreover, pro-inflammatory enzymes such as cyclooxygenase-2 or lipooxygenase were inhibited by CPS. Therefore, it may be suggested that &lt;i&gt;S. crispa&lt;/i&gt; is a valuable part of the regular human diet, which may contribute to a reduction in the risk of colon cancer, and possess promising activities encouraging further studies regarding its potential use as chemopreventive and therapeutic agent in more invasive stages of this type of cancer.">

        <span class="abst" title="Fungal infections affect 300 million people and cause 1.5 million deaths globally per year. With the number of immunosuppressed patients increasing steadily, there is an increasing number of patients infected with opportunistic fungal infections such as infections caused by the species of &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus&lt;/i&gt;. In fact, the drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Can. krusei&lt;/i&gt; and the emerging pan-antifungal resistant &lt;i&gt;Can. auris&lt;/i&gt; pose a serious threat to human health as the existing limited antifungals are futile. To further complicate therapy, fungi produce capsules and spores that are resistant to most antifungal drugs/host defenses. Novel antifungal drugs are urgently needed to fill unmet medical needs. From screening a collection of medicinal plant sources for antifungal activity, we have identified an active fraction from the rhizome of &lt;i&gt;Cyperus rotundus&lt;/i&gt;, the nut grass plant. The fraction contained α-Cyperone, an essential oil that showed fungicidal activity against different species of &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;. Interestingly, the minimal inhibitory concentration of α-Cyperone was reduced 8-fold when combined with a clinical antifungal drug, fluconazole, indicating its antifungal synergistic potential and could be useful for combination therapy. Furthermore, α-Cyperone affected the synthesis of the capsule in &lt;i&gt;Cryp. neoformans&lt;/i&gt;, a causative agent of fungal meningitis in humans. Further work on mechanistic understanding of α-Cyperone against fungal virulence could help develop a novel antifungal agent for drug-resistant fungal pathogens.">

The outbreak of corona virus diseases caused by SARS-CoV (year 2003), MERS-CoV (year 2012) and SARS-CoV-2 (year 2019) raised global health concerns. The side effects associated with the conventional drugs and increase in cases of anti-microbial resistance have led the researchers to switch to natural sources, especially plants, as they have immense potential to be used as antiviral agents. The aim of the article is to summarize the evidences of the bioactive phytocompounds from different plants as an effective alternative for the treatment of infections caused by coronaviruses. However, the use of most plant compounds succumbs to limitations due to lack of experimental evidences and safety studies. Therefore, further research and studies are required to validate their therapeutic uses for wide application of plant-based medicine, including anti-virals.">

Bodyweights of the treated mice were weighed, and the kidney tissues were collected; following, the histopathology and the expression of TGF-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; were examined using H&amp;E staining and immunohistochemistry. Afterward, the renal cells GP-293 were treated with CPT and/or Rb3. The expression and phosphoration of TGF-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;, Smad2, Smad3, Bcl-2, and Bax in GP-293 cells were detected by Western blotting. The cellular apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential were analyzed using flow cytometry.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;The xenograft nude mice exposure to CPT presented the bodyweight loss, necrotic areas, and the increased expression of TGF in kidney tissue, and Rb3 pretreatment relieved these changes evoked by CPT. In GP-293 cells, CPT administration induced the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, and Rb3 pretreatment suppressed the induced phosphorylation by CPT. Besides, flow cytometry analysis showed that Rb3 inhibited the CPT-evoked cellular apoptosis ratio and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The Western blotting test indicated that Rb3 alleviated the cleavage of PARP, caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9, the induction of Bax expression, and inhibition of Bcl-2 expression. Additionally, after treating with the TGF inhibitor of disitertide, Rb3 exhibited no alleviation effects on CPT-evoked cellular apoptosis ratio, inhibition of Bax expression, and induction of Bcl-2 expression in GP-293 cells.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Rb3 could alleviate CPT-evoked toxic effects on kidney cells during its treatment to oral cancer via TGF-&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis.">

        <span class="abst" title="Chromosome stability is primarily determined by telomere length. TRF1 is the core subunit of shelterin that plays a critical role in telomere organization and replication. However, the dynamics of TRF1 in scenarios of telomere-processing activities remain elusive. Using single-molecule magnetic tweezers, we here investigated the dynamics of TRF1 upon organizing a human telomere and the protein-DNA interactions at a moving telomeric fork. We first developed a method to obtain telomeres from human cells for directly measuring the telomere length by single-molecule force spectroscopy. Next, we examined the compaction and decompaction of a telomere by TRF1 dimers. TRF1 dissociates from a compacted telomere with heterogenous loops in ∼20 s. We also found a negative correlation between the number of telomeric loops and loop sizes. We further characterized the dynamics of TRF1 at a telomeric DNA fork. With binding energies of 11 kBT, TRF1 can modulate the forward and backward steps of DNA fork movements by 2-9 s at a critical force of F1/2, temporarily maintaining the telomeric fork open. Our results shed light on the mechanisms of how TRF1 organizes human telomeres and facilitates the efficient replication of telomeric DNA. Our work will help future research on the chemical biology of telomeres and shelterin-targeted drug discovery.">

These plants are cultivated in Europe as robust ornamentals, and several cultivars are available. However, their medicinal potential remains underutilized because of limited information about their phytochemical and genetic diversity. Thus, we combined an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) based metabolomics with DNA barcoding approach based on &lt;i&gt;trnH&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;psbA&lt;/i&gt; and ITS2 barcodes to clarify the relationships between these two taxa. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that aerial parts are more similar than roots and none of the major compounds stand out as distinct. Sugiol in &lt;i&gt;S. yangii&lt;/i&gt; leaves and carnosic acid quinone in &lt;i&gt;S. abrotanoides&lt;/i&gt; were mostly responsible for their chemical differentiation, whereas in roots the distinction was supported by the presence of five norditerpenoids in &lt;i&gt;S. yangii&lt;/i&gt; and two flavonoids and one norditerpenoid in &lt;i&gt;S. abrotanoides&lt;/i&gt;. To verify the metabolomics-based differentiation, we performed DNA authentication that revealed &lt;i&gt;S. yangii&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. abrotanoides&lt;/i&gt; to be very closely related but separate species. We demonstrated that DNA barcoding coupled with parallel LC-MS profiling constitutes a powerful tool in identification of taxonomically close &lt;i&gt;Salvia&lt;/i&gt; species.">

This work aims to study for the first time the potential inhibitory effect of this plant hydroethanolic extract on α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities using in vitro methods and its antidiabetic and antihyperglycemic activities using alloxan-induced diabetic mice as a model for experimental diabetes. Two doses were selected for the in vivo study (200 and 400 mg/kg) and glibenclamide, a well-known antidiabetic drug (positive control) in a subacute study (28 days) where the antihyperglycemic activity was also assessed over a period of 12 h on diabetic mice. The continuous treatment of diabetic mice with the extract of &lt;i&gt;Withania frutescens&lt;/i&gt; for 4 weeks succeeded to slowly manage their high fasting blood glucose levels (after two weeks), while the antihyperglycemic test result revealed that the extract of this plant did not control hyperglycemia in the short term. No toxicity signs or death were noted for the groups treated with the plant extract, and it shows a protective effect on the liver and kidney. The in vitro assays demonstrated that the inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase might be one of the mechanisms of action exhibited by the extract of this plant to control and prevent postprandial hyperglycemia. This work indicates that W. frutescens have an important long term antidiabetic effect that can be well established to treat diabetes.">

The total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, together with the biological activities of the derived essential oils and methanol extracts, were also investigated. Herein, the success of obtaining sequences of these plant using two different barcode genes &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K and &lt;i&gt;rbc&lt;/i&gt;L were 62.5% and 100%, respectively. Both regions were discriminated by around 700 base pairs and these had resemblance with those of the Clausenae materials earlier deposited in Genbank at a 99-100% degree of identity. Additionally, the use of &lt;i&gt;mat&lt;/i&gt;K DNA sequences could positively confirm the identity as monophyletic. The highest total phenolic and total flavonoid content values (&lt;i&gt;p &lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.05) were observed in the methanol extract of &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; at 43.50 mg GAE/g extract and 66.13 mg QE/g extract, respectively. Furthermore, anethole was detected as the dominant compound in &lt;i&gt;C. excavata&lt;/i&gt; (86.72%) and &lt;i&gt;C. harmandiana&lt;/i&gt; (46.09%). Moreover, anethole (26.02%) and caryophyllene (21.15%) were identified as the major phytochemical compounds of &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt;. In terms of the biological properties, the &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; methanol extract was found to display the greatest amount of antioxidant activity (DPPH; IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 95.54 µg/mL, ABTS value 118.12 mg GAE/g extract, FRAP value 48.15 mg GAE/g extract), and also revealed the highest &lt;i&gt;α-&lt;/i&gt;glucosidase and antihypertensive inhibitory activities with percent inhibition values of 84.55 and 84.95. Notably, no adverse effects on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were observed with regard to all of the plant extracts. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;M. koenigii&lt;/i&gt; methanol extract exhibited promise against human lung cancer cells almost at 80% after 24 h and 90% over 48 h.">

Phytochemical studies are still scarce. The information reported in the literature about &lt;i&gt;Iris&lt;/i&gt; species growing in Kurdistan has been summarized in the first part of this paper, although, except for &lt;i&gt;Iris persica&lt;/i&gt;, investigations have been performed on vegetal samples collected in countries different from Kurdistan. In the second part of the work, we have investigated, for the first time, the contents of the methanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;Iris postii&lt;/i&gt; aerial parts and rhizomes that were collected in Kurdistan. Both extracts exhibited a significant dose-dependent free radical scavenging and total antioxidant activities, comparable to those of ascorbic acid. Medium-pressure liquid chromatographic separations of the two extracts afforded l-tryptophan, androsin, isovitexin, swertisin, and 2″-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-α-l-rhamnopyranosyl swertisin from the aerial parts, whereas ε-viniferin, &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-resveratrol 3,4'-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-di-β-d-glucopyranoside, and isotectorigenin were isolated from the rhizomes. This is the first finding of the last three metabolites from an &lt;i&gt;Iris&lt;/i&gt; species. The various remarkable biological activities of isolated compounds scientifically sustain the traditional use of &lt;i&gt;I. postii&lt;/i&gt; as a medicinal plant.">

This review aims to provide an overview of the current status of the species from the genus &lt;i&gt;Parkia&lt;/i&gt; in terms of its relationship between its phytochemistry and medical uses. Comprehensive information on &lt;i&gt;Parkia&lt;/i&gt; species was retrieved from electronic databases, which were Web of Science, ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Google Scholar. This review identified nine species from genus &lt;i&gt;Parkia&lt;/i&gt; with properties of medicinal use. They are used traditionally to treat several ailments, such as diabetes, diarrhea, wounds, hypertension, cough, chronic piles, conjunctivitis, and measles. The most common species studied are &lt;i&gt;P. biglobosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. speciosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. javanica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. bicolor&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. biglandulosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. filicoidea&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;P. clappertoniana&lt;/i&gt;. A considerable number of secondary metabolites, such as terpenoids, phenolic acids, flavonoids (aglycone and glycosides), and numerous volatile compounds have been identified in this genus, which are responsible for their diverse pharmacological activities. Their extracts, pure compounds and seed lectins have been reported for their anticancer, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antiulcer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimalarial, hepatoprotective, and antidiarrheal activities. The information gathered in this review might be of help for future studies in terms of the current knowledge on the link between the phytochemical components and medicinal uses. This could facilitate more discoveries on its potentials particularly in the pharmacological characteristics and potential to be developed into modern medicines.">

To investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of the PBWE in vitro, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was conducted in TMT-treated primary cultures of mouse hippocampal neurons. In TMT-treated adult C57BL/6 mice, behavioral and histopathological changes were evaluated by seizure scoring and Fluoro-Jade C staining, respectively. In our in vitro assay, we observed that pretreating mice hippocampal neuron cultures with the PBWE reduced TMT-induced cytotoxicity, as indicated by the decreased LDH release. Furthermore, pretreatment with the PBWE alleviated seizures and hippocampal neurodegeneration in TMT-treated mice. The antioxidant activity of the PBWE increased in a dose-dependent manner; moreover, pretreatment with the PBWE mitigated the TMT-induced Nrf2 stimulation. In addition, six major compounds, including adenine, hypoxanthine, uridine, adenosine, inosine, and benzoic acid, were isolated from the PBWE, and among them, inosine and benzoic acid have been confirmed to have an essential antioxidative activity. In conclusion, the PBWE ameliorated TMT-induced toxicity in hippocampal neurons in both in vitro and in vivo assays, through a potential antioxidative effect. Our findings suggest that the PBWE may have pharmacotherapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases such as seizures or epilepsy.">

The total phenolics and flavonoids contents in &lt;i&gt;Curculigo&lt;/i&gt; species varied from 142.09 to 452.47 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE/g) and from 0.82 to 5.44 mg quercetin equivalent (QE/g), respectively. The lowest IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities is presented by &lt;i&gt;C. latifolia&lt;/i&gt; from a higher altitude region. Principal component analysis (PCA) from FTIR and UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-HRMS data could discriminate the plant parts and geographical origin. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis has identified several functional groups, such as O-H, C-H, C=O, C-C, C-O, and chemical compounds, unknown-185 and unknown-85, that are most likely to contribute to the antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory activities.">

        <span class="abst" title="Dysregulation of glucose homeostasis followed by chronic hyperglycemia is a hallmark of diabetes mellitus (DM), a disease spreading as a worldwide pandemic for which there is no satisfactory dietary treatment or cure. The development of glucose-controlling drugs that can prevent complications of DM, such as hyperglycemia and oxidative stress, which contribute to the impairment of the key physiological processes in the body, is of grave importance. In pursuit of this goal, this study screened 41 plant extracts for their antidiabetic and antioxidant activities by employing assays to test for α-amylase inhibition and free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) and by measuring glucose uptake in L6-GLUT4myc cells. While extracts of Rhus coriaria, Punica granatum, Olea europaea, Pelargonium spp., Stevia rebaudiana, and Petroselinum crispum demonstrated significant α-amylase inhibition, the extracts of Rhus coriaria and Pelargonium spp. also demonstrated increased FRSA, and the extract of Rhus coriaria stimulated glucose uptake. These natural extracts, which are believed to have fewer side effects because they are prepared from edible plants, interfere with the process in the small intestine that breaks down dietary carbohydrates into monosaccharide and disaccharide derivatives, and thereby suppress increases in diet-induced blood glucose; hence, they may have clinical value for type 2 diabetes management. The Pelargonium spp. and Rhus coriaria extracts demonstrated the highest antidiabetic and antioxidant activities. Both plants may offer valuable medical benefits, especially because they can be taken as dietary supplements by patients with diabetes and can serve as sources of new, natural-based antidiabetic drug candidates. The enhancement of cellular glucose uptake stimulated by Rhus coriaria extract could lead to the development of clinical applications that regulate blood glucose levels from within the circulatory system. Isolating bioactive substances from these plant extracts and testing them in diabetic mice will significantly advance the development of natural drugs that have both antidiabetic and free radical-scavenging properties, likely with lesser side effects.">

        <span class="abst" title="During recent decades, consumers have been continuously moving towards the substitution of synthetic ingredients of the food industry by natural products, obtained from vegetal, animal or microbial sources. Additionally, a circular economy has been proposed as the most efficient production system since it allows for reducing and reutilizing different wastes. Current agriculture is responsible for producing high quantities of organic agricultural waste (e.g., discarded fruits and vegetables, peels, leaves, seeds or forestall residues), that usually ends up underutilized and accumulated, causing environmental problems. Interestingly, these agri-food by-products are potential sources of valuable bioactive molecules such as tannins. Tannins are phenolic compounds, secondary metabolites of plants widespread in terrestrial and aquatic natural environments. As they can be found in plenty of plants and herbs, they have been traditionally used for medicinal and other purposes, such as the leather industry. This fact is explained by the fact that they exert plenty of different biological activities and, thus, they entail a great potential to be used in the food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry. Consequently, this review article is directed towards the description of the biological activities exerted by tannins as they could be further extracted from by-products of the agri-food industry to produce high-added-value products.">

The contents of swertiamarin (SWM), gentiopicrin (GP), sweroside (SWZ), mangiferin (MGF), isoorientin (ISOOR), and isovitexin (ISOV) were determined in six populations (three per study site), and separately for aboveground and belowground plant parts. PCA showed a clear separation of four groups according to the contents of the analyzed secondary metabolites. Out of six analyzed compounds, five were present in all samples and only one (SWZ) was found in Golija populations (belowground parts) but not in Vlasina populations, and its presence can be indicative of the geolocation of populations. Clear separation of groups was mostly affected by the different contents of chemical compounds in plant parts (aboveground versus belowground) and by the differences related to population origin (higher content of SWM and GP in belowground parts of individuals from Vlasina populations and higher content of MGF and ISOOR of individuals from Golija populations).

(Anacardiaceae), commonly known as sumac, is a commonly used spice, condiment, and flavoring agent, especially in the Mediterranean region. Owing to its bountiful beneficial values, sumac has been used in traditional medicine for the management and treatment of many ailments including hemorrhoids, wound healing, diarrhea, ulcer, and eye inflammation. This plant is rich in various classes of phytochemicals including flavonoids, tannins, polyphenolic compounds, organic acids, and many others. By virtue of its bioactive, &lt;i&gt;Rhus coriaria&lt;/i&gt; possesses powerful antioxidant capacities that have ameliorative and therapeutic benefits for many common diseases including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. This review describes the phytochemical properties of &lt;i&gt;R. coriaria&lt;/i&gt; and then focuses on the potent antioxidant capacities of sumac. We then dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sumac's action in modulating many pathophysiological instigators. We show how accumulating evidence supports the antibacterial, antinociceptive, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer effects of this plant, especially that toxicity studies show that sumac is very safe to consume by humans and has little toxicity. Taken together, the findings we summarize here support the utilization of this plant as an attractive target for drug discovery.">

However, the mechanism of anti-diabetic effects of &lt;i&gt;Helianthus tuberosus&lt;/i&gt; L. remains unproven. In the present study, antioxidant and anti-diabetic activity of the tubers of &lt;i&gt;H. tuberosus&lt;/i&gt; were studied in detail. Methanolic extracts of &lt;i&gt;H. tuberosus&lt;/i&gt; tubers were subjected to solvent fractionation method by increasing the polarity of the solvent using &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexane, and ethyl acetate. The obtained methanol extracts and its fractions were subjected to free radical scavenging activity (DPPH and ABTS assay) and in vitro enzyme (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) inhibition assay. Moreover, glucose uptake in insulin-resistant HepG2 cell line was analyzed. The preliminary phytochemical analysis confirmed the presence of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in the active fraction. The radical scavenging and in vitro diabetic related enzyme inhibitory activities were found to be dose dependent. The maximum ABTS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and DPPH scavenging activity was documented in ethyl acetate fraction of the &lt;i&gt;H. tuberosus&lt;/i&gt; followed by methanol extract, hexane fraction, and methanol fraction. We also found that &lt;i&gt;H. tuberosus&lt;/i&gt; showed a less toxicity in mouse fibroblast cells and enhance the glucose uptake in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Besides, the ethyl acetate fraction of the &lt;i&gt;H. tuberosus&lt;/i&gt; analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS-MS and GC/MS revealed the presence of phenolic compounds such as neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, 5-&lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-(4-coumaroyl)-quinic acid, feruloylquinic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, isoxazolidine, salicylic acid β-D-glucoside, dicaffeoylquinic acid isomers, salvianolic acid derivative isomers, and 1,4 dicaffeoylquinic acid etc. Among the identified phytochemicals, six were chosen for molecular docking study to explore their its inhibitory interactions with α-amylase and α-glucosidase. Taken together, the findings of the present study suggested that phytocompounds of EAF were responsible for the significant in vitro antioxidant, wound-healing, and anti-diabetic activities.">

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of argan leaves extract (ALE) on melanogenesis in B16 melanoma cells, determined its antioxidant activity, then quantified and identified its phenolic components. B16 cells were treated with various concentrations of ALE, then the cell viability and proliferation were assessed using MTT assay while the melanin content was determined using spectrophotometric methods. The expression level of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase related protein-1 (TRP-1) and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) was evaluated by Western blotting. The antioxidant activity of ALE was investigated using four different assays while UPLC-ESI-HRMS analysis was used to characterize the ALE phenolic profile. Fourteen phenolic compounds were identified, of which six are reported for the first time to be present in ALE. ALE treatment increases the melanin content of B16 cells in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. This was revealed by the observed ALE-increased expression level of TYR, DCT, and TRP-1. These bioactivities may be mainly attributed to its high flavonoids content. Argan leaves have the potential for use as a treatment for hypopigmentation disorders and as a bioactive component of cosmetic products that aim to increase pigmentation.">

Besides synthetic anti-coccidial drugs, natural herbs appear to be an alternative way to prevent avian coccidiosis. &lt;i&gt;Rumex nervosus&lt;/i&gt; (RN), a phytogenic shrub, has received considerable attention in recent years due to its significant anti-microbial effects; however, limited knowledge exists about its potential anti-coccidial functions. This study was conducted to evaluate the prophylactic and therapeutic activities of RN leaf powder in broilers infected with &lt;i&gt;Eimeria tenella&lt;/i&gt;. Infected chickens received a commercial diet containing 1, 3, or 5 g RN powder/kg diet compared to infected broilers that treated with Sacox (PC) or compared to uninfected broilers that received a commercial diet alone (NC). Results showed that RN powder significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) reduced the lesion scores and suppressed the output of oocysts per gram (OPG) in chickens' feces. Although RN was unable to minimize the weight gain loss due to emeriosis, RN at level 1 g improved the feed conversion ratio. Therefore, RN powder, at 5 g, possesses moderate anti-coccidial effects and hence could be used to treat avian coccidiosis in field conditions; however, further studies are required to investigate, in vitro or in vivo, the anti-coccidial potential of active ingredients.">

The phytochemical and mineral compositions were carried out using standard methods. The antioxidant activity was determined using the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2,2-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid), and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) tests. The antimicrobial activity was assayed using the agar diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration methods. The results of the chemical analysis showed that both varieties contained interesting mineral and chemical compositions with potentially active compounds; among them, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-isobutyl-2,4-heptadiene-6-monoynamide and cinnamic acid were detected in the &lt;i&gt;Anacyclus pyrethrum&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;pyrethrum&lt;/i&gt; (L.) only while thiadiazolo [5,4-d] pyrimidin-7-amine and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-isobutyl-2,4-undecadiene-8,10-diynamide compounds were limited to the &lt;i&gt;Anacyclus pyrethrum&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;depressus&lt;/i&gt; (Ball) Maire. In vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of the two varieties demonstrated that the different parts had prominent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed great similarity in the activity of the leaves, capitula, and seeds of both plants and a high difference in roots. &lt;i&gt;Anacyclus pyrethrum&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;pyrethrum&lt;/i&gt; roots were characterized by a high content in phenols and flavonoids and better antibacterial activities compared to &lt;i&gt;Anacyclus pyrethrum&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;depressus&lt;/i&gt; (Ball) Maire roots, which were characterized by better antioxidant activities. From this study, it can be concluded that the two varieties of &lt;i&gt;Anacyclus pyrethrum&lt;/i&gt; (L.) showed promising mineral and chemical compositions with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.">

Numerous studies have shown antimicrobial, anti-oxidative, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and other bioactivities of their extracts. The bioactive principles can be divided into two major groups: (a) hydrophilic polysaccharides with relatively high molecular weights and (b) low molecular medium polar secondary metabolites, such as the antifungal strobilurins. In this review, we summarize the state of the art on biodiversity, cultivation of the fungi and bioactivities of their secondary metabolites and discuss future applications. Although the strobilurins are well-documented, with commercial applications as agrochemical fungicides, there are also other known compounds from this group that have not yet been well-studied. Polysaccharides, dihydro-citrinone phenol A acid, scalusamides, and acetylenic lactones such as xerulin, also have potential applications in the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and medicinal market and should be further explored. Further studies are recommended to isolate high quality bioactive compounds and fully understand their modes of action. Given that only few species of oudemansielloid/xeruloid mushrooms have been explored for their production of secondary metabolites, these taxa represent unexplored sources of potentially useful and novel bioactive metabolites.">

An aqueous extract of its leathery exocarp (LEP) was obtained by a solid-phase micro-extraction method. The antifungal activity was examined against the phytopathogenic fungi, &lt;i&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Phytophthora cinnamomi&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Penicillium digitatum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Botrytis cinerea&lt;/i&gt;, and the antibacterial activity was evaluated against &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Xanthomonas campestris,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bacillus megaterium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Clavibacter michiganensis&lt;/i&gt;. The antimicrobial assays showed, in some cases, a promising antimicrobial effect compared to the synthetic drugs. The possible anti-acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant activities of the LEP extract were investigated by the Ellman's assay and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) test, respectively, and their results showed that the LEP extract has an effective anti-acetylcholinesterase inhibitory effect and an antioxidant activity. Thus, the LEP extract could be valid as a candidate for further studies on the use of pomegranate in neurodegenerative diseases as a food preservative and a suitable substitute to control several phytopathogens.">

We investigated the optimal extract parameters of TFSR using response surface methodology. The highest yield of TFSR was 1.04% with the ethanol concentration 58%, the material-to-liquid ratio 1:20 (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt;), the extraction time 2.6 h, and the extraction temperature 67 °C. The results of radical scavenging activities showed that ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) was the strongest by using 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzo thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and iron ion reducing analysis. The EAF had the highest flavonoids contents. Four fractions A, B, C and D were enrichment from EAF by polyamide resin. Fraction B had the highest flavonoids content. Thirteen chemical components of flavonoids in fraction B were first identified by Ultimate 3000 Nano LC System coupled to a Q Exactive HF benchtop Orbitrap mass spectrometer (UHPLC-HRMS/MS). Among of the thirteen chemical components, isoquercetin and daidzein were identified accurately by comparing with standard samples. Radical scavenging analysis showed that isoquercetin and EAF had strong activities. Therefore, sunflower receptacles can be used as a source of natural flavonoids. TFSR as a natural radical scavenger has potential applications in pharmaceutical industry.">

The aim of this study was to evaluate seasonal alterations in photoprotective and antioxidant activities and the influence of factors such as precipitation levels and sun radiation incidence. Thus, polyphenol quantification, cromatographics (HPLC-DAD) and multivariate (PCA) analyses of extracts of the two species through twelve months were done. It was observed that the best months for photoprotective and antioxidant activities were September for &lt;i&gt;M. villosa&lt;/i&gt; and July for &lt;i&gt;P. amboinicus&lt;/i&gt; (SPF = 14.79). It was possible to conclude that solar radiation more clearly influences the production of phenolics and the increase of SPF in &lt;i&gt;M. villosa,&lt;/i&gt; in addition to favoring the antioxidant activity of the two species, while precipitation seems to have no influence.">

Among them, synthetic and natural alike are pharmacologically active compounds and have always been at the forefront of attention due to their pharmacological properties. Heterocycles can be divided into different groups based on the presence of characteristic structural motifs. The presence of β-amino acid and heterocyclic core in one compound is very interesting; additionally, it very often plays a vital role in their biological activity. Usually, such compounds are not considered to be chemicals containing a β-amino acid motif; however, considering them as this class of compounds may open new routes of their preparation and application as new drug precursors or even drugs. The possibility of their application as nonproteinogenic amino acid residues in peptide or peptide derivatives synthesis to prepare a new class of compounds is also promising. This review highlights the actual state of knowledge about β-amino acid moiety-containing heterocycles presenting antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial compounds, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, as well as agonist and antagonists of the receptors.">

Although her group activity has been spread over several chemical families with relevance in Medicinal Chemistry, the main focus of the investigation and research has been in the xanthone family. Xanthone derivatives have a variety of activities with great potential for therapeutic applications due to their versatile framework. The group has contributed with several libraries of xanthones derivatives, with a variety of activities such as antitumor, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antimicrobial, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and multidrug resistance reversal effects. Besides therapeutic applications, our group has also developed xanthone derivatives with analytical applications as chiral selectors for liquid chromatography and for maritime application as antifouling agents for marine paints. Chemically, it has been challenging to afford green chemistry methods and achieve enantiomeric purity of chiral derivatives. In this review, the structures of the most significant compounds will be presented.">

The goal of this work is to shed light on the role of botanical families in ethnobotany, depicting in a molecular phylogenetic frame the relationships between families and medicinal uses of vascular plants in several Catalan-speaking territories. The simple quantitative analyses for ailments categories and the construction of families and disorders matrix were carried out in this study. A Bayesian approach was used to estimate the over- and underused families in the medicinal flora. Phylogenetically informed analyses were carried out to identify lineages in which there is an overrepresentation of families in a given category of use, i.e., hot nodes. The ethnobotanicity index, at a specific level, was calculated and also adapted to the family level. Two diversity indices to measure the richness of reported taxa within each family were calculated. A total of 47,630 use reports were analysed. These uses are grouped in 120 botanical families. The ethnobotanicity index for this area is 14.44% and the ethnobotanicity index at the family level is 68.21%. The most-reported families are Lamiaceae and Asteraceae and the most reported troubles are disorders of the digestive and nutritional system. Based on the meta-analytic results, indicating hot nodes of useful plants at the phylogenetic level, specific ethnopharmacological research may be suggested, including a phytochemical approach of particularly interesting taxa.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;i&gt;Artemisia herba-alba&lt;/i&gt; Asso. (Wormwood) is a wild aromatic herb that is popular for its healing and medicinal effects and has been used in conventional as well as modern medicine. This research aimed at the extraction, identification, and quantification of phenolic compounds in the aerial parts of wormwood using Soxhlet extraction, as well as characterizing their antimicrobial and anitoxidant effects. The phenolic compounds were identified in different extracts by column chromatography, thin layer chromatography (TLC), and high performance liquid chromatography. Five different fractions, two from ethyl acetate extraction and three from ethanolic extraction were obtained and evaluated further. The antimicrobial activity of each fractions was evaluated against two Gram-positive (&lt;i&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;) and two Gram-negative microorganisms (&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Proteus vulgaris)&lt;/i&gt; using the disc-diffusion assay and direct TLC bioautography assay. Fraction I inhibited &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, Fraction II inhibited &lt;i&gt;B. cereus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, Fraction III inhibited all, except for &lt;i&gt;P. vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;, while Fractions IV and V did not exhibit strong antimicrobial effects. Their antioxidant capabilities were also measured by calculating their ability to scavenge the free radical using DPPH method and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Ethanolic fractions III and V demonstrated excellent antioxidant properties with IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values less than 15.0 μg/mL, while other fractions also had IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values less than 80.0 μg/mL. These antioxidant effects were highly associated with the number of phenolic hydroxyl group on the phenolics they contained. These extracts demonstrated antimicrobial effects, suggesting the different phenolic compounds in these extracts had specific inhibitory effects on the growth of each bacteria. The results of this study suggested that the &lt;i&gt;A. herba-alba&lt;/i&gt; can be a source of phenolic compounds with natural antimicrobial and antioxidant properties which can be used for potential pharmaceutical applications.">

        <span class="abst" title="Diabetes mellitus is a life-threatening multifactorial metabolic disorder characterized by high level of glucose in the blood. Diabetes and its chronic complications have a significant impact on human life, health systems, and countries' economies. Currently, there are many commercial hypoglycemic drugs that are effective in controlling hyperglycemia but with several serious side-effects and without a sufficient capacity to significantly alter the course of diabetic complications. Over many centuries mushrooms and their bioactive compounds have been used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus, especially polysaccharides and terpenoids derived from various mushroom species. This review summarizes the effects of these main mushroom secondary metabolites on diabetes and underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for lowering blood glucose. In vivo and in vitro data revealed that treatment with mushroom polysaccharides displayed an anti-hyperglycemic effect by inhibiting glucose absorption efficacy, enhancing pancreatic &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-cell mass, and increasing insulin-signaling pathways. Mushroom terpenoids act as inhibitors of α-glucosidase and as insulin sensitizers through activation of PPAR&lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt; in order to reduce hyperglycemia in animal models of diabetes. In conclusion, mushroom polysaccharides and terpenoids can effectively ameliorate hyperglycemia by various mechanisms and can be used as supportive candidates for prevention and control of diabetes in the future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cinnamoyl sucrose esters (CSEs) were evaluated as AGIs and their enzyme inhibition activity and potency were compared with gold standard acarbose. The inhibition activity of the CSEs against α-glucosidase and α-amylase depended on their structure including the number of the cinnamoyl moieties, their position, and the presence or absence of the acetyl moieties. The inhibitory values of the CSEs &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; generally increases in the order of mono-cinnamoyl moieties &lt; di-cinnamoyl ≤ tri-cinnamoyl &lt; tetra-cinnamoyl. This trend was supported from both in vitro and in silico results. Both tetra-cinnamoyl CSEs &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; showed the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory activities of 77 ± 5%, 74 ± 9%, respectively, against acarbose at 27 ± 4%, and highest α-amylase inhibitory activities of 98 ± 2%, 99 ± 1%, respectively, against acarbose at 93 ± 2%. CSEs &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt; showed desired higher inhibition of α-glucosidase than α-amylase suggesting potential for further development as AGIs with reduced side effects. Molecular docking studies on CSEs &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt; attributed the high inhibition of these compounds to multiple π-π interactions and favorable projection of the cinnamoyl moieties (especially O-3 cinnamoyl) in the enzyme pockets.

        <span class="abst" title="Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global threat, mostly due to the development of antibiotic-resistant forms of &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis,&lt;/i&gt; the causal agent of the disease. Driven by the pressing need for new anti-mycobacterial agents several natural products (NPs) have been shown to have in vitro activities against &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. The utility of any NP as a drug lead is augmented when the anti-mycobacterial target(s) is unknown. To suggest these, we used a molecular reverse docking approach to predict the interactions of 53 selected anti-mycobacterial NPs against known &quot;druggable&quot; mycobacterial targets ClpP1P2, DprE1, InhA, KasA, PanK, PknB and Pks13. The docking scores/binding free energies were predicted and calculated using AutoDock Vina along with physicochemical and structural properties of the NPs, using PaDEL descriptors. These were compared to the established inhibitor (control) drugs for each mycobacterial target. The specific interactions of the bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids 2-nortiliacorinine, tiliacorine and 13'-bromotiliacorinine against the targets PknB and DprE1 (-11.4, -10.9 and -9.8 kcal·mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; -12.7, -10.9 and -10.3 kcal·mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively) and the lignan &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-cubebin and Pks13 (-11.0 kcal·mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) had significantly superior docking scores compared to controls. Our approach can be used to suggest predicted targets for the NP to be validated experimentally, but these in silico steps are likely to facilitate drug optimization.">

The purpose of this review article is to highlight the importance of phytomedicine against COVID-19. The main aim is to review the mechanistic aspects of most important phytochemical compounds that have showed potential against coronaviruses. Glycyrrhizin from the roots of &lt;i&gt;Glycyrrhiza glabra&lt;/i&gt; has shown promising potential against the previously epidemic coronavirus, SARS-CoV. Other important plants such as &lt;i&gt;Artemisia annua&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Isatis indigotica, Lindera aggregate&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pelargonium sidoides&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Glychirrhiza&lt;/i&gt; spp. have been employed against SARS-CoV. Active ingredients (e.g. emodin, reserpine, aescin, myricetin, scutellarin, apigenin, luteolin, and betulonic acid) have shown promising results against the coronaviruses. Phytochemicals have demonstrated activity against the coronaviruses through mechanisms such as viral entry inhibition, inhibition of replication enzymes and virus release blockage. However, compared to synthetic drugs, phytomedicine are mechanistically less understood and should be properly evaluated before application. Nonetheless, phytochemicals reduce the tedious job of drug discovery and provide a less time-consuming alternative for drug testing. Therefore, along with other drugs currently tested against COVID-19, plant-based drugs should be included for speedy development of COVID-19 treatment.">

Diabetic mice were orally administered with PCS (25 and 50 mg/kg b.w.) for 28 days. Oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) was also evaluated along with the anti-inflammatory effect, assessed by measuring paw edema development induced with carrageenan in Wistar rat and the antioxidant activity assessed using two tests (β-carotene discoloration and DPPH). Treatment of diabetic mice with PCS for four weeks managed their high fasting blood glucose levels, improved their overall health, also revealed an excellent antihyperlipidemic activity. The OGTT result showed a potent antihyperglycemic activity, and following the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, the PCS exhibited a perfect activity. LC-MS/MS result revealed the presence of 9 polyphenols. This modest work indicates that the PCS have an important antidiabetic, antihyperglycemic, antihyperlipidemic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effect that can be well established treatment of diabetes and its complications.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cellular senescence is the key mediator of cellular dysfunction before undergoing degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease. The aging process was mainly by the overactivation of senescence associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) enzyme before mediated several negative responses, including intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cellular senescence regulation, and death prior encourage synaptic loss. Thus, in the recent work, we evaluated the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; effects of aqueous extract of &lt;i&gt;Millingtonia hortensis L.&lt;/i&gt; (MH) from flower in hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-induced senescence in SK-N-SH cells. Herein, we demonstrated that MH significantly increased cell viability and decreased both of apoptotic cells and ROS production in a dose-dependent manner comparing to aging group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, flow cytometry, and ROS assay. Furthermore, the number of SA-β-gal-positive cells was also reduced in MH treatment (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01) together with the promotion of Sirt-1 protein. Importantly, MH also promoted the synaptic plasticity by decreased acetylcholinesterase activity and increased synaptophysin expression in aging neurons comparing to aging group (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01). Hispidulin (the active ingredient in MH) was also revealed the similarly effects to MH. Therefore, we suggested that MH might be beneficially for neurodegenerative disease that caused by aging.">

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and synergy by checkerboard assay of ampicillin and myticaganal C were assessed by resazurin-based 96-well microdilution. Bacterial responses were assessed by flow cytometry. Ampicillin in combination with myticaganal C showed better zone of inhibition (31.67 ± 0.58 mm) than myticaganal C or ampicillin alone. MIC of ampicillin was found to be 12.5 μg/mL, but myticaganal C was ineffective against &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Myticaganal C (8000 μg/mL) with ampicillin (0.0975 μg/mL) exhibited strong synergy, so the need for ampicillin was reduced 128-fold. Combination inhibited &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; by acting on cell membrane and by granularity disruptions. These findings indicate that myticaganal C enhances the potential of ampicillin against &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, thus providing an effective alternative to deal with the problem of bacterial resistance.">

The phytochemical studies of &lt;i&gt;P. madagascariensis&lt;/i&gt; led to the isolation of five known royleanone abietanes, namely, 6β,7α-dihydroxyroyleanone (&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;), 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;), horminone (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), coleon U quinone (&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;), and carnosolon (&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;). The relative configuration of compound &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; was established by X-ray analysis. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; showed antimycobacterial activity (Minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% inhibition, MIC&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.61-179.60 μM) against &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;37&lt;/sub&gt;Rv. Compound &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; showed comparable toxicity (Concentration for 50% inhibition, IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 98.49 μM and 79.77 μM) to tamoxifen (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; 22.00 μg/mL) against HaCaT cells. Compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;-&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; showed antioxidant activity through single-electron transfer (SET) and/or hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) with compound &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; being the most active antioxidant agent. Compounds &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; were isolated for the first time from &lt;i&gt;P. madagascariensis.&lt;/i&gt; The observed results suggest &lt;i&gt;P. madagascariensis&lt;/i&gt; as an important ethnomedicinal plant and as a promising source of diterpenoids with potential use in the treatment of tuberculosis and psoriasis.">

Sixty-five compounds in total were identified from the aromas, and 1-octen-3-ol was the main component for aromas of fresh (34.40%) and freeze-dried (68.61%) black morels, while the most abundant compound for the aroma of the oven-dried sample was 2(5&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;)-furanone (13.95%). From the lipophilic extracts, 29 compounds were identified with linoleic acid as the main compound for fresh (77.37%) and freeze-dried (56.46%) black morels and steroids (92.41%) as the main constituent for an oven-dried sample. All three lipophilic extracts showed moderate antioxidant activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) with the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values ranging 7.56 ∼ 17.52 mg/mL and 5.75 ∼ 9.73 mg/mL, respectively, and no obvious antimicrobial activity was observed for lipophilic extracts. The drying methods affect the chemical profile of black morel, and freeze-drying was favorable for retaining nutrients and morel smell.

Despite the persistent production of antiviral drugs and vaccines in the global market, viruses still remain as one of the leading causes of deadly human diseases. Effective control of viral diseases, particularly Zika virus disease, Nipah virus disease, Severe acute respiratory syndrome, Coronavirus disease, Herpes simplex virus infection, Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and Ebola virus disease remain promising goal amidst the mutating viral strains. Current trends in the development of antiviral drugs focus solely on testing novel drugs or repurposing drugs against potential targets of the viruses. Compared to synthetic drugs, medicines from natural resources offer less side-effect to humans and are often cost-effective in the productivity approaches. This review intends not only to emphasize on the major viral disease outbreaks in the past few decades and but also explores the potentialities of natural substances as antiviral traits to combat viral pathogens. Here, we spotlighted a comprehensive overview of antiviral components present in varied natural sources, including plants, fungi, and microorganisms in order to identify potent antiviral agents for developing alternative therapy in future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Antimicrobials have allowed medical advancements over several decades. However, the continuous emergence of antimicrobial resistance restricts efficacy in treating infectious diseases. In this context, the drug repositioning of already known biological active compounds to antimicrobials could represent a useful strategy. In 2002 and 2003, the SARS-CoV pandemic immobilized the Far East regions. However, the drug discovery attempts to study the virus have stopped after the crisis declined. Today's COVID-19 pandemic could probably have been avoided if those efforts against SARS-CoV had continued. Recently, a new coronavirus variant was identified in the UK. Because of this, the search for safe and potent antimicrobials and antivirals is urgent. Apart from antiviral treatment for severe cases of COVID-19, many patients with mild disease without pneumonia or moderate disease with pneumonia have received different classes of antibiotics. Diarylureas are tyrosine kinase inhibitors well known in the art as anticancer agents, which might be useful tools for a reposition as antimicrobials. The first to come onto the market as anticancer was sorafenib, followed by some other active molecules. For this interesting class of organic compounds antimicrobial, antiviral, antithrombotic, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory properties have been reported in the literature. These numerous properties make these compounds interesting for a new possible pandemic considering that, as well as for other viral infections also for CoVID-19, a multitarget therapeutic strategy could be favorable. This review is meant to be an overview on diarylureas, focusing on their biological activities, not dwelling on the already known antitumor activity. Quite a lot of papers present in the literature underline and highlight the importance of these molecules as versatile scaffolds for the development of new and promising antimicrobials and multitarget agents against new pandemic events.">

This review details typical plant-derived medicinal compounds of several classes, including alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, glycosides, lignans, phenylpropanoids, quinones, saponins, terpenoids, and xanthones that are produced by endophytic fungi. This review covers the studies carried out since the first report of taxol biosynthesis by endophytic &lt;i&gt;Taxomyces andreanae&lt;/i&gt; in 1993 up to mid-2020. The article also highlights the prospects of endophyte-dependent biosynthesis of such plant-derived pharmacologically active compounds and the bottlenecks in the commercialization of this novel approach in the area of drug discovery. After recent updates in the field of 'omics' and 'one strain many compounds' (OSMAC) approach, fungal endophytes have emerged as strong unconventional source of such prized products.">

The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; acute oral toxicity was evaluated by administering a single oral dose of the extract at 0, 300, or 2000 mg/kg body weight to female Wistar rats according to modified OECD Test Guideline 423. For the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity study, A549, HepG2, 3T3, and COS-7 cell lines were exposed to different doses of &lt;i&gt;A. malaccensis&lt;/i&gt; extract and cell viability was assessed adopting MTT assay followed by AO/EB staining, Hoechst staining, and comet assay with a view to compare the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity, if any. It was found that administration of 2000 mg/kg bw dose in &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; oral acute toxicity study did not produce significant toxicity or mortality. No significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.05) differences were observed for body weight and hematological and biochemical parameters compared to control after 14 days of treatment. No changes in behavior, body weight, hematological and biochemical parameters, and aspects of histopathology were observed when compared to the control. Thus, the possible oral lethal dose for &lt;i&gt;A. malaccensis&lt;/i&gt; extract is above 2000 mg/kg body weight. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cytotoxicity analysis showed nontoxicity concentrations of the extract to be 2, 1.4, 30, and 1.4 &lt;i&gt;µ&lt;/i&gt;g/mL for A549, HepG2, 3T3, and COS-7 cells, respectively, where no apoptotic/necrotic cell death and DNA damage were observed. In conclusion, the extract of rhizome of &lt;i&gt;A. malaccensis&lt;/i&gt; did not produce apparent cytotoxicity or acute oral toxicity, confirming the scope to use &lt;i&gt;A. malaccensis&lt;/i&gt; as a safe food preservative and a natural therapeutic product after further subacute and chronic toxicity studies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Atherosclerosis is a hallmark of most cardiovascular diseases. The implication of macrophages in this pathology is widely documented, notably for their contribution to lipid accumulation within the arterial wall, associated with oxidative stress and inflammation processes. In order to prevent or limit the atherosclerosis damage, nutritional approaches and medicinal plant-based therapies need to be considered. In Reunion Island, medicinal plant-based beverages are traditionally used for their antioxidant, lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of our study was to assess the protective effects of eight medicinal plant decoctions in an in vitro model of RAW 264.7 murine macrophages exposed to pro-atherogenic conditions (oxidized low-density lipoproteins-ox-LDL-&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; Lipopolysaccharides-LPS). The impact of polyphenol-rich medicinal plant decoctions on cell viability was evaluated by Neutral Red assay. Fluorescent ox-LDL uptake was assessed by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Activation of NF-κB was evaluated by quantification of secreted alkaline phosphatase in RAW-Blue™ macrophages. Our results show that medicinal plant decoctions limited the cytotoxicity induced by ox-LDL on macrophages. Flow cytometry analysis in macrophages demonstrated that medicinal plant decoctions from &lt;i&gt;S. cumini&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P. mauritianum&lt;/i&gt; decreased ox-LDL uptake and accumulation by more than 70%. In addition, medicinal plant decoctions also inhibited NF-κB pathway activation in the presence of pro-inflammatory concentrations of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; LPS. Our data suggest that medicinal plant decoctions exert protective effects on ox-LDL-induced cytotoxicity and limited macrophage lipid uptake. Moreover, herbal preparations displayed anti-inflammatory properties on macrophages that can be of interest for limiting the atherosclerotic process.">

A literature search was performed to find materials describing (i) botanical characteristics; (ii) the phytochemical profile; and (iii) biological properties of the essential oil sand extracts of these so called &quot;old roses&quot; that are cultivated in Bulgaria, Turkey, India, and the Middle East. The information used is from databases PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Roses have beneficial healing properties due to their richness of beneficial components, the secondary metabolites as flavonoids (e.g., flavones, flavonols, anthocyanins), fragrant components (essential oils, e.g., monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes), and hydrolysable and condensed tannins. Rose essential oils and extracts with their therapeutic properties-as respiratory antiseptics, anti-inflammatories, mucolytics, expectorants, decongestants, and antioxidants-are able to act as symptomatic prophylactics and drugs, and in this way alleviate dramatic sufferings during severe diseases.">

High-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC), resin adsorption technology and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to separate and purify phloridzin. Many studies showed that phloridzin had multiple pharmacological effects, such as antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antihyperglycaemic, anticancer and antibacterial activities. Besides, the physiological activities of phloridzin are cardioprotective, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, immunomodulatory, antiobesity, antioxidant and so on. The present review summarizes the biosynthesis, distribution, extraction and bioavailability of the natural compound phloridzin and discusses its applications in food and medicine.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a liver disease caused by a nonalcoholic fatty liver, is increasing in incidence worldwide. Owing to the complexity of its pathogenic mechanisms, there are no therapeutic agents for this disease yet. The ideal drug for NASH needs to concurrently decrease hepatic lipid accumulation and exert anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, and antioxidative effects in the liver. Because of their multipurpose therapeutic effects, we considered that medicinal herbs are suitable for treating patients with NASH.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We determined the efficacy of the alcoholic extract of Lysimachia vulgaris var. davurica (LV), an edible medicinal herb, for NASH treatment. For inducing NASH, C57BLKS/J lar-Lepr&lt;sup&gt;db&lt;/sup&gt;/Lepr&lt;sup&gt;db&lt;/sup&gt; (db/db) male mice were fed with a methionine-choline deficient (MCD) diet ad libitum. After 3 weeks, the LV extract and a positive control (GFT505) were administered to mice by oral gavage for 3 weeks with a continued MCD diet as needed.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In mice with diet-induced NASH, the LV extract could relieve the disease symptoms; that is, the extract ameliorated hepatic lipid accumulation and also showed antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The LV extract also activated nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression, leading to the upregulation of antioxidants and detoxification signaling. Moreover, the extract presented remarkable efficacy in alleviating liver fibrosis compared with GFT505. This difference was caused by significant LV extract-mediated reduction in the mRNA expression of fibrotic genes like the alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen type 3 alpha 1. Reduction of fibrotic genes may thus relate with the downregulation of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)/Smad signaling by LV extract administration.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in the liver were alleviated by feeding LV extract to NASH-induced mice. Moreover, the LV extract strongly prevented liver fibrosis by blocking TGFβ/Smad signaling. Hence, LV showed sufficient potency for use as a therapeutic agent against NASH.">

Towards the end of 2019, the novel coronavirus identified in Wuhan, China, presented as a cluster of symptoms of pneumonia. Its quick spread resulted in a global pandemic. This research documents detailed ethnopharmacological information on the medicinal plant species used by herbalists against coronavirus disease.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;The study was conducted in Salé Prefecture, from March 1st, 2020 to May 31st, 2020. Semi-structured face to face interviews were held with 30 herbalists and collected; socio-demographic characteristics, the names of local species, and traditional remedies being used. The data were analyzed through the use reports (UR) and medicinal use value (MUV).&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;In total, 20 plant species from 20 genera and 14 families had been most frequently used by herbalists from Salé Prefecture for the prevention and treatment of COVID 19. The most mentioned plant was &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus globulus&lt;/i&gt; Labill., followed by &lt;i&gt;Azadirachta indica&lt;/i&gt; A. Juss,. and &lt;i&gt;Ziziphus lotus&lt;/i&gt; (L.) Lam. Moreover, the most commonly used plant parts for herbal preparations were leaves (28.43%) and seeds (17.5%), and the majority of remedies were prepared through infusion.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The present study is the first contribution to the ethnopharmacological profile of this Prefecture. It is recommended that the constituents of indigenous species be studied to determine the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action. However, attention must be paid to the conservation of medicinal species, comprehensively documenting traditional medicinal knowledge as well as conducting phytochemical validation of reported plants.">

The results of sensitivity analysis revealed that phenological stages, hill aspects, total nitrogen, altitude and organic carbon are the most influential factors that have an integral effect on the content of hypericin.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;The designed graphical user interface will help pharmacognosist, manufacturers and producers of medicinal plants and so on to run the MLP model on new data to easily discover the content of hypericin in H. perforatum by entering ecological conditions of site, soil characteristics and plant phenological stages.">

        <span class="abst" title="Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) is a well-known hepatocarcinogen, and its oral administration causes severe liver damage including cancer. DEN induces the pathogenesis of the liver through reactive oxygen species mediated inflammation and modulation of various biological activities. 6-Gingerol, a major component of ginger, is reported to prevent liver diseases by reducing the oxidative stress and proinflammatory mediators. The present study investigated the hepatoprotective effects of 6-gingerol through the measurement of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory markers, liver function enzyme parameter, and histopathological analysis. The rats were randomly divided into four groups as the control, DEN treated (50 mg/kg b.w.), DEN+6-gingerol (each 50 mg/kg b.w.), and 6-gingerol only. To evaluate the hepatoprotective effects, liver function enzymes (ALT, AST, and ALP), oxidative stress markers (SOD, GSH, GST, and TAC), lipid peroxidation, inflammatory markers (CRP, TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;, IL-6, and ICAM1), haematoxylin and eosin staining, Sirius red staining, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy were performed. The results showed a significant increase in liver function enzymes, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers in the DEN-treated group as compared to the control group. Besides this, altered architecture of hepatocytes (infiltration of inflammatory cells, congestion, blood vessel dilation, and edema), abundant collagen fiber and organelle structures like distorted shaped and swollen mitochondria, and broken endoplasmic reticulum were noticed. The administration of 6-gingerol significantly ameliorated the biochemical and histopathological changes. The increased expression of TNF-&lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; protein was noticed in the DEN-treated group whereas the administration of 6-gingerol significantly decreased the expression of this protein. Based on these findings, it can be suggested that 6-gingerol may be an alternative therapy for the prevention and treatment of liver diseases.">

Its major medicinal active metabolites are perylenequinones, including hypocrellin A, elsinochrome A and so on. At present, the fermentation yield of perylenequinones is low, and its complex biosynthesis and regulatory pathways are still unclear. In this study, nitric oxide, as a downstream signal molecule of hydrogen peroxide, regulates the biosynthesis of perylenequinones. Exogenous addition of 0.01 mM sodium nitroprusside (nitric oxide donor) can promote perylenequinones production by 156% compared with the control. Further research found that hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide increased the transcriptional level of the biosynthetic genes of hypocrellin A. The results showed that nitric oxide is involved in the biosynthesis and regulation of perylenequinones in Shiraia bambusicola as a signal molecule. In the future, the yield of perylenequinones can be increased by adding exogenous nitric oxide in fermentation.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;Hereditary ataxia (HA) represents a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative diseases caused by dysfunction of the cerebellum or disruption of the connection between the cerebellum and other areas of the central nervous system. Phenotypic manifestation of HA includes unsteadiness of stance and gait, dysarthria, nystagmus, dysmetria and complaints of clumsiness. There are no specific treatments for HA. Management strategies provide supportive treatment to reduce symptoms.&lt;h4&gt;Objectives&lt;/h4&gt;This systematic review aimed to identify, evaluate and summarise the published literature on the therapeutic roles of natural remedies in the treatment of HA to provide evidence for clinical practice.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;A systematic literature search was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Web of Science, PubMed and Science Direct Scopus were thoroughly searched for relevant published articles from June 2007 to July 2020.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Ten pre-clinical and two clinical studies were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. We identified the therapeutic roles of medicinal plants Brassica napus, Gardenia jasminoides, Gastrodia elata, Ginkgo biloba, Glycyrrhiza inflata, Paeonia lactiflora, Pueraria lobata and Rehmannia glutinosa; herbal formulations Shaoyao Gancao Tang and Zhengan Xifeng Tang; and medicinal mushroom Hericium erinaceus in the treatment of HA. In this review, we evaluated the mode of actions contributing to their therapeutic effects, including activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, activation of antioxidant pathways, maintenance of intracellular calcium homeostasis and regulation of chaperones. We also briefly highlighted the integral cellular signalling pathways responsible for orchestrating the mode of actions.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;We reviewed the therapeutic roles of natural remedies in improving or halting the progression of HA, which warrant further study for applications into clinical practice.">

Molecular docking results provided the significant prima facie evidence of the leaf extract to have antileishmanial potential. To confirm this, we performed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antileishmanial and cytotoxicity assays. Methanolic extract of &lt;i&gt;C. fistula&lt;/i&gt; leaves showed growth inhibition and proliferation of &lt;i&gt;L. donovani&lt;/i&gt; promastigote with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 43.31 ± 4.202 μg/mL. It also inhibited the growth of intra-macrophagic amastigotes with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 80.76 ± 3.626 μg/mL. &lt;i&gt;C. fistula&lt;/i&gt; extract was found cytotoxic at a very high concentration on human macrophages (CC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 626 ± 39 μg/mL). Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay suggested partial apoptosis induction in parasites by &lt;i&gt;C. fistula&lt;/i&gt; to exert its antileishmanial activity. Here, for the first time, we have shown the antileishmanial potential of &lt;i&gt;C. fistula&lt;/i&gt; leaves. Overall, our results could open new insight for an affordable and natural antileishmanial with high efficacy and less toxicity.">

Further testing of purified compounds &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; proved that they are devoid of antibiotic activity, and all the activities observed in the crude extract could be assigned to emestrin (&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;), whose configuration was confirmed by crystallographic data.

        <span class="abst" title="Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi is a famous medicinal plant with its dried roots having been used as a traditional Chinese medicinal for more than 2000 years. Although its genome sequence has previously been published and molecular biology methods have been used to study this species, no suitable internal reference genes have been investigated for standardization of gene expression via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Here, the stabilities of 10 candidate reference genes, ACT11, ACT7, α-TUB, β-TUB, GAPDH, UBC, RPL, SAM, HSP70, and PP2A, were analyzed by four different procedures of GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Their expression stabilities were evaluated under various conditions, including different tissue types (root, stem, leaf, and flower), hormone stimuli treatments (methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and abscisic acid), and abiotic stresses (heavy metal, salt, drought, cold, and wounding). The results indicated that β-TUB was the most stable gene for all tested samples, while ACT11 was the most unstable. The most stable reference gene was not consistent under different conditions. β-TUB exhibited the highest stability for different tissue types and abiotic stresses, while for hormone stimuli treatments, ACT7 showed the highest stability. To confirm the applicability of suitable reference genes, we selected to SbF6H and SbF8H as target genes to analyze their expression levels in different tissues. This study helps to the accurate quantification of the relative expression levels of interest genes in S. baicalensis via qRT-PCR analysis.">

Thus, the study was conducted to evaluate the toxic effect of aqueous leaf extract of &lt;i&gt;Simarouba glauca&lt;/i&gt; (AESG) on relevant organs of male &lt;i&gt;Wistar&lt;/i&gt; rats. The oral acute toxicity of AESG was evaluated according to the method described by Lorke. Sub-chronic toxicity of AESG was carried out in line with the guidelines of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), using a total of twenty-four (24) male &lt;i&gt;Wistar&lt;/i&gt; rats divided into four groups of six rats each. Test rats were orally administered AESG at doses of 500, 1000 and 2000 mg /kg body weight, respectively, daily for thirty (30) days. At the end of the study, rats were fasted overnight and sacrificed; the relevant biochemical and histopathology evaluation was carried out. Statistical analysis was conducted using the GraphPad Prism®, version 7. The data obtained indicated that the &lt;i&gt;LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; exceeded 5000 mg/kg. There were significant increases (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;) in percentage (%) body weight of test rats. There were no significant differences (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;) in mean liver, kidney, and heart weight/body weight (IOW/BWT) ratios. The AST activity was significantly lowered (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;) in rats administered AESG 2000 mg/kg. The ALP activities were significantly elevated (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;), while the GGT activities were significantly lowered (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;) in all groups of rats administered AESG. Plasma conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin were significantly lowered and elevated (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;), respectively in rats administered AESG 1000 and 2000 mg/kg. Plasma urea was significantly elevated (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;) in rats given AESG 1000 mg/kg. Test rats given AESG 2000 mg/kg recorded significant reduction (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;) in plasma sodium ions concentration. Rats given AESG 500 mg/kg recorded significant reduction (&lt;i&gt;P &lt; 0.05&lt;/i&gt;) in plasma bicarbonate ion levels. The findings suggest that AESG was not significantly toxic to the liver, kidney, and heart.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) is a medicinal plant with antioxidant-rich fruits. Diniconazole, a broad-spectrum fungicide, is employed extensively. The present study was designed to evaluate the preventive efficiency of C. mas fruit extract (CME) against the toxic effects of diniconazole on a model organism, Allium cepa L. For this aim, physiological, cytogenetic and biochemical parameters as well as the meristematic cell damages were investigated in A. cepa treated with diniconazole and C. mas extract. A. cepa bulbs were divided into six groups which were treated with tap water, 0.5 g/L CME, 1.0 g/L CME, 100 mg/L diniconazole, 0.5 g/L CME + 100 mg/L diniconazole and 1.0 g/L CME + 100 mg/L diniconazole, respectively. Diniconazole application caused a significant reduction in germination percentage, root elongation and total weight gain. Mitotic index decreased, while chromosomal aberrations increased following diniconazole application. Diniconazole caused significant rises in malondialdehyde content and the total activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase enzymes. The meristematic cell damages induced by diniconazole were indistinct transmission tissue, epidermis cell deformation, thickening of the cortex cell wall and flattened cell nucleus. Aqueous C. mas extracts induced a dose-dependent prevention and amelioration in all damages arisen from diniconazole application.">

In particular, plant-derived natural compounds, including phytochemicals, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, are gaining attention as they promote health and prevent disease. Although several &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; methods have been developed to confirm the biological activities of natural compounds, there is still considerable room to reduce time and cost. To overcome these limitations, several &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; methods have been proposed for conducting large-scale analysis, but they are still limited in terms of dealing with incomplete and heterogeneous natural compound data. Here, we propose a deep learning-based approach to identify the medicinal uses of natural compounds by exploiting massive and heterogeneous drug and natural compound data. The rationale behind this approach is that deep learning can effectively utilize heterogeneous features to alleviate incomplete information. Based on latent knowledge, molecular interactions, and chemical property features, we generated 686 dimensional features for 4,507 natural compounds and 2,882 approved and investigational drugs. The deep learning model was trained using the generated features and verified drug indication information. When the features of natural compounds were applied as input to the trained model, potential efficacies were successfully predicted with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.">

This study evaluated the intrinsic antioxidant property of methanol fruit extract of &lt;i&gt;Tetrapleura tetraptera&lt;/i&gt; (TT), traditionally used for managing brain diseases such as cerebral infarction in West Africa, and its ability to protect primary astrocytes from anoxia-induced cell death. The effect of the phytochemicals present in TT on excitotoxicity was assessed &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;, through docking with human glutamate synthetase (hGS). Chromatographic and spectrophotometric analyses of TT were performed. Primary astrocytes derived from neural stem cells were treated with TT and its effect on astrocyte viability was assessed. TT-treated astrocytes were then subjected to anoxic insult and, cell viability and mitochondrial membrane potential were evaluated. Molecular docking of hGS with detected phytochemicals in TT (aridanin, naringenin, ferulic acid, and scopoletin) was performed and the number of interactions with the lead compounds, aridanin, analyzed. HPLC-DAD analysis of TT revealed the presence of various bioactive phytochemicals. TT demonstrated notable antioxidant and radical scavenging activities. TT also protected astrocytes from anoxic insult by restoring cell viability and preventing alteration to mitochondrial membrane integrity. Aridanin, naringenin, ferulic acid, and scopoletin demonstrated good binding affinities with hGS indicating that &lt;i&gt;Tetrapleura tetraptera&lt;/i&gt; is a potential source of new plant-based bioactives relevant in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.">

In this study, the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activity of three BBIQ alkaloids (cycleanine [compound 1], isochondodendrine [compound 2], and 2'-norcocsuline [compound 3]) isolated from the &lt;i&gt;Triclisia subcordata&lt;/i&gt; Oliv. medicinal plant traditionally used for the treatment of malaria in Nigeria are studied alongside two semisynthetic analogues (compounds 4 and 5) of cycleanine. The antiproliferative effects against a chloroquine-resistant &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; strain were determined using a SYBR green 1 fluorescence assay. The &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; antimalarial activity of cycleanine is then investigated in suppressive, prophylactic, and curative murine malaria models after infection with a chloroquine-sensitive &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium berghei&lt;/i&gt; strain. BBIQ alkaloids (compounds 1 to 5) exerted &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; antiplasmodial activities with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) at low micromolar concentrations and the two semisynthetic cycleanine analogues showed an improved potency and selectivity compared to those of cycleanine. At oral doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg body weight of infected mice, cycleanine suppressed the levels of parasitemia and increased mean survival times significantly compared to those of the control groups. The metabolites and metabolic pathways of cycleanine were also studied using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Twelve novel metabolites were detected in rats after intragastric administration of cycleanine. The metabolic pathways of cycleanine were demonstrated to involve hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, and demethylation. Overall, these &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; results provide a basis for the future evaluation of cycleanine and its analogues as leads for further development.">

Three extracts from seeds of &lt;i&gt;W. filifera&lt;/i&gt; were evaluated for their enzyme inhibitory effect and IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values were calculated for all the extracts. The inhibition mode was investigated by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis and the inhibition of IAPP aggregate formation was monitored. &lt;i&gt;W. filifera&lt;/i&gt; methanol seed extract appears as the most potent inhibitor of α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and for the IAPP fibril formation. Current findings indicate new potential of this extract that could be used for the identification or development of novel potential agents for T2D and AD.">

Our results show that this new synthesised compound effectively inhibits cell survival in BTK-dependent mechanism. Its effectiveness is much higher at a relatively low concentration as compared with the standard chemotherapy used for CRC, i.e. 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Flow cytometry analysis after annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining revealed that apoptosis was the main response of CRC cells to &lt;b&gt;MM-129&lt;/b&gt; treatment. We also found that &lt;b&gt;MM-129&lt;/b&gt; effectively inhibits tumour development in zebrafish embryo xenograft model, where it showed a markedly synergistic anticancer effect when used in combination with 5-FU. The above results suggest that this novel heterofused 1,2,4-triazine derivative may be a promising candidate for further evaluation as chemotherapeutic agent against CRC.">

The present work aims to evaluate the anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antifungal potentials of &lt;i&gt;C. europaea&lt;/i&gt; fractions including hydro ethanol (ET CE), n-butanol (But CE), and polyphenol (Poly CE). The chemical composition of hydroethanol, n-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions from &lt;i&gt;C. europaea&lt;/i&gt; were determined using GC-MS after silylation. The anti-inflammatory effect of hydroethanol, n-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions was studied by carrageenan-induced paw edema. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of hydroethanol, n-butanol, and polyphenol-rich fractions against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and yeasts were assessed using the disc diffusion and micro-dilution assays. The findings of the chemical characterization affirmed the presence of interesting bioactive compounds in &lt;i&gt;C. europaea&lt;/i&gt; fractions. The polyphenol-rich fraction was the best inhibitor of edema by75.68% after 6 h of treatment. The hydroethanol fraction was the most active against both bacteria and yeasts. This study contributes to society as it provides potential bioactive compounds in &lt;i&gt;C. europaea&lt;/i&gt; extract, which may help in fighting nosocomial antibiotic-resistant microbes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, and it is characterized by spontaneous seizures. In a previous study, we identified 4-(2-chloro-4-fluorobenzyl)-3-(2-thienyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5(4H)-one (GM-90432) as a novel anti-epileptic agent in chemically- or genetically-induced epileptic zebrafish and mouse models. In this study, we investigated the anti-epileptic effects of GM-90432 through neurochemical profiling-based approach to understand the neuroprotective mechanism in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced epileptic seizure zebrafish model. GM-90432 effectively improved PTZ-induced epileptic behaviors via upregulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine, 17-β-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, progesterone, 5α -dihydroprogesterone, and allopregnanolone levels, and downregulation of normetanephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and cortisol levels in brain tissue. GM-90432 also had a protective effect against PTZ-induced oxidative stress and zebrafish death, suggesting that it exhibits biphasic neuroprotective effects via scavenging of reactive oxygen species and anti-epileptic activities in a zebrafish model. In conclusion, our results suggest that neurochemical profiling study could be used to better understand of anti-epileptic mechanism of GM-90432, potentially leading to new drug discovery and development of anti-seizure agents.">

The oldest medical pharmacopeias of the African, Arabian, and Asian countries solely utilize plants and herbs to treat pain, oral diseases, skin diseases, microbial infections, multiple types of cancers, reproductive disorders among a myriad of other ailments. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 65% of the world population solely utilize botanical preparations as medicine. Due to the abundance of plants, plant-derived medicines are more readily accessible, affordable, convenient, and have safer side-effect profiles than synthetic drugs. Plant-based decoctions have been a significant part of Jamaican traditional folklore medicine. Jamaica is of particular interest because it has approximately 52% of the established medicinal plants that exist on earth. This makes the island particularly welcoming for rigorous scientific research on the medicinal value of plants and the development of phytomedicine thereof. Viral infections caused by the human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), hepatitis virus B and C, influenza A virus, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) present a significant global burden. This is a review of some important Jamaican medicinal plants, with particular reference to their antiviral activity.">

        <span class="abst" title="The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified in China as the etiologic agent of the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Due to its high transmissibility, this virus quickly spread throughout the world, causing considerable health issues. The scientific community exerted noteworthy efforts to obtain therapeutic solutions for COVID-19, and new scientific networks were constituted. No certified drugs to efficiently inhibit the virus were identified, and the development of de-novo medicines requires approximately ten years of research. Therefore, the repurposing of natural products could be an effective strategy to handle SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review aims to update on current status of the natural occurring compounds recognizing SARS-CoV-2 druggable targets. Among the clinical trials actually recruited, some natural compounds are ongoing to examine their potential role to prevent and to treat the COVID-19 infection. Many natural scaffolds, including alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, and benzoquinones, were investigated by in-silico, in-vitro, and in-vivo approaches. Despite the large data set obtained by a computational approach, experimental evidences in most cases are not available. To fill this gap, further efforts to validate these results are required. We believe that an accurate investigation of naturally occurring compounds may provide insights for the potential treatment of COVID-19 patients.">

        <span class="abst" title="Polycyclic endoperoxides are rare natural metabolites found and isolated in plants, fungi, and marine invertebrates. The purpose of this review is a comparative analysis of the pharmacological potential of these natural products. According to PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) estimates, they are more likely to exhibit antiprotozoal and antitumor properties. Some of them are now widely used in clinical medicine. All polycyclic endoperoxides presented in this article demonstrate antiprotozoal activity and can be divided into three groups. The third group includes endoperoxides, which show weak antiprotozoal activity with a reliability of up to 70%, and this group includes only 1.1% of metabolites. The second group includes the largest number of endoperoxides, which are 65% and show average antiprotozoal activity with a confidence level of 70 to 90%. Lastly, the third group includes endoperoxides, which are 33.9% and show strong antiprotozoal activity with a confidence level of 90 to 99.6%. Interestingly, artemisinin and its analogs show strong antiprotozoal activity with 79 to 99.6% confidence against obligate intracellular parasites which belong to the genera Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Leishmania, and Coccidia. In addition to antiprotozoal activities, polycyclic endoperoxides show antitumor activity in the proportion: 4.6% show weak activity with a reliability of up to 70%, 65.6% show an average activity with a reliability of 70 to 90%, and 29.8% show strong activity with a reliability of 90 to 98.3%. It should also be noted that some polycyclic endoperoxides, in addition to antiprotozoal and antitumor properties, show other strong activities with a confidence level of 90 to 97%. These include antifungal activity against the genera Aspergillus, Candida, and Cryptococcus, as well as anti-inflammatory activity. This review provides insights on further utilization of polycyclic endoperoxides by medicinal chemists, pharmacologists, and the pharmaceutical industry.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cervical cancer, as the most frequent cancer in women globally and accounts almost 14% in India. It can be prevented or treated with vaccines, radiation, chemotherapy, and brachytherapy. The chemotherapeutic agents cause adverse post effects by the destruction of the neighboring normal cells or altering the properties of the cells. In order to reduce the severity of the side effects caused by the chemically synthesized therapeutic agents, the current research developed an anti-cancer agent dimer of epicatechin (DoE), a natural bioactive secondary metabolite (BSM) mediated from an endophytic fungus &lt;i&gt;Curvularia australiensis&lt;/i&gt; FC2AP. The investigation has initiated with the evaluation of inhibiting the angiogenesis which is a main activity in metastasis, and it was assessed through Hen's Egg Test on Chorio Allantoic Membrane (HET-CAM) test; the BSM inhibited the growth of blood vessels in the developing chick embryo. Further the DoE was evaluated for its acute toxicity levels in albino mice, whereas the survival dose was found to be 1250 mg/kg and the lethal dose was 1500 mg/kg body weight of albino mice; hematological, biochemical, and histopathological analyses were assessed. The anti-inflammatory responses of the DoE were evaluated in carrageenan induced Wistar rats and the reduction of inflammation occurred in a dose-dependent manner. By fixing the effective dose for anti-inflammation analysis, the DoE was taken for the anti-cervical cancer analysis in benzo (a) pyrene induced female Sprague-Dawley rats for 60 days trial. After the stipulated days, the rats were taken for hematological antioxidants, lipid peroxidation (LPO), member bound enzymes, cervical histopathological and carcinogenic markers analyses. The results specified that the DoE has the capability of reducing the tumor in an efficient way. This is the first report of flavonoid-DoE production from an endophytic fungus &lt;i&gt;C. australiensis&lt;/i&gt; has the anticancer potentiality and it can be stated as anti-cancer drug.">

        <span class="abst" title="&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;In spite of an increasing number of ethnobotanical market surveys in the past decades, few studies compare changes in plant species trade over time. The open-air market Ver-o-Peso (VOP) in Belém, located near the mouth of the Amazon River in the state of Pará, Brazil, is known for its wide variety of medicinal plants. A survey of VOP was published in 1984, but it remains unknown to what extent its botanical composition changed over 34 years. Furthermore, in northern Brazil, little attention has been given to the origins of the vernacular names of these plants. Our aim is to give an up-to-date overview of the VOP medicinal plant market, concentrating on changes in species composition and vernacular names over time.&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;We collected medicinal plants and vernacular names at VOP in August 2018. We identified most plants at the Museo Paraense Emilio Goeldi Herbarium, where we also deposited vouchers and specimen labels. We compared our species composition data to the 1984 inventory by Van den Berg. Furthermore, we investigated the etymologies of the vernacular plant names.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;We recorded 155 plant specimens and 165 corresponding vernacular names, and collected 146 specimens from the medicinal and ritual stalls of VOP reporting 86 species formerly not recorded at this market. Vernacular names had mostly Portuguese roots, followed by Tupi and African ones. We found 30 species also documented in 1984, and vernacular names that overlapped between both surveys were used for the same botanical species or genus, indicating that vernacular names have changed little in the past decades. Lastly, we found 26 more introduced species sold at VOP compared to 1984.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;Forest degradation and deforestation, prevalence of diseases, and methodological factors may play a role in the differences we found in our survey compared to 1984. Of the plants that did overlap between the two surveys, vernacular names of these plants were hardly different. Lastly, the lingual origins of the vernacular names in our survey and the origins of the plant species reflect the history of the intricate syncretism of medicinal plant practices of indigenous, Afro-Brazilian and European origins in Belém.">

The present study was designed to investigate the total phenolic and flavonoid contents, as well as the antioxidant properties of leaves extracts from &lt;i&gt;Globularia alypum&lt;/i&gt; L. colected from the Taza region in northeast Morocco. Additionally, the individual phenolics and volatiles of the extracts were also evaluated. The organic extracts of this plant were obtained by Soxhlet extraction using two different solvents, namely ethyl acetate and chloroform. The antioxidant capacity of leaves extracts was measured using DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays; the phenolic profile was determined by HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS analysis, whereas the volatile composition was elucidated by GC-MS. The ethyl acetate extract analysis showed a total of 20 phenolic compounds and the determination of phenolic contents showed a significant value of 56.5 ± 0.61 µg GAE/mg of extract in comparison with the chloroform extract (18.9 ± 0.48 µg GAE/mg of extract). Also, the determination of the flavonoid contents revealed that the ethyl acetate extract contained the highest value (30.2 ± 0.55 µg CE/mg of extract) in comparison with the chloroform extract (18.0 ± 0.36 µg CE/mg of extract). Concerning the antioxidant properties, interesting values were attained for the ethyl acetate extract which exhibited higher antioxidant activity, namely IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.3 ± 3.83 µg/mL and IC50 = 37.0 ± 2.45 µg/mL for the DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively, whereas a value of 531.1 ± 17.08 (mg AAE/g DW) was obtained for the FRAP assay. Concerning the volatile profile, a total of 73 compounds were positively detected and among them &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-hexadecanoic acid (13.5%) was the most abundant one. The results achieved confirm the important role of this plant as a source of natural antioxidants.">

        <span class="abst" title="In this study, we investigated the bioactive potential (antibacterial and antioxidant), anticancer activity and detailed phytochemical analysis of &lt;i&gt;Selaginella&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;repanda (S. repanda)&lt;/i&gt; ethanolic crude extract for the very first time using different in vitro approaches. Furthermore, computer-aided prediction of pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile of the identified phytoconstituents were also employed in order to provide some useful insights for drug discovery. &lt;i&gt;S. repanda&lt;/i&gt;, which is a rich source of potent natural bioactive compounds, showed promising antibacterial activity against the tested pathogenic bacteria (&lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;P. aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. flexneri&lt;/i&gt;). The crude extract displayed favorable antioxidant activity against both 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 231.6 μg/mL) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 288.3 μg/mL) molecules. &lt;i&gt;S. repanda&lt;/i&gt; also showed favorable and effective anticancer activity against all three malignant cancer cells in a dose/time dependent manner. Higher activity was found against lung (A549) (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 341.1 μg/mL), followed by colon (HCT-116) (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 378.8 μg/mL) and breast (MCF-7) (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 428.3 μg/mL) cancer cells. High resolution-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HR-LC-MS) data of &lt;i&gt;S. repanda&lt;/i&gt; crude extract revealed the presence of diverse bioactive/chemical components, including fatty acids, alcohol, sugar, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, coumarins and phenolics, which can be the basis and major cause for its bioactive potential. Therefore, achieved results from this study confirmed the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;S. repanda&lt;/i&gt; and a prospective source of naturally active biomolecules with antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer potential. These phytocompounds alone with their favorable pharmacokinetics profile suggests good lead and efficiency of &lt;i&gt;S. repanda&lt;/i&gt; with no toxicity risks. Finally, further in vivo experimental investigations can be promoted as probable candidates for various therapeutic functions, drug discovery and development.">
