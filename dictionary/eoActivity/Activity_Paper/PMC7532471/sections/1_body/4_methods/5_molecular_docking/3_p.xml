<p id="Par32">The best binding conformation of phytocompounds against target proteins were determined based on the lowest total binding energy among the different conformations generated. The identified phytocompounds were imported into the iGEMDOCK graphical user interface and were sorted by the post-docking analysis based on their binding energies and compound fitness score measured by the iGEMDOCK docking algorithm

 </sup>. To determine the relative strengths of the binding interactions of the best identified phytocompound, screening for its best binding pose and the series of energy values, such as binding energy, ligand efficiency, inhibition constant and Van der Waals (VDW) + hydrogen bonding (Hbond) + desolvation energy of each target protein, were analyzed using the AutoDOCK program. Furthermore, the detailed interactions between the best phytocompound identified, and its binding sites with bacterial, fungal, viral and diabetic target proteins were visualized in PyMol 3D visualization
