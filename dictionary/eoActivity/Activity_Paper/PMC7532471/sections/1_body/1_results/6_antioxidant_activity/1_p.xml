<p id="Par15">In the present study, the different concentrations of leaf and rhizome extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> were subjected to 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) free radical scavenging method. The methanolic leaf extract was revealed maximum DPPH activity of 83.68%, while gallic acid, ethyl acetate leaf and methanolic rhizome extracts recorded about 94.85%, 81.86% and 84.53%, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). The methanolic leaf extract exhibited the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50.65 µg/ml, followed by methanolic rhizome and ethyl acetate extracts with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 59.42 µg/ml and 78.54 µg/ml respectively, whereas the gallic acid exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 48 µg/ml. The percent Ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP) activity of leaf and rhizome extracts recorded 18.56 to 81.57% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). Among extracts, methanolic leaf extract revealed a maximum FRAP activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value was 60.65 μg/ml, ethyl acetate leaf extract was showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 79.79 µg/ml and methanolic rhizome extracts was showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 73.42 µg/ml. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the extract was less than that of the standard.
