<p id="Par17">The GCâ€“MS analysis revealed that 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> leaf and rhizome extracts contained 25 bioactive compounds (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). These phytocompounds were analyzed for activities against bacterial, fungal, viral, antioxidant and diabetic target proteins. The docking studies were carried out for phytoligands using the iGEMDOCK program to elucidate the binding affinities to the target proteins. The binding interaction and conformation of each phytocompound with each target protein were predicted and ranked based on the iGEMDOCK-computed lowest energy and total binding energy, respectively. The best binding conformation for each phytocompound with each target protein was determined, if it showed the lowest total binding energy among its different conformations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>).
