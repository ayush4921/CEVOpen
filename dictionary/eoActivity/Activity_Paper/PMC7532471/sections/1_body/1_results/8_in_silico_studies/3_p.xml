<p id="Par19">The serverogenin acetate formed the most excellent ligand–protein complexes (e.g. with six of seven tested target proteins) compared with other compounds. Next, docking analysis was then carried out for serverogenin acetate with the target proteins through AutoDock program. According to the binding energies, the docking results of serverogenin acetate with target proteins were ranked. Analysis of the docking results showed the potential strength of binding affinity of serverogenin acetate into the binding sites of target proteins with minimum binding energies (ranging from − 3.31 to − 4.22 kcal/mol), ligand efficiency (− 0.08 to − 0.11 kcal/mol), inhibition constant (1.01 to 804.76 µM) and Van der Waals (VDW) + hydrogen bonding (Hbond) + desolvation energy (− 4.17 to − 5.14 kcal/mol) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>). This serverogenin compound also formed hydrogen-bond interactions and the best possible binding pose with the residues of bacterial (Fig.
