Computational prediction models, also known as predictive tools, which play an important part in the selection of methodologies directing pharmaceutical and technological research, and have also been used in in silico prediction of pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and toxicological performance

 </sup>. Currently, molecular docking is an effective and inexpensive method for designing and testing the drugs. This technique provides information about drug receptor interactions that are useful to predict the binding orientation of drug candidates to their target proteins

 </sup>. Besides, this approach helps in systemic study by introducing a molecule on the binding spot of the object macromolecule in a non-covalent fashion, leading to an accurate binding at the active sites of each ligand
