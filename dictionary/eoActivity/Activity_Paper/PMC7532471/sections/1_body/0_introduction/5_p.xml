<p id="Par6">Therefore, the present study focuses on identification of bioactive compounds from ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> leaves, and methanol extract from 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> rhizomes by GC–MS analysis. We have also evaluated the efficacy of leaves and rhizome extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> for their antimicrobial, antioxidant and antidiabetic assay. Subsequently, in silico molecular docking and computational molecular simulation was explored for analysis of the potential bioactive compounds for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant and antidiabetic (e.g. α-glucosidase, α-amylase and aldose reductase) activities. Findings suggest that out of 25 identified phytochemical compounds, serverogenin acetate ([3,12-diacetyloxy-10,14-dimethyl-13-oxo-15-(5-oxo-2H-furan-3-yl)-2-oxapentacyclo[9.7.0.01,3.05,10.014,18]octadecan-7-yl] acetate) might have the best pharmacological properties. This report helps predict the structure and formula of phytochemical components present in various solvent extracts of 
 <italic>A. nilgiricum</italic> plants.
