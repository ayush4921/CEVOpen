  <p>In silico molecular docking shows the binding interaction of serverogenin acetate ([3,12-diacetyloxy-10,14-dimethyl-13-oxo-15-(5-oxo-2H-furan-3-yl)-2-oxapentacyclo[9.7.0.01,3.05,10.014,18]octadecan-7-yl] acetate) compound with bacterial target protein (5iwm) based on the binding energy generated by AutoDock program. (
   <bold>a</bold>) A hydrogen-bond interaction is formed by O26 in GLY341 (black arrow) in the serverogenin acetate compound. (
   <bold>b</bold>) A close-up view of serverogenin acetate compound that binds to the bacterial target protein. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Binding pose of the bacterial target protein with serverogenin acetate compound.
