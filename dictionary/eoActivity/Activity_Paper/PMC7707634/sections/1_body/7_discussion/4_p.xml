<p>Several previous studies indicated a direct association between the presence of some secondary plant metabolites (especially alkaloids, phenols, and flavonoids) and antibacterial activities.

 </sup> Based on the qualitative analysis, we demonstrated the presence of phenols, flavonoids, and alkaloids in the third and fourth fractions of 
 <italic>P. scoparia</italic> root extract. Phenolic and flavonoids compounds are suggested to possess antibacterial activity.

 </sup> To confirm this, the TPC and TFC of the third and fourth fractions were assayed. In line with our qualitative data, the results of TPC and TFC assays also revealed the presence of phenolic and flavonoids compounds in both fractions, although the amount was higher in the third fraction. Therefore, it was deduced that the antibacterial activity of the 
 <italic>P. scoparia</italic> root extract could be attributed to these compounds, but primarily in the third fraction. However, since the two tested bacterial strains also showed sensitivity to the fourth fraction, the role of other secondary metabolites (e.g., anthraquinones, saponins, and terpenoids) should not be ignored. Further detailed investigations are required to specify the exact role of these secondary metabolites in the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>P. scoparia</italic> root. In line with the findings of two previous studies, 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> , 
  <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup> we demonstrated the potential of the secondary plant metabolites against burn wound pathogens. Note that the above-mentioned studies did not perform the fractionation procedure to obtain pure extracts, whereas we performed liquid-liquid separation and obtained different fractions out of the total plant root extract to achieve a high degree of purification.
