<p>The roots of the collected plants were dried and ground using a grinding apparatus (MX-110PN, Japan). The extraction process was carried using 80% methanol solvent. In brief, 200 mL of the solvent was mixed with 100 g of the powdered plant root. The mixture was properly stored for 24 hours during which it was stirred several times with a glass rod. Then, the mixture was placed in a rotary evaporator (Heidolph Co., Germany) to condense the extract until the solvent was evaporated. The extract was kept in a freezer (LG, South Korea) at -20 Â°C until further use.
