<p>Broth microdilution assay was performed to obtain minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of the plant root extracts against the bacterial strains.

 </sup> In brief, the methanol extract was dissolved in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide and water and transferred onto 96-well plates to obtain serial dilutions (0.39-50 mg/mL). Then, the bacterial suspension with a turbidity standard of 0.5 McFarland was added into the wells to reach a bacterial concentration of 1.5×10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL in each well with a final volume of 200 μL. The lowest concentration of the extract that showed no visible bacterial growth in the broth (after 24 hours incubation at 37 °C) was noted as MIC. Additionally, the lowest extract concentration killing 99.9% of bacterial inoculum was noted as MBC. MBC values were determined after sub-culturing 100 μL of the bacterial suspension on the Mueller-Hinton agar. All procedures were carried out in triplicates, and the values were presented as the mean of the three datasets. In accordance with a previous study, the antibacterial activity of the plant root was evaluated using the agar well diffusion method.
