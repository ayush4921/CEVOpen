 </sup> In brief, after mixing 1 mL of the extract fraction with 4 mL of distilled water in a tube, 0.3 mL of sodium nitrate (5%) and 0.3 mL of aluminum chloride (10%) were added to the mixture. After incubation at room temperature for five minutes, 2 mL sodium hydroxide (1 M) was added to the tube, and distilled water was added to the mixture to increase the volume to 10 mL. The test tube was placed on a shaker for five minutes, and the absorbance was measured at 510 nm. For calibration, several concentrations of catechin (50-100 mg/L) were used, and the measurements were expressed in mg of catechin equivalents (CEQ) per g of the sample. All the reagents were purchased from Merck, Germany.
