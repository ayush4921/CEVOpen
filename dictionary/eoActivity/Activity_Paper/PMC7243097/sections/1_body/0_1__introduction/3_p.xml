<p>Currently, there is limited knowledge concerning the anti-obesogenic potential of medicinal plants in Thailand. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the anti-obesogenic potential of Thai medicinal plants which are readily available in the markets in Thailand (
 <xref rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00056-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Most research for this purpose uses a single bio-assay to evaluate the potential of each plant to select a suitable candidate for further research. However single bio-assays may only reflect a part of the therapeutic potential. In the human body, multiple and complex steps are related to the development of obesity. Thus, by combining multiple bio-assays, the results are more likely to reflect the potential of medicinal plants and they will provide more valid information, which will increase the chance of obtaining successful results in further studies such as in vivo and clinical experiments. Thus, in this study, we used three in vitro assays (pancreatic lipase inhibition assay, lipolysis enhancement activity assay, and lipid accumulation reduction assay) to evaluate the anti-obesogenic potential of Thai medicinal plants and select the best candidates.
