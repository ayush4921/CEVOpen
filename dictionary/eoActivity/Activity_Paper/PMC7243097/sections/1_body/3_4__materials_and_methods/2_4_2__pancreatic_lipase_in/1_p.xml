 <xref rid="B19-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An emulsified solution of l-α-lecithin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; P4279, 10 mg), triolein (16 mg), and sodium taurocholate (5 mg) in Tris buffer (13 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1.3 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, pH 8.0, 9.0 mL) was used as a substrate. Porcine pancreatic lipase (Sigma, L3126, 4.5 mg) was dissolved in Tris buffer (30 mL) and used as an enzyme solution. The substrate (200 μL) and sample (100 μL, dissolved in 50% (

 <italic>v</italic>) aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was started by adding the enzyme solution (100 μL) and allowed to continue for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was then stopped by adding 1 M hydrochloric acid (20 μL), and the liberated oleic acids were extracted using by hexane (600 μL). The hexane layer (300 μL) was dried and dissolved in DMSO (100 μL), and the oleic acid content was quantitated using a NEFA C-test Wako kit (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chem. Ind. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Cetilistat (8 μM) was used as a positive control. The experiments were conducted in duplicate and repeated at least twice, and the representative values (mean ± standard deviation (SD)) are presented in the figures and tables.
