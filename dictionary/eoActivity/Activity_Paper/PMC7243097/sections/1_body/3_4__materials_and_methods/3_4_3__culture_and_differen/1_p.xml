<p>Murine 3T3-L1 cells (JCRB9014) were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank (Osaka, Japan). 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in 96-well plates to confluence using basic medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% (

The cells were grown at 37 °C in a 10% carbon dioxide atmosphere. One day after reaching confluence, which was designated Day 0, cells were induced to undergo differentiation by changing the medium to differentiation medium, which was the basic medium containing 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 0.25 µM dexamethasone, and 10 µg/mL insulin. The medium was changed to insulin medium (the basic medium supplemented with 0.5 μg/mL insulin) on Days 2–4. From Day 4, the cell treatment differed between the lipolysis enhancement and lipid accumulation reduction assays.
