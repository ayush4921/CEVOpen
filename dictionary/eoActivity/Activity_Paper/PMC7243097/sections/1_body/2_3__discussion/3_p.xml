<p>Despite being selected as a candidate in the first round of screening, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> leaf extract displayed only moderate inhibitory effects on pancreatic lipase during the second round of screening, and the plant was not considered a preferred candidate in this study. However, this plant has been studied for its beneficial effects on obesity-related fatty liver disease [
 <xref rid="B7-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In this prior study, 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> extract was administered to high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice for 12 weeks. Although there was no effect on body weight, the extract regulated hepatic lipid metabolism by attenuating liver X receptor Î±-mediated lipogenesis and upregulating lipolysis-associated markers such as lipoprotein lipase.
