 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> tubers on obesity using in vitro and in vivo methods [

 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lamaure et al. administrated 45 or 220 mg/kg/day 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> tuber hexane extract to Zucker rats for 60 days and observed a reduction in weight gain without an effect on food consumption [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceuticals-13-00056" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the same study, they described the ability of the extract to enhance lipolysis by 3T3-F442 adipocytes. In accordance with their result, 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> rhizomes strongly enhanced lipolysis and weakly inhibited pancreatic lipase in the present study. Although reduced lipid accumulation was not observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in our experiment, the combination of lipase inhibition and lipolysis enhancement might be important for the reduction of weight gain observed in the study by Lamaure et al.
