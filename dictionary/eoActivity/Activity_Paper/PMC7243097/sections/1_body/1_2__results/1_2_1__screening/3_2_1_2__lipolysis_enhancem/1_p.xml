<p>Lipids are stored in adipocytes, and their levels in adipocytes are directly correlated with the obesity status of a person. The amount of lipids stored in adipocytes is controlled by the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis. Thus, inhibiting lipogenesis or enhancing lipolysis will decrease the amount of lipids in adipocytes and exert favorable effects for treating or preventing obesity. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used to evaluate the lipolysis-enhancing activities of Thai medicinal plant extracts, and the criterion for positivity was a greater than 30% increase in lipolysis compared with the effects of the control. Nine extracts satisfied this criterion:
