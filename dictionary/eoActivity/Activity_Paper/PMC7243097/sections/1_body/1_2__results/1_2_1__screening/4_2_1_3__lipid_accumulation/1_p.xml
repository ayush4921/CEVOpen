<p>The accumulation of lipids in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was measured to evaluate the effect of Thai medicinal plant extracts on lipogenesis. Although lipolysis enhancement also reduces lipid levels in adipocytes, assessment of both lipolysis enhancement and lipid accumulation suppression will clarify whether inhibition of lipogenesis or enhancement of lipolysis is the cause of reduced lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The criterion for positivity was a greater than 10% decrease in lipid accumulation compared with the control findings, and seven extracts satisfied this criterion:
