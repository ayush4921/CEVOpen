 <italic>T. triandra</italic>, 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic>, 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic>. These plants were subjected to further analyses using the same methods with different concentrations to more precisely reveal their potential. A cell viability assay was also performed to detect the cytotoxic effects of the extracts.
