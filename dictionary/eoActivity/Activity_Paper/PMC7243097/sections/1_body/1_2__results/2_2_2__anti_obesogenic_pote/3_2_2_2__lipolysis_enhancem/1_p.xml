<p>The abilities of the candidate plant extracts to enhance lipolysis were analyzed at concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00056-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Based on the results, the extracts were categorized into three groups (no, relatively weak, and relatively strong activity). Two extracts, namely 
 <italic>M. alba</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sappan</italic> exhibited no ability to enhance lipolysis, whereas 
 <italic>T. triandra</italic> and 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> exhibited relatively weak activity. Of these plants, a negative correlation was observed between the concentration of 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> and its lipolysis-enhancing effects. Cell viability testing (Figure 5) suggested that cytotoxicity was the cause of this negative correlation. Thus, lower concentrations (0.00625, 0.0125, and 0.025 mg/mL) were used for 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic>, and the results revealed a positive correlation at these concentrations, confirming the interference of cytotoxicity at high concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00056-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Three plants namely, 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic>, increased lipolysis by more than 50% relative to the control. We would like to note that 
 <italic>E. longifolia</italic> displayed the highest activity among the seven candidate plants.
