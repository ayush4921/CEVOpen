<p id="Par7">COVID-19 Docking Server web-based software (AutoDock Vina is used as the main docking engine) is an interactive web server for docking small molecules, peptides, or antibodies against potential protein targets of COVID-19 in order to predict the binding modes between COVID-19 targets and the ligands along with screening and evaluating the anti-COVID-19 activities of these ligands (i.e., the platform provides a free interactive modern tool using a very precise knowledge-based scoring function to evaluate the candidate binding poses for the specific prediction of COVID-19 target-ligand interactions and the following drug discovery for COVID-19). Generally, almost all SARS-CoV-2 nsps (enzymes) and very few SARS-CoV-2/human sps as COVID-19 therapy targets are recommended for small molecule docking. The structures of all the functional or structural protein targets involved in the SARS-CoV-2 replication life cycle were collected by direct downloading from international web databases (e.g., from the Protein Data Bank “PDB”) or constructed based on their known homologs of coronaviruses (by using homology modeling module of Maestro 10, website:

The utmost effective and influenced nsps and sps (almost are functional enzymes) among all the detected and recognized proteins involved in COVID-19 therapy (previously presented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) were accurately opted to be targeted and docked. This includes fifteen various nCoV protein targets and one human protein target (the human enzyme ACE2). For docking of only one small molecule, the “Docking” mode box should be specifically selected as the computational module (type) for every specific target (this is the selection used in the current case). To get the best accurate results, an average exhaustiveness option of “12” was used. The detailed results of these estimations (binding energies in kcal/mol) are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. After docking, the structure of each enzyme/protein-compound complex was further examined and accurately analyzed for characterization by the help of the fully automated comprehensive interactive tool of the famous Protein–Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) web server (
