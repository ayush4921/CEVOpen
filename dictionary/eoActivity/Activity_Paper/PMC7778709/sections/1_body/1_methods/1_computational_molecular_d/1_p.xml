<p id="Par6">To expectedly assess the anti-COVID-19 activities of the two target antioxidant compounds of the current research, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>, prior to their actual practical anti-COVID-19 biological evaluation (preliminary in vitro/in vivo assays and subsequent preclinical/clinical trials), molecular docking of the molecules of both compounds in the target SARS-CoV-2 nsps and sps (along with one target human sp, ACE2) has been carried out using the docking engines of the most known and credible international molecular docking software programs (e.g., Discovery Studio, LeDock, GemDock, and GOLD). Different docking software programs were used to confidently and doubtlessly ensure the results and to assess and guarantee their reproducibility. Integrating the expected pharmacophoric features with the interaction energy analysis disclosed functionally pivotal amino acid residues in the binding pockets/cavities of the active and/or allosteric sites of the target SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (mainly) along with in silico predicted common inhibitory binding modes with the highly potent reference repurposed compounds (e.g., remdesivir, ivermectin, and favipiravir). The docking results were very brilliant to encourage me to utilize a new specific web-based server designed in 2020, which is specialized in precise molecular docking of all COVID-19 target nsps/sps and prediction of anti-COVID-19 activities and potencies of tested compounds. For this objective, the newly programmed COVID-19 Docking Server was used [
