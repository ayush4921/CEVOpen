<p id="Par3">Many known drugs are currently under anti-COVID-19 therapeutic investigation, such as remdesivir (antiviral), ivermectin (antiparasitic), favipiravir (antiinfluenza), hydroxychloroquine (antimalarial and antirheumatic disorders), and arbidol (antiinfluenza) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Perspectives of many medicinal chemists are based on utilizing the in silico computational molecular modeling studies as the starting points for designing novel potent compounds active against SARS-CoV-2, and most of these studies have been collected in currently published reviews [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This current direction in searching for effective safe known compounds having the structural flexibility to be successfully redirected and repurposed as potential agents against COVID-19 triggered me to screen our library of known compounds/drugs (including my previously synthesized active compounds). Surprisingly, the predictive computational molecular search and screening gave rise to the discovery of two promising compounds in respect to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, 1,2,3-tris[5-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]propan-2-ol (

 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It is worth noticing that both compounds were previously synthesized and evaluated as effective antioxidant agents [
