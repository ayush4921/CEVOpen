<p id="Par2">A broad variety of tactics and strategies was employed to fight the current worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic as an urgent result of the novelty of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, and the lack of effective medications [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The design in each case depends on present scientific proof and evidence of logic mechanistic approaches that are efficient against either analogous/identical viral infections or the severe signs/symptoms that are caused by COVID-19 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Comprehensive inhibition of the coronaviral-2 proteins (i.e., multitarget inhibition) can establish one of the most promising plans for developing effectively potent drugs for COVID-19. However, all the discovered blockers of the main stages of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle lack the required maximal potencies against the major SARS-CoV-2 enzymes (e.g., RNA-dependent RNA polymerase “RdRp”, papain-like protease “PLpro”, and main protease “Mpro”) [
