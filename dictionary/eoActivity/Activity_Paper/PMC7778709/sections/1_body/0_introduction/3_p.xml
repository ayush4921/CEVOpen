<p id="Par4">The adaptable and flexible scaffolds of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecules are characterized by carrying significantly considerable number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors and aromatic rings, which are the principal key moieties required for the best/ideal/strongest binding (hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions) with the binding domains of almost all the COVID-19 protein targets in SARS-CoV-2 and human. It is worth mentioning that 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> are chemically very analogous to RNA nucleos(t)ides, giving them the expected abilities of being efficient bioisosteric antimetabolites in COVID-19 treatment. Additionally, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> structures are also characterized by their abilities to strongly bound to zinc atoms, where they have many active zincophoric centers (i.e., they are rich in oxygenous and nitrogenous moieties) allowing them to act as strong multizincophores. Zinc atom/ion carriers have been extensively studied especially for their potent antiviral activities and they have been found to effectively inhibit the replication/reproduction machinery of several viruses in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Specifically, Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions in certain exceedingly higher/lower concentrations can impair and disrupt the coronaviral replication and transcription and, therefore, excessive displacement or transport of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions by zincophoric agents (e.g., 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>) will undoubtedly affect the coronaviral replication processes (zinc ionophores have been found to successfully and significantly inhibit the replication process of coronaviruses intracellularly in cell cultures) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The considerable chemical resonance of both structures aids in boosting the comprehensive potential anti-COVID-19 bioactivities through intensifying the inhibitory chemical stabilities of the complexes of each compound with the active site residues of the coronaviral-2/human target proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is also worth noticing that the potent antioxidant actions of both compounds may aid their anti-SARS-CoV-2/anti-COVID-19 bioactivities through reducing almost all the oxidizing moieties of all the target proteins, which logically causes deactivation of the catalytic and noncatalytic biological activities of these important active proteins, meantime, these antioxidant properties aid in quenching the free radicals and fighting the oxidative stress inside the body of the COVID-19 patient [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The existence of the bioactive antiviral 1,3,4-oxadiazole rings in the backbones of the two molecules is suggested to significantly enhance the anti-COVID-19 actions of both of them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The two compounds have very balanced (ideal) lipophilic/hydrophilic properties (they have log 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 5, which perfectly obeys Lipinski’s Rule of Five “Ro5”) which are required to afford the top tolerated pharmacokinetic characteristics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The two molecules were docked in all the available SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural and structural protein targets (including functional enzymes and proteins) along with one human structural enzyme, with an emphasis on the most important enzymes like the RdRp.
