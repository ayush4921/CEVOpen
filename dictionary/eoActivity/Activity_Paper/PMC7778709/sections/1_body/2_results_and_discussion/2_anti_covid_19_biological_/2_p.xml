<p id="Par17">We should put into consideration the possibility that 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> may undergo prior intracellular metabolic transformation into more active forms (e.g., their triphosphate forms) by human cellular enzymes (e.g., kinases and transferases), which may differ among various cell types, thus evaluation of the pharmacological actions of these two target compounds in primary human airway epithelial cells will clearly facilitate the interpretation and clarification of the previous results. The metabolic activation would almost add extra anti-COVID-19 activities to the two drugs through incorporation of human cell-biocompatible and human cell-bioavailable moieties into the chemical structures of both of them, and this would consequently increase the net clinical effectiveness and efficacy of these two potent compounds. Importantly, the three reference drugs (remdesivir, ivermectin, and favipiravir) are currently undergoing extensive and broad clinical trials as anti-SARS-CoV-2/anti-COVID-19 agents worldwide. The very high values of CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> indicate that both compounds would be predictably well tolerated in the human body. The significantly desirable high values of SI (i.e., the extremely minute values of anti-SARS-CoV-2 EC
 <sub>50</sub> along with the very high values of mammalian cells CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> reflect that both compounds evidently favor resistant RNA virus over DNA virus and mammalian cells, and this, in turn, expectedly indicates and expresses the selective specificity of these two compounds as anti-COVID-19 drugs (specifically, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> can be considered as a unique superpowerful SARS-CoV-2 antidote/killer). 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> is apparently more potent and more promising than 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor. Using a combination formula of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and remdesivir is a possible good experimental choice, as it may have exceptional and striking combinational synergistic anti-COVID-19 action (comprising the desirable advantages of both potent SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors) in further assays (in vivo) and preclinical/clinical trials. Almost all the factual experimental results obtained and concluded, here, in the anti-COVID-19 antiviral biological evaluation are complying with the previous speculative theoretical results suggested and extracted from the anti-SARS-CoV-2 computational molecular pharmacological predictions for the two newly repurposed biologically reevaluated compounds, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>, and the three reference drugs.
