<p id="Par16">The results demonstrated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> obviously and directly revealed the extremely higher and amazing anti-COVID-19 effectiveness and potency of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> (as two of the most potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds ever) relative to those of each of the reference drugs. All the five tested compounds were found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with EC
 <sub>50</sub> under 100 μM. Surprisingly, 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.31 μM) was found to be about 65, 171, and 303.5 times more potent than remdesivir (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.17 μM), ivermectin (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 53.00 μM), and favipiravir (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 94.09 μM), respectively, in the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (in vitro). With the same interesting results, 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.01 μM) was found to be about 20, 52.5, and 93 times more potent than remdesivir, ivermectin, and favipiravir, respectively, in the same assay. According to this assay, CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> is much larger than 100 μM, thus both compounds are expected to have very high safety margin and clinical selectivity index (SI; SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>, SI
 <sub>
  <bold>CoViTris2020</bold>
 </sub> &gt; 322.58 and SI
 <sub>
  <bold>ChloViD2020</bold>
 </sub> &gt; 99.01), while on the other hand, the references remdesivir, ivermectin, and favipiravir are expected to have narrow safety margin and clinical therapeutic index (SI
 <sub>Remdesivir</sub> &gt; 4.96, SI
 <sub>Ivermectin</sub> &gt; 1.89, and SI
 <sub>Favipiravir</sub> &gt; 1.06). 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> are also having interestingly very small values of the concentration that causes 100% inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effects in vitro (
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> has the best CPEIC
 <sub>100</sub> value, among all the tested compounds, of 0.99 μM, directly followed by 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> which has CPEIC
 <sub>100</sub> value of 1.97 μM) and of the concentration that is required for 50% reduction in the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in vitro (
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> has the best EC
 <sub>50</sub> value, among all the tested compounds, of 0.33 μM, directly followed by 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> which has EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.23 μM).
