<p id="Par9">The deep understanding of the COVID-19 target-ligand interactions represents an extremely crucial key challenge in drug discovery for COVID-19.Â The computational simulative prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins-inhibiting properties of the newly repurposed target compounds 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> greatly helped me to have a comprehensive overview of the expected anti-COVID-19 activities of the two compounds. This prediction also aided me to have a detailed conception about the two target compounds anti-COVID-19 modes of action along with the compounds degrees of efficacy and potency.
