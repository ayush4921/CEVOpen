<p id="Par15">In short, the previous computational results of the predicted binding modes of the two inhibitors 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> with the SARS-CoV-2/human proteins extremely comply with and support my suggested hypothetical multitarget mechanism of anti-COVID-19 action of each of the two ligands.
