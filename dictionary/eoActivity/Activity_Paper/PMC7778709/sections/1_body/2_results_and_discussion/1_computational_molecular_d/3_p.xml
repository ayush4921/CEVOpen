 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> comes second, among all the five compounds, in its inhibitory binding energies and affinities which are ranged from − 7.50 to − 9.90 kcal/mol. The binding affinities of 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> surpass those of all the three reference drugs (except for those of each of exoribonuclease and endoribonuclease with remdesivir, as there is binding energies difference of − 0.20 kcal/mol in favor of remdesivir in both cases), as the potent antioxidant 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecule strongly binds to the respective proteins forming very stable inhibited complexes with relatively lower binding energies (i.e., significantly lower than the binding energies of all the three reference molecules in their complexes with the respective nsps and sps). 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecule specifically gives its best inhibitory binding affinities with the four nsps nsp3 (207-379, MES site) (− 9.90 kcal/mol), RdRp-RNA (RTP site) (− 9.60 kcal/mol), nsp14 (N7-MTase) (− 9.30 kcal/mol), and PLpro (dimer) (− 9.30 kcal/mol), respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a–d). Interestingly, 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> approaches and reaches the lower binding affinity of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> in only one enzyme which is N7-MTase (it is also one of the most effective protein targets in stopping the coronaviral-2 life cycle through blocking of its active site [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) with the same binding energy value of -9.90 kcal/mol. These promising results indicate the significant possibility of 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> to be a very potent inhibitor ligand or antagonist of nsp3, RdRp, nsp14, and/or PLpro. Other proteins giving very encouraging binding affinities with 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecule include ACE2, N protein (NCB site), helicase (both sites), nsp16 (all sites), Mpro, Nsp15 (endoribonuclease), and RdRp without RNA (RNA site), respectively.
