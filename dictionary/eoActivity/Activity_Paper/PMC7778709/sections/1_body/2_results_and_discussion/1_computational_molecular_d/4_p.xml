<p id="Par12">The chemical structures of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecules are exceptionally characterized by higher degrees of balanced orientational and conformational flexibility when compared to those of the other or reference anticoronaviral drugs (e.g., favipiravir, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and arbidol). These extraordinary unique flexibilities of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> structures are apparently observed in the docking poses in SARS-CoV-2 target proteins (along with human target ACE2) as shown in both Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, respectively. 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> molecule (a trisubstituted or three armed bulky derivative of citric acid) has higher degree of flexibility than 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecule (a typical 2,5-disubstituted derivative of 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring) due to, mainly, its larger topological polar surface area (TPSA) and its higher number of atoms. This highly balanced flexibility is generally required for excellent and extreme positioning of the drug molecule to be more superimposable in the active binding pockets and cavities of any enzyme or protein (i.e., required for extreme lock-and-key positioning of the drug molecule after hitting and striking any protein molecule), leading to more adequate and potent inhibition (i.e., antagonism or blocking) of the actions (either catalytic or whatever) done or mediated by the protein. Consequently, the highly balanced flexibilities of 
 <bold>CoViTris2020</bold> and 
 <bold>ChloViD2020</bold> molecules greatly increase their abilities to be very potent anti-COVID-19 agents, respectively.
