<p id="p0055">The Folin-Ciocalteau (FC) method was performed to establish a total phenolic compound. About 0.5 mL extracts (10 times diluted) and FC reagents were blended for 5 min. About 4 mL Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> 1 M was then added and mixed for 15 min. The colorimetric method at 765 nm is used to determine phenols. Gallic acid standard solution as a standard curve. Total phenolic content was determined as Gallic acid equivalent (GAE) (mg/g of dry mass). Samples were presented in triplicate.
