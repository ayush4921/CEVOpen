<p id="p0050">Aluminium chloride colorimetric method (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) by Zhishen etÂ al. (1999) was applied to get total flavonoid content with quercetin as standard [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Extract (1 mL) was put into a volumetric flask containing 4 mL of water, followed by NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> 5% (0.3 mL). Approximately 0.3 mL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> 10% was added after 5 min. The blend was let to endure for 6 min. Then, NaOH 1M (2 mL) was put in and distilled water was poured to get up to 10 mL of the total volume. The absorbance was monitored and recorded at 510 nm. The quercetin standard solution as a standard curve. Total flavonoid was established as quercetin equivalents (QE) (mg/g of dry mass). Samples were presented in triplicate.
