<p id="p0060">The Brand Williams method with modified by Dudonn'e et al was applied to estimate the activities of antioxidants from the extract [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. About 3 mL 1,1, diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl DPPH solution 6 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M and samples 100 μL were prepared. The methanol extracted solution and methanol DPPH solution were mixed in various concentrations. The same quantity of methanol was put into the regulator. Then, it took 20 min to incubate the mixture in dark room temperature. The absorbance was observed at 515 nm (As). The blanko DPPH solution was monitored its absorbance at 515 nm (Ab). The DPPH inhibition rate was examined with the formula: Inhibition (%) = [(A
 <sub>b</sub>-A
 <sub>s</sub>)/A
 <sub>b</sub>] x100.
