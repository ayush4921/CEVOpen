<p id="p0085">The antiplasmodial activity was performed by the procedure described by Budimulja et al (1997) [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The sample was dissolved in DMSO, then kept the sample at –20 °C until used. The malarial parasite 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 clone was propagated in the presence of various concentrations of each sample. The growth of the parasite was observed by making a blood smear fixed with methanol and stained with Geimsa stain. The antiparasitic effect of the sample was measured by growth inhibition percentage as described by Widyawaruyanti et al (2007) [

 <sup>.</sup> The antiplasmodial activity of each compound was expressed as an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value.
