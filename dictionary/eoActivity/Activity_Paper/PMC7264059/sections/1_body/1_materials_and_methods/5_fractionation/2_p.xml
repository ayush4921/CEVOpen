<p id="p0045">The crude extract was fractionated by vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC), eluting with a gradient solvent system. Dichloromethane fraction was collected and concentrated in vacuo. Then, this fraction was prepared by fractionated a portion (40 g) of the total methanol using vacuum liquid chromatography. Further fractionation was done by repeated VLC, eluting with gradient solvent system and purified by Sephadex in order to yield a yellowish-brown powder. Then the purity of the isolated compound was tested by monitoring three eluents and 2-dimensional TLC. The structure of the isolated compound was characterized by comprehensive spectral analysis including IR, 1D and 2D NMR.</p>
