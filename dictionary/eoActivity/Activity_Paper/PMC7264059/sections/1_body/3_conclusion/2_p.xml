<p id="p0130">The inhibitory effects of the isolated compound against rat intestinal α-glucosidase and porcine pancreas α-amylase were evaluated in comparison with the antidiabetic acarbose. The isolated 
 <italic>α</italic>-viniferin showed an active α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 256.17 and 212.79 μg/mL, respectively. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity test against 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> at a concentration of 100 μg/mL revealed a strong antiplasmodial inhibitory activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.76 μg/mL.
