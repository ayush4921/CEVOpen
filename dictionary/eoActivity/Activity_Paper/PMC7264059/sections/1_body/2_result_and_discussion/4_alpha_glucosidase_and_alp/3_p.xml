<p id="p0120">The antidiabetic activity of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> has also determined using α-amylase inhibitory assay. The experiments result showed inhibition of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> towards α-amylase activity for 38.18% of α-amylase inhibition rate with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 212.79 μg/mL as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The α-amylase inhibitory activity were determined at 99.01 μg/mL by absorbance decrease at 650 nm. The MeOH extract and EtOAc fraction of 
 <italic>D. littoralis</italic> have an inhibition activity of α-amylase (p &gt; 0.05) with 69.15 and 41.49% of inhibitory rate with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 66.22 and 181.88 μg/mL respectively. Acarbose was also taken as standard showed 94.11% of inhibition rate of α-amylase activity. The antidiabetic ability of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> is linear with its capacity to reduce the 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and α-amylase activity. The evaluation of antidiabetic potential using α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibition is expectedly able to encounter novel therapeutic agents which are applicable harmless for treating DM. The observed activities and the therapeutic properties of the active plants may be still comprised of a synergistic effect of the phytochemicals. The α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activity of α-viniferin which is isolated from 
 <italic>D. littoralis</italic> extract are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>.
