<p id="p0115">Glucosidase is the key catalyzing enzyme involved in the process of carbohydrate digestion and glucose release. Inhibition of α-glucosidase is one very effective way of delaying glucose absorption and lowering the postprandial blood glucose level, which can potentially suppress the progression of DM [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> α-glucosidase inhibitory studies were demonstrated that compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, MeOH extract and EtOAc fraction of 
 <italic>D. littoralis</italic> had α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. The EtOAc fraction of 
 <italic>D. littoralis</italic> has an inhibition activity of α-glucosidase (p &gt; 0.05) with 53.99% of inhibitory rate with IC

 <bold>1</bold> has a higher mean α-glucosidase inhibition activity than methanol extract of 
 <italic>D.littoralis</italic> (p &gt; 0.05) with 38.7% of inhibitory rate and IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 256.17 μg/mL as shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> α-glucosidase inhibitory activity was determined at 312.5 μg/mL by absorbance decrease at 490 nm. Acarbose was taken as standard showed 91.9% of inhibition rate of α-glucosidase activity.
