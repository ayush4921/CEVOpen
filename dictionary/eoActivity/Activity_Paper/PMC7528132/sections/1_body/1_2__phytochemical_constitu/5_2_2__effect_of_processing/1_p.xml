<p>The processing of medicinal plants can alter antioxidant activity by increase or decrease in efficacy. Methods of processing of medicinal plants can impact on the phytochemical constituent availability for pharmacological effect. Baba and Onanuga [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found that different methods of processing sandpaper leaf (
 <italic>Ficus exasperata</italic>) extracts inhibited arginase and angiotensin-1-converting enzymes (ACE) activities in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, their result showed that the soaking method produced significantly higher inhibition of both enzymes than other methods which include hand maceration, boiling, and blending. Previous studies show that the health benefits of the medicinal plant in mono- or poly-formulations are often a result of complex mixtures of phytochemicals in a holistic form which synergistically modulates multiple targets to produce overall therapeutic actions due to combined antioxidant properties [

The effects of processing methods (blanching, cooking or thermal processing, dehydration or drying, extrusion, and irradiation), other nonthermal processing (storage, carbon dioxide treatment), and other ingredients in the formulation on the phytochemicals have been extensively reviewed by [

However, during processing, naturally occurring antioxidants often undergo degradation such as Strecker degradation, as well as reactions such as Maillard reaction, leading to the formation of new compounds with lower or higher antioxidant activity, thereby accounting for the differences in the total phenolic contents and antioxidant activities in the processed when compared to unprocessed foods [
