<p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes reverse transcriptase which functions in the process of the viral genome reverse transcription, a fundamental step in the HIV-1 replication cycle and promising target in the antiretroviral drug development [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. A study conducted in Nigeria [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] on the antiviral activities of 27 medicinal plant extracts, belonging to 26 different plant species, against echovirus 7, 13, and 19 serotypes (E7, E13, and E19, respectively) revealed the highest antiviral activity from methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Macaranga barteri</italic> leaves on E7 and E9, respectively, followed by 
 <italic>Ageratum conyzoides</italic> leaves extract on E7 and E19 and 
 <italic>Mondia whitei</italic> leaves extract on E7 and E19. In China, 
 <italic>Rheum palmatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Rheum officinale</italic> extracts along with their main single isolated constituents' anthraquinone derivatives inhibited both HIV-1 reverse transcriptase-associated DNA polymerase (RDDP) and ribonuclease H activities [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The screening of some plants showed antiretroviral activities. For instance, 
 <italic>Ancistrocladus korupensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and 
 <italic>Ancistrocladus</italic> congolensis [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] produced michellamine A and B [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], 
 <italic>Ancistrocladus congolensis</italic> [
