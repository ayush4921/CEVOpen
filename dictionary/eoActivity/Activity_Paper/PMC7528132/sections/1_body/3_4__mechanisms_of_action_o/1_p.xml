<p>The rare occurrence of infectious diseases in wild plants serves as a fundamental indication of the presence of competent defence mechanisms. Different mechanisms of action through which phytochemicals can exert antimicrobial activities include (i) inhibition of the activity of enzymes and toxins, (ii) damage of the bacterial membrane, (iii) suppression of virulence factors, (iv) formation of biofilm, (v) inhibition of protein synthesis, and (vi) quorum quenching [
