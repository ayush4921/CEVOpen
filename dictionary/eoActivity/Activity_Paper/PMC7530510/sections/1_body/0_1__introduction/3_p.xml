<p>To date, there is no appropriate method to evaluate the antiradical ability within various herb extracts; thus, several tests were performed, comprising organic substrate-based assays such as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2â€²-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonate) (ABTS), mineral substrate-based tests such as ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and also biological substrate-based ones such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 2,2,-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride- (AAPH-) induced hemolysis assays. The goal of the current investigation is to quantify the total phenolic, flavonoids, and tannin contents plus the antioxidant, antiperoxidative, and antihemolytic powers, employing DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, TBARS, and AAPH-induced hemolysis assays of three
