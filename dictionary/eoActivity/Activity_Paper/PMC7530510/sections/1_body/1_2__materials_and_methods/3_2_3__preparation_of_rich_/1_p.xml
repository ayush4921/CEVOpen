<p>Coriander-, parsley-, and celery-rich polyphenol extracts preparation was performed following the procedure established by Bouhlali et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with slight adjustments. In summary, thirty grams of powdered aerial parts of plants was extracted using 150 mL MeOH–H
 <sub>2</sub>O (4 : 1, v/v), at 35°C for 12 h using an orbital shaker-incubator. After then, a liquid-liquid extraction using hexane was performed in order to remove hydrophobic pigments such as chlorophyll which has the same color as the extracts. Then, the solution was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated using a rotary evaporator under minimal pressure at 40°C until total evaporation of the solvent. The resulting crude extracts were stored at −20°C in dark glass bottles until further use. The extracts were redissolved in a known dilution of water to determine their phenolic, flavonoidic, and tannin contents plus their antioxidant, antiperoxidative, and antihemolytic abilities.
