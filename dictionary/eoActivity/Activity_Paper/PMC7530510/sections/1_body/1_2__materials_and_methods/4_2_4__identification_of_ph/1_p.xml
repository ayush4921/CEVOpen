<p>The plant extracts were evaluated for their phenolic and flavonoid composition by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described by Bouhlali et al. [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], with slight changes. One gram of the plant extract was first dissolved in 25 mL acidified methanol solution (1 N HCl/methanol/water, 1/80/19, v/v/v) and, then, ultrasonicated for 30 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min, and 2 mL of the supernatant was filtered via a 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m filter before the injection. Phenolic standards (including seven phenolic acids: p-coumaric, vanillic, ferulic, caffeic, syringic, chlorogenic, and gallic acids and three flavonoids: quercetin, luteolin, and rutin) were prepared at a stock solution of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and used to prepare standard plots. A Shimadzu liquid chromatography system (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an auto-sampler (SIL-20A), dual pump (LC-20AB), a vacuum degasser (DGU-20A), diode array detector (SPD-M10A), and a system controller (SCL-10A) was implemented to conduct the analytical separation. Polyphenol compounds were separated at 40°C using the Restek C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m particle size) (Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, USA). The mobile phase comprised water-acetic acid (97 : 3, v/v) (eluent A) and acetonitrile (eluent B). Elution was executed at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1 with the following gradient outline: 0–5 min, 0–8% solution B (linear gradient); 5–25 min, 8–25% solution B (linear gradient); 25–30 min, 25% solution B (isocratic elution); and 30–50 min, 25–90% solution B (linear gradient). The injection volume was 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L, and the wavelengths of detection were set at 280, 320, and 350 nm. The compounds were authenticated with the help of retention time and comparing peak areas with those obtained under the same conditions. The quantification of the different samples was performed by the measurement of the integrated peak area, and the contents were calculated by means of the standard curve by plotting the peak area against concentration of the respective standard sample. Triplicate measurements were performed, and the results were averaged and reported as milligrams per 100 g DW of plant extracts.
