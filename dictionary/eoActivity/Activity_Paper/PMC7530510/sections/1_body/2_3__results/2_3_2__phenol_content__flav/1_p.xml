<p>Results from the quantitative determination of total polyphenols, total condensed tannins, and total flavonoids of the three 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> species are revealed in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The phenol amount varied largely (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The phenolic content increased in the order of coriander (1.372 g GAE/100 g) &lt; celery (1.739 g GAE/100 g) &lt; parsley (2.163 g GAE/100 g). The flavonoid content in all analyzed plant extracts varied considerably (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and ranged between 0.814–1.573 g RE/100 g. Parsley exhibited the richest level of flavonoid content and celery recorded the lowest level. Concerning condensed tannins, they showed significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) differences among plant species. Celery showed the highest level (0.365 g CE/100 g) while the lowest level was observed in coriander (0.123 g CE/100 g).
