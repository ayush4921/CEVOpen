<p>Free-radicals trapping capacity was estimated using ABTS, DPPH, and reducing power assessed via FRAP assay. All analyzed 
 <italic>Apiaceae</italic> species exhibited largely (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) different scavenging potential. As revealed in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, parsley showed the strongest scavenging ability based on DPPH
 <sup>IC50</sup> (22.84 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) and ABTS (231.46 
 <italic>µ</italic>mol TE/g). Coriander recorded the weakest scavenging potential based on ABTS (102.95 
 <italic>µ</italic>mol TE/g) and DPPH
 <sup>IC50</sup> (77.62 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL). Nevertheless, the latter remains lower compared to ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.87 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) being the reference antioxidant. In this study, DPPH
 <sup>●</sup> and ABTS
 <sup>●+</sup> radicals scavenging activities of the tested samples increased in the order: parsley &gt; celery &gt; coriander.
