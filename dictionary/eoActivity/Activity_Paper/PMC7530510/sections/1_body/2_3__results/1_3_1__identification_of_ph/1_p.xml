<p>The typical phenolic profiling of the studied plants extracts is revealed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and the results are illustrated in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The plant species exhibited significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) concerning their content in phenolic and flavonoid compounds. All plant extracts were demonstrated to retain all the analyzed polyphenols and flavonoids at various concentrations. In the celery extract, p-coumaric acid was the predominant compound (114.30 ± 10.87 mg/100 g DW), tailed by chlorogenic acid (102.33 ± 10.02 mg/100 g DW), caffeic acid (67.65 ± 7.04 mg/100 g DW), luteolin (31.63 ± 3.51 mg/100 g DW), quercetin (25.08 ± 3.12 mg/100 gDW), gallic acid (24.36 ± 3.09 mg/100 g DW), ferulic acid (21.67 ± 3.56 mg/100g DW), rutin (16.73 ± 2.05 mg/100g DW), syringic acid (6.62 ± 0.93 mg/100 g DW), and vanilic acid (4.50 ± 0.99 mg/100 g DW). On the other hand, the parsley extract was characterized by the presence of cholorogenic acid as the predominant compound (171.30 ± 10.55 mg/100 g DW) and syringic acid as the minor compound (9.49 ± 0.77 mg/100 g DW). In the coriander extract, p-coumaric acid was the most abundant compound (91.18 ± 3.39 mg/100 g DW), followed by chlorogenic acid (82.30 ± 7.51 mg/100 g DW), caffeic acid (41.09 ± 5.14 mg/100 g DW), gallic acid (29.16 ± 3.23 mg/100 g DW), luteolin (27.98 ± 2 mg/100 g DW), vanilic acid (22.11 ± 2.59 mg/100 g DW), rutin (19.67 ± 2.89 mg/100 g DW), and quercetin (6.66 ± 0.30 mg/100 g DW).
