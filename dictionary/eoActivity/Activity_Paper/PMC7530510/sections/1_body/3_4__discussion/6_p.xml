<p>Different results were obtained using various tests including DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, TBARS, and AAPH-induced hemolysis assays. Strong interrelations were noticed between DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and TBARS assays, while weak correlations were found among the antihemolysis test and others. These differences obtained for the AAPH assay could be explained by the thermodynamic, kinetic properties of the test, and the stereoselectivity of antioxidant compounds [
