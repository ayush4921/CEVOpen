<p>The analysis of correlation evidenced significantly strong interrelations (

 <sup>2</sup> ≥ 0.910). These interrelations indicate that phenols are the main providers of the observed antioxidant activity and protective effect against lipid peroxidation. As a matter of fact, given the significant antiperoxidative power within the analyzed extracts proved by TBARS assay, which is the first step prior to the evaluation of hypolipidemic activity, they deserve a focused study of their antiatherogenic effect against various cardiovascular diseases.
