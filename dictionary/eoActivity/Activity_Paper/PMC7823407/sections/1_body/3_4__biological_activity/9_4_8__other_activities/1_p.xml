<p>Several studies demonstrate the antinematode and antiplasmodial activities of 
 <italic>B. aegyptiaca</italic> extracts. Shalaby et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] showed the effects of methanolic fruit extracts on enteral and parenteral stages of 
 <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> (pork worm). The authors also evaluated the effectiveness of methanolic extract against preadult migrating larvae and encysted larvae of 
 <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> in rats and compared them with the commonly used anthelmintic chemical, albendazole. Methanolic extract (1000 mg/kg body weight) for five successive days throughout the parasite lifecycle led to a marked reduction in migrating and encysted larvae by 81.7% and 61.7%, respectively. In another study, the efficacy of a methanolic extract on 
 <italic>Toxocara vitulorum</italic> (roundworm), a major parasite in cattle and buffalo, was assessed [
 <xref rid="B79-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. They incubated parasites in a ringer solution containing 10, 30, 60, 120 and 240 µg/mL of ethanolic extract for 24 h. The most prominent activity at 240 µg/mL caused the disorganization of body cuticle musculature. Kusch et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] evaluated a crude extract of seeds for antiplasmodial activity. An IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for chloroquine-susceptible 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> NF54 was 68.26 µg/µL. The compound responsible for this activity was 6-phenyl-2(H)-1,2,4-triazin-5-one oxime. The authors also showed that two phenolic compounds, 2,6-di-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyl-phenol and 2,4-di-
 <italic>tert</italic>-butylphenol, displayed antiplasmodial activity at IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 50.29 and 47.82 µM, respectively.
