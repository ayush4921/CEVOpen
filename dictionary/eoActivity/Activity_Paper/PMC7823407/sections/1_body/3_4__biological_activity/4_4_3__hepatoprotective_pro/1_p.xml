<p>A methanolic extract of leaves was evaluated for hepatoprotective activity against carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>)-induced hepatic damage in rats [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Administration of the extract (200 and 400 mg/kg per os) markedly reduced the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced elevation of serum marker enzymes, such as glutamate pyruvate transaminase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. Similarly, fruit mesocarp and stem bark aqueous extracts ameliorated CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, as measured by liver enzyme activity, blood parameters and histopathology [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Ethanolic extracts of bark protected hepatocytes against paracetamol and CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, analogous to silymarin [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Bioactive compounds, primarily obtained from dietary sources, contain a wide range of free radical scavenging constituents, including polyphenols, alkaloids and phytosterols, which are responsible for hepatoprotective effects [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Desert date is rich in polyphenols, phytosterols and saponins. It has depicted very good antioxidant potential and thus increased the cellular antioxidant defense system, which may be responsible for the hepatoprotective effects of desert date.
