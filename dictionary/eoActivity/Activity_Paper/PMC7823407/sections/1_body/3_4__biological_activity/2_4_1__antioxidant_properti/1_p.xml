<p>Various kinds of physical and physiological stresses lead to the overproduction of oxidants in the human body, which can cause oxidative damage of DNA, proteins and lipids. Furthermore, this damage is responsible for several disorders in the human body such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and aging. It was reported that minor fruits and nuts possess abundant antioxidant phytochemicals, and the consumption of minor fruits and nuts is beneficial to the human body [

The antioxidant effects of methanol extracts of stem bark on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) scavenging is demonstrated and accounted for in the total soluble phenolic and flavonoid contents [

 <xref rid="B49-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] results show that methanol extracts display the highest phenolic content (35.17 mg gallic acid equivalents/g) and considerable flavonoid content (112.83 mg quercetin equivalents/g). Methanol extract showed the highest free radical scavenging activity at IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 40 µg/mL and IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 125.85 µg/mL in DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. The antioxidant properties of aqueous fruit extracts were assessed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats [

 <xref rid="B39-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Polyphenols such as quercetin and kaempferol are the major components responsible for antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition, phytosterols including ß-sitoterol, stigmasterol and campesterol have been reported to exert antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Polyphenols, phytosterols and saponins together might be responsible for the antioxidant activity of desert date.
