<p>Plants synthesize several antimicrobial compounds, including phenolics such as simple phenols, phenolic acids, quinones, flavonoids, flavones, flavonols, tannins, coumarins, terpenoids, essential oils and alkaloids [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The mechanism of action of these compounds ranges from membrane disruption, substrate deprivation, intercalation into the cell wall/or DNA and enzyme inhibition. Desert date is rich in all these phytochemicals and demonstrates potent antimicrobial activity. The bark of 
 <italic>B. aegyptiaca</italic> is widely used in African folk medicine for the treatment of wounds and skin diseases. The effects of aqueous ethanolic extracts of bark on bacteria isolated from wounds have been reported [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These extracts inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> in vitro. The in vitro antifungal activity of saponin-rich extracts of fruit mesocarp was explored against phytopathogenic fungi [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-10-00032" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These extracts were moderately active (34.7%) against 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic> and highly active (89.01%) against 
 <italic>Pythium ultimum</italic>, and activity was significantly higher compared to the fungicide, metalaxyl (15 Î¼g/mL). The antifungal activity of ethanolic and methanolic extracts of root bark and fruit have been demonstrated against 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>Penicillium crustosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> [
