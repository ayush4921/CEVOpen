  <p>Flow cytometry analysis on apoptosis in cisplatin-induced renal cell injury. The renal cell injury model was treated with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR at 1 mg/ml for 3 days, and the apoptotic cells were measured using staining with annexin-V/propidium iodide (a, b). The results are represented as a percentage to the cisplatin nontreated group (Veh) in NRK (c) and HK-2 (d).
