<p>In the cisplatin-induced renal cell injury model, the cell viabilities of the vehicle negative control showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> : 49.1% in NRK and 50.8% in HK-2, compared with those of cisplatin nontreated cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). One-way ANOVA showed significant main effects for the group in NRK (
 <italic>F</italic> = 62.4, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and HK-2 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 11.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The post-hoc tests versus the negative control showed significant increases in treatments with BJ at 0.3–1.2 mg/ml, OR and PJ at 0.3–2.4 mg/ml, and WR at 0.6–2.4 mg/ml in NRK, and in treatments with BJ, OR, PJ, and WR at 0.6 and 1.2 mg/ml in HK-2 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The viabilities seemed to be evidently increased in the treatment at a concentration between 0.6 and 1.2 mg/ml. The increased ratios to the negative control were 1.7-folds in treatments with BJ, OR, and PJ and 1.8-folds in WR at 1.2 mg/ml in NRK, while they were 1.5-folds in treatments with BJ and OR and 1.2- and 1.6-folds in treatments with PJ and WR, respectively, in HK-2.
