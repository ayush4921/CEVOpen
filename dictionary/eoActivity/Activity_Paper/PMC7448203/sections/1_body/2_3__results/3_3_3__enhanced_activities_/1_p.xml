<p>The negative control in the renal cell injury model versus cisplatin nontreated cell showed reduced activities of SOD and catalase by 36.3% and 35.4%, respectively, in NRK and by 40.8% and 39.4% in HK-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). There were significant differences among the groups for SOD level in NRK (
 <italic>F</italic> = 105.5, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and HK-2 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 157.2, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and for catalase in NRK (
 <italic>F</italic> = 80.9, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) and HK-2 (
 <italic>F</italic> = 84.6, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Consistent with the results of the DPPH assay, the post hoc tests versus the negative control revealed significant increases in the levels of SOD and catalase of NRK and HK-2 treated with BJ, PJ, and WR (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) but not for OR. The increased levels of SOD were 1.2-, 1.4-, and 1.2-folds in treatments with BJ, PJ, and WR, respectively, in NRK, and they were 1.1-, 1.3-, and 1.2-folds in HK-2. The increased levels of catalase were 1.4-, 1.4-, and 1.3-folds in NRK, and they were 1.2-folds in BJ, PJ and WR in HK-2.
