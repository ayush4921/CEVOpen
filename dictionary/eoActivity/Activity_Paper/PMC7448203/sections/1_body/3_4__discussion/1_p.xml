<p>In this study, we showed that four traditional polyherbal formulas potentially prevented cisplatin-induced renal cell injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptotic cell death and enhancing cellular proliferation. Traditional polyherbal formulas consisting of natural products have advantages over chemical compound-based drugs, including less side effects, variable bioavailability, and vigorous biological activity. Many traditional Korean medicine-based polyherbs are commercially available because accumulated clinical results prove that they have been effective for a long time. However, scientific evidence is still needed to clarify their efficacy and therapeutic mechanisms. We have screened potentials of anti-AKI polyherbal formulas with multitargeting to complement the treatment limitations of monotargeted agents. Considering that a goal of drug discovery is developing optimal combinations consisting of effective compounds for treating diseases, verifying the efficacy in traditional polyherbal formulas already proven clinically can be the most efficient and fastest strategy for novel drug development in AKI treatment.</p>
