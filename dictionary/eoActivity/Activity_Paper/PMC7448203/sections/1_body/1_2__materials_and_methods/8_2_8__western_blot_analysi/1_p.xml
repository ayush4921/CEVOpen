<p>Cells were scraped and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The cell pellet was lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (PA 19464, Rock Land, Pottstown, PA, USA) containing 1 mg/ml protease inhibitor (leupeptin, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 30 min on ice. After centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the supernatant was measured for total protein contents using the BCA assay (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL, USA); then, the samples were mixed with a loading buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and subsequently boiled for 10 min. The samples containing equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed through 12% SDS-PAGE gels and electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using semidry blot transfer (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% skim-milk in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween (5% TBST, Bio-Rad), the membrane was incubated with mouse anticleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA: dilution of 1 : 100) and anti-
 <italic>β</italic>-actin antibodies (Abcam, dilution of 1 : 2,000) in 1% TBST at 4°C overnight. Next day, it was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase- (HRP-) conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, dilution of 1 : 1000) for 1 h. The membrane was washed five times with TBST for 30 min after incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. The expressions were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (WESTAR
 <italic>η</italic>C2.0, Cyanagen, Bologna, Italy) and analyzed using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc instrument (Bio-Rad).
