<p>Cells were collected using Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver, Canada), and their apoptosis and proliferation were measured. Apoptotic cells were measured using annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Briefly, the prepared cells were stained with an anti-annexin-V-FITC antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, dilution of 1 : 1000) for 30 min and then with PI (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml for 10 min. For proliferative cell measures, the cells were fixed in cold methanol for 10 min, and the cell membranes were permeated by treatment with saponin (TCI Chemicals) at 1 mg/ml for 30 min. The cells were incubated with a rabbit anti-Ki67 antibody (Abcam, dilution of 1 : 100) for 30 min and then with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Life Technologies, dilution of 1 : 1000). All steps were performed on ice, and the cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% FBS between each step. Cell fluorescence was analyzed using a BD Accuri C6 Plus flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA).
