<p>Renal cell injury was induced by cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) at concentrations of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M for NRK and 16 
 <italic>μ</italic>M for HK-2 as the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for 3 days. The cell model was treated with the various polyherbs, and then collected for further experiments. The treatments were carried out under serum-free conditions, and the results were compared with those of the vehicle control.
