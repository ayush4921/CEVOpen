<p>Two kidney proximal tubular epithelial cell lines, rat NRK-52E (NRK) and human HK-2, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, URL 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.atcc.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.atcc.org</ext-link>). The NRK and HK-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose (DMEM-HG; Hyclone) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml streptomycin (all from Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were grown in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> humidified incubator at 37°C. When the cells reached 80–90% confluence, they were seeded in 96- and 6-well plates at 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well, respectively, and starved overnight in serum-free medium before treatment.
