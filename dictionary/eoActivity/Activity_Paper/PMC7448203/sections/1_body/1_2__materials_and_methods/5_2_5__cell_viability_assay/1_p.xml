<p>Cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (TCI Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan). Cells seeded in a 96-well plate were treated with MTT at 0.5 mg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Then, the cells were lysed using DMSO, and color development was assessed at 570 nm using a Synergy™ H1 automated microplate reader (Bio-Tek). The viability was represented as a percentage of that of the vehicle control.</p>
