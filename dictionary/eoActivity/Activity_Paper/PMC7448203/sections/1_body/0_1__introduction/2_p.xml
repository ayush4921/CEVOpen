<p>Drug-induced AKI accounts for up to 60% of all cases, resulting in a severe threat to hospitalized patients [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Cisplatin is one of the most efficient and widely used antineoplastic drugs; however, its application is restricted due to the side effects, including nephrotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Indeed, the cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity is occurred as high as 30–40% [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The nephrotoxicity involves oxidative stress, DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, caspase activation, apoptosis/necrosis, and inflammation, especially in the proximal tubules and collecting ducts [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many target-based treatments including anti-inflammatory (i.e., 
 <italic>α</italic>-lipoic acid and ABT-719) and antioxidant (i.e., selinium and 
 <italic>α</italic>-tocopherol) reagents and others (i.e., rhIGF1, ANP, and dopamine) have been reported to be effective in both in vivo and in vitro AKI models. However, their clinical application has shown inconsistent results [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which suggests that monotarget -based drugs can be not sufficient for treating AKI. Current standard cares are limited to vigorous hydration with saline and the simultaneous administration of mannitol [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, patients who have progressed to end-stage renal disease have only two treatment options: dialysis or kidney transplantation. The limited treatment options for AKI have led to an increased interest in alternative therapies using traditional herbal medicine.
