<p>Pretreatments of rabbit tracheal rings with the ethanol 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract (0.5 mg/mL) resulted in a significant relaxation of the muscle after an increased concentration of acetylcholine (0.3–1000 nM) contractile stimulus compared to acetylcholine alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Increased concentrations (1 or 2 mg/mL) of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract further potentiated the relaxant effects of the extract, return of the concentration-response curve toward baseline, respectively. This significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) inhibition of smooth muscle contraction by the SR extract clearly indicates 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract anticholinergic activity.
