<p>One of the mechanisms involved in smooth muscle relaxation is PGE2 production, a product of COX-1 activation [

 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract-dependent tracheorelaxant activity, indomethacin (nonselective COX inhibitor, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) was added prior to 2 mg/mL of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract in CCh-contracted tracheal rings. Compared to 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract-treated alone (in CCh precontracted muscle), the cotreatment of rabbit smooth muscles with the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract and indomethacin significantly inhibited the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract-induced relaxant effects (
