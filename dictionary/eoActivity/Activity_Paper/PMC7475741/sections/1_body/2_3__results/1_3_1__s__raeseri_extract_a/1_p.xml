<p>In the first series of experiments, we investigated the potential effect of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract (SRE) alone on the tracheal basal tone after an approximately 1 h equilibration period under 1 g resting tension. To this end, the addition of cumulative concentrations of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract (0.3–2 mg/mL) to the tissue bath did not significantly alter the tracheal basal tone (data not shown).
