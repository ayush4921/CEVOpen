<p>The NO/cGMP pathway induces smooth muscle relaxation through multiple mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. NO is an endogenous tracheorelaxant mediator that is made in a reaction catalysed by the NO synthase (NOS) isoforms, which utilize L-arginine, molecular oxygen, and NADPH as substrates to effectively produce NO and L-citrulline [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Nitric oxide further activates soluble guanylyl cyclase (GC) to synthesize intracellular cGMP, relaxing the airway smooth muscle [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We preincubated isolated tracheal rings with either NOS inhibitor L-NAME or NOS stimulator bradykinin or GC inhibitor ODQ to determine the putative involvement of the NO/cGMP-mediated signaling pathway in the relaxant activity of

Therefore, it clearly indicates that SRE-induced tracheorelaxant effects are mediated by multiple mechanisms, including NO/cGMP signaling pathway.
