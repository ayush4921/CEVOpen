<p>We have previously reported a new tracheorelaxant effect of another medicinal plant, 
 <italic>Vitex agnus-castus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are no prior studies that have revealed the mechanism of tracheorelaxant activity of 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic>. In view of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> ethanol extract effects, we hypothesized that the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract may also have a tracheorelaxant function. This study was realized to scientifically demonstrate the pharmacological basis for medicinal use of the 
 <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract to be used for the treatment of hyperactive airway disorders, such as asthma, respectively.
