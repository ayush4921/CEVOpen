   <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract causes rabbit airway smooth muscle relaxation after muscle contraction induced by acetylcholine. (a) Original representative current tracings showing effects in force/time of dose-dependent (0.3–1000 nM) acetylcholine-induced smooth muscle contraction on isolated tracheal rings in the absence or presence of app. 5 min preincubation with specific concentrations (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/mL) of the 
   <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract. (b) Arithmetic means ± SEM (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5-6) of different measurements recorded in tracheal rings untreated (basal tonus, grey closed circles) or treated with specific dose-dependent concentrations of acetylcholine in the absence (closed squares) or after 5 min pretreatment in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL (closed triangles), 1 mg/mL (closed rhombi), or 2 mg/mL (black closed circles) of the 
   <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract. 
   <sup>∗</sup>indicates statistical significance (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; 
   <italic>t</italic>-test) from the absence of the 
   <italic>S. raeseri</italic> extract.
