<p>It has been recognized that medicinal plants are equipped with bioactive compounds used for prophylaxis and therapeutic purposes [

 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> activities. Considering that 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> is a public health concern and one of the pathogens on the World Health Organization (WHO) list for which drug development is an emergency [

 <xref rid="B43-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], it is imperative to explore possible alternative solutions through the use of NPs that can be candidates for drug development. With this background, the present study evaluates the susceptibility of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains to selected NPs and frontline antimicrobials.
