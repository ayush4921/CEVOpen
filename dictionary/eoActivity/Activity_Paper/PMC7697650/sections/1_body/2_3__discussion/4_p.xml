<p>The chicken isolates exhibited resistance to quinolones (CIP and NAL) and tetracycline. These results support previous reports of increased resistance to fluoroquinolones in 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> strains from various sources, including chickens [
 <xref rid="B57-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains are becoming more resistant to drugs of choice, and this has been associated with the irrational use of various antibiotics in animal husbandry [
 <xref rid="B58-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], mainly poultry [
 <xref rid="B7-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Apart from the point mutation in 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A, increased resistance to quinolones has been associated with the broad use of fluoroquinolones in the human population and veterinary medicine [
 <xref rid="B59-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Furthermore, ciprofloxacin is used in treating diarrhea cases of unknown etiology, and once acquired, resistance to fluoroquinolones can be maintained in populations even after being banned in animal production [
 <xref rid="B18-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In South Korea, the use of fluoroquinolones in veterinary medicine was banned in July 2020 [

 <xref rid="B61-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The mutation in 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A (Thr86Ile) confers resistance to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid [
 <xref rid="B62-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, a different mutation (Thr86Ala) in 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A has been associated with resistance to nalidixic acid alone [
 <xref rid="B63-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The Thr86Ile mutation was found in 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> species isolated from chicken (this study), which is in agreement with the broth microdilution and PCR results. The same mutation has been associated with high-level resistance to quinolones [
