<p>The 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> isolated from chicken (MT947450, CJâ€“CI) showed 100% similarity with 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> (CP047481.1) isolated from patients with gastroenteritis in Chile. This shows the possible transmission of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> species from poultry to humans, and several reports have shown an association between human and poultry isolates when drinking contaminated water or eating undercooked meat [

 <xref rid="B68-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Chicken is known as the major reservoir of human campylobacteriosis due to its high body temperature, which is suitable for 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> growth [
 <xref rid="B69-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and increased poultry consumption [

 <xref rid="B70-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Therefore, control measures and adherence to hygienic practices are required to reduce the transmission of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> from animals to humans. We also recommend studies on the synergistic activities of both NPs and existing antibiotics aimed at reducing the MIC values of drugs of choice and, thus, helping to slow down antimicrobial resistance and extend the effectiveness of existing antibiotics.
