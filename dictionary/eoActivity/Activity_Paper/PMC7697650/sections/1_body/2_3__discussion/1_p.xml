<p>The objective of this study is to evaluate the susceptibility of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains to various NPs and frontline antibiotics. Cinnamon extract, oil, and trans (E)-Cinnamaldehyde had the lowest anti-
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> activities, ranging from 25 to 200 µg/mL, which concurs with previous results where the range was from 46.8–600 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, the MIC for cinnamon oil was lower than the 1000 µg/mL reported against 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> strains in Egypt [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Clove oil and its major compound eugenol had MICs varying from 50–100 µg/mL, which are higher than the previously reported value of 20 µg/mL for clove oil [
 <xref rid="B33-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] but lower than the 500 µg/mL reported for eugenol [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Other studies have also reported the strong anti-
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> potential of cinnamon and clove oil [
 <xref rid="B45-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Essential oils are given to broilers to control 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> [
 <xref rid="B46-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The difference in MIC values could be associated with the method used as some researchers used an agar-based method instead of the recommended broth microdilution [
 <xref rid="B28-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Other probable reasons could be the location and extraction procedures [
 <xref rid="B47-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] or the presence of biofilm, virulence, and antibiotic-resistance genes [
 <xref rid="B3-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].
