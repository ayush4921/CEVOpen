<p>The ultimate goal of screening for antimicrobial activities from plant-derived products is to avail ourselves of products with antipathogenic and anti-inflammatory potencies that can be used in either prevention or treatment of campylobacteriosis [

 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> activities of NPs are limited, possibly due to a lack of suitable infection models [
 <xref rid="B66-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. For instance, Hlashwayo et al. [
 <xref rid="B42-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] recently reported that not even a single in-vivo study had been published in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) on the antimicrobial activities of plants used to treat campylobacteriosis. The screened NPs may be candidates for in-vivo studies using different models.
