<p>After the sequencing of PCR products, BioEdit software (version 7.2.6.1) was used to edit, align, and analyze the DNA sequences [
 <xref rid="B83-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The consensus sequences obtained were compared to GenBank strains by a BLAST search, and they were submitted to GenBank to get accession numbers [
 <xref rid="B84-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Standard sensitive strains for 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A mutation, including 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> (GenBank accession number L04566.1) and 
 <italic>C. coli</italic> (GenBank accession number U63413.1), were used for comparison with the sequences of this study. For comparison, strains with 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A mutations were also included (KX982339.1 and MT176401.1). For the 
 <italic>tet</italic>(O) gene analysis, different GenBank accession numbers (AM884250, 81-176, and CP044175.1) were used. For the antibiotic resistance genes, sequence alignments were performed with Clustal Omega [
 <xref rid="B85-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Amino acid sequences were deduced from the DNA sequences using the ExPASyTranslate tool [
