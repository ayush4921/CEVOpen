<p>The MIC and MBC for the tested NPs and antibiotics were determined by broth microdilution using 96-well plates (Greiner-bio-one, Kremsmünster, Austria) [
 <xref rid="B79-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Briefly, 100 μL of the antimicrobials at working concentrations were pipetted to the first column of a plate. After two-fold serial dilutions by MHB across the plate, all wells were inoculated with 50 μL of inoculum except for the negative controls. Control wells were prepared with culture medium (sterility control), plant extract (negative control), bacterial suspension (positive control), and DMSO in amounts corresponding to the highest quantity present. The highest amount of DMSO in the test well was 2% for extracts and less than 0.5% for essential oils and pure phytochemicals. The DMSO at the highest concentration (2%) did not affect bacterial growth, as previously described [

All tests for antimicrobial susceptibility were repeated six times for reproducibility. The MICs were evaluated spectrophotometrically by measuring the bacterial concentration at an absorbance of 600 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy HT; BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). The MIC was confirmed by the addition of iodonitrotetrazolium chloride (INT), followed by agitation at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial agent that results in a significant decrease (˃90%) in inoculum viability after 48 h, as previously described, with modification on incubation time [
