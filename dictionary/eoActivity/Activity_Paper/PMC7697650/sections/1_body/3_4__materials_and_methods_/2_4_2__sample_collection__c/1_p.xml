<p>Pen floor fecal samples were collected using sterile cotton swabs, which were then placed on ice and transported to the laboratory within one hour. These samples were inoculated onto modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, UK) containing the 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> mCCDA selective supplement, SR155E (Oxoid Ltd.). Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions generated by CampyGen
 <sup>TM</sup> gas sachets (Oxoid Ltd.), as previously described [
 <xref rid="B71-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Typical colonies of 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic>, with the features of being moistened, gray, flat, and a tendency to spread [
 <xref rid="B72-antibiotics-09-00790" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], were subcultured on Mueller Hinton agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h under microaerophilic conditions generated by CampyGen
 <sup>TM</sup> gas sachets (Oxoid Ltd.). Species confirmation was performed by PCR and sequencing. 
 <italic>Campylobacter</italic> isolates were preserved at −80 °C in Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) supplemented with 25% glycerol (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). Apart from chicken isolates, 
 <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> 33560
 <sup>TM</sup>) and 
 <italic>Campylobacter coli</italic> (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> 33559
 <sup>TM</sup>) were also used. For antibacterial activity assays, bacterial inoculum of 0.5 McFarland (1–5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL) was prepared from fresh colonies taken from MHA plates supplemented with 5% defibrinated horse blood (Oxoid Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, England) and dissolved in sterile normal saline (0.85%). The absorbance was recorded spectrophotometrically at 600 nm (Synergy HT; BioTek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT, USA).
