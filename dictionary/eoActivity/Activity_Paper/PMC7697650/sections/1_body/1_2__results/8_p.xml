<p>The Genbank accession numbers registered for DNA 
 <italic>gy</italic>rA sequences of 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic> and 
 <italic>C. coli</italic> in this study are MT947448 and MT947449, respectively. Furthermore, MT947448 and MT947449 exhibited two silent mutations each (AGT to AGC for Ser119Ser and GCC to GCT for Ala120Ala in 
 <italic>C. jejuni</italic>; TTT to TTC for Phe99Phe and GCG to GCA for Ala122Ala in 
 <italic>C. coli</italic>). The sequences for 
 <italic>gyr</italic>A genes showed similarity to known sequences from GenBank (
