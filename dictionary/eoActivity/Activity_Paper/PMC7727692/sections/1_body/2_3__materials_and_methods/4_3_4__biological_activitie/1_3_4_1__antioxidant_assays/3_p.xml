<p>In the Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant (TEAC) assays, the method by [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] was employed. To generated ABTS radical cation, 88 µL of freshly prepared 140 mM potassium-peroxodisulphate solution and 5 mL of ABTS solution (7 mM). The solution was mixed and left in a dark enclosure at room temperature for 24 h. The ABTS solution was then diluted with ethanol (1:20

The Trolox standard wells contained 25 μL of standard solution while the control ones contained 25 μL of the control solutions. Sample wells contained 25 μL of samples in triplicate. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The recording of the plates was done in a Multiskan Spektrum plate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Trolox was used as the standard. Results were expressed as μmol Trolox equivalents/g sample weights.
