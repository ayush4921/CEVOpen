<p>The biological activities of crude extract of 
 <italic>L. petersonii</italic> were compared against the isolated flavonoid, 6-methyltectochrysin which was isolated from the methanolic extracts. The crude extracts showed stronger antioxidant activity (up to 8-fold greater) and higher antimicrobial activity relative to the pure 6-methyltectochrysin. The antimicrobial activities were more improved for Gram-positive bacteria strains than the tested Gram-negative strains. Other reports abound on the biological activities of the essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>L. petersonii</italic> species, which may suggest that the essential oil is the major bioactive component of the plant, especially in antimicrobial assays. This study has, however, shown that spent (defatted) leaves, obtainable in the form of discarded waste from essential oil production factories, possess promising use as natural food preservatives to avoid bacteria growth. Future work may access the strength of these products in the inhibition of enterotoxin secretions that may cause food poisoning. The practice of immediate disposal of spent leaves of the 
 <italic>Leptospermum</italic> after extraction of essential oils may be reconsidered. Since 
 <italic>L. petersonii</italic> is edible, we also suggest the possibility of phytomedicinal formulations or other culinary use of the plants, especially in regions burdened with 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic>.
