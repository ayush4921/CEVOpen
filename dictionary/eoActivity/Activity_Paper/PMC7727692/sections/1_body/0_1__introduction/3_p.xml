<p>The increase in the incidences of antibiotic resistance remain a global persistent threat to human health [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among the known multidrug-resistant pathogens is 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>, an aerobic rod-shaped Gram-positive bacterium that leads to fried rice disease syndrome in Africa and elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Fried rice syndrome caused by bacterial infestation with 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> has been implicated in food-borne diarrhea and may lead to severe soft tissue infection in other instances [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This is a phenomenal problem in regions where rice is a stable food, for example, in most underdeveloped countries. The poor food preservation and hygiene habits at food preparations spaces, and especially at ready-to-eat food vending spots create thriving hotspots for pathogens including 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-05487" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which may lead to food poisoning. Natural food preservatives may thus proffer manageable solutions in such regions.
