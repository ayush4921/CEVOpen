<p>Antioxidants are biologically useful compounds that may help reduce the progression, or avoid oxidation of substrates. These compounds can inhibit or eliminate oxidative stress and damages to cells or other molecules within the body of living hosts. The neuroprotective properties of natural antioxidants are reported elsewhere [

Living organisms rely on antioxidant defense mechanisms provided by natural compounds, which are either produced within the body, for instance, in the synthesis of superoxide dismutase, or obtainable externally from nutritive diets. External (exogeneous) source of antioxidants (vitamins A, C and E, carotenes, lycopene, etc.) are mainly from plants. Antioxidants are believed to serve as protection against tissue damage in plants, but in humans, dietary intake of antioxidants has several benefits, including a decline in the proliferation of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and aging [
