<p>The incidence of drug resistance is still a global burden. The results from this study showed a general resistance exhibited by the Gram-negative strains, which coincidentally have been reported to exhibit higher resistance due to the impermeable outer membrane structure. Unfortunately, conventional treatments have been shown to be less effective in managing microbial infections, mainly due to the increasing drug resistance of these microorganisms, which directly results from drug overdose, negligence and poor infection control practices [
