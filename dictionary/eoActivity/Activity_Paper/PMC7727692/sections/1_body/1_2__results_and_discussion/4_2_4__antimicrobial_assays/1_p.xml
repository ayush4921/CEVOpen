<p>In vitro broth dilution assays were carried out against six species of multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria strains including three Gram-positive (
 <italic>Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>) bacteria and three Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic>). The antimicrobial activities of the crude extract and the purified flavonoid are shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05487-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The recorded level of inhibition has been presented in percentages after an initial calculation of the average instrument readings (Â± standard deviations). The percentage inhibitions of the samples are presented as follows.
