<p>The concentration (strength) of the reference antibiotics were doubled (111 µg/mL) relative to the concentration of the tested samples (55 µg/mL) to test the efficacy of the samples at 50% strength relative to the known antibiotics. From the results (

 <italic>B. cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> due to the high concentration of nerolidol found in the essential oils [
