<p>The reference antibiotic (ampicillin) was inactive against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae,</italic> however the crude extract showed some activity (23%) against the microbial strain. Gram-positive 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> was observed to be resistant to the crude extract and the purified flavonoid at the tested concentrations. The crude extract and the pure flavonoid (6-methyltectochrysin) were inactive against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> though ampicillin showed 11% inhibition at a concentration of 111 Âµg/mL.
