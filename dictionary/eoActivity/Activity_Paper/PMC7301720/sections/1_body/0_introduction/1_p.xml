<p>Learning and memory are the hallmarks of human beings. Learning and memory are among the highest functional levels of the central nervous system (CNS) (Spencer et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Memory is a biological adaptation that enables a living organism to use past experiences to regulate its behaviour against environmental changes. Memory is assumed to be the result of long-term changes induced by learning in the relationship between neurons (Holroyd and Shepherd 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). The spatial memory and long-term memory are constantly forming in the hippocampus (Diba et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Since learning and memory are important issues in science and technology advancement and the number of people with learning and memory disorders is increasing, using herbal drugs in the treatment of forgetfulness and enhancing memory has been a topic of interest for many researchers (Izadpanah et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). These herbs have been used since ancient times and they rarely lead to side effects (Jamshidi-Kia et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). There are many medicinal herbs effective in enhancing memory and learning. 
 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> L. (Rutaceae), which has significant therapeutic properties, is one of the medicinal herbs used in traditional medicine in Iran and some other countries (Shojaii et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This herb is referred to as panacea due to its high therapeutic value include the treatment of anticular, ear, pharynx, neurological, pulmonary, digestive, renal, gynecological diseases, parasites excretion, pain relief, and treatment of spasm and inflammation

 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Javadi and Emami 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). There are more than 120 compounds of different types of flavonoid glycosides, quinoline alkaloids, coumarins, lignins, and flavonoids as the active ingredients of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>graveolens</italic> (Stashenko et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Gentile et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Among these flavonoids, rutin has been a topic of interest for researchers (Adsersen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Also, as a major compound of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>graveolens</italic>, rutin enhances memory retrieval and has pharmacological activities, including anti-allergic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiviral, and antimycotic properties (Jianxiong et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate and compare the effect of hydroalcholic extract of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>graveolens</italic> and rutin on spatial memory and passive avoidance memory in rats.
