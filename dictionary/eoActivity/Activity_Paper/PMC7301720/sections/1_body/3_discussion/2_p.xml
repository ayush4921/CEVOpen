<p>The group receiving 300 mg/kg of the extract and the group receiving rutin, compared to the control group, which this indicates the improving effect of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>graveolens</italic> on the spatial memory. There was a significant difference between the doses 30 and 300 mg/kg in comparing Morris water maze test results in the groups receiving extract. There was also a significant difference in the test results between one of the groups receiving extract (30 mg/kg) and the group receiving rutin. In addition, according to the shuttle box test results, there was no significant difference between different doses of extract and rutin. The results of the current study indicated that total serum and brain antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in the groups receiving 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg of the extract and the group receiving rutin, compared to the control group. There were also significant differences in serum antioxidant capacity between the groups receiving extract (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg), and there was another one in brain antioxidant capacity between two of the groups receiving extract (30 and 300 mg/kg). There were also significant differences in serum antioxidant capacity between two of the groups receiving extract (30 and 300 mg/kg) and the group receiving rutin, and there was another one in brain antioxidant capacity between one of the groups receiving extract (30 mg/kg) and the group receiving rutin. In addition, serum and brain MDA levels were significantly decreased in the groups receiving 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg of the

 <italic>graveolens</italic> extract and the group receiving rutin, compared to the control group. There were also significant differences in serum MDA level between two of the groups receiving extract (30 and 300 mg/kg) and another one in brain MDA level between the groups receiving extract (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg). There was also a statistically significant difference in serum MDA level between one of the groups receiving extract (30 mg/kg) and the group receiving rutin, and there was another significant difference in brain MDA level between two of the groups receiving extract (30 and 100 mg/kg) and the group receiving rutin. In 2006, Adsersen et al. proved that the extract of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> can inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity. Therefore, this plant has been suggested to be effective in memory improvement (Adsersen et al. 2006). Talić et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) also investigated the effect of 
 <italic>R. graveolens</italic> on the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), which are considered as promising strategies in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to this study, the strongest inhibition effect on AChE was detected within water extract of rue (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 50 µg/mL) and there was also a significant inhibition effect on BuChE. These results are consistent with our results. In a study conducted by Ratheesh et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) it was reported that methanol extract of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>graveolens</italic> reduced the oxidative stress and inflammation, and improved pathology induced in aorta of hypercholesterolemic rats, such that the herb decreased the activities of cyclooxygenase-2 and myeloperoxidase, as well as the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, and increased the antioxidant activities of certain enzymes such as glutathione, indicating the antioxidant activity of the herb, which this is in agreement with our study (Ratheesh et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Preethi et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) also reported that the low (homeopathic) concentrations of 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>graveolens</italic> had cytotoxic effects on human lymphoma and fibroblastoma cells by controlling the oxygen free radicals and preventing the peroxidation of membrane lipids, and also saved the life of animals suffering from cancer (Preethi et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). In the study of Abidin et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), implemented on the relationship between oxidative stress and memory, stressful periods and increased stress levels were associated with adverse effect on memory and memory retention (Abidin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). Therefore, oxidative stress accelerates the aging process and behaviours related to depression, dementia, and impairments of memory and learning. MDA is a product of cell membrane lipids peroxidation. Increasing the amounts of these lipid peroxides in the nerve cells leads to cell damage. The body uses the antioxidant system to cope with oxidative substances. In addition to these systems, some medicinal herbs reduce the oxidative stress and its adverse outcomes due to the antioxidants (Pandya et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rabiei et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).
