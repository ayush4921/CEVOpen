<p>In standardising the extract in the present study, the amounts of rutin, apigenin, and caffeic acid were 40.15, 0.84, and 19.92 μg/mL of dry extract, respectively, using HPLC analysis. In a study by Proestos et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), the amounts of phenolic and flavonoid compounds were measured in aromatic plants, such as 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>graveolens</italic>, in which the amounts of caffeic acid, rutin, and quercetin were 20.1, 40.1 and 3.1 μg/mL of dry extract, respectively, and the amounts of apigenin, luteolin, and naringenin were not adequate to be detected. Besides that, the antioxidant capacity of the 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>graveolens</italic> leaf was 159.17 μg/mL in the DPPH method (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), and the total phenolic content of the herb extract was calculated at 14.1 mg/g of dry extract.
