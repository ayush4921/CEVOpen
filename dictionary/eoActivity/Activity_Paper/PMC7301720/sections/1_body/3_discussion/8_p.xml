<p>The inhibitory effects of rutin on GABA transaminase (GABA-T) and succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase have been indicated in numerous in-vitro studies. Inhibition of the two enzymes in the brain tissue increases GABA levels and may have therapeutic applications in neurological disorders. In addition, GABA-T is known as an important target for some of the drugs effective in the brain. Therefore, the inhibition of flavonoids by these enzymes may lead to exhibiting neuro-pharmacological effects (Tao etÂ al.
