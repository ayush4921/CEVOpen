<p>Total phenolic and flavonoid content of the extract was determined using Folin-Ciocalteu reagent and the aluminium chloride colorimetric method, respectively. To achieve this purpose, total phenolic and flavonoid content was calculated by the calibration curve, and the results were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) and rutin equivalent/g of the extract dry weight, respectively (Medini etÂ al.
