<p>Each rat was given 60 min to find the platform in Morris water maze test. If a rat could not find the platform, it was guided to the platform. The rats were allowed to rest for 30 s between each two trials to explore the environment. Also, rats were taken out from water for 10 min between two blocks, and those were allowed to rest in the cage. Each rat was trained 4 times per day for 4 days, and the test was repeated without the platform on day 5 (probe day) (Tarnawski et al.
