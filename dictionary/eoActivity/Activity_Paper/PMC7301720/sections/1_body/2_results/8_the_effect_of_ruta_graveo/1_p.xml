<p>There were significant differences between different groups in one-way ANOVA (

 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), but the difference between two of the groups receiving extract (30 and 100 mg/kg) and the group receiving rutin was significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There were also significant differences between the groups receiving extract (30 and 100 mg/kg, 30 and 300 mg/kg, and 100 and 300 mg/kg) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The results of this test showed that the effects of this extract were dose-dependent (
