<p>There were significant differences between different groups in one-way ANOVA (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Tukey’s 
 <italic>post hoc</italic> test showed that the brain antioxidant capacity was significantly higher in the groups receiving 
 <italic>Ruta graveolens</italic> extract with the concentrations of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg and the group receiving 10 mg/kg rutin, compared to the control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, and 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, respectively). Regarding the brain antioxidant capacity, there was no significant difference between two of the groups receiving extract (100 and 300 mg/kg) and the group receiving rutin (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), but the difference between one of the groups receiving extract (30 mg/kg) and the group receiving rutin was significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). There was also a significant difference between two of the groups receiving extract (30 and 300 mg/kg) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
