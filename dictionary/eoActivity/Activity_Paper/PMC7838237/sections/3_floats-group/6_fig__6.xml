  <p>Possible immune mechanism cytokines 
   <bold>a</bold> fungus polysaccharides increased the production of IL-2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1α, and IL-1β generated from T cells. Cytokines 
   <bold>b</bold> mushroom polysaccharides increased the production of IL-1, 2, 3, 12, TNF-α, and IFN-γ of NK cells. Cytokines 
   <bold>c</bold> fungus polysaccharides could improve the release of IL-6 and 8, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ from macrophages. ConA was used as a specific T cell activator, and LPS was used as a general activator of B cells, macrophages, and DCs [
