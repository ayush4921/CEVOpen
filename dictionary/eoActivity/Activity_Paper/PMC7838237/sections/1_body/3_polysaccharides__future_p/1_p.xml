<p id="Par21">Polysaccharides are the most abundant natural biopolymers, and recently they have gained more attention as applicable substances in different biomedical areas. Many properties are contributed to their excellent reputation, they are economically cheaper, could be modified chemically to suit specific purposes, and unlike synthetic biopolymers which have many drawbacks such as toxicity and long-time synthetic approaches, polysaccharides are comparably safe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Over the past few years, there has been an increasing interest in the application of polysaccharide materials in the field of tissue engineering [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. Mushrooms have been used for a long time, and recently they have gained more importance in cancer therapy, polysaccharides derived from mushrooms such as chizophyllan, lentinan, grifolan, polysaccharide-peptide complex (PSP), and polysaccharide-protein complex (PSK) can induce the immune response and produce the antitumor effect, which makes them promising candidates against tumor in the future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The safety of polysaccharides is a crucial factor, and a strong advantage that will make the use of their increase in the future, many other organic synthesis and chemical modifications caused severe environmental pollution which could be improved by substitution to natural polysaccharides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. From the drug delivery perspective, and due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability properties, polysaccharides have been increasingly used in many different forms to control the delivery of some drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. The diversity of functional groups located on polysaccharides structures such as hydroxyl, amino, and carboxylic acid groups could be furtherly modified to serve as a specific biological tool in different fields like vaccine adjuvants, drug carriers, tissue engineering scaffolds, and many other pharmacological activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Natural polysaccharides such as glycogen, cellulose, and starch were engineered onto biologically superior molecules by numerous methods such as chemical modification, co-polymer grafting, and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) to promote its candidature in biopharmaceutics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The conjugation between hydrophilic groups of polysaccharides with hydrophobic groups of drugs can form prodrugs with amphiphilic properties, which can be self-assembled to form nanostructures with improved water solubility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. On the other hand, and since the polysaccharides are usually derived from natural sources, there are some limitations and challenges for polysaccharides in pharmaceutical and biological fields, such as batch-to-batch variations, microbial contamination, reduced viscosity during the storage, thickening, and uncontrolled rate of hydration. Fortunately, these drawbacks could be minimized by modifications such as grafting, cross-linking, and blending with other natural/synthetic/semi-synthetic polymers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. The high variability of polysaccharides in nature adds a new difficult task in extraction and purification of these polysaccharides, over and above, polysaccharides naturally found in complex with other compounds like proteins and lipids, and their isolation requires efficient and precise methods to avoid co-extraction and contamination with other compounds. Finally, the determination and fully understand of the structural activity relationship of polysaccharides shall provide new opportunities in pharmaceutical and biological applications [
