<p id="Par4">Polysaccharides, the most form of carbohydrates that existed in nature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], can be defined according to their chemical structure, which contains monosaccharides units that linked by glycosidic bonds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], they are either sugars residues that glycosidically linked together or bonded covalently to other structures like peptides, amino acids, and lipids. Homopolysaccharides are homoglycans that consist of the same monosaccharides, whereas heteropolysaccharides are heteroglycans that consist of different monosaccharides (Fig.Â
