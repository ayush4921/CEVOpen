<p id="Par6">Chemical modifications of polysaccharides like sulfation, phosphorylation, and carboxymethylation are very efficient procedures to modify and change the biological properties of polysaccharides[
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which render them suitable for drug delivery systems in different drugs preparations because they can be more stable, non-toxic, and biodegradable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Chemical modifications such as grafting, cross-linking, complexation, and covalent coupling add more potentialities as drug delivery and subsequently improve therapeutic efficacy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They can also be a suitable choice for the replacement of some excipients or synthetic polymers [
