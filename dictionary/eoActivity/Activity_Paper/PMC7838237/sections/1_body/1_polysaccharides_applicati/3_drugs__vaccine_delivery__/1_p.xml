<p id="Par11">Recently, polysaccharides have been extensively used as drug carriers, building blocks for drug delivery, bioactive materials, and excipients to enhance drug delivery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], they also gain more attention in tissue engineering [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], cosmetics, and wound healing fields [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The ability of natural polysaccharides to be shaped and modified to do specific goals made them a potential candidate for many applications including drug and vaccine delivery. Xanthan gum, gellan gum, and scleroglucan are microorganisms-derived polysaccharides and have been studied extensively in drug delivery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. The absorption of the drug can be increased by loading it in bioadhesive polysaccharides nanoparticle carriers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Other naturally occurring polysaccharides include pectin, guar gum, amylose, inulin, dextran, chitosan, and chondroitin sulphate, which have been investigated for colon-specific drug release and their ability to be used as pharmaceutical excipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. These polysaccharides can deliver drugs to the colon as prodrugs or coating tablets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]; moreover, chitin and chitosan are low-immunogenic and tissue compatible polysaccharides that proved to be effective in wound healing, tissue engineering, bone regeneration, and in delivery of drugs and vaccine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Chitosan (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) is one of the most biopolymers that has been widely used as a drug and vaccine delivery system in many preparations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], that is because a wide variety of antigen that could be encapsulated under mild conditions and without using organic solvents, which avoid the degradation and denaturation of the antigen during processing or after loading [
