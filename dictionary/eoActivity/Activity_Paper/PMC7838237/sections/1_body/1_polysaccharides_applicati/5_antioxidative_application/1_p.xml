<p id="Par14">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may cause damages to the human body, they attack different macromolecules such as membrane lipids, proteins, and DNA, leading to many health disorders such as cancer, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases with severe tissue injuries. Antioxidative agents are of great benefit in this regard since they can block or reduce the effect of these hazardous agents [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>], and improve human health [

Antioxidants from scientific resources are bearing many drawbacks like their carcinogenesis and liver damages; for these reasons, an alternative natural substitute will be of great advantage. Polysaccharides derived from plants are promising candidates because they exhibit strong antioxidant activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], that could protect the human body against free radicals and decreased the complications of many diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Owing to its biological importance, chemical properties of plant polysaccharides have been extensively investigated for their wide range of applications, such as antitumor, immune-stimulation, and antioxidant activities [

Moreover, the existence of natural antioxidants capable of scavenging these ROS will offer great help in this regard, this is the case with polysaccharides since they possess antioxidant activity which has been proved to protect and inhibit cardio and cerebrovascular disease caused by free radicals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Many of these natural polysaccharides, such as
