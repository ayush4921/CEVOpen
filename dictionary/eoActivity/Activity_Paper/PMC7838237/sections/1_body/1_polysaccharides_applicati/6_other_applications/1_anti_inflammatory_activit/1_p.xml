<p id="Par16">Natural polysaccharides have been widely used in nanomaterials for controlling inflammatory pathologies [

 <italic>,</italic> and were experimentally tested for their anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. The anti-inflammatory effect of polysaccharides could be through one of these mechanisms, e.g., the anti-inflammatory activity of TCM polysaccharides is mainly due to the inhibition of the expression of the chemotactic factor and adherence factor, as well as the activities of key enzymes in the inflammation process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Other polysaccharides have an inhibitory effect on inflammatory-related mediators such as cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a) and NO (nitric oxide), and decreased the infiltration of inflammatory cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], sulfated polysaccharides derived from algae exhibit their anti-inflammatory effect through interfering with the migration of leukocytes to sites of inflammation [
