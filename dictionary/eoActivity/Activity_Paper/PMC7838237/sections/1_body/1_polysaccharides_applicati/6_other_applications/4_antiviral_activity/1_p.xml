<p id="Par19">The antiviral activity of polysaccharides was proved since the 50 s of the last century, it has been established that sulfated polysaccharides from seaweeds have an inhibitory effect against the replication of enveloped viruses including herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, and respiratory syncytial virus [

Polysaccharides derived from Chinese traditional medicine have also been used for a long time as antiviral agents since they can improve and strengthen the immune system through activating macrophagocytes to promote their phagocytic ability and induce the secretion of IL-2, IFN-γ, and antibodies [
