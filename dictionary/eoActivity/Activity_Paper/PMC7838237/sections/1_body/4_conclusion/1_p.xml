<p id="Par22">Polysaccharides are the most available natural biopolymers with diverse physical and chemical properties that render them a promising candidate in many biomedical areas. Polysaccharides have several advantages over other synthetic polymers; they are safe, economical, stable, hydrophilic, biocompatible, biodegradable, and prone to chemical modifications and tailoring for specific purposes in a wide variety of applications, such as preparation of pharmaceutical materials, drug release agent and plasma substitutes. Polysaccharides can be applied biologically in many different therapeutic fields like immunoregulatory, anti-tumor, anti-virus, anti-inflammatory, antioxidation, and hypoglycemic activity. Over the past decades, polysaccharides have attracted extensive attention and can be considered as one of the most potent alternatives to conventional therapy. Even though carbohydrate-based pharmaceuticals are proved effective in different areas, they are not gaining as much interest as proteins or nucleic acid-based drugs. At the end of this review, we recommend further studies and investigation because many discoveries still lie ahead and many biological activities of a variety of polysaccharides are still not fully understood. Extensive investigation and elucidation of the structural activity relationship of polysaccharides are crucial to give more insight into the exact mechanisms of their biological activities and fully explore their future applications.</p>
