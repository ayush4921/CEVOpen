<p id="Par20">Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 outbreak has become a major health challenge, especially with continuous searching for safe and effective therapeutic agents and vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Polysaccharides with their broad antiviral activity are considered one of the promising candidates in COVID-19 prevention and control from both sides as a therapeutic agent and carriers. GAGs, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and marine polysaccharides have shown potent anti-coronavirus activity. The entry of the virus to the host cell can be interfered with by sulfated polysaccharides by blocking the positive charge of the pathogen surface receptors. The cationically modified chitosan shows significant inhibition against the human coronavirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, which indicate its inhibitory effect against low-pathogenic human coronaviruses. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine contains potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 active compounds, especially Hedysarummultijugummaxim, coptidis rhizoma, and forsythiae fructus [
