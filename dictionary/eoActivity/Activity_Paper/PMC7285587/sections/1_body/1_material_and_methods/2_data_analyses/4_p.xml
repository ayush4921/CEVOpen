<p id="Par21">For preparations with more than one plant, we obtained the recently proposed index of taxon usefulness in mixtures (ITUM) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], which is the quotient between the number of reports of one taxon in mixtures and its total citations, whether simple or complex presentation. This index indicates the exclusiveness of taxa in mixtures when the value is one or closer to one.
