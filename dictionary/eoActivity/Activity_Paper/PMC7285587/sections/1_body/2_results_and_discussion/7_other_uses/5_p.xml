<p id="Par57">If we split data into subcategories, agrosilvopastoral management (11.74%), domestic (8.67%), magic or religious beliefs and practices (8.35%) and broom elaboration (8.20%) are the most reported. The first three categories are general and group a variety of uses, which explains the first positions. Broom elaboration is a very specific use, quoted by almost all our informants and a wide diversity of taxa. Up to 11 species are reported for this use. 
 <italic>Dorycnium pentaphyllum</italic> and 
 <italic>Mantisalca salmantica</italic> (L.) Briq. et Cavill. are the most valued, specifically used to sweep the threshing floor after selecting cereal or legume grains, and the street near home (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Other species reported are 
 <italic>Arundo donax</italic>, 
 <italic>Chamaerops humilis</italic> L., 
 <italic>Erica multiflora</italic> L., 
 <italic>Kochia scoparia</italic> (L.) Schrad., 
 <italic>Lygeum spartum</italic>, 
 <italic>Phoenix dactylifera</italic> L., 
 <italic>Retama sphaerocarpa</italic>, 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Spartium junceum</italic> L. Some of these brooms continue, to some extent, to be used nowadays and renewed when necessary. Furthermore, even if, as already stated, these uses are, in general, declining, some utilisations, such as ritual (for instance in Christmas or Palm Sunday), folk oral literature (e.g. proverbs) or handicraft basketry, persist in the studied territory, as they do in other Catalan language territories [
