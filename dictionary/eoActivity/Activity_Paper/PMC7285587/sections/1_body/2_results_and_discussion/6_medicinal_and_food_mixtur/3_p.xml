<p id="Par48">The index of taxon usefulness in mixtures was calculated taking into account all the taxa with three or more use reports in mixtures, thereby using the same criteria as in the simple presentation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The results in medicinal mixtures show there are two taxa reported only in mixtures, 
 <italic>Petroselinum crispum</italic> (Mill.) Hill and 
 <italic>Apium graveolens</italic> L., with the maximum ITUM value of one, and another one, 
 <italic>Citrus limon</italic> (L.) Burm., with a high value (0.92).
