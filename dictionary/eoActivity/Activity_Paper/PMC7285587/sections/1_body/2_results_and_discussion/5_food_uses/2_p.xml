<p id="Par43">The five most cited species are 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic> L., 
 <italic>Rubus ulmifolius</italic> Schott, 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> var. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> and 
 <italic>Prunus dulcis</italic> (Mill.) Weeb. The first three plants are wild and typical in the studied area: The aerial part of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> is used as a condiment, the young leaves of 
 <italic>Papaver rhoeas</italic> consumed as salad and the fruit of 
 <italic>Rubus ulmifolius</italic> is either eaten fresh or cooked with sugar, to make jam, the three uses being quite common. 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> var. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> and 
 <italic>Prunus dulcis</italic> are the main crops in the studied area, where they are largely cultivated (ca. 19,276 and 645â€‰ha, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]), and this explains their high number of use reports. The fundamental role of oil in the Mediterranean cuisine together with the numerous recipes for the preparation and preservation of olives explain the high number of citations of the olive tree. The high number of UR of the almond tree could be interpreted in the same sense. This species, widely distributed in the Mediterranean area, has been cited for the consumption of its ripe seeds, raw or toasted, but also for the complete unripe fruit, named green almonds, which are usually eaten either directly or pickled. The top-ranked twenty species and their principal mode of consumption are shown in Table
