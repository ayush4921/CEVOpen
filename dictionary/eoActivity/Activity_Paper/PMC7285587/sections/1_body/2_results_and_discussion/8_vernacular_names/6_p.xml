<p id="Par63">The Garrigues being an important agricultural area, it is not surprising that some cultivated plants bear a high number of names due to the races present in the area or known by the informants. This is the reason for which 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic> L. (with 15 folk names) is the taxon with the highest number of popular names. This also happens with 
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> var. 
 <italic>europaea</italic> (13 names), with the added value, at a local level, that one of the villages of the district (Arbeca) gives the name to a very well-known olive race (‘arbequina’), highly appreciated for both fruit consumption and oil elaboration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Finally, the same applies to 
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L. (14 names). The first wild plant species in the ranking of common names is 
 <italic>Helichrysum stoechas</italic> (11 names), followed by 
 <italic>Crataegus monogyna</italic> and 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> (both with nine names).
