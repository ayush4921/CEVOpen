<p id="Par60">The allochthonous ethnophytonymy index is 18.05%, between Giron√®s (4.7%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Mallorca (27.8%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] values. The reason for this quite high value in a rural district is the origin of one of the interviewees, who is from Germany but has lived in the Garrigues district for a long time, although she only speaks Spanish, not Catalan.
