<p id="Par58">In the present study, 849 vernacular names with 116 phonetic variants have been collected for 410 taxa. Fifty-four of these taxa do not have medicinal, food or other uses associated, 36 of them with other observations and 18 only with a popular name. Ten taxa have been mentioned by the informant without any popular name; in these few cases, the informant did not know or could not remember the name of a plant. Out of the 849 names, 79 are in the Spanish language, two in French and one in English, all the rest being in Catalan. The most cited taxon in terms of folk name (apart from cultivated plants with races, see later) is 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic>, which has been reported 90 times with the popular name 
 <italic>timó</italic> and 17 as 
 <italic>farigola</italic>, the second name (belonging to the so-called eastern Catalan dialect) not typical in the area (speaking western Catalan dialect), but known by many informants as used in other Catalan language variants. The same happens with 
 <italic>Rosmarinus officinalis</italic>’ names, with ‘romer’ (75 UR) as the typical in the district and ‘romaní’ (5 UR) also known from other dialects.
