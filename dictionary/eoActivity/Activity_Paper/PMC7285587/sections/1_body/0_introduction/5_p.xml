<p id="Par9">There are fundamental climax plant communities in the studied area. A kind of holm oak forest called ‘carrascar’ in Catalan language (
 <italic>Quercetum rotundifoliae</italic>) dominates a large part of the Garrigues district. A portion of the Garrigues, including the so-called historical (belonging to Segrià district) is more arid and dominated by a maquis (
 <italic>Rhamno lycioidis-Quercetum cocciferae</italic>) called ‘garriga’ (plural ‘garrigues’) in the Catalan language, which gives its name to the district. The part called Garrigues Altes (Serra de la Llena) is dominated by another type of holm oak tree forest (
 <italic>Viburno tini-Quercetum ilicis</italic>) called ‘alzinar’ in the Catalan language [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These climax communities are to a large extent degraded, and the landscape is far from the pure one of the plant formations quoted. Time and human action model a landscape fruit of the transformation of the natural vegetation by agricultural activities. In some cases, agriculture is currently in recession, and the abandoned fields will evolve again in terms of landscape.
