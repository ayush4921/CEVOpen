<p>In this study, ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> had antioxidant capacity, which is shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. ORAC quantified antioxidant capacity, measured fluorescence quenching, based on the production of peroxyl free radicals generated interacted with fluorescent probe.[

 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaves' extracts had an ORAC value of 9057.29 ± 43.08 μmol TE/100 g. FRAP quantified antioxidant power, measured directly reducing capacity of antioxidants (ferric to ferrous ion reduction).[

 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> had an FRAP value of 1230.88 ± 19.51 μmol TE/100 g. However, from previous study, 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf extracts had also been reported with strong antioxidant capacity. For DPPH assay, leaves extracts had antioxidant capacity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 100.81 ± 5.05 μg/ml (leaf maceration extract), 72.20 ± 9.61 μg/ml (leaf refluxing extract), and 14.50 ± 1.04 μg/ml (leaf decoction extract).[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] For FRAP assay, leaf extract had antioxidant capacity with 930 μmol Fe (II)/g extract.
