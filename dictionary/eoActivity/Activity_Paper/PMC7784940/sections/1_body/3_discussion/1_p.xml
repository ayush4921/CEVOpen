 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Proximate composition of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples is shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Moisture content is the amount of loss on drying of water and volatile substances.[

 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Moisture is sometime used for estimation of the qualitative of food. However, the amount of moisture content is one of the main factors in storage, due to the proliferation of microorganisms, such as fungi and mold.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] When fresh 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples dried until constant weight, moisture content was found to be 74.62 ± 0.38 g/100 g sample. Crude protein is the amount of total nitrogen multiplied by protein factors. Total nitrogen consisted of protein nitrogen and a few nonprotein nitrogens. Different types of food had different protein factors.[

 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In this study, 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples used protein factor of 6.25 to convert nitrogen to protein; then, crude protein in the leaf samples was found to be 5.01 ± 0.05 g/100 g sample. Total fat, ether extract, is the amount of fat including fatty acid, oil-soluble dyes, fat-soluble vitamins, and steroids.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Total fat of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples was found to be 0.95 ± 0.04 g/100 g sample. Total carbohydrate is the amount of carbohydrate, which is one of the main components of structural materials in plants.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In this study, we calculated that based on difference method, the total carbohydrate of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples was found to be 16.47 ± 0.40 g/100 g sample. Dietary fiber is the amount of total dietary fiber.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Dietary fiber of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples was found to be 8.54 ± 0.06 g/100 g sample. Ash content is the amount of total mineral residue left after incinerated leaf samples until constant weight.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Ash content of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples was found to be 2.95 ± 0.04 g/100 g sample. Protein, lipid, and carbohydrate each contribute to the total energy composition. Energy of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples was found to be 94.48 ± 1.30 kcal/100 g sample.
