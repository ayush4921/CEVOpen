<p>For anticancer activity of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> ethanolic leaf extract, cell viability was determined using MTT (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) methods[
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with minor modifications. Each human cancer cell line in 198 μl of RPMI 1640 culture medium was incubated with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere at 37°C for 24 h. Either 2 μl of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf extract or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (as negative control) was added and then incubated at 37°C for 48 h. 10 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added, then incubated at 37°C for 4 h, and removed all media. 150 μl of DMSO and 25 μl of glycine (0.1 mol/l) were added, mixed, and then measured absorbance at 540 nm.
