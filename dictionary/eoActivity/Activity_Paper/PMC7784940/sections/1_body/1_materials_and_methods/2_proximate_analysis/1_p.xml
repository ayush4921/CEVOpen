<p>For quantitative determination of proximate composition of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> leaf samples, moisture was determined using hot air oven (Association of Official Analytical Chemists; AOAC 952.08, 2016),[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] dried leaf samples at 105째C, until constant weight. Crude protein was determined according to the Kjeldahl method (AOAC 992.23, 2016);[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] total nitrogen was multiplied by a protein factor of 6.25. Total fat was determined according to the acid hydrolysis method (AOAC 948.15, 2016),[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] using Soxhlet extractor at 60째C, until constant weight. Dietary fiber was determined according to the enzymatic gravimetric method (AOAC 985.29, 2016),[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] digested leaf samples with heat using alpha-amylase, protease, and amyloglucosidase at 60째C, respectively, then added ethanol to samples to precipitate fiber. Ash was determined according to gravimetric method (AOAC 930.30, 2016),[
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] incinerated leaf samples at 550째C, until constant weight. Total carbohydrate was determined according to the difference method by calculation. Energy was determined by calculation based on the contents of carbohydrate, protein, and lipid multiplied by a factor of 4, 4, and 9 respectively, and then added the results together.
