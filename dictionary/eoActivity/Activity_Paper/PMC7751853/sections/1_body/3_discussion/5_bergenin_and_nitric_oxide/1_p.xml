<p>IL-1β, and IFN-γ, are reported to stimulate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which causes NO formation leading to beta cell death. Using Griess reagent, we assessed cellular nitrite production, a surrogate marker for NO. Bergenin has been reported to downregulate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), thereby reducing NO production [
