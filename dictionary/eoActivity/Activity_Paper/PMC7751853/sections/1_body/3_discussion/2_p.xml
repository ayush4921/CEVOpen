<p>Proinflammtory cytokines are reported to infiltrate pancreatic islets at early stage of diabetes leading to beta cell dysfunction and death [

 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In beta cells, IL-1β, INF-γ, and TNF-α simulate intrinsic apoptotic pathway by inducing NFκB, MAPK, and STAT-1 signaling cascades which eventually cause reduction in beta cell mass [

 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Since these cytokines play prominent role in beta cell biology, efforts have been made to identify small molecule suppressors which can prevent cytokine-induced beta cell death. Several studies have identified small molecule inhibitors of cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and as trichostatin A (TSA) [
