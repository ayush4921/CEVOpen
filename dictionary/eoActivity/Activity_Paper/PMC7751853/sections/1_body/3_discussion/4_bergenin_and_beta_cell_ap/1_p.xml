<p>Bergenin was further examined for its effects on different aspects of beta cell biology. We assessed inhibition of caspse-3 activity as a direct indicator of apoptosis. Generally, caspase activity is highly increased in apoptotic cells. Similarly, two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with a cytokine cocktail increased caspase-3 activity; however, this increase in caspase activity was significantly suppressed by the addition of bergenin to the INS-1E cells with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 7.29 Î¼M (
 <xref rid="pone.0241349.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This observation demonstrates for the first time a protective and or beneficial role of bergenin in suppressing beta cell apoptosis. We were also able to demonstrate inhibition of the cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis through flow cytometry analysis.
