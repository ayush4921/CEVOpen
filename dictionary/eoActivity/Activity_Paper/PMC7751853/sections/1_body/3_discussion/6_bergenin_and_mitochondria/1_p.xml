<p>Mitochondrial physiology is also impaired by the adverse effects of cytokines in beta cells. Two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with inflammatory cytokines reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, which was completely restored by the addition of beregnin with an EC

Several studies have reported anioxidant potential of bergenin in the context of lipid peroxidation, hydrogen peroxide, DPPH, and ABTS scavanging assays [

 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our current study, two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with a cytokine cocktail increased ROS production, which was effectively reduced by bergenin with an IC

 <xref rid="pone.0241349.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Mitochondrial membrane potential was also impaired in beta cells by the exposure to the cytokine cocktail; however, addition of bergenin almost completely restored membrane potential with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2.27 μM (
 <xref rid="pone.0241349.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity was reduced by the adverse effects of cytokine cocktail in INS-1E cells, was completely restored by bergenin with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.39 μM (
 <xref rid="pone.0241349.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These effects of bergenin in improving mitochondrial physiology in INS-1E cells in the presence of cytokines are reported for the first time.
