<p>In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that bergenin can inhibit beta cell apoptosis in the presence of cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) and concurrently increased beta cell viability and function (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241349.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Bergenin exhibited potent pharmacological activity and significantly improved i) beta cell viability, ii) restored glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, iii) and improved mitochondrial physiology in INS-1E cells. Bergenin protected beta cells through multiple mechanisms simultaneously. Therefore, it could be of great clinical value for the prevention and treatment of diabetes.
