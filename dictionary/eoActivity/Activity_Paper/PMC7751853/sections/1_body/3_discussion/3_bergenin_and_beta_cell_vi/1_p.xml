<p>The rat insulinoma cell line INS-1E [
 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] was treated with a cytokine cocktail in the presence or absence of bergenin for 48 hr. We employed luciferase-based assay to evaluate the cellular ATP levels, which served as a surrogate marker for beta cell viability [
 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Bergenin significantly increased the cellular ATP levels in the presence of cytokines with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.97 μM (
 <xref rid="pone.0241349.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Bergenin demonstrated antiarthritic activity through inhibition of the inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2) in balb/c mice [

 <italic>Bergenia</italic> rhizome exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> rat models [

 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As bergenin being the main components of alcoholic and methanolic extract of 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> rhizome, we could speculate that bergenin could be responsible, at least in part, for the effects observed with these extracts. Furthermore, bergenin was also reported for anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities, which were due to the inhibition of IL-1β and TNF-α [
