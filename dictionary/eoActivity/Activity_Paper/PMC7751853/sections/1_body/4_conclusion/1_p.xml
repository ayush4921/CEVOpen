<p>The present study shows for the first time that bergenin could be a potentially interesting candidate for the prevention and or treatment of diabetes. In INS-1E cells, bergenin increased beta cell viability, suppressed cytokine-induced beta cell apoptosis, and restored beta cell insulin secretory function. Bergenin protected beta cells through multiple mechanisms simultaneously. The anti-apoptotic effect of bergenin could be due the reduction in caspase-3 activity, NO and ROS production by potentially influencing NF-ÎºB, MAPK, and JAK/STAT pathways. Therefore, it is of great clinical value for the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Due to the complexity of natural products and their mechanisms, the exact targets and mechanisms need to be further explored and verified in isolated pancreatic islets or in animal models of diabetes.</p>
