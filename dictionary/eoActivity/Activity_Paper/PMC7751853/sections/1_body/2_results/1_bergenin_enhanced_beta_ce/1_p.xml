<p>Bergenin is an isocoumarin derivative with five hydoxyl groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241349.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In order to quantify the maximum tolerable concentration of bergenin in experimental assays, INS-1E cells were cultured for 48 hr with bergenin at several concentrations in the absence of cytokines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241349.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). These values were used to determine the maximum tolerable concentration of bergenin in the follow-up assays. In beta cell viability assay, two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with a cytokine cocktail (IL-1β, INF-γ, and TNF-α) resulted in ˃2-fold decrease in cellular ATP levels as compared to untreated controls (
