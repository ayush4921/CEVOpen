<p>Inflammatory cytokines also known to impair mitochondrial physiology, disrupting electron transport chain, leading to beta cell dysfunction. Two-day treatment of INS-1E cells with a cytokine cocktail resulted in ˃2-fold decrease in the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity as compared to the untreated controls (
