<p>Proinflammatory cytokines play prominent roles in beta cell dysfunction, and death. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β,) interferon-γ (INF-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have been employed in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies to mimic the situations which induce pancreatic beta cell death. Moreover, these cytokines have been shown to stimulate JAK-STAT, and NFκB pathways, which later induce intrinsic apoptotic pathway in beta cells. Likewise, both TNF-α, and IL-1β have also been reported to induce nitric oxide (NO) production, which causes the inhibition of electron transport chain, decrease in glucose oxidation rate leading to decrease in ATP generation, and insulin production [

 <xref rid="pone.0241349.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therapeutic interventions currently available to treat diabetes are unable to cease the loss of functional beta cell mass. Therefore, strategies targeting beta cell apoptosis are urgently required. As such, small molecule compounds inhibiting cytokine-induced pancreatic beta cell death, could serve as new drug candidates that may be used in combination with existing therapeutics.
