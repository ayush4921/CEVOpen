<p>For the quantitation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in beta cells, INS-1E cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well (Perkin Elmer, USA). After overnight incubation, 150 μL of fresh RPMI medium containing a combination of cytokines (20 ng/mL IL-1β, 50 ng/mL, IFN-γ, and 50 ng/mL TNF-α) was added to each well. For dose-response studies, bergenin was added at (1–10 μM) concentrations. After 48 hr incubation, INS-1E cells were washed twice with 500 μL glucose-free Krebs-Ringer Bicarbonate buffer (KRB) (118 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>·2(H
 <sub>2</sub>O), 1.0 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>·7(H
 <sub>2</sub>O), 25 mM NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>, and 2.4 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>·2(H
 <sub>2</sub>O). Thereafter, INS-1E cells were incubated in 500 μL of pre-warmed KRB under low (2 mM) and high (16 mM) glucose for 1 hr. The supernatant was taken in a new tube for the measurement of released insulin. To extract cellular insulin content, INS-1E were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (with Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>), followed by the addition of 500 μL of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.3 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM EDTA, cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and PhosStop (Roche, Germany). After three freeze/thaw cycles (−80°C /4°C), INS-1E cells were centrifuged for 20 sec. at 6000*g at room temperature, and supernatant was collected in a new tube for the quantitation of cellular insulin content. We compared the percent of insulin secreted, relative to the insulin content in each well. Insulin was measured using the ultra-sensitive rat insulin ELISA kit (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, USA).
