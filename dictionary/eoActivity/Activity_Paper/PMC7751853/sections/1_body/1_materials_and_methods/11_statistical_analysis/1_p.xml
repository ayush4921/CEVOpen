<p>The EZ-Fit enzyme kinetics was used to calculate the EC
 <sub>50</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. All data were derived from three to twelve independent experiments and presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was analyzed by Student-t test, and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test. The p-value of less than &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant, and indicated with 
 <bold>*</bold>, while p-value &lt;0.01, and &lt;0.001 are marked with 
 <bold>‡</bold> and 
 <bold>§</bold>, respectively.
