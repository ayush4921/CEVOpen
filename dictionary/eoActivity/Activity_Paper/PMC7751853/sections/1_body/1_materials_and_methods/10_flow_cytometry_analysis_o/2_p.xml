<p>INS-1E cells were seeded in 24-well plate (Perkin Elmer, USA) at a concentration of 3 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per well in 200 μL RPMI containing 5% FBS and incubated overnight at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. The following day, the oxidized medium was replaced with the fresh one, and INS-1E cells were treated for 48 hr with a cytokine cocktail (20 ng/mL IL-1β, 50 ng/mL IFN-γ, and 50 ng/mL TNF-α), and bergenin at various concentrations (2–10 μM). The vehicle (DMSO), and positive control (no cytokines) wells were also used in the experiment. After incubation, the INS-1E cells were harvested by trypsinization, and washed twice with 1xPBS followed by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The cell pellet was then suspended in 1 mL of 1x binding buffer (annexin V-FITC/ PI buffer). From this solution, 100 μL of suspension (1 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells) was then transferred to the Eppendorf tubes. We then added 5 μL of fluorescein isothiocianate (FITC) conjugated annexin-V molecules, and 5 μL of propidium iodide (PI = 50 μg/mL) and incubated for 15 minutes in the dark. After incubation, 200 μL of 1X Annexin binding buffer was added in the tube, and mixed gently. The samples were then proceeded for apoptotic analysis on FACS Caliber flow cytometer (USA). Propidium iodide with excitation/emission of 493/636 nm was detected on FL2 channel, while annexin V-FITC with excitation/emission of 494/518 nm was detected on FL1 channel. The analysis was carried out using Cell Quest Pro software. The viable cell populations were in the lower left quadrant (Annexin V
 <sup>-</sup>/PI
 <sup>-</sup>), the cells at the early apoptosis were in the lower right quadrant (Annexin V
 <sup>+</sup>/PI
 <sup>-</sup>), and the ones at the late apoptosis were in the upper right quadrant (Annexin V
 <sup>+</sup>/PI
 <sup>+</sup>). INS-1E cells in each quadrant were expressed as percentage (%) of the total number of stained cells counted.
