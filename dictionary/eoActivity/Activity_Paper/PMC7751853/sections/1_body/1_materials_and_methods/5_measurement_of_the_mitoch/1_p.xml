<p>For the measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential, INS-1E cells were incubated for two days as described for cellular ATP levels assay. After treatment with cytokines and bergenin for 48 hr, 20 μL of 3.25 mM JC-1 was added to each well. After 3 hr incubation at 37°C, the cells were gently washed three times with 150 μL of 1X calcium- and magnesium-free PBS. Fluorescence was measured with SpectraMax 5M
 <sup>e</sup> microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA) at the rhodamine spectra (excitation/emission 530 nm/580 nm), followed by fluorescein (excitation/emission 485 nm/530 nm). The ratio of rhodamine to fluorescein intensity was determined which represents the degree of mitochondrial membrane potential.
