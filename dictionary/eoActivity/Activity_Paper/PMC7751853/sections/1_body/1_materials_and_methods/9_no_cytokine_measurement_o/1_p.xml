<p>A counter screen assay was performed to test the ability of bergenin for the induction of ATP production in the absence of cytokines. INS-1E cells were treated with bergenin at various doses for 48 hr in the absence of cytokine cocktail. INS-1E cells were seeded at 3 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in an opaque, white 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer, USA) in 150 μL of RPMI containing bergenin for two days. After 48 hr incubation, 50 μL of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Luminescence was measured using SpectraMax 5M
 <sup>e</sup> microplate reader (Molecular Devices, USA).
