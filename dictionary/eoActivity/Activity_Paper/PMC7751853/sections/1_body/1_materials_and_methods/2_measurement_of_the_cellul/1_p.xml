<p>We employed quantitation of cellular ATP levels as our primary assay, which served as a surrogate marker for beta cell viability. The CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used to quantify cellular ATP levels in metabolically active cells, which indirectly determine the number of viable cells in the experimental culture medium. Ribonucleotide adenosine triphosphates (rATPs) (Promega) were used for the standard curve. In this study, we prepared a cytokine cocktail (20 ng/mL IL-1β, 50 ng/mL, IFN-γ, and 50 ng/mL TNF-α) to model the events leading to beta cell death as previously described [

 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in white optical 96-well plates (Perkin Elmer, USA). After overnight incubation, the exhausted RPMI medium was removed, and 150 μL of fresh RPMI medium containing a cytokine cocktail was added to each well. Bergenin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0241349.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) was dissolved in DMSO in required dilution. We used 10 μM as a common bergenin concentration in the assays. For dose-response studies, INS-1E cells were treated with bergenin at concentrations from 0.5 to 20 μM. A stock solution of bergenin was diluted in the culture medium. DMSO was added in the medium without bergenin treatment as a vehicle control (these steps were similar for other cell based assays). After 48 hr incubation at 37°C, the RPMI medium was removed, and 50 μL of CellTiter-Glo reagent was added. After 10 min of incubation at room temperature, the luminescence was measured using SpectraMax 5M
