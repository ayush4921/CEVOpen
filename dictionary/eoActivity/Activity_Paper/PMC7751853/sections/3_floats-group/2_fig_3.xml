  <title>Cellular effects of bergenin on mitochondrial physiological parameters of beta cells in the presence of cytokines.</title>
  <p>Effects of bergenin on mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), intracellular ROS production, and mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (MDA) after 48 hr treatment with IL-1β, INF-γ, and TNF-α. For dose-response studies, INS-1E cells were treated with various concentrations of bergenin (0.25–10 μM). The treated INS-1E cells were assessed for their ability to restore mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) (A); to reduce cellular ROS production (B); and to improve mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (C). Data are represented as the mean ± standard deviation of 12 independent wells for A-F. * indicates p &lt;0.05, ‡&lt;0.01, and §&lt;0.001 relative to cytokine-treated cells.</p>
