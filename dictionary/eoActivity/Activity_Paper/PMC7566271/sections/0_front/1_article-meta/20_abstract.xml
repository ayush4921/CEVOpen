  <title>Background and Aim:</title>
  <p>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) causes AIDS-like symptoms in domestic and wild cats. Treatment of infected cats has been performed using human anti-HIV drugs, which showed some limitations. This study aimed to determine the anti-FIV potential of some mushrooms.</p>

  <title>Materials and Methods:</title>
  <p>A total of 17 medicinal and edible mushrooms were screened to find their inhibitory effect against FIV reverse transcriptase (FIV-RT). Three solvents, water, ethanol, and hexane, were used to prepare crude mushroom extracts. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to perform relative inhibition and 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) studies.

  <title>Results:</title>
  <p>The ethanol extract from dried fruiting bodies of 
   <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> showed the strongest inhibition with an IC
   <sub>50</sub> value of 0.80±0.16 μg/mL. The hexane extract from dried mycelium of 
   <italic>I. obliquus</italic> and ethanol and water extracts from fresh fruit bodies of 
   <italic>Phellinus igniarius</italic> also exhibited strong activities with the IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 1.22±0.20, 4.33±0.39, and 6.24±1.42 μg/mL, respectively. The ethanol extract from fresh fruiting bodies of 
   <italic>Cordyceps sinensis</italic>, hexane extracts from dried mycelium of 
   <italic>I. obliquus</italic>, ethanol extracts of 
   <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic>, hexane extracts of fresh fruiting bodies of 
   <italic>Morchella esculenta</italic>, and fresh fruiting bodies of 
   <italic>C. sinensis</italic> showed moderate anti-FIV-RT activities with IC
   <sub>50</sub> values of 29.73±12.39, 49.97±11.86, 65.37±14.14, 77.59±8.31, and 81.41±17.10 μg/mL, respectively. These mushroom extracts show anti-FIV potential.
