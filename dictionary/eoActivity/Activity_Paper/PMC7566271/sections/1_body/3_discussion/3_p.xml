<p>The extracts from 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic> also exhibited strong anti-FIV-RT activity with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.33±0.39 μg/mL and 6.24±1.42 μg/mL for 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic>-EtOH and 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic>-DW, respectively. 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic> is also classified as a medicinal mushroom and is one of the most used mushrooms in Asian folk medicine to treat many diseases, including cancers. Lee 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reported that the water extract of 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic> had antiviral activity against influenza A and B, including pandemic H1N1, human H3N2, avian H9N2, and oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 viruses by blocking virus attachment to the cell surface receptor. Lee 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also speculated that its polysaccharides might be responsible for the antiviral activity as they are the main components of the mushroom extracts [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The water extract of 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic> also showed anti-HSV-1 activity in Vero cells [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The study of the chemical composition revealed that the mushroom contains hispidin, which showed anti-influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2 and anti-HIV-1 integrase activity. Hispidin is of interest to use in drug discovery [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Again, it is necessary that further studies be performed to evaluate the effect of hispidin on FIV-RT activity and search for novel active compounds against FIV-RT.
