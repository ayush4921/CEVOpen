<p>A total of 17 medicinal and edible mushrooms widely distributed in Thailand were chosen to screen for anti-FIV-RT activity. Comparison of the inhibition potentials of these mushrooms against FIV-RT revealed that the ethanol extract from dried fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> showed the strongest inhibition activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.80±0.16 μg/mL. The hexane extract from dried mycelium of 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> and ethanol and water extracts from fresh fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>P. igniarius</italic> also exhibited strong activities with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.22±0.20, 4.33±0.39, and 6.24±1.42 μg/mL, respectively. The ethanol extract from fresh fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>, hexane extract from dried mycelium of 
 <italic>I. obliquus</italic> and fresh fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic>, and the hexane extract of fresh fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>M. esculenta</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> showed moderate anti-FIV-RT activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 29.73±12.39, 49.97±11.86, 65.37±14.14, 77.59±8.31, and 81.41±17.10 μg/mL, respectively. These mushroom extracts show anti-FIV potential. However, further study is required to identify the specific constituents responsible for anti-FIV-RT activity and their mechanism of action. In addition, the studies on the immune effect and interaction between mushroom extracts and anti-FIV drug candidates are also required for its clinical application.
