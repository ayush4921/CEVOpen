<p>Recently, researchers have become interested in using mushrooms as a source of biologically active compounds for medical uses such as anticancer, antiviral, immunomodulating, as well as hepatoprotective agents [

 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hispolon, a bioactive compound isolated from 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic>, was found to be a potential anti-oral cancer. It could suppress cell proliferation of human epidermoid KB cell with a 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) value of 4.62±0.16 μg/mL [

 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> showed anti-HIV-1 activity by inhibiting HIV-1-induced cytopathic effects and HIV-1 protease [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. β-Glucan from 
 <italic>Grifola frondosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Lentinus lepideus</italic> showed immunomodulating activities such as promoting mouse bone marrow cell growth and differentiating and increasing the number of granulocytes and myeloid progenitors [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The crude extracts from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Lentinula edodes</italic> can reduce the level of serum transaminases, which were produced from injured liver cells from paracetamol [
