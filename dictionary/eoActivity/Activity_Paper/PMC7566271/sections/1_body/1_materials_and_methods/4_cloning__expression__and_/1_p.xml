<p>The amino acid sequence of FIV-RT from PDB ID 5OVN was used to design its corresponding DNA sequence. As FIV-RT is a heterodimeric protein containing p66 and p51 subunits in which p51 is produced from proteolytic processing of p66, the amino acid sequence of p66 was used to generate the DNA sequence by submitting to the GenScript Express Gene Synthesis Service (GenScript, USA). Codon optimization was also performed to ensure high-protein expression in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The 
 <italic>fiv-rt</italic> gene was synthesized and cloned into pET15b at 
 <italic>Nde</italic>I and 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I restriction sites and the new recombinant plasmid was named pET15b_FIV-RTp66. For cloning of p51, the primers were designed with 
 <italic>Nde</italic>I and 
 <italic>Xho</italic>I restriction sites, and pET15b_FIV-RTp66 was used as a template. PCR reaction was performed with 5´ATTCATATGGCGCAGATTAGCG3´ forward primer and 5´ATCTCGAGTTATTTAATGTTCAGCG3´ reverse primer. The DNA fragment of p51 was also cloned into the pColdI vector at the same restriction sites. The recombinant plasmids containing 
 <italic>fiv-rtp51</italic> genes were named pClodI_FIV-RTp51. Each plasmid was individually transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α and BL21 (DE3) for maintaining DNA stock and protein expression, respectively. The FIV-RT subunits p51 and p66 were individually expressed in 1 L of LB broth containing 0.5 mM IPTG at 180 rpm, 16°C for 16-18 h. Then, the induced cells were harvested and pooled together before subjecting to protein purification using ultrasonication for cell lysis and using Ni-Sepharose and Resource S cation exchange chromatography for protein purification [
