<p>EnzChek® reverse transcriptase assay kit (Molecular Probes, USA) was used in this study. The relative inhibition assay was performed using fluorescence spectroscopy as previously described [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Briefly, 2 μL of 10 mg/mL crude mushroom extract was added into each well of a 384-well plate containing 13 μL RT reaction buffer (50 mM TE pH 7.6, 2 mM DTT, 20% glycerol). Then, 5 μL of 50 nM purified recombinant wild-type FIV-RT was added into each well. The reaction was started by adding 5 μL of 1:400 primer/template substrate. The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 30 min and was stopped by adding 5 μL 0.2 M EDTA. After that, 40 μL of 1:700 Picogreen was added to the stopped reaction. The reaction was then incubated in the dark for 5 min and fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm. EFV was used instead of the mushroom extract for the positive control reaction. The reaction without inhibitor was used as a negative control. The relative inhibition was calculated using the formula: Relative inhibition (%) = [(FI
 <sub>P</sub>−FI
 <sub>S</sub>) × 100]/FI
 <sub>P</sub>, where FI
 <sub>P</sub> and FI
 <sub>S</sub> were fluorescence intensities of the positive control and mushroom reactions, respectively. Three independent experiments were performed. Mushrooms which showed relative inhibition higher than 70% were chosen for further IC
 <sub>50</sub> assays.
