 <italic>Pleurotus sajor-caju</italic>, 
 <italic>Pleurotus eryngii</italic>, 
 <italic>Phellinus igniarius</italic>, and 
 <italic>Tremella fuciformis</italic> were collected from local markets in Thailand. The fruiting bodies or mycelia were cut into small pieces, ground, and lyophilized for 2 days. Then, the dried small pieces of mushrooms were ground into powder and divided into three parts. Each part was extracted with each solvent, distilled water (DW), and 99.5% ethanol and hexane. Ethanol and hexane extractions were carried out by incubating at 37°C in a shaker at 180 rpm overnight, while the DW extraction was performed at 25°C overnight in a shaker at the same rpm. After that, all crude extracts were filtered through Whatman no.1 filters and centrifuged at 7000 rpm, 4°C for 15 min to remove precipitate. The ethanol and hexane solvents were removed using a hot air oven at 80°C, and the DW was removed by lyophilization. The mushroom powder was redissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 100 mg/mL. The crude extracts were kept at −20°C until used.
