<p>To determine whether the purified recombinant wild-type FIV-RT was active or not, the activity of the enzyme was tested using the EnzCheckÂ® Reverse Transcriptase Assay Kit. The different concentrations of the enzyme were reacted with substrate as described in the relative inhibition assay. The results showed that enzyme concentrations up to 15 nM were linearly proportional to relative fluorescence unit. Thus, the enzyme concentration at 10 nM was used in the subsequent experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure-2</xref>). The relative inhibition of FIV-RT by crude mushroom extracts was performed by incubating 0.8 mg/mL of each mushroom extract with 10 nM purified recombinant wild-type FIV-RT. Crude mushrooms extracts showed various inhibition activities against FIV-RT (
