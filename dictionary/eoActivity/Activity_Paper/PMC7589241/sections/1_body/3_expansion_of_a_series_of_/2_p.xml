<p>A reaction array of 220 reactions was executed based on all combinations of ten substrates (
 <bold>D1</bold>–
 <bold>D10</bold>; plus no substrate) and nineteen co‐substrates (
 <bold>E1</bold>–
 <bold>E19</bold>; plus no co‐substrate; see Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c for conditions). The components were chosen to offer the possibility that multiple products might be formed, and to explore a diverse range of substitution patterns. After 48 h, the reactions mixtures were filtered through silica, evaporated, and screened against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC29213 at a total product concentration of 50 μM (Figure
