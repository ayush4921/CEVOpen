<p>In subsequent rounds, the co‐substrates used were inspired by the productive co‐substrates from the previous round, and screening was performed at increasingly low total product concentration (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, middle and right). In round 2, reactions of the diazo substrate 
 <bold>B1</bold> with dihydropyran (
 <bold>C1a</bold>), dihydronaphthalene (
 <bold>C1b</bold>) or indene (
 <bold>C1c</bold>) were found to be productive; whilst, in round 3, reactions of 
 <bold>B1</bold> with the substituted dihydropyran 
 <bold>C1a’</bold> or the chromene 
 <bold>C1b’</bold> were identified.
