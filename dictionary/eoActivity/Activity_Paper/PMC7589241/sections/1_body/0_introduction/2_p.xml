<p>Activity‐directed synthesis (ADS) is a structure‐blind, function‐driven approach in which active compounds emerge in parallel with an associated synthetic route (Figure

 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> In ADS, reactions that have the potential to yield multiple possible products are deliberately exploited. Arrays of reactions are performed on a microscale (typically ∼10 μmol), and the resulting crude product mixtures are directly screened for biological function. A crucial step is to show that none of the individual components display activity in the screening assay. The reaction arrays may be assembled from stock solutions of components (e. g., substrates, co‐substrates, catalysts, solvents), typically using multi‐channel pipettes, via processes that are amenable to automation. After minimal work‐up, such as scavenging to remove metals, the crude product mixtures are diluted and screened for biological function. Here, as multiple products may be formed, screening is performed at a specific total concentration of the products formed from the limiting substrate. Hit reactions that yield bioactive products are thereby identified and can inform the design of subsequent reaction arrays. In subsequent rounds of ADS, screening may be performed at lower total product concentration in order to drive the emergence of reactions that yield more active product mixtures. Finally, the hit reactions are scaled up, and the responsible bioactive products are purified, structurally elucidated and characterised.
