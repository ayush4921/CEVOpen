<p>In this Concept, we describe the reported applications of ADS that have led to the discovery of bioactive small molecules. We note the range of reaction classes and assay formats that have been used to underpin ADS. In each case, it is explained how ADS was exploited to realise alternative medicinal chemistry strategies. We discuss the value of the approach to allow diverse chemical space to be explored to yield distinctive starting points for molecular discovery. Finally, we comment on the future challenges that would need to be addressed in order for ADS to become a mainstream lead generation approach.</p>
