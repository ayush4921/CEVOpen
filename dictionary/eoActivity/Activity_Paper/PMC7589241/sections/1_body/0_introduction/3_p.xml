<p>To allow exploration of diverse chemical space by ADS, it is important to harness reactions that have multiple (and diverse) possible outcomes. Here, the selection of underpinning chemistry contrasts starkly with that for conventional discovery workflows in which reactions that yield specific, designed molecules are preferred. Metal‐carbenoid chemistry has many of attributes that are required to underpin ADS.
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> First, the diazo substrates can undergo many different types of reaction (e. g., O−H, N−H and C−H insertion; cyclopropanation; ylid formation) in either an inter‐ or an intramolecular sense. Second, the distribution of alternative products can often be tuned through variation of the metal catalyst. Such chemistry might therefore enable diverse chemical space to be explored, and the synthesis of bioactive chemotypes to be optimised.
