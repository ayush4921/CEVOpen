<p>It may also be possible to harness late‐stage functionalisations to enable activity‐directed tuning of the potency, selectivity and/or molecular properties of ligands; recent advances in photoredox catalysis

Additionally, we note the potential of other ligand‐directed synthetic approaches (in addition to those outlined in this Concept article) to explore in parallel small molecules based on multiple scaffolds.
