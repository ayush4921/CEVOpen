<p>Finally, we believe that ADS has the potential to enable the autonomous discovery of bioactive small molecules. All stages of the workflow are performed in parallel and are amenable to integration and automation. Although human‚Äêdriven to date, it may be possible to develop algorithms to design reaction arrays that enable diverse, yet relevant, chemical space to be explored autonomously.</p>
