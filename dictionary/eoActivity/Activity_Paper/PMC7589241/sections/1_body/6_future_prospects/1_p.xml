<p>ADS has the potential to become a mainstream lead discovery approach. It is highly general, requiring only access to a suitably robust high‐throughput assay. To date, substrate design has been informed by known ligands, for example by deconstruction of known inhibitors or harnessing the structures of fragment hits. However, exploiting larger, target‐agnostic reaction arrays, it may also be possible to discover wholly novel chemotypes. To manage the size of initial reaction arrays based on each reaction, whilst enabling diverse chemical space to be explored, we envisage that selected combinations of fragment‐sized substrates (perhaps chosen from &lt;100 diverse alternatives) might be explored.</p>
