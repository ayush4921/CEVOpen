<p>After 24 h, the reactions were scavenged, evaporated, dissolved in DMSO and screened in duplicate at a total product concentration of 20 μM using an established fluorescence anisotropy (FA) assay (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, left). Significant bioactivity was identified in the products of reactions with the diazo substrates 
 <bold>F2</bold>, 
 <bold>F3</bold> and 
 <bold>F4</bold>. In the case of 
 <bold>F3</bold>, activity was observed for reactions with or without a co‐substrate, suggesting that 
 <bold>F3</bold> alone might yield bioactive product(s); the Rh

 <sub>4</sub>‐catalysed reaction of 
 <bold>F3</bold> was shown to yield both 
 <bold>16</bold> and 
 <bold>17</bold> (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, left). LC/MS of three hit reactions involving 
 <bold>F2</bold> and 
 <bold>F4</bold> confirmed the formation of intermolecular reaction products in each case.
