<p>The use of metal carbenoid chemistry to link substrates containing substituents with the potential to mimic p53 hot spot residues enabled four distinct and novel series of p53/
 <italic>h</italic>dm2 inhibitors to be discovered in parallel. It was concluded that 
 <bold>17</bold>, 
 <bold>18</bold>, 
 <bold>19</bold> and 
 <bold>20</bold> all contain pairs of substituents that target two hot spots. These ligands are highly dissimilar to each other, and to all ligands in ChEMBL with annotated activity against 
 <italic>h</italic>DM2. Here, ADS enabled experimental scaffold‐hopping, resulting in the discovery of ligands in which common fragments were displayed in the context of alternative scaffolds. PPIs generally do not have defined small‐molecule binding sites, yet ADS was shown to identify distinctive starting points for the discovery of PPI inhibitors.
