<p>Reactions with significant bioactivity from both rounds were scaled up 50‐fold, and the products purified and structurally elucidated. Products were identified from a range of reaction types (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b): intramolecular insertion into an aryl C−H bond (→
 <bold>16</bold>); insertion into an O−H bond (→
 <bold>18</bold>); cyclopropanation (→
 <bold>19</bold>); and insertion into an indoyl C−H bond (e. g., →
 <bold>20</bold>). The activity of the purified products was evaluated in the fluorescence anisotropy assay and were further validated as
