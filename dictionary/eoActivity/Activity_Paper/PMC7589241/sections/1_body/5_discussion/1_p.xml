<p>The above case studies showcase ADS as an efficient approach for the discovery of novel bioactive small molecules. ADS requires a robust high‐throughput assay, and both target‐oriented and phenotypic assays have been shown to be suitable (Table 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although over 200 reactions were conducted in each case, only a few reactions (typically &lt;10) needed to be scaled up and the products purified and structurally elucidated. ADS thus focuses resources on reactions that yield bioactive products.
