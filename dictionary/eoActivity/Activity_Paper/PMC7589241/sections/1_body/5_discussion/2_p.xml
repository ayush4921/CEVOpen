<p>Retrospective analyses have provided insights into the mechanism of evolution of activity‐directed syntheses. The yield of the most active component may be optimised in an ADS workflow: for example, the yield of the AR partial agonist 
 <bold>3</bold> increased significantly when a new catalyst was introduced.
