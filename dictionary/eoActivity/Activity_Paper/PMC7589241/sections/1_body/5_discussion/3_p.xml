<p>The use of a promiscuous, yet tuneable, reaction toolkit allows multiple diverse, yet synthetically accessible, chemotypes to be explored in parallel. This contrasts with overwhelming medicinal chemistry practice in which 
 <italic>perceived</italic> synthetic accessibility tends to influence which molecules are prioritised for synthesis. In several cases, retrospective analysis showed that other chemotypes had been explored in ADS reaction arrays: for example, intramolecular insertion into an aryl Câˆ’H bond in substrates similar to 
 <bold>A3</bold> gave oxindoles rather than lactams as products.
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> These alternative chemotypes were not taken forward because other reactions had resulted in more active product mixtures.
