<p>In round 2, six diazo substrates were exploited: the four substrates identified in round 1, and two additional substrates (
 <bold>A11</bold> and 
 <bold>A12</bold>) that had not yielded bioactive products. The six substrates were each treated with a metal catalyst (8 alternatives) in a specific solvent (4 alternatives). The crude product mixtures were scavenged and evaporated as before, and screened at tenfold lower concentration (total product concentration: 1 μM; Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc202000524-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, middle). It was observed that the most active product mixtures stemmed from two of the substrates (
 <bold>A1</bold> and 
 <bold>A3</bold>) in combination with dirhodium carboxylate catalysts.
