  <bold>Parallel discovery</bold> of diverse bioactive small molecules for a range of targets: Activity‐directed synthesis has enabled a range of medicinal chemistry strategies to be realised, including scaffold constraint; fragment‐based discovery; expansion of a series of ligands; and scaffold hopping. Future scientific challenges, and the prospects of activity‐directed synthesis becoming a mainstream lead generation approach, are discussed.
