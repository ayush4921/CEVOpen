  <p>Overview of activity‐directed synthesis. Designed reaction arrays harness combinations of alternative components (such substrates, co‐substrates, catalysts and solvents). The crude reaction products are directly screened for biological function, and the identified hit reactions inform the design of subsequent reaction arrays. Finally, the most promising hit reactions are scaled up, and the products are purified, structurally elucidated and characterised.</p>
