 <italic>Mesona chinensis</italic>, belonging to the Labiatae family, is an importante conomic and medicinal plants, widely distroibuted in Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, has the effects of antioxidation and hypolipidemic (Lin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). In this study, the structural characteristics of cp genome of 
 <italic>M. chinensis</italic> were described, which provides an important basis for further study. Firstly, fresh leaves of 
 <italic>M. chinensis</italic> were collected from Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Guangzhou, China). Then, the genomic DNA was extracted using plant genomic DNA kit (Omega), which was strored at Key Laboratory for Crops Genetic Improvement of Guangdong in Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (specimen code Lfc2019) and seuquenced on the Novaseq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Finally, we assembled and annotated the cp genome by GetOrganelle and Geseq, respectively (Tillich et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Jin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
