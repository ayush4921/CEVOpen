<p>The size of the cp genome was 152,547 bp, with 37.89% GC content, exhibited a typical quadripartite structure, consisted of a pair of IR regions (25,670 bp) separated by LSC region of 83,482 bp and SSC region of 17,725 bp (GenBank assession number MT328397.1). Total of 131 functional genes were predicted, including 86 protein-coding genes, 37 tRNA genes and 8 rRNA genes. The phylogenetic relationship of 
 <italic>M. chinensis</italic> was constructed with the complete chloroplast genomes of other 26 species using maximum likelihood method by RaxML software (Stamatakis 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>, the position of 
 <italic>M. chinensis</italic> was closely to 
 <italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic> with a bootstrap of 100%. The characterized cp genome sequence of 
 <italic>M. chinensis</italic> will be facilitate future research on molecular breeding and genetic engineering.
