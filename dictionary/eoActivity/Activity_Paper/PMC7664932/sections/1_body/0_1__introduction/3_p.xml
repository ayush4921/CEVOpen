 <italic>Calotropis procera</italic> (Aiton) W.T. Aiton (Family Apocynaceae) is known as Sodomâ€™s apple. It is a widely distributed plant worldwide, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas. It is a native tree to northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, and southern Asia. Additionally, it is considered a weed in several habitats such as roadsides, waste areas, near watercourses, disturbed sites, open woodlands, sand dunes, grasslands, and pastures [

 <italic>Calotropis procera</italic> is used excessively in folk medicines for the treatment of cold, fever, leprosy, asthma, rheumatism, eczema, indigestion, diarrhea, elephantiasis, skin diseases, and dysentery [

 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Several pharmacological activities were documented for different extracts of 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, gastroprotective, cardiovascular, antipyretic, antioxidant, anthelmintic, anti-angiogenic, hypolipidemic, antimicrobial, analgesic, and anticonvulsant [

 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Due to the high biological impacts of this plant, many studies identified the presence of several metabolites such as flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, saponins, alkaloids, steroids, and cardenolides [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Additionally, the EO of this plant was studied for Indian [

 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, no study explored the variation of the EO of this tree with different climatic and environmental conditions. Many studies have proposed that the chemical composition either in quality or quantity is substantially affected by the variation in the climatic and environmental conditions [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, the present work aimed to, (i) study the comparative chemical profiles of the EOs of 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> collected samples from Saudi Arabia and Egypt, as well as with the other reported ecospecies, (ii) assess the phytotoxic effects of EOs of both samples on the weeds 
 <italic>Bidens pilosa</italic> L. and 
 <italic>Dactyloctenium aegyptium</italic> (L.) Willd., and (iii) evaluate antimicrobial activities of EOs against some bacterial and fungal strains.
