<p>The EOs from Egyptian and Saudi ecospecies of 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> showed remarkable variation both in the number and quantity of the compound. This variation could be ascribed to the variation in the climatic, topographic, edaphic, or genetic differences. The EO of Saudi ecospecies comprised of 76 chemical compounds with hinesol, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate, 1,4-
 <italic>trans</italic>-1,7-
 <italic>cis</italic>-acorenone, phytol, and Myristicin as major compounds, while the Egyptian ecospecies contained 33 compounds with a dominance of phytol, 
 <italic>n</italic>-docosane, linoleic acid, 
 <italic>n</italic>-pentacosane, and bicyclogermacrene as major constituents. The EOs of both ecospecies had potent phytotoxic activity against the two tested weeds (
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> and 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic>), while the EO of the Egyptian ecospecies was more effective, particularly on the weed 
 <italic>D. aegyptium</italic>. Therefore, the EO of this plant could be a promising eco-friendly bioherbicide against weeds, particularly this tree is widely grown as a weed in arid habitats. Due to the allelopathic activity of the identified compounds are still poorly understood, further study is recommended for the characterization of authentic materials of the major compounds. Moreover, evaluating their activity at the field scale, modes of action, and biosafety are required. On the other hand, the EOs showed potent antimicrobial activity that supported their leading role for antimicrobial drugs.
