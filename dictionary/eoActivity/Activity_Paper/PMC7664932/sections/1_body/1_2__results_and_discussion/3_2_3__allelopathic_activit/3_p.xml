<p>Based on the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, it was observed that the EO of Egyptian ecospecies showed more phytotoxic activity on 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> than Saudi ecospecies. The Egyptian ecospecies attained an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 48.6, 18.7, and 2.3 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup> for germination, seedling shoot growth, and seedling root growth, respectively, while the Saudi ecospecies showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 70.9, 32.9, and 5.9 µL L
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05203-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The potency of the EO from Egyptian ecospecies on the germination, seedling shoot growth, and seedling root growth of 
 <italic>B. pilosa</italic> were ≈ 1.5–1.8, and 2.5-fold of Saudi ecospecies.
