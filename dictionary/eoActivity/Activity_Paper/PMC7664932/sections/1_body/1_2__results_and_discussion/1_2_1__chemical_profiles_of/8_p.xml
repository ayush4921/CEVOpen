<p>In contrast, the EO of Egyptian plant was found to contain 44.82% of diterpenes out of the overall constituents with an abundance of oxygenated diterpenes (43.92%) in addition to traces of diterpene hydrocarbons (0.90%). The oxygenated diterpenes were represented by only three compounds, phytol (38.02%), isophytol (2.66%), and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-geranyl geraniol (3.24%). The plants that are characterized by the preponderance of diterpenes are very rare in the plant kingdom [

 <italic>C. procera</italic>, in which the diterpenes were reported as main compounds, particularly 
 <italic>E</italic>-phytol [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, the present data were inconsistent with the profile of Indian 
 <italic>C. gigantea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in which the diterpenes were completely absent. From the EO chemical profile of the Egyptian 
 <italic>C. procera</italic>, it can be concluded that this plant is a very specific plant due to its ability to biosynthesize diterpenes, especially phytol.
