<p>The EOs extracted hydrodistillation from both Saudi and Egyptian ecospecies of 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> collected are yellow-colored with a quantity of 0.046% and 0.029% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>), respectively. Quantity variation of the EOs between the two plant samples might be attributed to the effects of environmental factors such as habitat, salinity, temperature, altitude, seasonality, plant age and development, and water availability [

 <italic>C. procera</italic> samples (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05203-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). From these compounds, 76 were detected in the Saudi sample while 33 were recorded in the Egyptian sample. In addition to the variations in the yield of the oil of the two plant samples, the GC-MS exhibited substantial qualitative variation, whereas the Saudi sample was very rich in compounds compared to the Egyptian one. This significant variation could be attributed to the variation in habitat, temperature, altitude, and soil conditions [
