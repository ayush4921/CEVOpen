<p>The monoterpenes in EO of Saudi 
 <italic>C. procera</italic> represented remarkable concentration (16.48%). The oxygenated monoterpenes, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate (12.33%), and camphor (1.50%) were found as the main compounds, while 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-cyclocitral (0.15%) was detected as a minor compound (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05203-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In contrast to the Saudi plant, the monoterpene was found as minor constituents of EO from the Egyptian plant, comprising only three identified oxygenated monoterpenes. Among all the identified oxygenated monoterpenes, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-chrysanthenyl acetate (1.09%) was found as the major compound, while eucalyptol (0.21%) represented a minor one. Monoterpenes were found as main components of EOs derived from several aromatic plants and herbs such as

 <italic>Calotropis</italic> species, monoterpenes were characterized as main compounds in EOs derived from Indian 
 <italic>C. gigantea</italic> [

 <italic>C. procera</italic> collected from the Egyptian delta [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05203" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], in which the monoterpenes represented low concentrations.
