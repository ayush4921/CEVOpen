<p>NO is an important chemical mediator involved in the regulation of various physiological processes. NO or RNS (reactive nitrogen species) formed during their reaction with oxygen or with superoxides, such as NO
 <sub>2</sub>, N
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, and N
 <sub>3</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> which are very reactive and are responsible for altering the structural and functional behavior of many cellular components [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Scavengers of nitric oxide compete with oxygen leading to reduced production of nitrite ions [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Among the plant extract under study, the root extract of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> showed the NO scavenging activity by 31% at 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml and other extracts showed less activity. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of both the plant samples had shown similar value to that of the standard drug, curcumin, which is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The ability of the extract to generate the nitrite in decreased amount may be due to the capacity to decompose the sodium nitroprusside in vitro due to the presence of different phytoconstituents mainly phenolic compounds such as flavonoids responsible to scavenge the free radical by competing with the oxygen molecule of NO free radical, thus leading to antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This activity was comparatively lower than that observed in water and carbinol extract of leaves of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> in previous studies [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] whereas ethanolic leaves extract of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> showed less activity in this study. This may be due to the solvent effect.
