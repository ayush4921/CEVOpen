<p>In NO scavenging assay, incubation of solutions of sodium nitroprusside in phosphate buffer saline at 250°C for 2.5 hr resulted in a linear time-dependent nitrite production [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The quantities of NO produced is determined using Griess reagent by the development of purple to pink color during the diazotization of nitrite with sulfanilamide and its subsequent coupling with NEDD. The absorbance is observed at 548 nm on UV spectrophotometer [
