<p>The NO scavenging activity of different plant extracts was determined by using Griess reagent. Sodium nitroprusside was used as nitric oxide-producing agent. The root and stem of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> and leaves of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> had shown NO scavenging activity at higher concentrations (100 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml), i.e., 31% and 21% and 22%, respectively. The root, stem, and leaves extracts of 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> had shown IC
 <sub>50</sub> value as slightly higher than that of standard drug curcumin as 0.23 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml, 0.32 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml, and 0.58 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Similarly, the extract of 
 <italic>R. indica</italic> had also exhibited higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> value to that of standard, which is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and
