<p>Out of two plant species, 
 <italic>M. rubicaulis</italic> had shown antibacterial activity towards 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, but antioxidant activity was shown by both plant species. Antibacterial and antioxidant activities found in plant species might help in formulation development which could be marketed as antibacterial and wound-healing agents in future days.
