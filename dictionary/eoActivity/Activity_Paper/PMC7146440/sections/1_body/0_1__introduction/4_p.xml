<p>A literature review of the anti-cancer properties of 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> was performed using Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Articles, published in English, where an in vitro and/or in vivo approach was implemented to investigate the anti-cancer properties of 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> extracts, were included. Due to extensive fungal species misidentification [
 <xref rid="B8-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], taxonomy and means of accurate identification of 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> were also explored. Search terms included “
 <italic>Fomitopsis pinicola</italic>”+ “cancer” + “in vivo.” Thereafter “anti-inflammatory” was substituted for “cancer”, and an additional article was returned. In a similar manner “in vitro” was substituted for “in vivo”, and “
 <italic>Fomitopsis pinicola</italic>” + “taxonomy” were also searched. Pearly growing was implemented. This article is not a systematic review and, together with the implementation of pearly growing, it was decided not to include numbers and justification for article inclusion and exclusion.
