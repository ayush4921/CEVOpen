<p>The most obvious limitation of this review is the lack of certainty surrounding the identity of the specimens used in the studies we discuss. For example, Gao et al. 2017 state that 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> is traditionally categorized as Reishi [
 <xref rid="B19-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], yet Reishi is identified as 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (Lingzhi) [
 <xref rid="B28-nutrients-12-00609" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is therefore unclear as to whether Gao et al. studied 
 <italic>G. lucidum</italic> or 
 <italic>F. pinicola</italic> and the method of species identification is not stated.
