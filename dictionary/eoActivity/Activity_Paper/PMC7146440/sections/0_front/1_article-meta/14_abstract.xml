  <italic>Fomitopsis pinicola</italic> (Sw. Karst) is a common bracket fungus, with a woody texture. It is found predominantly in coniferous forests in temperate regions throughout Europe and Asia. 
  <italic>Fomitopsis pinicola</italic> has been extensively used for medicinal purposes, particularly in Chinese and Korean traditional medicine. In this mini-review, the anti-cancer characteristics of 
  <italic>F. pinicola</italic> extracts were investigated. In vitro experiments revealed the pro-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of extracts, whilst two of three in vivo studies reported an inhibition of tumour growth and prolonged survival. Only studies wherein fungal specimens were sourced from Europe or Asia were included in this review, as samples sourced as 
  <italic>F. pinicola</italic> from North America were probably not 
  <italic>F. pinicola</italic>, but a different species. Although not one of the most revered fungal species, 
  <italic>F. pinicola</italic> has been used as a medicinal fungus for centuries, as well as consumed as a health food supplement. To date, the results from only three in vivo studies, investigating anti-cancer properties, have been published. Further studies, using comprehensively identified specimens, are required to fully elucidate the anti-cancer properties of 
  <italic>F. pinicola</italic> extracts.
