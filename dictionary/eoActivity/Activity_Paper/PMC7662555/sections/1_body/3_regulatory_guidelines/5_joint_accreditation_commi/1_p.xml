<p>CAR-T cell production and clinical management have peculiar characteristics that can be associated with HSCT; therefore in most of the Countries in EU the Regulatory Agencies have identified that their administration should occur in a Bone Marrow transplant Unit. This activity is regulated by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy-Joint Accreditation Committee of the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) and the European Group for Blood and BMT (FACT-JACIE). The European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) implemented the FACT-JACIE international standards for HSCT programs including specific requirements for CAR-T cell preparation and treatment, intended as guidelines for the usage of this novel therapeutic approach (“
 <italic>The Joint Accreditation Committee ISCT-Europe &amp; EBMT (JACIE) is Europe’s only official accreditation body in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and cellular therapy. It promotes high-quality patient care and medical and laboratory practice through a professional-driven and voluntary accreditation scheme</italic>”. JACIE has developed quality standards to evaluate the quality level of the transplant programs in all the phases, including the collection of stem cells, the activities of cell processing, and the infusion in patients. The latest version of the JACIE Standard included the accreditation for the administration to patients of Immune Effector Cells (IEC), including CAR-T cells. It is important to note that the JACIE standard is limited to the qualification of centers dedicated to the 
 <italic>stem cell transplant programs</italic> and for this reason only CAR-T products connected to the stem cell unit and utilized for the treatment of hematological malignancies are included. CAR-T cell products for the treatment of solid tumors are not included, and this can generate controversies in the organization of clinical centers for the CAR-T cell therapy of this type of tumors. According to the JACIE standards, the requirements to apply for the CAR-T products are the following:
