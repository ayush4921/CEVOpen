<p>CAR-T cell therapies are included in the category of ATMPs within the definition of gene therapy medicinal product. According to the Committee for Advanced Therapy, the CAR-T Product is an ATMP product: “
 <italic>products consisting of cells or tissues may scientifically be at the border between Tissues and Cells directive (Directive 2004/23/EC) and the ATMP regulation”</italic>. The classification of an ATMP as a biological product determines a wider regulatory framework and the subsequent requirements for the development and the marketing authorization. These need to be considered in association with the specific framework for ATMPs, 
 <italic>Regulation 1394/2007/EC</italic>, which was approved on December 30, 2008: “
 <italic>ATMP are authorized centrally through the European Medicine Agency (EMA). They benefit from a single evaluation and authorization procedure. EMA continues to monitor the safety and efficacy of ATMPs following their approval and commercialization. This Agency also provides scientific support to the developers of these products in the design of pharmacovigilance and risk management systems to monitor the safety of these medicines</italic>”. This regulation provides the overall framework on ATMPs for those products, which are intended to be placed in the market of EU Member States. In addition, 
 <italic>Directive 2009/120/EC</italic> updated the definitions and detailed scientific and technical requirements for advanced therapies. ATMPs are regulated by both guidelines of medicinal products and that of medical devices. On the 25th of May 2017, two additional regulations on medical devices were identified (
 <italic>European Commission, 2017a</italic>). For the development of advanced therapies in EU, the development and approval of clinical trials are in charge of the individual national competent authorities. However, for marketing authorization, all ATMPs are evaluated through centralized procedures ensuring that they benefit from a single evaluation and authorization across EU. Two committees are responsible for the scientific evaluation and approval of ATMPs: the CAT and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) (European Medicines Agency, 2018a). The CAT is the EMA committee responsible for classifying, assessing the quality, safety, efficacy of ATMP, in order to follow the scientific progress in the field and to provide an opinion on each ATMP application submitted to the EMA, supporting the final decision by the CHMP.
