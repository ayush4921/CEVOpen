<p>The organizational and regulatory aspects of CAR-T cell clinical center represent novel and challenging topic within a rapidly evolving field. These involve different clinical expertise and departments, regulatory and quality management, laboratory dedicated to the tissue collection, processing and storage, and the accurate and timely coordination of logistics. The complexity of this organization requires personnel with specific background and continuous interactions and coordination among them. This manuscript aims at addressing the clinical, regulatory, and organizational requirements of clinical centers, including hematological and oncological departments, dedicated to CAR-T cell therapies called CAR-T Unit. In this review a model of CAR-T Unit is proposed, as well as the need of a new figure called “CAR-T specialist”. The connection between the CAR-T Unit and the involved facilities, either within the clinical centers (

 <italic>e.g.</italic>, pharma companies, clinical research organizations) is also described.
