<p>CAR-T cell therapies have been classified in the regulatory category of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) under the definition of a gene therapy medicinal product, although they represent cellular therapies. To assure the reliability and safety of this type of therapy, it is important to define the optimal conditions of administration to patients. Therefore, an organizational structure with accreditation path needs to be identified. In 2009, a specialized committee was created by the EMA, the Committee for Advanced Therapies (CAT) (Regulation (EC) No. 1394/2007of the European Parliament and of the Council of November 13, 2007), aimed at providing opinion on the quality, safety, and efficacy of studies utilizing CAR-T cells. Details of the structure, experience, and regulatory requirements of clinical centers where CAR-T cell therapy can be administered are discussed in the text below. The initial indication has been established for the hematology field, for which approved medicinal products are available. To guarantee the safety of patients, the requirements for CAR-T cells centers have been identified as similar to those for early-phase clinical trials for novel immune therapies, with the designation of clinical centers with documented experience in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) program, from alternative donors and sources, as reference for this type of therapy. This implies the availability of on-site clinical hematology unit, with intensive care unit, neurological department, emergency department, pharmacy, and transfusion center.</p>
