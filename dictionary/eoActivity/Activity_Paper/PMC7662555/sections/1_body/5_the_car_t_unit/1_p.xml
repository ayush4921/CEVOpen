<p>In order to guarantee the processes illustrated above and the regulation compliance, it is necessary to establish a dedicated organization that comprises different units within the clinical center. The clinical unit has the responsibility to select the patient, to evaluate the donor, to perform the infusion of CAR-T cell product, and to manage the follow-up activities. The apheresis unit collects mononuclear cells and transfers them to TE. The TE performs (if required according to the specific protocol) the processing, labeling, and storage of the aphaeretic product and organizes the shipping to the GMP facilities. Under the responsibility of the pharmacy department, the TE receives the CAR-T product, performs the temporary storage, and transfers the product to the clinical unit for infusion. The pharmacy has the responsibility to receive the drug product and to delegate the TE to store the product. ICU supports the clinical unit in the management of the patients in case of adverse events, together with several medical support consultants.The Organizational Model of the CAR-T Unit</p>
