<p>The clinical CAR-T unit is in charge of the evaluation and selection of patients eligible for CAR-T cell therapy. This represents a critical task since the demand of patients in need of such treatment will increase overtime while the availability of CAR-T cells are still limited—at least so far—to a relatively low number of clinical centers. Stringent eligibility criteria are required in order to select those patients that may benefit from CAR-T cell administration. The decision to treat a patient with CAR-T cell therapy should be made in the context of a multi-disciplinary team. The main factors that influence the suitability of a patient to CAR-T cell treatment are represented by the medical history, the clinical conditions, the disease burden, and life’s expectancy. In particular, disease burden at the time of evaluation represents a critical consideration, as patients with low tumor burden experience less treatment-related toxicities and have superior clinical responses (

However, in real life, most patients have aggressive malignancies that need to be carefully managed along with the timeline and processes, such as insurance authorization, apheresis procedure, and manufacturing, to obtain the medicinal product for infusion. Moreover, clinicians should take into account the risk of disease progression and the related complications that could occur until the expected date of CAR-T cell infusion. Finally, also manufacturing failures should be foreseen, since in this case alternative therapies have to be considered.
