<p>Despite the documented clinical success of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells, the broad clinical usage is still limited due to several factors, such as the non-optimal persistence, the low efficacy in solid tumors, the safety profile and the high costs associated with the complex manufacturing. Although anti-CD19 CAR-T cells can lead to complete response rates for B-cell malignancies, a consistent proportion of patients relapse through various resistance mechanisms, including loss of expression of the target antigen (CD19-negative recurrences) (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). To overcome this drawback and reduce the risk of disease recurrence, T cells have been engineered with multiple CARs to target simultaneously two tumor-associated antigens (bispecific CAR-T cells) (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). This strategy may allow decreasing the toxicity while augmenting the tumor specificity of CAR-T cells. To improve their anti-tumor efficacy, they have been implemented with molecular features that can target the tumor microenvironment (TME). These are represented by the fourth generation “armored” CAR-T cells that include T cells redirected for Universal Cytokine-mediated Killing cells (TRUCK) through the incorporation of genes encoding for cytotoxic cytokines (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Moreover, allogeneic or “universal” CAR-T cells are produced from T cells isolated from healthy donors, representing “off the shelf” engineered T cells. This strategy allows the viability of CAR-T cells for a high number of patients and the decrease of the costs regarding clinical grade production (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Great emphasis is also placed in the development of CAR-T cells for the treatment of solid malignancies; to date results showed limited clinical efficacy (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The challenges associated with the effectiveness of CAR-T cells in this setting are: i) the selection of target antigens, specifically expressed by tumor and not by normal cells; ii) the homing of CAR-T cells and their interaction with TME and the vascularization; iii) the production of immunosuppressive molecules; iiii) the high metabolic rate of both tumor cells and TME (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). To date in fact, a candidate target antigen expressed by solid tumors that is comparable to CD19, a lineage antigen over-expressed on B-cell malignancies which counterpart expression on normal cells limited to B cells is not available. Due to the high heterogeneity of cells within solid tumors, the “armored” CAR-T cells allow promotion of a universal cytokine-mediated activation, targeting even those cancer cells that would be invisible to CAR-T cells.
