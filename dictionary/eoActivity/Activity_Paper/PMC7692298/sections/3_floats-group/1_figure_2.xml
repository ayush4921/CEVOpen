  <p>Growth inhibitory effects of 
   <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> plant extracts on the shoot and root growth of lettuce, alfalfa, cress, rapeseed, barnyard grass, timothy, Italian ryegrass, and foxtail fescue: the tested species were exposed to the concentrations of 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg DW equivalent extracts of 
   <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic>/mL. The values are mean Â± SE for each treatment from the two independent experiments with 3 replications (10 seedlings for each replication) for every experiment (
   <italic>n</italic> = 60) that is displayed. Asterisks signify important variations between treatments and control: * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, and *** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (ANOVA one-way and LSD test by post hoc).
