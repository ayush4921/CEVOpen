  <p>Effect on the seedling growth of cress of the aqueous and ethyl acetate fractions that has been obtained by partitioning of 
   <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> extracts: cress was subjected to concentrations equal to 0.1 and 0.3 g DW extracts of 
   <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic>/mL. The values are mean Â± SE for each treatment from the two independent experiments with 10 seedlings. Asterisks show major variations between treatments and control: ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 and ***
