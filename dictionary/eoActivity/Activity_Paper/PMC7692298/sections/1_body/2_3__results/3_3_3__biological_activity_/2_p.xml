<p>The I
 <sub>50</sub> values of vanillic acid against cress shoot and root were 0.04 and 0.05 mM, respectively, (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01591-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) which are about 12- and 9-times higher, respectively than that for the Italian ryegrass shoots (0.47 mM) and roots (0.45 mM). In contrast, the I
 <sub>50</sub> values of gallic acid against Italian ryegrass shoot and root were 6.6 and 2.3 mM, respectively, (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01591-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) which are roughly 2.3- and 6-times lower, respectively, than that for the cress shoot (15.4 mM), and root (13.8 mM). The I
 <sub>50</sub> values show that vanillic acid had greater growth inhibitory effects against both tested species compared with gallic acid. In addition, the cress shoot and root displayed greater susceptibility to vanillic acid than that of Italian ryegrass, and the Italian ryegrass showed higher sensitivity to gallic acid than cress.
