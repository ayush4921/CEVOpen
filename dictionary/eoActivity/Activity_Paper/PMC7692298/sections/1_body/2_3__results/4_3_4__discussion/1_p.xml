<p>The present study showed the phytotoxic activities of aqueous methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic>, which significantly restricted the seedlings growth of eight tested species: lettuce, alfalfa, cress, rapeseed, barnyard grass, Italian ryegrass, timothy, and foxtail fescue (

These findings suggested that the growth inhibitory effects of the plant extracts indicate the presence of phytotoxic substances. The extracts in this study were subjected to chromatographic fractionations, and two substances were isolated and characterized using spectral analysis as vanillic acid and gallic acid. These two substances are phenolic compounds. Phenolic substances are the most common classes of phytochemicals that have important morphophysiological significance in various plants and exhibit various biological activities like anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant effects [
