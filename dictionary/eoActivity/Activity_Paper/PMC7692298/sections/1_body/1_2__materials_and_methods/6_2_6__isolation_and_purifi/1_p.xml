<p>After saturating overnight with sodium sulphate, the EtOAc (ethyl acetate) fraction was evaporated to dryness. The extract residues were loaded into a silica gel column (60 g of silica gel 60, 70–230 mesh; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and eluted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane with increasing quantities of EtOAc (increased 10%/step (
 <italic>v/v</italic>), in 150 mL/step) and 300 mL methanol. The repressing effects of all fractions were calculated through the cress assay, as previously stated. In the column of silica gel, the most active fractions were obtained from 60, 70, and 80% EtOAc in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and EtOAc, which were mixed together and then evaporated until complete dryness; purified through a column of Sephadex LH-20 (GE Healthcare Bio-Science AB, SE-75184, Uppsala, Sweden); and rinsed with 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 80% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) aqueous methanol (150 mL/step) and 300 mL methanol. The highest active fraction was eluted with 40% aqueous methanol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01591-f001">Figure 1</xref>), then evaporated until dry, diluted in 20% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) aqueous methanol, and burdened into a reverse-phase C
 <sub>18</sub> cartridge (YMC Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). The C
 <sub>18</sub> cartridge was rinsed with 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 80% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) aqueous methanol and cold methanol. The highest active fraction was rinsed with 50% aqueous methanol, which was then refined with reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (5 µm, 4.6 × 250 mm I.D., Inertsil
 <sup>®</sup> ODS-3; GL Science Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The HPLC column was rinsed with 20% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) aqueous methanol at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The active substances were determined at the wavelength of 220 nm and at the oven temperature of 40 °C from 62 to 100 min retention time as a colorless substance (substance 1) and from 65 to 70 min retention time as a whitish substance (substance 2). Both substances were characterized using high resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (HRESIMS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance (
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR), and specific rotation.
