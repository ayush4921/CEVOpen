<p>The extracts of 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> were diluted into 300 mL of methanol to make six test concentrations as 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg DW (dry weight) equivalent extract/mL. Aliquots of the extract were applied to the single sheet of filter paper (No. 02) into Petri dishes (28 mm) at assay concentrations and kept in a draft chamber to desiccate the methanol. The filter paper was then soaked with 0.6 mL (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) aqueous solution of Tween 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate; Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan) in each Petri dish to serve as a surfactant. Ten seeds of lettuce, alfalfa, cress, and, rapeseed, and 10 pre-emergence seeds of timothy, Italian ryegrass, barnyard grass, and foxtail fescue (incubated in dark condition for 68 h, 48 h, 46 h, and 72 h, respectively, at the temperature of 25 °C) were placed onto the filter paper in the Petri dishes. The control treatments were prepared for the seeds and pre-emergence seeds with an aqueous mixture of polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate without the extracts. After two days of incubation in dark condition at 25 °C, the growth of the all tested plants were estimated. The seedling percentage length of seedlings was determined based on the length of the control seedlings. The concentration needed for 50% growth inhibition (I
 <sub>50</sub> values) was determined for each species using a logistic regression equation of the concentration–response curves. Throughout this experiment, the assay was performed with three replications for each model plant and replicated twice (10 seeds or pre-germinated seeds/replication).
