<p>The 
 <italic>Wedelia chinensis</italic> extracts were evaporated at 40 Â°C with a rotary evaporator to make an aqueous residue, and pH of the residues was modified to 7.0 by using 1 Molar (M) phosphate buffer. The plant extracts were then partitioned eight times with an equivalent amount of EtOAc (ethyl acetate) and divided into H
 <sub>2</sub>O (aqueous) and EtOAc fractions. A bioassay was set with cress seeds to measure the phytotoxic effects of H
 <sub>2</sub>O and EtOAc fractions.
