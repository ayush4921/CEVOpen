 <italic>Camellia</italic> green tea extract obtained from “inappropriate” extraction procedures (e.g., room temperature extraction) might be inhibitory to reduce the power generation of MFCs compared to bioelectricity stimulation by supplement of higher temperature-extracted green tea. Evidently, the main components of green tea extracted by pure water and MEOH showed significant difference in concentration and composition, which could directly lead to the differences in inhibitory potency and biocompatibility. Although the extracts obtained by different solvents (i.e., water and MEOH) owned significant redox capabilities, the application in MFCs unexpectedly still exhibited considerable inhibitory effect. Microbial community analysis showed that the supplementation of green tea extract significantly altered the distribution of microbial community, especially the decrease of microbial diversity and evenness. Therefore, in practical application of different microbial culture systems, selecting appropriate RMs should not only consider their excellent redox-mediating characteristics, but also the inhibitory responses for feasibility evaluation as screening criterion.
