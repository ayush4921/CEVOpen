 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> indicated, aromatic compounds with electron-shuttling functional groups (e.g., 
 <italic>ortho</italic>- or 
 <italic>para</italic>-dihydroxyl (−OH) substituent(s)) could act as RMs to enhance efficiency of simultaneous wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation in MFCs. According to Chen et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, RMs could be reversibly inter-converted between reduced and oxidized forms of intermediates to enhance electron transfer phenomena between electron donor(s) and electron acceptor(s) for augmenting electricity generation. Therefore, the application of two green tea extracts into MFCs should clearly present whether such electrochemical activities could be stably expressed by microbes. This would be reflected in the remarkable electron-shuttling phenomenon, improving the bioelectricity-augmenting performance of MFCs 
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Thus, water extract and MEOH extract were supplemented to MFCs with the same mass concentration to evaluate power-generating capacity for comparison. Aware that nearly identical mass concentration of tea extract simply suggested that the same weight of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> tea (biomass) was used for comparison. In fact, two kinds of MFCs inoculated with different mixed consortia of bacteria (i.e., MFC-A and MFC-B) were carried out to verify whether the expression of electrochemical RMs in MFCs is still controlled by the electroactive-bacterial populations. However, supplementation of both water extract and MEOH extract did not enhance the power generation of MFCs as anticipated. On the contrary, significant inhibitory effects were observed in both MFC-A and MFC-B. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> , the twice successive supplementation of both water extract and MEOH extract obviously repressed the power production of MFC-A and MFC-B. Regarding the power generation capacity, the power density of MFC-A1 and MFC-B1 respectively decreased from 14 to 18 mW

 <sup>2</sup> with the successive supplementation of water extract. Of course, dose concentration strongly influenced the degree of inhibitory potency expression since higher dose would trigger more severe adverse effects to be taken place to the receptor organisms. That was why power density of 2nd was even lower than 1st (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This also suggested that different levels of inhibitory responses would be resulted owning to the difference of microbial community. Furthermore, addition of MEOH extract tended to dramatically inhibit the power generation of MFC-A2 and MFC-B2, respectively decreased from 15 to 19 mW

 <sup>2</sup>. These result directly suggested that the inhibition of MEOH extract was even more considerable than that of water extract. Since the sources of water extract and MEOH extract were the same green tea, the apparent inhibitory differences were most likely owing to the differences in the composition and content of the extract due to the different solvents and temperatures of extraction as discussed afterwards.
