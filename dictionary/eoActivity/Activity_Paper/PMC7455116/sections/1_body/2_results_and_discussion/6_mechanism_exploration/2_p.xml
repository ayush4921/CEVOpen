<p id="para0023">To elucidate such different inhibitory outcomes of GT extracts, comparative analysis on prior studies and literature was carried out. As aforementioned, evidently contents of GA, EGCG and several unknown compositions in the water extract and MEOH extract were significantly different. As indicated in literature [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], EGCG owned apparent inhibitory effects on bacterial species (e.g., 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Proteusbacillus vulgaris, Salmonella typhosa, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Oral streptococcus, E. coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>)
 <italic>.</italic> Moreover, EGCG could even express significant antibacterial activity toward food poisoning bacteria and plant pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, due to the higher content of EGCG in GT extract, the greater inhibitory potency towards the bacterial populations was revealed. In addition to EGCG, there were many chemical components with the similar chemical structure (e.g., 
 <italic>ortho</italic>-dihydroxyl bearing aromatic compounds EC, EGC, ECG, GA, TF) in GT extracts. According to Zuo et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and Yao et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, catechins in tea extracts can also include epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin gallate (ECG), and epicatechin (EC), which are likely corresponding to the unidentified peaks in the HPLC results. Similar to EGCG, these catechins had high antioxidant capacities and also revealed very strong antibacterial activities. Furthermore, GT extracts obtained through room temperature extraction could also lead to higher contents of inhibitory chemical species than those from higher temperature (e.g., 65 °C) extracts. These findings all supported that the presence of antibacterial components in GT extract may directly alter the distribution of microbial community, further decreasing the power-generating capabilities of MFCs possibly due to reduction of electroactive populations in the community.
