<p id="para0024">However, such strong inhibitory effect of tea extract seemed to be different from our prior findings [

 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. From the comparison upon experimental methods, the extraction temperature seems to be the main-effect reason to evolve such a difference. In fact, different degree of inhibition caused by changes in temperature of extraction were also found in natural products (e.g., medicinal herbs). As a matter of fact, many medicinal herbs may not be appropriate to be extracted at low temperature (e.g., room temperature). According to the practices in Herbal Medicine, macerated and heat-dried or processing (páozhì) under higher temperature heating (65–85 °C) could attenuate some inhibitory chemical species and sometimes even lose power of side effects in medication. For example, artemisinin (Qinghaosu) was found to be effectively against malaria. However, this finding was due to “accidental” modification of the extraction at low temperature by the Youyou Tu's group

After their further separation of acid extract, the natural extract indeed contain very promising antimalarial activity that was even much stronger than well-known chloroquine for clinical mediation to patients with malaria. Moreover, this phenomenon was popularly observed in extracts of active compositions in medicinal herbs to against disease. As revealed in Oh et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, ethanol extract of GT at 20 °C owned potent antimicrobial activity against all five test pathogens, compared to water extract at 80 °C. That is, ethanol extracts contained higher concentrations of inhibitory chemicals to pathogens than water extracts. This may be due to the favorable solubility of antimicrobial compounds in organic alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol) much higher than that in water.
