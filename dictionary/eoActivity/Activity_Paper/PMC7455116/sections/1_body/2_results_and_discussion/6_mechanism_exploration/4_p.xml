 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> indicated, evidently there were at least three crucial conditions to affect inhibition potency of GT to bacteria as follows: (1) temperature of extraction (e.g., room, higher temperature), (2) solvent of extraction (e.g., water, ethanol or methanol) and (3) concentration of extract (e.g., powder, concentrated solution). They all affected the role of GT to be either “medicine” (yào) or “poison” (dú). In addition, herbal tolerance and susceptibility of test organism also strongly influenced the responses to be in either “toxicity” or medication. These all strongly suggested that why macerated and heat-dried or processing (páozhì) is of great importance to clinical medication. The novelty of this MFC study was to depict a promising platform to evaluate possible herbal species for its bioenergy-extracting potential without sacrifice of living mice and animals in practice. The scope also pointed out some information of great importance on the threshold criteria of “toxicity” for the characteristic of
