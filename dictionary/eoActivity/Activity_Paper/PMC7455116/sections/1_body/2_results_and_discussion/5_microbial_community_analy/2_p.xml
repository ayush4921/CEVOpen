<p id="para0020">As the two 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> green tea extracts contained chemical components with strong antibacterial activities, applications to MFCs clearly expressed inhibitory effect on power generation, directly affecting electrochemical activities of the electrogenic microorganism to be exhibited in MFCs. To clearly decipher such inhibitory effect of green tea extract on bacterial strains in MFCs, microbial community analysis of MFCs before and after supplementation of MEOH extract was implemented 
 <xref rid="bib0041" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. The changes of microbial community in MFCs were analyzed from the levels of phylum, class, order and family (
 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref> ). Regarding MFC-A, from the phylum level, the original flora could be mainly divided into 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, and the two phyla accounted for 48.21% and 51.78%, respectively, in a relatively even distribution state (i.e., community in higher biodiversity). However, after the supplementation of MEOH extract, the proportion of the 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> increased significantly (up to 85.60%), while the 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> could not adapt to such environmental stress, leading to significant loss of cell viability (decreased to 14.40%). The same result could be found in the microbial community analysis of MFC-B. The 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> respectively changed from 42.73% and 57.27% to 67.00% and 33.00%, respectively. In addition, such phenomenon could also be observed in the classification of class and order levels. From the more detailed classification of the family, in addition to the obvious changes of microbial community in MFC-A, 
 <italic>Clostridiales</italic> UC and 
 <italic>Clostridiaceae</italic>-1 strains seemed to become extinct with the supplementation of MEOH extract. In MFC-B, except for dying out of 
 <italic>Clostridiaceae-1, Carnobacteriaceae</italic> strains were also eliminated from the population owing to the addition of MEOH extract. These results indicated that these strains were unlikely to resist such supplementation of MEOH extract.
