<p id="para0008">As prior work indicated, different methods of extraction could result in different levels of antioxidant/ electron transfer capabilities (e.g., H
 <sub>2</sub>O extracted &gt; EtOH extracted) 
 <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Moreover, many medicinal herbs may not be appropriate to be extracted in low temperature, rather than at high temperature. In fact, high temperature by macerated and heat-dried or processing heating could attenuate contents of some toxic species and sometimes even reduce power of side effects in medication. To clearly reveal whether such phenomena may also be taken place in MFCs, 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> GT was selected herein as study material using water and methanol as solvents of extraction. Furthermore, to reveal the novelty of this study and to compare results of high-temperature extraction in prior studies, low-temperature extraction was intentionally selected to inspect the electrochemical activity and/or antibacterial characteristics of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> green tea extract. After centrifugation and freeze drying, extracted powders of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> GT obtained from the extraction of different solvents were harvested for comparison. In addition, electrochemical properties of the extracts were characterized via electrochemical measures to evaluate whether their electrochemical potential activities could be considered as RMs. Quantitative analyses of bioelectricity generation and community ecology in MFCs with the supplementation of these electrochemical active extracts were further implemented to quantitatively present such inhibitory or stimulating responses to affect the performance of bioenergy-extracting processes in MFCs.
