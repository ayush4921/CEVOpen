<p id="para0010">For comparison upon components and contents of tea extracts obtained via different extraction solvents, water extract and methanol extract of 
 <italic>Camellia</italic> GT at the same mass concentration were analyzed by HPLC. The HPLC system was accomplished with a Chromaster-5110 single pump, Chromaster-5260 auto sampler, and Chromaster-5420 UV–VIS Detector (Hitachi High-Tech Sci. Corp., Japan) using an InertSustain C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, GL Sciences Inc., Japan) under a mode of gradient eluent. The gradient used was mobile phases A (3% acetic acid solution, HAc: water =3:97) and mobile phases B (methanol), where the percentage of mobile phases A was changed over time as follows: 0–1 min, 100%; 1–28 min, 100–37%; 28–33 min, 37–100%. The rejection volume was 10 μL with the flow rate of 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The chromatographic separation was completed in 33 min for each sample. The separated components were detected at 280 nm using the Chromaster-5420 UV–VIS Detector. In fact, as Cabrera et al. 
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> recommended, this is more reliable, rapid and simpler method of HPLC for simultaneous determination of catechins, gallic acids (GA) and caffeine (CAF).
