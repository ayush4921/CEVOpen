<p id="para0009">To achieve maximal extraction efficiency, 5.0 g GT sample was ground into powder and screened through the particle size sieve (diameter of 40 μm). In addition, the final solid/liquid ratio (S/L) was set as 5 g/50 mL to have identical basis for comparison. To have comparative assessment with prior studies, the deionized water and 80% methanol (MEOH) aqueous solutions were intentionally used as solvents of extraction at room temperature in total volume of 50 mL with continuous stirring for 12 h

Harvested supernatants were then purified via 0.2 μm filters (Millipore Millex®-GS 0.22 μm filter unit) to eliminate residual particles. After refrigeration under the condition of − 80 °C for overnight, frozen extracts were placed into the freezer dryer for 48 h and then pulverized. As the resultant powder may be light-sensitive and were then placed in dried, dark brown glass containers to avoid deliquesce and illumination.
