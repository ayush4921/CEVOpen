<p>For years, natural products from plant-based origin have been an indispensable source of medicinally active constituents that are essential for drug discovery and development for the treatment of numerous diseases. Many herbal medicines have been recognized to play a tremendous role in the treatment of emerging pandemics, specifically the ability to block the SARS virus from binding to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) [
 <xref rid="B144-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Increased ACE-2 activity and expression have been known to modulate the inflammatory cytokine levels, most notably interleukin-1 and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). The presence of the glycan-mimicking structure in most bioactive compounds (especially phenolic compounds) makes them suitable for various protein-inhibitory roles [

 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00042-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Water extract of the whole plant of 
 <italic>Houttuynia coedata</italic> was reported to slow down viral replication through pivotal enzyme inhibition against SARS-CoV as a result of its ability to inhibit 3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and RdRp of the virus [
 <xref rid="B39-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similar water extract of young leaves of 
 <italic>Toona sinensis</italic> also exhibited good inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E) replication [
 <xref rid="B148-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Anti-SARS-CoV activities of several other plant extracts such as ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Euphoria nerifolia</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B149-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>], polar and non-polar extracts of Chineseâ€™s medicinal herbs such as 
 <italic>Cibotium barometz</italic>, 
 <italic>Gentiana scabra</italic>, 
 <italic>Dioscorea batatas</italic>, 
 <italic>Cassia tora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Taxillus chinensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B150-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>], water extract of 
 <italic>Istatis indigotica</italic> root [
 <xref rid="B151-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], and ethyl acetate soluble fraction of 
 <italic>Angelica keiskei</italic> [
 <xref rid="B152-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>] were also reported. Thus far, neither in vivo nor clinical studies involving herbal medicines and SARS-CoV have been reported.
