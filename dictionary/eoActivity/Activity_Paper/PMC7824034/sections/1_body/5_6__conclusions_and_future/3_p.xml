<p>Even though a great number of research studies on anti-DENV and anti-SARS-CoV are still at initial stages, additional research is still very much required on the identification of the bioactive components, elucidation of the mechanisms of actions, evaluation of efficacy, and possible in vivo applications to promote the exploration of potent antiviral chemotherapeutics against these infections. Not much research has been done to study any potential immunomodulatory effects of the extracts or compounds, or their effects on signaling mechanisms leading to viral eradication. Additional investigations are also needed on the possibility of combining the existing treatment with natural bioactive compounds as a multiple-target solution to reduce the potentials of infection from drug-resistant virus strains. Moreover, there is a need for the standardization of herbal medicines to enhance high reliability, effectiveness, quality, and safety, which will require a series of scientific experiments ranging from the isolation of the active major compounds to different biological testing; pharmacokinetics, toxicological, and clinical studies. It is hoped that natural remedies such as medicinal plants and pure bioactive metabolites will play a significant role in the development and advancement of anti-dengue and anti-coronavirus drugs that are safe, efficacious, and cost-effective. The effects of the medicinal plant crude extracts and bioactive compounds on DENV infection are summarized in
