<p>Among many medicinal plants with anti-DENV potentials, 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> has been tested clinically in many studies. Administration of 25 mL of plant aqueous leaf extract was found to reduce the severity of dengue fever in patients by increasing platelet, white blood cell as well as neutrophil counts in the blood [
 <xref rid="B91-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Similarly, in a clinical study conducted on 12 patients with dengue fever with a platelet count less than 130,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, two doses (5 mL) of 
 <italic>C. papaya</italic> leaf extract administered at 8 h intervals along with standard dengue symptomatic care, resulted in an increase in platelet count and white blood cell count within 24 h of treatment [
 <xref rid="B92-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Oral administration of 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> leaf juice at a dose of 30 mL for three consecutive days also elevated mean platelet count in 228 patients with dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever compared to the control group [
 <xref rid="B93-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. It therefore could prevent the complications of thrombocytopenia [
 <xref rid="B94-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], and shorten the length of hospital stay in these patients [
 <xref rid="B95-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Similar outcomes were also reported by a recent study [
 <xref rid="B96-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>] that also showed 
 <italic>C. papaya</italic> treatment reduced plasma tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 as well as mean dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1). The findings confirmed the immunomodulatory property of the plant seen in the animal study. A clinical study on 
 <italic>E. hirta</italic> aqueous extract demonstrated that oral administration of the extract to patients with dengue fever raised platelet and total leukocyte counts, but had no significant effect on hematocrit [
 <xref rid="B97-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Not many clinical studies on the anti-DENV activity in medicinal plants have been carried out. More such studies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of the extracts and/or their isolated bioactive compounds on DENV.
