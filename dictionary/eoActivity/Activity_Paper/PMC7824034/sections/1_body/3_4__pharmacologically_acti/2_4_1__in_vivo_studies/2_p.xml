<p>It seems that 
 <italic>C. papaya</italic> is the most studied plant in the dengue fever model. However, more research studies need to be conducted to better understand the beneficial effects of the plant extracts and the active phytoconstituents on DENV infection biology. The effects of medicinal plants on the pathophysiology of dengue concerning the mechanisms that govern the causes of capillary leakage and decrease in platelet count could also be studied in animal models. Many mouse models such as knockout mice or transgenic mice can also be employed to evaluate anti-DENV activity of the medicinal plans [
