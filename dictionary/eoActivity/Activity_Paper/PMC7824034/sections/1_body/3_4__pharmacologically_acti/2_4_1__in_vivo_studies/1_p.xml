<p>One of the significant clinical features of dengue fever is a reduction in platelet count. Many plant species have the ability to boost platelet count. Leaf extract of 
 <italic>C. papaya</italic> has been demonstrated to augment platelet count in various dengue fever models in animals [

 <xref rid="B78-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], in addition to reducing clotting time in thrombocytopenic rats [
 <xref rid="B76-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Other plant species that show similar activity are 
 <italic>Ipomea batata</italic> and 
 <italic>Aternanthera sessillis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B77-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], 
 <italic>Eurycoma longifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B69-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and 
 <italic>E. hirta</italic> [

 <xref rid="B78-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, 
 <italic>M. charantia</italic> did not show similar effects in the DENV-infected Sprague-Dawley rats [
 <xref rid="B77-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Eurycoma longifolia</italic> root also showed 30% reduction in viral load in AG129 DENV-infected mice [
 <xref rid="B79-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that oral administration of 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> remarkably reduced viral loads in ddY mice after 24 h [
 <xref rid="B80-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> leaves at 20â€“30 mg/mL (maximum non-toxic concentration) completely inhibited viral replication as confirmed by the absence of virus specific 511 bp amplicon in real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the absence of DENV-related symptoms in DENV-infected suckling mice [
 <xref rid="B81-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Freeze-dried 
 <italic>C. papaya</italic> leaves also increased plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) levels during the peak of viremia when given orally to AG129 dengue-infected mice, suggesting the possible immunomodulatory capacity of this plant during DENV infection [
