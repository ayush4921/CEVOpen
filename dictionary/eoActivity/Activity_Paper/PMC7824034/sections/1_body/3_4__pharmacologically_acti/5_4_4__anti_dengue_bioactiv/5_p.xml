 <xref rid="biomolecules-11-00042-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. To date, antiviral agents for DENV that have been developed act by inhibiting viral entry, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), protease, or helicase enzymes (

 <italic>Trigonostemon cherrieri</italic>—trigocherrins A and trigocherriolides B and C—also inhibited DENV RdRp, while no effect was seen with trigocherrins B and F as well as trigocherriolide A [
 <xref rid="B128-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. No plant compounds with anti-DENV property that could act via helicase and protease inhibitory activities have been reported. Most of the studies are still at the stage of activity screening. More works need to be done to explore the anti-DENV potential with their mechanism such as the inhibition of viral genomes and the destruction of enzymes necessary for viral encoding to find potential candidates for DENV treatment.
