<p>Virtually all in vitro studies were centered on the inhibitory effects of various medicinal plants against DENV replications. Infection by cytocidal viruses is usually associated with changes in cell morphology and physiology as well as sequential cellular biosynthetic events. Reduction in cytopathic effect—structural changes in host cell due to viral invasion—is the major technique used for the detection of the extract’s inhibitory capacity against DENV. Polar extracts such as aqueous [

 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] have been reported to possess anti-dengue activity. The inhibitory potential is attributable to the presence of polyphenols and terpenes [
 <xref rid="B88-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The extract showed good inhibitory effects that ranged from 0.8 µg/mL to 1900 µg/mL with percentage inhibition more than 34% up to total inhibition. Methanol extracts of

 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic>,

 <italic>Cymbopogon citratus</italic> methanol extract of about 98.8% against DENV-2 New Guinea C strain (NGC) at a dose of 20 µg/mL [
 <xref rid="B86-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Other extracts that showed similar inhibition include 
 <italic>Acorus calamus</italic> and 
 <italic>Myristica factual</italic> (96.5% and 122.7%, respectively). Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> leaves had totally inhibited 100–10,000 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID

 <xref rid="B81-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In a similar context, leaf methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Spondias mombin</italic> and 
 <italic>Spondias tuberosa</italic> showed promising inhibitory capacity against DENV-2 replication at concentrations of 3.31 and 17.98 µg/mL, respectively, believed to be due to the presence of rutin, quercetin, and ellagic acid in both plants [
