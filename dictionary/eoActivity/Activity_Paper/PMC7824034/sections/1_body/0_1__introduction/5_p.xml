<p>Although DENV and SARS-CoV belong to different viral families and their characteristics such as structure, entry mechanism, replication, and pathogenicity are different, they manifest similar early signs and symptoms of fever, headache, joint pain, low platelet and white cell counts [
 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], which could lead to misdiagnosis. Both DENV and SARS-CoV are endemic to several parts of the world, while COVID-19 has become a pandemic. More importantly, some medicinal plants and their bioactive compounds have been reported to be effective for the inhibition of both infections, either by reducing viral load or by preventing viral replication. 
 <italic>Houttuynia cordata</italic> and 
 <italic>Boesenbergia rotunda</italic> are such examples. The extracts of both plants have been reported to inhibit both DENV-2 [

 <xref rid="B37-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and SARS CoV-2 [
