<p>Dengue fever is a viral infection that has imposed serious economic burdens in both tropical and sub-tropical regions [
 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. More than 300 million cases are recorded annually with nearly 22,000 deaths [
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Globally, dengue fever affects approximately 2.5 billion people with an estimated 50–100 million new cases annually [
 <xref rid="B17-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The endemic disease occurs in more than 100 countries including Africa, Asia, America, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific being the most affected regions [

 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. More than 20 African countries were affected by an epidemic between 1960 and 2017. However, many outbreaks are never officially reported [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Dengue fever is caused by four distinct but antigenically related flavivirus serotypes with dengue virus (DENV) type-2 (DENV-2) reported to be more deadly than all other serotypes [
 <xref rid="B21-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The disease is prevalent in urban and semi-urban areas and is transmitted by female 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The incubation period after the virus gets into the human body varies from 3–14 days, after which symptoms ranging from mild to severe begin to manifest. Early symptoms may include headache, fever, severe muscle, and joint pain [
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Severe cases are characterized by hemorrhagic fever syndrome, which may result in dengue shock syndrome [
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Its treatment includes standard management of general fever as well as other symptomatic treatments [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Dengvaxia, the first dengue vaccine, was licensed a few years back for clinical use [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-11-00042" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The safety of the vaccine however, is still questionable due to findings that it could increase the risk of dengue fever severity in individuals with no prior history of DENV infection [
