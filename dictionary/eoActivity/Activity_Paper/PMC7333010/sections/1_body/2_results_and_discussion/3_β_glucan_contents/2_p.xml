<p>In addition to enhancing immunity and exhibiting anti-tumor effects (
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Hazama et al., 2009</xref>), β-glucan has been reported to exhibit antioxidant activity (
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2019a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). 
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. (2011b)</xref> explained that molecular interactions with β-glucan polyphenols can increase antioxidant activity. 
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">Mebrek et al. (2018)</xref> proposed that β-glucan can provide electrons to reactive free radicals, converting them into more stable non-reactive molecules. 
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2014)</xref> reported that this scavenging effect is more effective when the hydroxyl groups in polysaccharides are substituted by carboxymethyl or sulfate groups. This implies that sulfate and carboxymethyl groups of β-glucan can enhance its antioxidant capability compared with compounds with only a single sulfate or carboxymethyl group.
