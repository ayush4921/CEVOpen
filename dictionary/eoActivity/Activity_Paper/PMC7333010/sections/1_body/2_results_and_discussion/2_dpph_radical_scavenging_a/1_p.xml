<p>The antioxidant activity of the control, Cordyceps coffee and Cordyceps mushrooms is shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. DPPH is a relatively stable free radical. When DPPH reacts with a substance exhibiting antioxidant activity, it is reduced or eliminated, resulting in a decrease of its dark purple color. Therefore, DPPH is widely used to measure antioxidant capacity (
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Gardner and Fridovich, 1991</xref>). The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the control and Cordyceps coffee (80.56% and 82.21%, respectively) was higher compared with that of Cordyceps mushrooms (62.89%); although the DPPH radical scavenging activity was slightly higher in Cordyceps coffee than the control, these did not significantly differ. In the study on several medicinal mushrooms, the DPPH radical scavenging activity was highest in Phellinus mushrooms (90%). In addition, DPPH radical scavenging activity was higher in Chaga mushrooms (78%) and Cordyceps mushrooms (48%) than
