<p>These differences can be more clearly distinguished in the Vapor Print graph (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Vapor Print is a 360Â° circular image based on from the initial RT to the last compound detection time, which uses two variables, the RT as an angular variable and the response level as a radial variable. The polar derivative pattern refers to a pattern image obtained by differentiating the frequency, and the polar frequency pattern is a pattern image representing a change in frequency obtained from a sensor according to the RT in Herz. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, A and B showed a very similar pattern, whereas C showed a different overall pattern, including unusually strong peaks or almost disappeared peaks.
