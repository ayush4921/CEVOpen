<p>The total polyphenol contents are shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Both the control (27.00 mg GAE/g) and Cordyceps coffee (37.34 mg GAE/g) had higher total polyphenol content than Cordyceps mushrooms (23.17 mg GAE/g). Coffee beans are rich in polyphenols, but the polyphenol content of Cordycepin coffee was further increased by Cordyceps mushroom. Suh et al. (2015) reported that the total phenolic contents of fresh green coffee beans from Brazil, Indonesia, and Kenya are 21.3, 20.6, and 23.1 mg GAE/g, respectively. These values are consistent with ours. In addition, when the coffee was slightly roasted, the polyphenol content in coffee from Brazil and Kenya increased to 36.2 and 26.1 mg GAE/g, respectively (
