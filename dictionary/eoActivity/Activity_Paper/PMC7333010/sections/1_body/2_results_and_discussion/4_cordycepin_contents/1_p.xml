<p>The Cordycepin contents are shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. The Cordycepin contents of Cordyceps mushroom and Cordyceps coffee were 11,533.22 mg/kg and 2,274.70 mg/kg, respectively. The Cordycepin content was lower in Cordyceps coffee than in Cordyceps mushrooms, however Cordycepin is considered to have been relatively well implemented into the coffee beans, similar to β-glucan. 
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al. (2003)</xref> reported that the Cordycepin content of Cordyceps mushrooms differs depending on the variety and the part of the plant; the fruiting body contains 448 mg/100 g Cordycepin whereas the host part contains 238 mg/100 g Cordycepin, 8∼23 times higher than the content in other varieties.
