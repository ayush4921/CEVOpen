<p>Cordyceps coffee was roasted using a roaster (THCR-01, Taehwan, Bucheon, Korea) for 14 min at 180°C; these conditions were determined during preliminary experiments. Coffee extracts were finely ground using an automatic coffee grinder (K30ES, Mahlkönig Guatemala Lab, Hamburg, Germany) and 7 g of the ground coffee was extracted in 125 mL distilled water on a hot plate with stirring at 93°C for 4 min; extracts were then straightly filtered, based on the amount of one serving size of typical espresso coffee. These ground and liquid Cordyceps coffee samples were used for experimentation.</p>
