  <italic>Measurement of total glucan content</italic>:
 </bold> To quantify total glucan, samples (0.1 g) and 1.5 mL of 37% v/v (12 M) hydrochloric acid were added to tubes. Tubes were capped, stirred on a vortex mixer, and placed in a water bath at 30°C for 45 min. Ten milliliters of 
 <italic>d</italic>-water was then added to each tube, and the contents were vigorously stirred on a vortex mixer for 10 s. The tubes were incubated in a boiling-water bath (∼100°C) for 2 h and then cooled to room temperature. Ten milliliters of 2 M KOH was then added and mixed well. The contents of each tube were quantitatively transferred into 100 mL volumetric flasks and the volume was adjusted to 100 mL with 200 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5). After centrifuging at 1,500 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min, 0.1 mL of the supernatant was incubated with 0.1 mL of a mixture of 
 <italic>exo</italic>-1,3-β-glucanase (100 U/ mL) plus β-glucosidase (4 U/mL) in 200 mM sodium acetate buffer at 40°C for 60 min. Glucose standards and reagent blanks were measured concurrently. For a reagent blank, 0.2 mL of acetate buffer was added and for the D- glucose standard, 0.1 mL of the D-glucose standard and 0.1 mL of the acetate buffer were added. Finally, 3 mL of glucose oxidase/peroxidase (GOPOD) reagent enzyme was added to the mixture, the mixture was incubated at 40°C for 20 min, and the absorbance was measured at 510 nm (all reagents and assay procedures used are available/described in the kit Cat. No. K-YBGL, Megazyme Inc.).
