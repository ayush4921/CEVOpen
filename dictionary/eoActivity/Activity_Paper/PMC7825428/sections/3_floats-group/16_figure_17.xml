  <p>The principal plant volatile compounds are derived from four biosynthetic classes of precursors: terpenoids, fatty acid catabolites, aroma, and amino acid derived products. Many of these products are made more lipophilic (storage in membranes or oil bodies) before their release by removing or masking hydrophilic functional groups through reduction, methylation, or acylation reactions.
