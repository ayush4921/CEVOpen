<p>Plants provide multiple ranges of aromatic features well-noticed by the most sensitive human senses—taste, and odour [

The use of MAPs began as an unselective wild-harvesting of plants, moving into a selective collection and then to the cultivation of the most useful. From ancient times to the present day, plants have been used as medicines and food preservers [

These natural compounds, most of which are essential oils, are volatile at room temperature, and important for plant adaptation and survival—namely as pollinator attractants, as herbivores restraints, or as a defence against pathogenic microorganisms. Because of their biological activities, they are also important to Man in both commercial and industrial resources—namely, in traditional medicine [
