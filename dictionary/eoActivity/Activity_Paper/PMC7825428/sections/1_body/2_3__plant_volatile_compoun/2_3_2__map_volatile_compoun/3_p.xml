<p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature and the World Wildlife Fund estimated that about 50,000â€“80,000 flowering plant species are used in medicinal formulations across the world. Among these, only 1 to 10% has been studied chemically and pharmacologically for their potential value [
 <xref rid="B175-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. MAPs contain a wide variety of bioactive secondary metabolites, such as essential oils, alkaloids, phenolics (such as flavonoids), steroids, terpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and saponins [

 <xref rid="B177-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Many secondary metabolites include aroma substances, and phenolic compounds or their oxygen-substituted derivatives such as tannins [

 <xref rid="B179-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>]. The chemotypes are of extreme importance when considering the safety, quality, and efficacy of herbal products derived from MAPs. There are numerous cases of plant species showing a great variety of chemotypes. The genus 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> shows many examples since many 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> species are chemically heterogeneous. 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> is among the most popular plants having chemotypes. Six different chemotypes are known, depending on the main component of the essential oil: thymol, carvacrol, linalool, geraniol, borneol, sabinete hydrate, and multiple component chemotypes [
