<p>The concept of “quality” is wide, but in horticulture, it can be defined as the degree of excellence given by the combination of different attributes or characteristics that give each product value in terms of its proposed use [
 <xref rid="B1-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In this concept, visual appearance, ability to endure postharvest processing operations, chemical and nutritional composition, and aroma can be included [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Advances have been made in horticultural breeding, and now it is possible to find fruits and vegetables with characteristics that growers and retailers desire, such as high yield, high resistance to pest attacks and disease, attractive appearance, and capacity to support different handling and processing operations. However, most of the time, many of these horticultural crops fail to achieve top nutritional and flavour characteristics [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increasing horticultural crops’ flavour by breeding is still not an easy task, due to the multitude of factors that affect the synthesis of volatile and nonvolatile compounds responsible for flavour attributes such as climate, cultural practices, agricultural practices (organic vs. conventional), and pre- and postharvest processing operations [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Additionally, the astringency, dryness, viscosity, heat, coolness, prickling, and pain, often referred to as the “texture” of foods, can affect the flavour of vegetables and medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) [
 <xref rid="B5-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This review presents a discussion of the most important factors that affect the contents and profiles of the volatile and nonvolatile compounds responsible for the aromatic features of vegetables and MAPs, as well as the recent advances in plant breeding regarding the achievement of chemical compounds responsible for the typical aromatic features’ sensory attributes.
