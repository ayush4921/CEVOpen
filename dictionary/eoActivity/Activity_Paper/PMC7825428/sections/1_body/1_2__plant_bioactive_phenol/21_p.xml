<p>Many of these reported biological functions have been attributed to free radical scavenging activity and there has been intensive research on the natural antioxidants derived from plants [

 <xref rid="foods-10-00106-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> summarise important bioactivities related to the presence of phenolic identified in vegetables and MAPs widely consumed in the world. For example, Salem et al. [
 <xref rid="B78-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] found that extracts of artichokes rich in polyphenols were capable of inhibiting the production of histamine, bradykinin, and chemokines. These authors discovered that polyphenols present in extracts were capable of acting synergistically, enhancing their anti-inflammatory potential. Additionally, Sharma et al. [
 <xref rid="B79-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] observed that extracts of onion were capable of inhibiting the bacterial growth of 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, due to the presence of quercetin aglycone, quercetin-4′-
 <italic>O</italic>-monoglucoside, and quercetin-3,4′-
 <italic>O</italic>-diglucoside. However, the intensity of the antagonistic effect was dependent on the concentration of each compound in each onion variety assessed. In 2018, Dzotam et al. [
 <xref rid="B80-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], using extracts of nutmeg rich in 7-trihydroxyflavone, observed an antibacterial activity of such extracts against the multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>Providencia stuartii</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. A recent study showed that 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> extract rich in rosmarinic acid and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid was capable of exhibiting antiradical and antioxidant properties and enhanced gastrointestinal digestion [
