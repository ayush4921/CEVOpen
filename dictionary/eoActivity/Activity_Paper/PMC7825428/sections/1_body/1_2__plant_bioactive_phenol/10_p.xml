<p>Lignans are a diverse group of bioactive phenolic compounds formed of two β-β-linked phenylpropane units; they are present in different parts of plant species in free form or combined form as glycoside derivatives. Lignans are found in vegetables such as in the brassica family where fresh edible weights (mg/100 g) between 0.185 to 2.32 of can be found, for instance, for broccoli (98.51), Brussels sprouts (50.36), cauliflower (9.48), green cabbage (0.03), red cabbage (18.1), white cabbage (21.51), and kale (63). They can also be found in green beans (22.67), tomato (2.15), cucumber (3.8), zucchini (7.02), green lettuce (1.17), and carrot (7.66). However, spinach, white potatoes, and mushrooms contain an amount below 0.1 mg/100 g (fresh edible weight) of lignin [
