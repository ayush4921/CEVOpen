<p>Condensed tannins, also recognised as proanthocyanidins, mainly comprise a flavan-3-ol unit to form dimers, oligomers, and polymers of up to 50 monomer units (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00106-f008">Figure 8</xref>). Proanthocyanidins have complex structures depending on the number of the flavan-3-ol units, the location and type of interflavan linkage in the molecule, and the nature and position of substituents on the flavan-3-ol unit. Proanthocyanidins can be classified into procyanidins and prodelphinidins based on their hydroxylation patterns of A and B rings [
