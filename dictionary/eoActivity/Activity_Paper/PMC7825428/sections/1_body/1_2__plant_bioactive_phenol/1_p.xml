<p>Vegetables and MAPs are important sources of bioactive phenolic compounds and have a key role in the development of compounds eliciting beneficial health effects [

 <xref rid="B7-foods-10-00106" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They might be produced from two distinct pathways: (i) shikimic acid (phenylpropanoids) and (ii) acetic acid (phenols) [

Due to their abundance in vegetables and MAPs, the study of phenolic compounds’ (simple phenolics, coumarins, lignans, flavonoids, isoflavonoids, anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins, and stilbenes) effects on health has increased in recent years, due to the growing evidence indicating that polyphenols are a major class of bioactive phytochemicals. Their consumption may play a role in the prevention of several chronic diseases as potent antioxidant properties, prevention of diseases induced by oxidative stress, and prevention of some specific cardiovascular (mainly high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure) and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, type II diabetes, cancers, urinary tract infections) [
