 <sub>4</sub> group impaired liver tissues with altered cellular organization, inflammation and hepatocyte pycnosis were noticed. Animals treated with 100and 200 mg/kg b.w recovered the cellular organization to some extent, while the flower extract 300 mg/kg b.w has reinstated the structural arrangement of tissues which verified its curative potential and was analogous to silymarine effect. Histological studies discovered the dynamic role of flavonoids for the treatment of damaged cells of liver (
