<p id="p0160">The weight of mice was suddenly reduced (50 ± 2.0 to 48.3 ± 0.5) when CCL
 <sub>4</sub> was induced in mice from all groups. However with the treatment of plant extracts particularly 300 mg/kg body weight (b.w) methanol flower extract has shown increased in the body weight which was comparable with animals from normal control group (
