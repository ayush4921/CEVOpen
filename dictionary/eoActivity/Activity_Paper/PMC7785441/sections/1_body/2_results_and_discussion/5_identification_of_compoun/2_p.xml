 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Comparison of chromatogram and compounds gave peak area (%) and further information was attained from the data base of NIST library. GCâ€“MS spectrum showed 10 compounds and out of which 4 compounds illustrated higher substantial peaks. Results showed that 1-(+)-Ascorbic acid 2, 6-dihexadecanoate (35.092%), Dihydroxypropylelaidate (35.740%), Stearic acid (10.314%) and Docosanoic anhydride (1.580%) was observed on Peak 3, 4, 5 and 6 in BV flower extract.
