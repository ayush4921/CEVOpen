<p id="p0120">The beneficial properties of medicinal plants are probably due to occurrence of various secondary metabolites, those serves as defense mechanism against many microorganisms (Britto and Sebastian, 2012).Therefore due to strong evidence obtained during screening of phytochemicals various secondary metabolites like flavonoids, phenols, tannins, saponins, alkaloids and carotenoids were quantified from various flower extracts of

 <italic>Variegata</italic> possesses significantly higher quantity of total phenols 21.34 ± 2.63 and 17.66 ± 1.3 mg/g in both DVM and DVC. Subsequently 18.16 ± 3.1 and 12.18 ± 0.21 mg/g flavonoid contents are present in DVM and DVC. Methanol extracted more quantity of phytochemicals as compare to chloroform. Methanol has a potential for the diverse richness of phytochemical extraction and found to be more effective for isolating numerous phyto-constituents (
