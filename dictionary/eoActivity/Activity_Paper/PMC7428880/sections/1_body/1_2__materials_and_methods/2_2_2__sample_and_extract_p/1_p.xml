<p>The fruits were well rinsed with distilled water, and the sliced soft flesh and the peel samples were oven-dried (LABOTEC, South Africa) at 40°C for 72 hours, after which the dried samples were pulverised using a food blender (Hamilton Beach HBF 500S Series). Another group of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> peels (1000 g/L) were boiled in distilled water in the water bath (BUCHI B-480) at 80°C for 20 minutes. The boiled peel extracts were freeze-dried for 48 hours (Ceramic Filter Core Drier CD 052) and stored at 4°C until analytical work commenced. 150 g of the pulverised sample was weighed into three conical flasks, each containing 1,000 mL of acetone, ethanol, and distilled water solvents. Afterwards, the mixtures were homogenised constantly at 124 rpm on a shaker (Lasec Stuart Orbital Shaker SSL1) for 48 hours. The solvent mixtures were then pressure-filtered through the Whatman filter paper (No 1, 25 mm) in a Buchner funnel set-up on the vacuum pump. The acetone and ethanol filtrates were then concentrated further to obtain crude extracts using a rotary evaporator (LABOROTA 4000 Heidolph) at 56°C and 78°C [

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] boiling points, respectively, while the aqueous filtrates were chilled in a refrigerant chiller (PolyScience AD15R-40-A12E, USA) at −40°C and concentrated to dry form using the freeze dryer for 48 hours (Ceramic Filter Core Drier CD 052). Water (aqueous) and ethanol extracts were prime organic solvent options since the medium of cooking and preparation of herbal medicines are infusion or decoction using water or alcohol, with acetone chosen because of its extractive ability for hydrophilic and lipophilic plant components. The extraction yields of the three solvents for the fruit compartments of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> were evaluated and recorded. The extracts were stored at 4°C until further analysis.
