<p>This was determined based on the method described by [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] with slight modification. 0.5 mL of extracts and different concentrations (0.0625 mg/mL to 1 mg/mL) of catechin (standard) were dispensed into different test tubes. Then, 3 mL of vanillin-methanol (4% w/v) and 1.5 mL of hydrochloric acid were added. The mixture was then vortexed and left to stand for 15 minutes at room temperature. The absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at 500 nm (UV-3000 PC spectrophotometer). Total proanthocyanidin (TPR) content was evaluated using the equation of the calibration curve: 
 <italic>y</italic> = 1.1493
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0334, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9839, and it was expressed as mg catechin equivalent (CE)/g using the formula, 
 <italic>C</italic> = 
 <italic>cV/m</italic>, where 
 <italic>C</italic> is the total proanthocyanidin content in plant extract in mg CE/g, 
 <italic>c</italic> is the concentration obtained from the standard curve (mg/mL), 
 <italic>V</italic> is the volume of plant extract used (mL), 
 <italic>m</italic> is the mass of extract used (g).
