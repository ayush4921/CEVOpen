<p>Total flavonoid content in the extracts was determined using the colorimetric aluminium chloride method described by [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. 0.5 mL of plant extracts and varying concentrations of quercetin standard, ranging from 0.0625 to 1.0 mg/mL, were dispensed into different test tubes. Into tubes were added 2 mL of distilled water and 0.15 mL of 5% sodium nitrite (NaNO
 <sub>2</sub>), with the solution made to stand for six minutes, after which 0.15 mL of 10% aluminium chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) was added and incubated for five minutes. The mixtures were vortexed and incubated at 25°C for 15 minutes (LABOTEC, Durban, South Africa), and 1 mL of 1M sodium hydroxide was added in each tube. The solution was made up to 5 mL with the addition of 1.2 mL distilled water. Absorbance was measured at 420 nm with a spectrometer. Flavonoid content was quantitatively derived using the equation of the calibration curve:
