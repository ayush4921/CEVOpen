<p>The ferric reducing power of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> extracts was determined using the method described by [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The FRAP reagent was prepared upon the mixture of 2.5 mL 0.2 M phosphate buffer reagent (62.5% monobasic + 37.5% dibasic; pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide (K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>). 1 mL of the standard rutin and plant extracts at varying concentration levels (0.025 mg/mL–0.1 mg/mL) were added to the FRAP solution. This mixture was incubated in a water bath (BUCHI B-480) at 50°C for 20 minutes. Afterwards, 2.5 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added and the mixture was centrifuged at 300 rpm for 10 minutes; then, 0.5 mL 0.1% iron (III) chloride (FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>), 2.5 mL of distilled water, and the 8.5 mL supernatant from the centrifuged solution (1 : 5:5) were mixed and incubated for 10 minutes, at room temperature. The ferric reducing ability of plant extracts (mg/g Fe (II) equivalent) was measured at 700 nm against the methanol blank. Ferric reducing power (iron (II)) was quantitatively derived using the following equation:
