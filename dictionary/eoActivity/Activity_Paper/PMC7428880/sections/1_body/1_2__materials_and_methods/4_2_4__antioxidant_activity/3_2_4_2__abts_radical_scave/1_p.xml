<p>This was determined as described in [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The stock solution of ABTS was prepared by mixing 7 mM ABTS and 2.45 mM potassium persulfate (K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>) (1 : 1) and was incubated in the dark at 25°C for about 18 hours in order to release its radicals (ABTS
 <sup>+</sup>). The solution was diluted further by the mixture of 1 mL ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> with 50 ml methanol to obtain a working solution (absorbance 0.700 ± 0.0006 at 734 nm). Plant extracts and rutin standard solution of concentration (0.005 mg/mL–0.08 mg/mL) were reacted with 1 mL ABTS in a test tube and kept in dark condition for 7 minutes. The absorbance was determined at 734 nm against methanol (blank):
