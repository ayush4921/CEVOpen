<p>Pulverization of soft flesh and peel samples was done with a food blender (HBF 500S series, Virginia, USA). The boiling of peel samples was done in a water bath (BUCHI B-480). Filtration of sample-solvent mixtures was done using a set-up of the Whatman filter paper, Buchner funnel, and vacuum pump. Aqueous extracts were chilled in a refrigerant chiller (PolyScience AD15R-40-A12E, USA). Freeze-drying of aqueous extracts was done with a freeze dryer (Ceramic Filter Core Drier CD 052), Oven-drying of soft flesh and peel samples was done in an oven (LABOTEC, Durban, South Africa). Homogenization of extracts was done on a shaker (Lasec Stuart Orbital Shaker SSL1); organic (acetone and ethanol) extracts were concentrated using a rotary evaporator (LABOROTA 4000 Heidolph). Absorbance spectra were measured with Hewlett Packard VR-3000 PC spectrophotometer, 765â€‰nm.</p>
