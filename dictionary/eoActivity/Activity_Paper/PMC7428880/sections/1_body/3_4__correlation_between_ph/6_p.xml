<p>Phenolics are secondary metabolites and are broadly dispersed in plant tissues. They are responsible for pigmentation, taste, and flavour in fruits [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A large number of phenols such as eugenol are responsible for taste [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Phenolic compounds have antioxidant activity which has stimulated nutritional interest [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The phenol content was high in all acetone and ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> which is similar to the phenolic levels detected in a number of medicinal plants such as 
 <italic>Terminalia arjuna</italic>, 
 <italic>T. bellerica, T. chebula</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Likewise, the observation is in line with the high phenolic content observed in 
 <italic>Morus nigra</italic> cv. Cherokee, 
 <italic>Solanum melongena</italic> cv. Blacknite, 
 <italic>Vaccinium corymbosum</italic> cv. O'Neal, and 
 <italic>Capsicum annum</italic> as reported by [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] just as [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] also reported similar phenolic content outcomes in the mesocarp and pericarp of 
 <italic>Mauritia flexuosa</italic> and 
 <italic>Theobroma bicolor</italic>.
