<p>Proanthocyanidins, also termed condensed tannins, are polymers of flavonoid molecules [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] present in fruits and flowers of several plants which function as a defence against biotic and abiotic stress and possess antitumor, antioxidant, and immunostimulatory capacity [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Furthermore, proanthocyanidins are hypoglycaemic agents reported to have free radical scavenging capacity [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. They also have inhibitory activity against cancerous cells in the liver [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and ovarian section [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Proanthocyanidin content is high in the ethanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> peels and is comparable to that of similar solvent extractants of 
 <italic>Brachylaena ilicifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, the high proanthocyanidin contents in the acetone extracts of 
 <italic>M. sinensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> fruits are similar to those detected in 
 <italic>Cucumis africanus</italic> fruit by [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the low levels in the aqueous extracts are similarly corroborated by qualitative profiles of aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>M. sapientum</italic> and 
 <italic>M. paradisiaca</italic> and ripened Saba banana as well as in bracts of the Karpuravalli, Nendrum, and Poovan cultivars of banana [
