<p>Phytochemical compounds are secondary metabolites naturally sourced from fruits, vegetables, and other plant products, amongst them are the phenolics, which are central to the signal and defence mechanism in plants. Polyphenols help in reducing the risk of neurodegenerative disease, leukaemia, vasorelaxation, and antiallergenic activity [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] such as glutathione S-transferases and the NADPH: quinine oxidoreductase (NQO1) and preventing the initiation phase of carcinogenesis through the modulation of cytoprotective enzyme activation [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. They are active in a series of signalling pathways that are usually disrupted during tumour initiation and proliferation [
