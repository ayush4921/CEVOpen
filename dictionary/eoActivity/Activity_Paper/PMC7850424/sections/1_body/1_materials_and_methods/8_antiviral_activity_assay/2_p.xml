<p>The cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> extract and baicalein on Vero cells were determined by CCK8 assays (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan). We then evaluated the antiviral efficiency of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> extract and baicalein against SARS-CoV-2 (C-Tan-nCoV Wuhan strain 01) virus 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well and then grown for 24 h. For the full-time inhibition test, cells were pre-treated with indicated concentrations of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> extract or baicalein for 1 h, and the virus (MOI of 0.01, 200 PFU/well) was subsequently added to allow infection for 2 h at 37 °C. Virus input was washed with DMEM and then the cells were treated with medium containing the drugs at various concentrations for 48 h. For the entry inhibition test, after viral infection for 2 h, both the virus input and the drugs were washed out with DMEM and the cells were treated with fresh medium without drugs for 48 h. For the post-entry inhibition test, the drugs were added only after 2 h of viral infection and maintained until the end of the experiment. The supernatant was collected and the RNA was extracted and analysed by relative quantification using RT-PCR as in the previous study
