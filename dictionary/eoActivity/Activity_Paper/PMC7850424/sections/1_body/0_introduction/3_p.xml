<p>COVID-19 was confirmed to be caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), whose genome was sequenced in early January 2020

 </xref>. The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of SARS-CoV with about 79.6% sequence identity
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>5</sup>
 </xref> and remains stable up to now
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>6</sup>
 </xref>. However, the sequence identities vary significantly for different viral proteins
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>5</sup>
 </xref>. For instance, the spike proteins (S-protein) in CoVs are diverse in sequences and even in the host receptors that bind due to the rapid mutations and recombination
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>7</sup>
 </xref>. Although it has been confirmed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as receptor and occupy the same binding site, their binding affinities to ACE2 vary due to subtle interface sequence variations
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>8</sup>
 </xref>. On the contrary, the 3C-like proteases (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) in CoVs are highly conserved. The 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a sequence identity of 96.1%, making it an ideal target for broad spectrum anti-CoV therapy. Although many inhibitors have been reported for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>9–12</sup>
 </xref>, unfortunately none of them has entered clinical trial. Inspired by the previous studies, several covalent inhibitors were rationally designed and experimentally shown to inhibit the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2, with some of the complex crystal structures solved
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>13–15</sup>
 </xref>. In addition, a number of clinically used HIV and HCV protease inhibitors have been proposed as possible cure for COVID-19
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>16</sup>
 </xref> and some of them are now processed to clinically trials
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>17</sup>
 </xref>. Most of the reported SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors covalently target the active site cysteine. Highly potent SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors with diverse chemical structures and mode of action need to explored.
