<p>We performed molecular docking to understand the inhibitory activity of 
 <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> ingredients. The docking scores are listed in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14756366.2021.1873977" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Table S1</ext-link>. In the docking model, baicalein binds well in the substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with its 6-OH and 7-OH forming hydrogen bond interactions with the carbonyl group of L141 and the backbone amide group of G143, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(A)</xref>). In addition, the carbonyl group of baicalein is hydrogen bonded with the backbone amide group of E166. The catalytic residues H41 and C145 are well covered by baicalein, accounting for its inhibitory effect. This computational model is in consistent with the recently reported crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 3CL

 </xref>. As the 7-OH in baicalin is in close contact with the protein, there may not be enough space for glycosyl modification, explaining the low activity of baicalin. As for wogonin, the absence of 6-OH together with its additional 8-methoxyl group alters the binding orientation and weakens the binding strength (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3(B)</xref>). Hydrogen bond is observed between its 5-OH and the backbone carbonyl group of L141, while the interaction with E166 by its 8-methoxy group is weaker than that formed by the carbonyl group in baicalein.
