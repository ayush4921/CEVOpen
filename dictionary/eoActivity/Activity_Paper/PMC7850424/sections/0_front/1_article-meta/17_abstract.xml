 <title>Abstract</title>
 <p>COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and there is an urgent call for developing drugs against the virus (SARS-CoV-2). The 3C-like protease (3CL
  <sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV-2 is a preferred target for broad spectrum anti-coronavirus drug discovery. We studied the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of 
  <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> and its ingredients. We found that the ethanol extract of 
  <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> and its major component, baicalein, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> activity 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> with IC
  <sub>50</sub>’s of 8.52 µg/ml and 0.39 µM, respectively. Both of them inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells with EC
  <sub>50</sub>’s of 0.74 µg/ml and 2.9 µM, respectively. While baicalein is mainly active at the viral post-entry stage, the ethanol extract also inhibits viral entry. We further identified four baicalein analogues from other herbs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup> activity at µM concentration. All the active compounds and the 
  <italic>S. baicalensis</italic> extract also inhibit the SARS-CoV 3CL
  <sup>pro</sup>, demonstrating their potential as broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drugs.
