<p>A spectrophotometrical method was used to evaluate the anti-tyrosinase activity of extracts in which tyrosinase enzyme from mushrooms was used following a method described elsewhere with a slight modification [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The substrate used in this assay was L-Dopa, while kojic acid was used as the standard inhibitor of tyrosinase. The percent inhibition of the enzyme (Inhibition %) by the extracts was calculated at each sample concentration (Âµg/mL) in a similar manner as in the AChE and BChE assay.
