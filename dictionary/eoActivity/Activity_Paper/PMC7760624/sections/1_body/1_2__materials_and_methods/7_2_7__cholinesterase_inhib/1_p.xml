<p>Ellman’s Method was used to evaluate the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibition potential of extracts, and slight modifications were made [
 <xref rid="B31-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Next, 96-well microplates were used and acetylthiocholine iodide (0.71 mM) was the substrate in AChE assay, while butyrylthiocholine chloride (0.2 mM) was the substrate for the BChE assay. In a 96-well plate containing 150 μL sodium phosphate buffer 100 mM (pH = 8), 10 μL of the sample were mixed with 20 μL of enzymes AChE or BChE. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min, after which 10 μL of substrates and 10 μL of Ellman’s Reagent (DTNB 0.5 mM) were added and the volume made up to 200 μL. The absorbance was measured at 412 nm for 10 min. The percentage inhibition of AChE or BChE was determined control using the formula:
