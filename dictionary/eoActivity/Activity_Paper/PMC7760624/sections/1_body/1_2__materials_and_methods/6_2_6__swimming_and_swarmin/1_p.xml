<p>The ability of the extracts to inhibit swarming motility in 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 was performed as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Briefly, swarming plates consisting of, 0.5% NaCl, 1% peptone, 0.5% agar, and 0.5% D-glucose together with extracts at three concentrations of 50, 75, and 100 µg/mL were prepared. 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 was grown overnight and 5 µL of it were point-inoculated at the center, and the swarm plates were wrapped with paraffin and inoculated in an upright position for 18 h. The plates not containing extracts were used as controls. The swarming movement was measured from the swarm diameter fronts.
