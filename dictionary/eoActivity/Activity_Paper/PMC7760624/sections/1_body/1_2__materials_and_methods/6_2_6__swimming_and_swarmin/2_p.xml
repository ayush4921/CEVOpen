<p>The swimming plates consisted of 1.5% agar, 1% peptone, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.5% D-glucose together with the extracts at 50, 75, and 100 Î¼g/mL concentrations. The same bacteria 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 was inoculated as in the swarming model. The inoculation was done for 18 h and control plates did not contain extracts. Swim zone diameter for samples and controls were used in calculating the percentage inhibition of swimming motility.
