<p>The indophenol method, in which the production of ammonia is measured, was used to determine the potential of extracts to inhibit urease [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A mixture of 25 μL of a Jack bean source urease enzyme, phosphate buffer 100 mM (pH 8.2), and 50 μL of urea 100 mM was prepared and after the adding of the samples (10 μL, 1 mM), it was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, 45 μL of phenol reagent 1% (
