<p>These plants have been reported to possess antimicrobial activities, with more emphasis on their essential oil and little information about their extracts, meanwhile the plant seeds are consumed in whole. No studies have reported the ability of these plants to inhibit quorum-sensing-mediated effects in bacteria such as biofilm, violacein production, and swarming and swimming motilities. The aim of this work is to evaluate the ability of 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> and 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> extracts to inhibit biofilm formation, violacein production, and swimming and swarming motilities, as well as acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, urease, and tyrosinase enzymes.
