<p>In every region of the world, selected indigenous plants are used as foods and spices, and investigating their chemical composition and bioactivities has become an interesting field of research. This is because it reveals both the nutritive value and medicinal potential of these food materials used as remedies especially for recalcitrant infectious diseases resulting from food contamination. Spices are defined by Corn et al. (1999) as ingredients usually from vegetables or different dried plant parts like barks, seeds, and leaves added in nutritionally small quantities to food in order to improve its color, taste, or flavor and may also play the role of preservatives that inhibit harmful bacterial growth [

Most spices are added to food recipes primarily for flavoring, seasoning, and imparting aroma to foods rather than for their nutritional benefits, and for this reason, their phytochemical compositions as well as bioactivities are still under-studied [
