<p>The capacity of 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> to inhibit some selected enzymes acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, tyrosinase, and urease are evaluated and reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01768-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. On AChE, the activities of 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> (7.80% ± 0.36%) and 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> (9.65% ± 0.11%) were almost the same but far lower than that of the standard galantamine (80.76% ± 0.52%). This was the same effect for BChE on which percentage inhibitions of 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> and 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> were 15.48 ± 0.57 and 13.64 ± 0.88 respectively against 74.43% ± 0.30% for galantamine.
