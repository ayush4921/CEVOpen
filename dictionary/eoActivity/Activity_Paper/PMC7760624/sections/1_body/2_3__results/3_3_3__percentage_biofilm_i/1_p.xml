<p>Prior to antibiofilm assay, the MIC values were determined and the biofilm inhibition potential of both extracts determined at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations and reported in 
 <xref rid="foods-09-01768-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Both extracts had good antibiofilm activity on 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. On 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, the biofilm inhibition of 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> varied from 45.3% ± 1.5% at MIC to 5.2% ± 1.0% at MIC/8 while that of 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> varied from 52.6% ± 3.3% at MIC to 11.3% ± 1.5% at MIC/8. On 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, at the same concentration, 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> had better antibiofilm activity than 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic>. On 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>, 
 <italic>X. aethiopica</italic> had better antibiofilm than 
 <italic>M. myristica</italic> at the same concentration (
