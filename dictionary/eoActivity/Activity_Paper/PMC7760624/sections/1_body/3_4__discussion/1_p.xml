<p>The chemical composition of both plant extracts were effected using GC-MS. The GC-MS was done after the samples were silylated to enable the detection of a large number of compounds including polar ones. Silylation helps to reduce polarity of compounds contained in the extract while equally rendering them more volatile such that they become detectable on GC-MS. These enabled the identification of major compounds in both extracts. These two plants investigated in this study have evidently been proven to possess antimicrobial activity and have been used extensively to manage infectious diseases [

In this study, the extracts have also demonstrated appreciable antimicrobial activity, and this is advantageous, since the plants are consumed principally in crude form. Antimicrobial activity was displayed by both plant extracts and these results corroborate with some findings in which these plant extracts showed antimicrobial activity against some pathogens [
 <xref rid="B35-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, microbial resistance arises due to quorum-sensing-mediated traits of pathogens which determines the severity of infections as well. The assays that involved quorum-sensing-mediated processes in bacteria are usually focused biofilm formation, violacein pigment production, and swimming and swarming motilities. Prior to these assays, MIC values are determined and they are performed at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations. Thus, working at sub-MIC concentrations, the hypothesis of bactericidal effect of extracts that occurs at high concentrations is eliminated, giving way for QS investigation.
