<p>The bacterial communities that are formed on surfaces constitute a serious health threat and potent contamination. The colonization of various surfaces by bacteria through bacterial motility can be reduced or limited by the use of natural substances and compounds which need to be identified and evaluated for their applications to impede bacterial colonizations [
 <xref rid="B39-foods-09-01768" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Before forming biofilms, bacteria move by swimming and swarming and colonize surfaces, and this step is believed to be an initial step for the formation of the biofilm in flagellated 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01. This bacterium can use its flagella to swim towards surfaces followed by swarming and twitching motilities, which enables it to colonize surfaces and establish biofilm communities.
