<p>Cholinesterase inhibitors are a group of medicines that block the normal breakdown of acetylcholine. Deterioration of the central nervous system and Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) result from cholinergic deficiency and are associated with dementia. As a remedy to this situation, various cholinesterase inhibitors such as natural compounds and extracts and synthetic analogues and their hybrids are being employed [

The enzyme-mediated browning reaction in harvested fruits is usually initiated by the copper-containing oxidase enzyme called tyrosinase. It is an enzyme with multiple functions and is responsible for the undesirable over-pigmentation of human skin in a process that is similar to that which takes place during the browning of fruits. The first two steps in mammalian melanogenesis are catalyzed by this enzyme, and hence the search for potent tyrosinase inhibitors, especially those that can be used safely in cosmetics and foods, is an attraction for researchers [

Many bacteria produce the nickel-dependent urease (ureolytic bacteria) enzyme, which is capable of hydrolyzing urea to produce ammonia with the emission of carbon dioxide as well. The emission of ammonia from agriculture is usually associated with these bacteria, and it also causes a number of infectious diseases [

Although in the enzyme inhibitory assays no extract had an inhibition close to that of the standards, these results are moderate because the extracts were tested at the same concentrations as the pure standard compounds.
