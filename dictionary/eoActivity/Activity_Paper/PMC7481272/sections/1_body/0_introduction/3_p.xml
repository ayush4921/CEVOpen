<p>In north Ethiopia, leaves of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> are macerated in alcohol overnight and used for the management of headache and pain secondary to physical damage. Also, fresh leaves of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> are used against inflammatory skin conditions. However, scientific verification of this folkloric use is lacking. Hence, this study was aimed to assess the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive property of ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic>.
