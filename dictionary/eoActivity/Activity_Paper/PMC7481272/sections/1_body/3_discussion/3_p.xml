<p>Different irritating chemical agents like acetic acid have been used to induce peripheral nociception in rodent models for the assessment of peripheral analgesic activity of medicinal plants.
 <xref rid="cit0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid causes writhes which are characterized by abdominal contractions, movement of the hind paws, inward rotation of one or more feet, twisting or turning of the trunk, and drawing-in of the abdominal wall.

 <xref rid="cit0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In the current study, the acetic acid-induced writhing test was used to determine the peripheral anti-nociceptive activity of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> leaf extract. The leaf extract exerted significant inhibition of peripheral nociception (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 versus the negative control) at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg. The lowest dose (100 mg/kg) has also reduced the number of writhes, though it was statistically insignificant. The analgesic effect of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> leaf extract is consistent with the anti-nociceptive property of chloroform, alcoholic and aqueous leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. spinosa</italic> against acetic acid-induced peripheral nociception.
