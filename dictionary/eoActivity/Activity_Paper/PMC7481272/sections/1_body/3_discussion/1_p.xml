<p>The anti-inflammatory property of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> leaf extract was determined using in vitro hyaluronidase inhibition assay and in vivo carrageenan-induced paw oedema in mice model. The in vitro hyaluronidase inhibition assay is one of the commonly used, simple, validated, reliable, and well-established protocols to study an anti-inflammatory effect of substances. Hyaluronidase is an enzyme that degrades β-1,4 glycosidic linkage of hyaluronic acid which eventually leads to activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release and immunity. Whenever there is inflammation, hyaluronidase enhances tissue permeability and the spread of the inflammatory responses around the affected organ.

 <xref rid="cit0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Medicinal plants with anti-hyaluronidase activity may behave as anti-inflammatory remedies. In this investigation, significant and dose-dependent hyaluronidase inhibition property of the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> leaf was observed.
