<p>Significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in vitro hyaluronidase inhibition was observed for treatments of the hydroalcoholic leaves extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic>. As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001">Figure 1</xref>, the crude extract demonstrated a dose-dependent in vitro anti-hyaluronidase activity. The anti-hyaluronidase property of the crude extract was found similar to the effect of the standard drug, indomethacin. Results of the in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of the extract against carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in mice model are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> exerted statistically significant (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) inhibition of carrageenan-induced hind paw edema in mice at the studied doses when compared to the distilled water-treated group. The in vivo anti-inflammatory property of this extract was observed to increase with dose.
