<p>Resource equation method, based on the law of diminishing return, as described by Charan and Kantharia (2013) was applied to determine the sample size used in the present study as multiple endpoints were measured.
 <xref rid="cit0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Accordingly, the value of the degree of freedom of analysis of variance (ANOVA) (E) is suggested to lie in between 10 and 20 to obtain significant results from the study. The equation given below was used to calculate the value of E and the number of animals used was calculated at E value is 20 to have the highest possible significant results.
