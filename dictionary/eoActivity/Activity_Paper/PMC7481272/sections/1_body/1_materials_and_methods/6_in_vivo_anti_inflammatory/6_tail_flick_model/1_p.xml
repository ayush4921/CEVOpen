<p>Central anti-nociceptive activity of the leaf extract was determined using the tail immersion test method as per the method of Toma et al (2003).
 <xref rid="cit0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Concisely, hot water (55 ± 1 ºC) was used as thermal stimuli. Before the experiment, all mice were screened for sensitivity to the stimuli by immersing two-third of the height of the tail of mice gently in the hot water and mice dislodged their tail from the water within 15 s (15 s was regarded as an endpoint to avoid injury to the mice) were included in this study. Mice were grouped and treated as designated earlier. A basal reaction time of each mouse in each group to the thermal stimuli was determined before treatment (0 min). Response latency of all mice was recorded every 30 min since treatment for 3 hours consecutively.
