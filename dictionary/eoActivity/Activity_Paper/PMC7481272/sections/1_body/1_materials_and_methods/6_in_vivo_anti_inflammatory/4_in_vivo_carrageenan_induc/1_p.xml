<p>In vivo carrageenan-induced paw oedema in mice model was followed as per the protocol described by Posadas et al (2004) to evaluate the in vivo anti-inflammatory property of the leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic>.
 <xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Briefly, the mice groups were treated with their respective test samples orally as per the experimental design stated above. Then, one-hour post-treatment, each mouse has been injected 0.05 mL of carrageenan suspension (1%, w/v) into their dorsal region of the sub-plantar surface of the right hind paw. The initial paw volume of each mouse was recorded before the test sample administration (0 h). After 1 hour of carrageenan injection, right hind paw volumes were measured every 1 hour for 4 hours uninterruptedly using a plethysmometer. Percent of acute inflammation secondary to carrageenan injection was calculated based on the formula given beneath.
