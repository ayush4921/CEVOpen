<p>The ethanolic leaf extract of 
 <italic>H. schulli</italic> was investigated for its in vitro anti-hyaluronidase activity before the in vivo study according to Sigma protocol with slight modifications.
 <xref rid="cit0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Concisely, the assay medium containing 3–5 U hyaluronidase in 100 µL of 0.02 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 0.077 M sodium chloride and 0.01% bovine serum albumin was pre-incubated with 5 μL of different concentrations (10 μg/mL, 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL) of the extract as well as a standard drug (indomethacin) for 15 min at 37 °C. The test was initiated by adding 100 µL hyaluronic acid to the incubation mixture and incubated again for 45 min at 37 °C. The undigested hyaluronic acid was then precipitated with 1 mL acid albumin solution (made up of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in 24 mM sodium acetate and 79 mM acetic acid, pH 3.75). After standing at ambient temperature for 10 min, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was recorded at 600 nm. The absorbance in the absence of enzyme was used as the reference value for maximum inhibition. The activity of the enzyme was checked with a blank experiment conducted simultaneously, in which the enzyme was pre-incubated with 5 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide. Percentage inhibitory activities of the test samples were determined using the formula given below:
