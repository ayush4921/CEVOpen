<p id="p0015">One of the major causes of premature death killing about 50000 people daily in the world is infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to the resistance of human pathogenic microbes to drugs, a subsequent rise in the infectious diseases has been reported leading to increase in mortality rates [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This has resulted in an increased pursuit for plants phytochemicals with the potency to inhibit the proliferation of microbes that have shown or developed resistance to conventional drugs or antibiotics. Plants with one or more of their organs containing bioactive compounds that can be used to synthesize drugs are referred to as medicinal plants according to the World Health Organisation [
