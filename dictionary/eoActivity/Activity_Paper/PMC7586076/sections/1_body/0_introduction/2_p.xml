<p id="p0010">Leguminous plants are known for their nutritional value and economic significance in the world [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Even though legumes are regarded as the poor man's meat, they play a crucial function in the diets and wellbeing of humans especially in poor rural African communities in sub-Saharan Africa because of the high protein and carbohydrates content and assorted phenolic compounds being released when consumed (cooked or uncooked) [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported that legume seeds contain proteins and peptides that could be grouped as nutraceuticals. According to Pandey, Verma, &amp; Saraf, [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], nutraceuticals are synthetic substances or chemical compounds (usually concentrated in powder, capsule or pill form) that can provide therapeutic or wellbeing benefits to humans, including the promotion of disease prevention and treatment. Sasi [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] refers nutraceuticals as any functional food extract with health and medical benefits especially to humans. Also, López-Gutiérrez 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported phytochemicals as non-nutritive compounds in plants with disease-preventive properties. Plant-based nutraceuticals have drawn the attention of most researchers in recent years due to the presence of a vast variety of phytochemicals (some undiscovered) with health benefits and disease-preventive properties.
