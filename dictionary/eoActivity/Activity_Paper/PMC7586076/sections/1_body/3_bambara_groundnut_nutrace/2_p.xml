<p id="p0055">The progressive increase in the resistance of microorganisms to recently available antibiotics has prompted the quest for effective and novel antimicrobial compounds. This quest for effective antimicrobial compounds has directed researchers to focus on plant-based medicine because of their historical use for curing infectious and non-infectious diseases especially in developing and under developed countries [

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] pointed out that these medicinal plants are consumed as elixirs, teas, or juice preparations for respiratory infection treatments. Works done by many researchers [

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] examined five leguminous plants (

 <italic>Humboldtia brunonis</italic>, 
 <italic>Indigofera cassioides</italic>, 
 <italic>Derris scandens</italic> and 
 <italic>Ceasalpinia mimosoides</italic>) for anti-tubercular activity and observed that the legumes contained saponins, steroids, anthro-quinones, terpinods, flavonoids and phlabotanins that showed potential for anti-tubercular activity.
