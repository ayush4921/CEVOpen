<p id="p0035">The plant is capable of surviving in wet climates, and poor-nutrient soil conditions that most non-leguminous plant may not survive [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] indicated BGN as a pest, disease, and drought-resistant crop capable of reducing pest in the field. The ability of BGN to fix atmospheric nitrogen through the process of biological nitrogen fixation reduces the necessity to apply manures or expensive environmentally unfriendly synthetic fertilizers especially in nutrient-poor soils in Africa, where the crop is cultivated by resource-poor farmers. This nitrogen-fixing ability of BGN was supported by work done by Mohale 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] on the symbiotic nitrogen (N) nutrition efficiency of BGN grown in the Lowveld region (Mpumalanga Province) in South Africa. The authors found that BGN was significantly dependent on symbiotic fixation (4–200 kg N-fixed ha
 <sup>−1</sup>) for its N nutrition and contributed N (33–98%) to the nutrient-poor soils in the region [
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the dry savannah regions in sub-Saharan Africa, BGN is a point of interest for utilization and cultivation. In Botswana, 90% of farmers (majority are women) cultivate BGN and 63% of the farmers grew the crop for consumption, 12% of them grew the plant for making a profit and 25% for both feeding and making a profit [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Based on the crop's ability to strive well in harsh conditions such as poor-nutrient soils and drought under future climate change scenarios, the crop is seen as a poverty and poor nutrition remediation crop that can enhance food and nutrition security especially in poor rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa.
