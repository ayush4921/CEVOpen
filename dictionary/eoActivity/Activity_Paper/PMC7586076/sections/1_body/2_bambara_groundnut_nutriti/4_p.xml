<p id="p0050">Generally, most legumes are noted to possess antioxidants [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. White and Xing [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] reported antioxidants as ingredients with the potential of protecting the quality of food by impeding the oxidative breakdown of lipids. Furthermore, Adelakun 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] referred to antioxidants as ingredients that protect the cells and tissues of human against free radicals (reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS)). The seed coats of most leguminous nuts are rich in antioxidants, and differences in amounts of antioxidants in the dark-seeded and light-seeded landraces of BGN have been reported [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Onyilagha 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] reported that the red and black seed coat of BGN contains antioxidants whose antioxidative mechanisms were different from other legumes and were noted to contain more nutrient and mineral content than the light-seeded landraces. In Botswana, the light-seed landrace is preferred for consumption because of less time to cook and superior flavour while the dark-seeded landrace is used to treat impotence [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Interestingly, in Africa, BGN is used by different tribes for the treatment of different diseases. For example, some tribes used BGN to treat nausea and diarrhoea (in Kenya) [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], venereal diseases (in Nigeria) [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], nausea and vomiting in pregnant women (in South Africa) [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and cataract (in Senegal) [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In summary, BGN has different usages, which includes provision of functional food (nutrients and minerals) and health benefits (due to their antioxidant properties) for humans and animals, and as a commodity to generate income or financial support for people in rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, there exists the need to preserve and promote the growth of this crop for the continuous supply of the crop's benefits to the populace in most rural communities in Africa.
