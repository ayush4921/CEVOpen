<p id="p0040">Bambara groundnut serves as a source of protein to the consumers and is grown locally by the rural population to provide food for their immediate families especially in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The works done by researchers have shown that seeds of BGN per 100 g dry weight may contain carbohydrates (49–63.5%), protein (15–25%), fat (4.5–7.4%), fibre (3.2–4.4%), ash (0.7%), and cholesterol (0.01%) [

The fruits of BGN are produced underground and the pods containing at least one or two seeds are noticeably hard and wrinkled when dried. The dried seeds can be boiled and consumed as a functional food. Further, the food crop can be consumed matured as porridge [
