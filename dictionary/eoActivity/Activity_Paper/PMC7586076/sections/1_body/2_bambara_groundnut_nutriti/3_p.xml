 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] also reported the use of BGN flour in making steamed products like “okpa” in Nigeria. Murevanhema and Jideani [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] clarified "okpa" as a cooked mixture like gel produced using BGN paste enveloped by banana leaves and bubbled till prepared for utilization. Further, Heller

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] revealed the application of matured black landraces seed for medicinal purposes. Vegetable milk produced from BGN was ranked first in flavour and composition; and the lighter colour of the milk was most preferred than cowpea, pigeon pea, and soybean milk [
