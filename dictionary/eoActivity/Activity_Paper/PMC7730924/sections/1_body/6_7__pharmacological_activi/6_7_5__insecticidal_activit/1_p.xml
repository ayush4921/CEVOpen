<p>It has been recently discovered that 
 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> exhibit an insecticidal property. The volatile oil from roots of 
 <italic>B. ligulata</italic> containing 1,8-cineole (
 <bold>119</bold>) [4.24%], (+)-(6
 <italic>S</italic>)-isovaleric acid (
 <bold>120</bold>) [6.25%], (+)-(6
 <italic>S</italic>)-parasorbic acid (
 <bold>121</bold>) [47.45%], terpinen-4-ol (
 <bold>122</bold>) [2.96%], and (
 <italic>Z</italic>)-asarone (
 <bold>123</bold>) [3.50%] was tested for its insecticidal activity against 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which was found to be significant [

 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species or its specific component could be deployed as a natural insecticidal agent [
