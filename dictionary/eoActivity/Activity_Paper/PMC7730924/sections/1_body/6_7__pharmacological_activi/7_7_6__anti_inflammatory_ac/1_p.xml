 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species do have anti-inflammatory potential. The aqueous and EtOH (50%) extract of the rhizomes were introduced to animal model (rats) to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory activity. The succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity level (represented higher in inflammation) reduced in the rats that received the therapy. The attenuation of inflammatory response was confirmed through pharmacological and biochemical measurements [

 <italic>B. ciliata</italic> rhizomes have also been tested on a rat model with 100 mg/kg phenylbutazone (an anti-inflammatory agent) as a standard. Maximum inhibition of the inflammatory response was recorded at a dose of 300 mg/kg [

 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> leaves was administered to DBA/2 mice to study the effect on immune response. The extract declined the inflammatory process by preventing T-lymphocyte accumulation and cytokine production in the inflammatory region [
