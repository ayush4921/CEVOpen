<p>It was reported by Ivanov et al. (2011) that crude extracts of 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> rhizomes can efficiently suppress the human pancreatic lipase activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.4 g/mL) in vitro [

 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> leaf extracts are known to suppress the appetite as well as energy intake in rats suffering from high-calorie diet-induced obesity. Compared to controls, a 40% reduction in the daily dietary consumption of the rats tested with 50 mg/kg 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> aqueous leaf extract (seven days of oral treatment) was observed. Moreover, a reasonable reduction (45%) in the triglyceride level was also observed after seven-day therapy [

 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> roots has been reported (using MC3T3-G2/PA6 murine preadipocytes) to exhibit a moderate anti-lipid accumulation activity [
