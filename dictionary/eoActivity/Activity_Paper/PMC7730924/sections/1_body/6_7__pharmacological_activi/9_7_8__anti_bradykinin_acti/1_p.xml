<p>The anti-bradykinin activity of 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> leaf extract (per oral dose/treatment: 50 mg/kg for 14 days) has been studied in 
 <italic>spontaneously hypertensive</italic> (SHR) rats. The reduction in the systolic blood pressure was observed after 3–6 h (by 20–25 mmHg), while a lowering of diastolic blood pressure with similar values was observed after 1 h of treatment [

The angiotensin-I-converting enzyme converts the hormone angiotensin I to the active form (vasoconstrictor: angiotensin II) and thus indirectly elevates the blood pressure by causing the blood vessels to constrict. The EtOH (70%) extract of 
 <italic>B. crassifolia</italic> rhizomes significantly inhibits the angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.128 mg/mL), in vitro, and thus exhibits anti-bradykinin activity [
