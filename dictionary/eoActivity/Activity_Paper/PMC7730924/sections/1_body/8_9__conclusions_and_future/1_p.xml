<p>It is quite evident from this review that the 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> species contains a wide range of bioactive compounds of therapeutic value. The safety and efficacy of 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic> leaves and rhizomes has been time-tested and documented during the long-period of traditional use. However, there is still a scope of research on the mechanism of action of several other aforementioned therapeutic activities. Moreover, among the 32 species, only nine species have been experimentally reported to possess the pharmacological properties. There is a scope for phytochemical analysis and clinical efficacy trials with the rest of the 23 species. To date, 152 compounds have been isolated and characterized from the genus 
 <italic>Bergenia</italic>.
