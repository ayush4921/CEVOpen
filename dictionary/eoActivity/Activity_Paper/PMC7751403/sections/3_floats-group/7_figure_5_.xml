  <p>(A) Effect of compound 
   <bold>7c</bold> on anti-apoptotic proteins. SW-620 cancer cells were treated with two concentrations of compound 
   <bold>7c</bold> for 24 h. Immunoblotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. The band densities were measured and the bar charts were created to compare the effect on proteins. The statistical analysis was performed where the significance of data was assessed at

   <bold>7g</bold> on anti-apoptotic proteins. SW-620 cancer cells were treated with two concentrations of compound 
   <bold>7g</bold> for 24 h. Immunoblotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. The band densities were measured and the bar charts were created to compare the effect on proteins.
