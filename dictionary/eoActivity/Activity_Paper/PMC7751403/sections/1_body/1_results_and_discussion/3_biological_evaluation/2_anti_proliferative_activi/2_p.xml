<p>The anti-proliferative potential of the final compounds (
 <bold>7a-j</bold> and 
 <bold>9a-e</bold>) was examined against two human colorectal cancer HT-29 and SW-620 cell lines. While, HT-29 is an adenocarcinoma cell line, SW-620 represents metastatic cancer cell line. These effects were compared with known anti-cancer drug, 5-Fluorouracil (
 <bold>5FU</bold>) commonly used in colorectal cancer treatment. All of the compounds were found to inhibit the cell viability of cancer cells with varied sub-micro-molar efficacy. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 105 to 611â€‰nM for all compounds were calculated using Graph Pad prism 8 (
