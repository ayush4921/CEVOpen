<p>Bcl2 and BclxL, as anti-apoptotic proteins, are known to be overexpressed in diverse tumours causing cancer cell survival and drug resistance

 </xref>. Treatment of SW-620 with compound 
 <bold>7c</bold> resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Bcl2 and BclxL protein expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(A)</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>7g</bold> was also found to inhibit Bcl2 and BclxL expression in SW-620 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5(B)</xref>). These findings thus indicate that compound 
 <bold>7c</bold> and 
 <bold>7g</bold> inhibited cell viability by inhibiting Bcl2 and BclxL resulting in the apoptosis.
