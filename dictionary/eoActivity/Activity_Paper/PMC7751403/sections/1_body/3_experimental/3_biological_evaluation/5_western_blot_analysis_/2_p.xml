<p>All cells were seeded in a 100 mm dish (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per dish) in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C in the appropriate culture medium. The cells with around 50% confluency were treated with compounds for 24 h. At the experiment day, cells were washed with 1x PBS, harvested and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer, combined with protease inhibitors, (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) as described previously

Lysates were loaded in equal concentration and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by semi-dry. Blocking of the membrane was done by 5% non-fat dried milk for one hour, incubated with the primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were Bcl2 (cat. no. sc-7382), BclxL (cat. no. sc-8392) and β Actin (cat. no. sc-69879) from (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (cat. no. sc-2005) and mouse anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (cat. no. sc-2357) from (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA). Detection was done with Luminol HRP chemiluminescence substrate (cat. no. sc-2048) from (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX, USA) and then visualised by c-digit blot-scanner (LI-COR, Nebraska, USA).
