<p>Induction of apoptosis was measured by Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Annexin V FITC and PI, for flow cytometry (Thermofischer scientific, OR, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. As described previously (39), cells were seeded in a 6-well plate (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well) and treated with the various compound for 24 h. Both floating and adherent cells were harvested, pooled together, and incubated with Annexin V-FITC and PI for 15 min on ice in dark. The cells were analysed by BD FACSCalibur™ cell analyser (BD Biosciences, CA, USA) at an emission of 530 nm (FL1 channel) and &gt;575 nm (FL3).
