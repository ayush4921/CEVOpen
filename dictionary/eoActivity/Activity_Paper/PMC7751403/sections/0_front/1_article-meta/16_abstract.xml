 <p>Mitochondrial anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and BclxL proteins, are overexpressed in multiple tumour types, and has been involved in the progression and survival of malignant cells. Therefore, inhibition of such proteins has become a validated and attractive target for anticancer drug discovery. In this manner, the present studies developed a series of novel isatin–indole conjugates (
  <bold>7a-j</bold> and 
  <bold>9a-e</bold>) as potential anticancer Bcl2 and BclxL inhibitors. The progression of the two examined colorectal cancer cell lines was significantly inhibited by all of the prepared compounds with IC
  <sub>50</sub> ranges132–611 nM compared to IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 4.6 µM for 
  <bold>5FU</bold>, against HT-29 and IC
  <sub>50</sub> ranges 37–468 nM compared to IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 1.5 µM for 
  <bold>5FU</bold>, against SW-620. Thereafter, compounds 
  <bold>7c</bold> and 
  <bold>7g</bold> were selected for further investigations. Interestingly, both compounds exhibited selective cytotoxicity against both cell lines with high safety to normal fibroblast (HFF-1). In addition, both compounds 
  <bold>7c</bold> and 
  <bold>7g</bold> induced apoptosis and inhibited Bcl2 and BclxL expression in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, the high potency and selective cytotoxicity suggested that conjugates 
  <bold>7c</bold> and 
  <bold>7g</bold> could be a starting point for further optimisation to develop novel pro-apoptotic and antitumor agents towards colon cancer.
