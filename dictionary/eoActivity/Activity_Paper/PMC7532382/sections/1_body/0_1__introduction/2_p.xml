<p>Lung cancer is the most common type of cancer and is associated with a high rate of cancer-related mortality worldwide [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Lung cancer is generally divided into two major subtypes: non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer, accounting for 85% and 15% of all lung cancers, respectively [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. More than 70% of patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at an advanced stage with metastatic disease (stage III or IV) [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Current treatment options for lung cancer include surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, for inoperable stage III and IV NSCLCs, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are considered the standard therapy [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Radiotherapy involves exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) to either directly or indirectly kill cancer cells, with the main advantage of localized application in most cases. However, IR can also promote malignant effects in some cases, such as local recurrence and distant metastasis [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. IR at sublethal doses has been shown to promote cancer cell migration and invasion in various cancer cell lines [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and it induced metastasis in an animal model [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Furthermore, IR induces radioresistance, which contributes to the poor prognosis of patients with cancer, and it is the main reason for radiotherapy failure [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These effects can lead to tumor recurrence and metastases. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an effective and safe radiotherapy enhancer that can inhibit the induction of malignant behavior.
