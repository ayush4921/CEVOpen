<p>Although several studies have shown the anticancer effects of extracts and constituents from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], there has been no investigation on the inhibitory effects of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> components on IR-induced migration and invasion of cancer cells. Therefore, as a part of our ongoing search for new radiotherapy enhancers from medicinal herbs, we isolated three triterpenoids from the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> and evaluated their inhibitory activities on the IR-induced migration and invasion of A549 human lung cancer cells.
