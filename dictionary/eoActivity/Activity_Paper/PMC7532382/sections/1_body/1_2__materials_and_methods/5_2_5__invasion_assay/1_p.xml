<p>Cell invasion potential was assessed using a transwell assay, as described previously [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In brief, IR-treated (10 Gy) or nontreated (0 Gy) A549 cells in serum-free medium were seeded (1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells) on the upper surface of Matrigel-coated transwell chambers (BD Biosciences). The lower compartments of the chambers were filled with medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After 16 h of incubation, the cells that invaded the lower surface of the filter were stained using the Diff-Quick Kit (Fisher Scientific) and counted under a microscope (Motic).
