<p>By chromatographic separation of the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic>, we isolated three compounds, which were identified as asiatic acid (1) [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], asiaticoside (3) [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and madecassic acid (2) [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], by NMR spectra analysis and comparison with their published values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).
