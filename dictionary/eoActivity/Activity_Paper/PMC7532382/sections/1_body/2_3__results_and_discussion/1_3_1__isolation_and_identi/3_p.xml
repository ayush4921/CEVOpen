<p>Asiatic acid (1), asiaticoside (2), and madecassic acid (3) have been reported as the major components of 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and these compounds have exhibited anticancer activity in various cancer cell lines. Asiatic acid has showed an antiproliferative effect by regulating apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma cells [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Madecassic acid has also been found to inhibit cell growth by inducing apoptosis in mouse colon cancer cells and exhibit antiproliferative activities in various cancer cell lines via regulation of the ERK signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A recent study showed that the anticancer effect of asiaticoside is mediated by the inhibition of cell migration and invasion via the STAT3 signaling pathway in multiple myeloma [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the anticancer activity of these compounds in the context of their potential as radiotherapy enhancers has not been assessed.
