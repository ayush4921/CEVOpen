<p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that compounds 1–3 isolated from 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> with demonstrated anticancer activity can also inhibit the IR-induced migration and invasion of A549 lung cancer cells. These findings suggest that compounds 1–3 might be effective in improving the radiotherapeutic effect in NSCLC. However, further research on the inhibitory mechanisms of these compounds is required.
