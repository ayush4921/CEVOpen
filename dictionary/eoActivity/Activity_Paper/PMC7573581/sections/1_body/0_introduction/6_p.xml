<p id="Par7">Several potential therapeutic approaches have been experimented to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection such as protein-based vaccine design, blocking of ACE2 receptor and effect of phytochemicals on spike protein binding with its ACE2 receptor. Among the various therapeutic strategies that have been proposed for the treatment of SARS-Co V 2 treatment, drug designing with phytochemicals is a well-known method. Several phytochemicals for example,

 </sup> are analyzed with the help of molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies. In the last study, hesperidin, one of common flavonoids in Citrus sp., has been selected as potent inhibitor with the lowest binding score and the highest binding affinity for different protein receptors.
