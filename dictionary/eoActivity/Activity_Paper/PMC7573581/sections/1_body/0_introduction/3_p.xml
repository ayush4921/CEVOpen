<p id="Par4">Every coronavirus comprises four structural proteins namely spike, envelope, nucleocapsid and membrane proteins. Among them, spike (S) protein is the most vital protein which controls the biological processes such as viral particle attachment, fusion and lastly entry in the host cell. As a result, it can be considered as a target for development of medicines in COVID-19, as well as SARS-CoV infection

 </sup>. The S protein facilitates the entry of virus in human host cells. Initially it binds to ACE2 protein through its receptor-binding domain. Subsequently, it fuses with the viral and host membranes. However SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is about 10â€“20 times more probable to bind with ACE2 on human cells, compared to that of spike protein from the SARS-CoV infection (occurred in 2002).
