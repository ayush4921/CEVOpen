 </sup> suggested that RBD fragment (from amino acid residues 331â€“524 of spike protein) in SARS-CoV-2 strongly binds with human ACE2 (hACE2) as well as bat ACE2 (bACE2) receptors. Thus, this spike protein fragment is responsible for the entry of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in human ACE2-expressing cells. Small molecules, which can affect the binding efficiency of spike protein with its receptor, may act as the viral attachment inhibitor for both infections.
