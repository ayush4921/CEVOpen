<p id="Par11">When spike protein fragment as ligand binds with ACE2 protein, this ACE2 protein functions as virus receptor, participating in the biological process known as the viral particle entry in host cell. Due to presence of a modulator molecule, for example hesperidin, ligand binding activity of spike protein, allosterically may be modulated. Some phytochemicals, which have been reported earlier as spike protein inhibitor for SARS

 </sup> are considered here as small molecules for protein–ligand molecular docking study. These phytochemicals are present in Indian medicinal plants. Name, source, chemical class and structures of phytochemicals e.g. hesperidin, emodin, anthraquinone, rhein and chrysin are enlisted in Table

 </sup>. To study the effect of Indian phytochemicals on spike protein fragment, molecular docking study is used for spike glycoprotein fragment with human ACE2 receptor. Bound structure of spike glycoprotein with human ACE2 receptor is considered here as target molecule for treatment of COVID-19 and the phytochemicals are considered here as modulators. These chemical compounds can bind with the host protein ACE2 as non-competitive molecule and impart their anti-viral activity by destabilizing spike protein binding with human host ACE2 receptor.
