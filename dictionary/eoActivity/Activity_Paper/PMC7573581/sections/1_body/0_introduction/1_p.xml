<p id="Par2">COVID-19 is a deadly disease, where the infection is caused by SARS-CoV-2. The coronavirus particles are spherical in shape having spike proteins around them. These proteins are responsible for virus replication in human host cells. Spike proteins after attaching with human cells, undergo structural changes, which results in a fusion of viral particle membrane with human host cell membrane. Thus, the viral RNA enters into the host cell and produces more viruses after copying its genome. SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins bind to the receptor proteins, on the host cell surface, known as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The molecular level structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has a Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) for binding to host human cells. Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of spike glycoprotein interacts with ACE2 receptor in Protease Domain (PD) of the host human cell, causing viral infection. </p>
