<p id="Par5">ACE2 is a membrane bound receptor for both coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. For the first infection, ACE2 is confirmed as receptor from both ‘in vitro’ as well as ‘in vivo’ studies

 </sup> has experimentally demonstrated that ACE2 is cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human host. ACE2 enzyme having catalytic activity in maturation reaction of angiotensin, which is a peptide hormone. ACE2, a type I membrane bound protein, is expressed in many tissues including heart, kidney, intestine except lungs. ACE2-expressing epithelial cells express several viral replication associated genes
