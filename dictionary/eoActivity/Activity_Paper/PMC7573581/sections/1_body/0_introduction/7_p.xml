 </sup> have used homology modeling technique to model several viral proteins and at the same time, two human target proteins. They have screened probable small ligand molecules from the ZINC Drug as well as traditional Chinese medicine and natural products databases to identify potential molecules to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hesperidin molecule, which is known for its anti-oxidant effect and anti-inflammatory, is obtained from 
 <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic>. In their study, it was observed Hesperidin can only bind to the interface between Spike protein and ACE2 receptor. So, they have suggested that Hesperidin can disrupt the interaction of ACE2 and receptor-binding domain. But, during molecular docking analysis, they used PDB file SARS_CoV-2 _Spike_RBD_homo_Hesperidin considering RBD-S (PDB ID: 6LXT) and PD-ACE2 (PDB ID: 6M18). PDB structure of 6LXT contains structure of post fusion core of 2019-nCoV S2 subunit in dimeric form along with tetraethylene glycol and Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion. Similarly, PDB ID: 6M18 represents angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in complex with sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter B (0) AT1. There are several experimental structures which have been discovered, where spike protein is present as a whole with its receptor ACE2 in RSCB database. But, all of them have some small molecules present as ligands or some other macromolecules e.g. PDB ID 6CS2 containing fibritin. Similarly, PDB ID 6M17 shows the presence of sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter B(O)AT1 in its structure. In this study, specifically the 3D structure of spike protein (from amino acid sequence 331â€“524) and its binding site with its host cell receptor ACE2 protein, are focused. So, homology modeling structure of spike protein is required for molecular docking study.
