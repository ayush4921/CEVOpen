 </sup>. Similarly, two known inhibitors of coronavirus spike proteins such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are also used for similar docking studies with bound structure of ACE2 protein and spike protein fragment. Many binding modes are predicted in the vicinity of all target cavities, which is known as blind docking. The CHARMM energies are estimated on a grid using CHARMM force field
