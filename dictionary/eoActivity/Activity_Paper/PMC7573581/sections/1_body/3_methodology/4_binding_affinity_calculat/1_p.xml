<p id="Par64">The strength of proteinâ€“ligand binding is known as binding affinity. The attraction force between the bound structure of S protein fragment, ACE2 and Hesperidin determine the binding affinity of the ligand towards protein. This affinity determines whether a ligand finally will bound or separate from the protein surface and return to its unbound state. The binding affinity of different docking structures in absence and presence of spike protein for non-competitive modulators are calculated using Dockthor web server
