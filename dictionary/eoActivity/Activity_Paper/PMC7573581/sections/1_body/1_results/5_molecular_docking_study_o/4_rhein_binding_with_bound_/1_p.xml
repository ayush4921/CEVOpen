<p id="Par27">The phytochemical rhein binds with docked structure of spike fragmented protein and human ACE2 receptor with ΔG value − 8.73 kcal/mole. But, the binding site of this chemical is totally different from earlier substances (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). Rhein can bind with only spike protein fragment. It has no interaction with human ACE2 receptor protein molecule.
