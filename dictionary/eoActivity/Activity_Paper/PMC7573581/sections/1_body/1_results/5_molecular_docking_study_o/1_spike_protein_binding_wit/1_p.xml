 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, spike protein fragment (331–524) is shown in red colour, hesperidin molecule in stick model and human ACE2 is shown in blue colour. Hesperidin binds with spike protein fragment and its receptor ACE2 with binding energy − 8.99 kcal/mole. This docked structure is stabilized by two H binding (shown in Figure with green lines) at PHE 457 of spike protein with O7 atom of hesperidin, with bond length 2.618 Å and H atom of small molecule hesperidin with O atom of GLU 455 of spike protein fragment with a distance 2.067 Å. Hesperidin binds at ASN 63, ALA 71, LYS 74 and SER 44 amino acids of ACE2. Detailed analysis of intermolecular contacts (ICs) and list of amino acids which are present in the protein–protein interaction sites of spike protein fragment with ACE2 receptor in absence and presence of hesperidin have been carried out and are presented in Supplementary File 1 (Figure
