 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> has − 2.87 QMEAN score, shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a. QMEAN value is a linear combination of four statistical relevant terms. It provides a Z score to relate it to high resolution X-ray structures with similar size. Higher Z score is related to more favorable model. Ramachandran plots are drawn for this model by using two web servers e.g. Molprobity

 </sup> and PDBsum

 </sup>, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b,c. For this model the overall average value of G-factors is − 0.18, which is not unusual for main-chain covalent forces and dihedral angles. The value of G-factors shows a measurement for unusualness or out-of-the ordinary property. From MolProbity version 4.4
