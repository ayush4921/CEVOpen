<p id="Par36">Binding affinity of ACE2 protein and spike protein fragment as ligand and different natural compounds as modulators, are displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. Above results show that hesperidin molecule binds with ACE2 protein molecule (with binding affinity − 9.167 kcal/mole. But in case of the bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment, hesperidin binding affinity changes to − 8.639 kcal/mole. This result indicates that due to presence of hesperidin, the bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment becomes unstable. For emodin the trend in change of binding affinity is same (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). As a result, this natural product can impart antiviral activity in SARS CoV2 infection as noncompetitive modulator. Anthraquinone and rhein are not considered as modulators from molecular docking study. But chrysin does not show the same antiviral activity.
