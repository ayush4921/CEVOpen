<p id="Par37">Detailed analysis of Molecular dynamics simulation study of bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment has been carried out and added in Supplementary Information 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. From molecular simulation study for various parameters, it can be concluded that hesperidin can act as modulator for the bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment. This modulator molecule decreases the stability of the bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein fragment. This analysis confirms the antiviral activity of natural compound hesperidin as non-competitive allosteric modulator of spike protein binding with its human host receptor.
