<p id="Par34">The strength of protein–ligand binding in the binding site can be expressed as its binding affinity. The strength of attractive force of protein and ligand determines corresponding binding affinity. These binding affinity values of different docking structures of ACE2 and natural products, in absence and presence of spike protein fragment are calculated using Dockthor web server and enlisted in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>. In this soft docking method, standard algorithm precision is set with 1,000,000 evaluations, population size 750 and initial seed value of − 1985 for 24 runs.
