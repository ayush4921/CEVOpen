<p id="Par50">Considering the results obtained from molecular docking studies, phytochemicals hesperidin, emodin and chrysin can be used for COVID-19 treatment, after in-silico mutagenesis study and experimental verification. These phytochemicals have shown comparable spike protein inhibiting efficacy as that of known inhibitors such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. From the molecular dynamics and QSAR study, it can be concluded that for ACE2 receptor protein, ligand binding activity of spike protein fragment, will be decreased noncompetitively by modulator hesperidin. So, this natural compound can show antiviral activity by destabilizing spike protein binding with human host ACE2 receptor. The modulation of hesperidin of ACE2 protein try to prevent its interaction with spike protein. It has been proved by a simple in silico experiment and the result of this experiment in shown in Supplementary Information
