<p id="Par39">Considering the primary sequence from 331 to 524 of Spike protein, a homology modelled structure is built using SWISSMODEL, with template 6lzg.1. B having sequence identity 100.00% and coverage 100%. This modelled structure is validated by Ramachandran plot. This stable spike protein fragment is used for binding with human host ACE2 receptor protein by molecular docking study.</p>
