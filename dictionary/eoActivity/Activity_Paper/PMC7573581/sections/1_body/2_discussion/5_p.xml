 </sup> (results are not shown here). Among three interacting amino acids of spike protein fragments GLN 403 and ASP 416 are well conserved among all sequences. But LYS 451 is conserved among SARS-CoV2 spike proteins and differed with ARG in SARS-CoV spike proteins. Though arginine is a positively charged, polar amino acid, it can be substituted with the other positively charged amino acid lysine. But a change from arginine to lysine is not always neutral. Arginine contains a complex guanidium group on its positively charged sidechain and shows a geometry and charge distribution, which is suitable for ideal binding with negatively charged amino acid residues. It can also form multiple hydrogen bonds. But lysine can also interact with negatively charged amino acid residues with a limited number of hydrogen bonds
