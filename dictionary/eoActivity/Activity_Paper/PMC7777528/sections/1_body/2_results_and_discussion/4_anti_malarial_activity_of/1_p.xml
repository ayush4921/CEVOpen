<p id="Par37">The two phenolic fractions of 
 <italic>K. folosia</italic> were also found to have activity against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> in mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Compared to their respective negative controls, both factions possessed significant suppressive activity at all dose levels tested. They showed the highest activity at 400 mg/kg with fraction 1 and fraction 2 causing 46.32% and 47.53% suppression, respectively. Both fractions prolonged the mean survival days of the treatment groups by 2 days relative to their negative controls although it was not statistically significant. No significant difference in percent change in weight was noted in the treatment groups when compared with the positive controls. Therefore, it can be deduced that the phenolic fractions of 
 <italic>K. folosia</italic> are moderate in their in vivo anti-malarial activity, congruent with earlier reports that extracts containing phenolic compounds and their glycosides have modest levels of antiplasmodial activity [
