<p id="Par41">Perusal of literature reveals that a number of promising anthraquinones and preanthraquinones leads such as visimione, rufigallol, uveoside, aloin and phenyl anthraquinones have been isolated and/or synthesized [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. These compounds are considered as oxidants like artemisinins and 4-aminoquinolines. More importantly, they are catalytic oxidants that enhance the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inside parasitized erythrocytes or increase these cells’ susceptibility to oxygen radicals. The free oxygen radicals formed interact with haem or other biomolecular targets inhibiting its tetramerization to the insoluble haemozoin (malaria pigment) [

Knipholone, being an anthraquinone derivative, is anticipated to undergo one-electron oxidation and subsequently interact with haem (or other biomolecular targets) thereby inhibiting its tetramerization (or detoxification of haem). Similarly, because of the structural similarity of dianellin and phlorizin, a monoglucosidechalcone, its anti-malarial mechanism of action could be due to inhibition of the solute transporter of the host cell membrane induced by the parasite invasion [
