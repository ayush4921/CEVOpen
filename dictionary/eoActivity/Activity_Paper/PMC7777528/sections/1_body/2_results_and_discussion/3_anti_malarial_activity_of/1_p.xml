<p id="Par36">The 80% methanol extract of 
 <italic>K. folosia</italic> showed chemosuppressive effect against

 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). At all dose levels tested, the extract exhibited a statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) dose dependent effect. The extract showed the highest activity with 61.52 and 51.39% suppression at 400 and 200 mg/kg, respectively. Moreover, at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg, the extract significantly extended the survival days of treated groups compared to the negative controls, indicating that the extract has the capacity to lower the overall pathologic effect of the parasite in mice. However, there was no significant difference in percent change in weight before and after treatment among groups except with the positive control group. According to Deharo et al
 <italic>.</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], anti-malarial activity of the 80% methanol extract of 
 <italic>K. folosia</italic> can be regarded as good since it showed greater than 50% suppression at a dose of 200 mg/kg. Previous studies demonstrated that medicinal plants rich in anthraquinones such as aloes and senna possess notable in vivo anti-malarial activity [
