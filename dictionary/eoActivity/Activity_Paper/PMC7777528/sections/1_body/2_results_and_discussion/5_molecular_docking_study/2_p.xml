<p id="Par43">The binding modes of P2FE-400, a designed inhibitor of plasmepsin II, knipholone and chloroquine to plasmepsin II are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. P2FE-400 showed the highest and strongest affinity for the aspartic protease, plasmepsin II, with the HYDE score of − 38.3 kJ/mol. The aspartic protease plasmepsin II has two aspartic acid residues Asp34 and Asp214 (the catalytic dyad) that serve as proton donors and acceptors, respectively, in the amide hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins. As shown in the current study and also described by Jaudzems et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], P2FE-400 forms four hydrogen bonds with the catalytic dyad (Asp34 and Asp214), Val78 and Ser218 amino acid residues. Chloroquine showed a comparable binding affinity with an estimated HYDE score of − 19.7 kJ/mol. The Cl substituent of chloroquine was found to be unsuitable for binding in the hydrophobic cavity of plasmepsin II. Chloroquine forms hydrogen bonds with Gly36 and Val78 amino acid residues. Knipholone and dianellin showed weak binding interaction with HYDE score of − 6.0 and − 4.2 kJ/mol, respectively. Nonetheless, knipholone forms two hydrogen bonds with one of the catalytic dyad (Asp214) and Val78 amino acid residues.
