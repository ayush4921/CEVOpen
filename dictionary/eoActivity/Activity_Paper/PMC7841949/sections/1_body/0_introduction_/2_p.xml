<p>Among many complications associated with DM, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is also common and leads to severe damage of many vital organs. A number of free radicals and reactive oxygen species are formed during metabolism, and using antioxidants, these free radicals are neutralized without any harmful effect to our body. Free radicals may harm our immune system by a number of degenerative ailments. Free radicals are chemically unstable species with unpaired electrons. These unpaired electrons capture electrons from neighboring biomolecules like DNA, proteins, and lipids, thus initiating chain reactions in the body, which triggers the abnormal behavior of these biomolecules.

 </sup> Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, 
 <italic>e.g</italic>., xanthine oxidase, lipoxygenase, etc., affect the production of ROS due to hyperglycemia.

 </sup> Thus, a high level of ROS and oxidative stress in diabetes leads to cellular death through numerous mechanisms that finally leads to tissue damage.
