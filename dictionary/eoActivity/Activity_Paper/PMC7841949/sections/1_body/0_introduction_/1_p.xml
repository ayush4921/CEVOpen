<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM), one of the common metabolic disorders, is usually characterized by irregular blood glucose levels. The elevated level of blood glucose is referred to as hyperglycemia, which results due to the abnormal functionality of enzyme insulin. Insulin is a peptide hormone that is secreted through the islets of Langerhans. Any damage to these cells leads to either less or no secretion of insulin, which consequently leads to uncontrolled levels of glucose in blood.

 </sup> There are many pathways through which diabetes can be controlled, one of which is enzyme inhibition. Since digestive enzymes such as α-amylase have been known to increase blood glucose, one of the methods to control diabetes is the inhibition of this enzyme for controlled digestion of carbohydrates in diabetic patients.

 </sup> α-Amylase is an enzyme (EC.3.2.1.1) that hydrolyzes α-1,4 glycoside bonds of complex carbohydrate molecules such as starch and glycogen to yield glucose and maltose. It contains calcium in its active site and is found in normal serum, saliva, and urine of humans. It is also found in bacteria and other living organisms. Primarily, α-amylase hydrolyzes complex carbohydrate molecules into small oligosaccharides and maltodextrins, and by the action of another digestive enzyme α-glucosidase, they are finally converted to glucose and absorbed in the bloodstream.

 </sup> Therefore, inhibition of α-amylase would be an ideal therapy to control diabetes and its related complications.

 </sup> Prolonged diabetes mainly affects the metabolism of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, water, and electrolytes and thus leads to various structural changes in tissues of vital organ systems in the body, especially the vascular system.

 </sup> The increased level of blood glucose prompts several metabolic signaling pathways that leads to inflammation, cytokines secretion, cell death, and subsequently diabetic complications.

 </sup> Therefore, diabetic patients are commonly found to be associated with damage of heart, kidney, skin, eye, foot, etc. Alzheimer’s disease, a common neurological disorder, is also associated with prolonged effects of this disease.

 </sup> The high prevalence and rapid increase of diabetes have attracted the attention of many researchers, and hence many drugs have been developed for its control and cure. However, to date, no drug has been able to completely cure this disease. Commercially available α-amylase inhibitors are associated with a number of side effects, most commonly gastrointestinal complications. Therefore, there is still a need and space for the development of cheap and less harmful drugs that can be easily available having potent antidiabetic activity.
