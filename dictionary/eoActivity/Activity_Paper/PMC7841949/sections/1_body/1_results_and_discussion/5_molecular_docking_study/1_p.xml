 <italic>In silico</italic> docking simulation was conducted to explore the binding modes of indole-3-acetamide derivatives 
 <bold>1–24</bold> against α-amylase enzyme. The crystal structure of α-amylase (PDB ID: 1HNY) was downloaded from Protein Data Bank for docking study. Docking simulation was performed by MOE-2016 software. Using the default parameters of MOE, the α-amylase enzyme and the newly synthesized compounds were protonated and energy-minimized to get the optimized structures of the protein and compounds. These optimized structures of target protein and compounds were further used for docking studies.
