<p>The methyl-substituted derivative 
 <bold>2</bold> displayed weak antioxidant activity; nonetheless, the dimethyl-substituted compounds 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, and 
 <bold>5</bold> showed superior activity in comparison to compound 
 <bold>2</bold>, which might be due to the addition of another methyl group that resulted in better activity due to the hyperconjugation effect. Compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>7</bold> with ethyl and butyl groups, respectively, also displayed comparable activities to methyl-substituted compounds. Compound 
 <bold>8</bold> bearing a methoxy group displayed better activity than methyl-substituted compounds. However, dimethoxy-substituted compound 
 <bold>9</bold> was less active than compound 
 <bold>8</bold>. The general activity pattern revealed that compounds with halogen substitutions were better antioxidizing agents compared to methyl and methoxy.
