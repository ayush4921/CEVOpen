<p>Limited structure–activity relationship suggested that compound 
 <bold>1</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.6 ± 0.09 μM) bearing unsubstituted phenyl ring demonstrated moderate inhibition against α-amylase enzyme in comparison to the standard acarbose (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.92 ± 0.4 μM). The addition of methyl group at the 
 <italic>para</italic> position of phenyl ring resulted in slightly reduced activity in compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.84 ± 0.1 μM). Compounds 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, and 
 <bold>5</bold> with dimethyl substitutions at different positions of aryl ring displayed variable inhibitory activity. Among them, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.52 ± 0.06 μM) with 
 <italic>meta</italic>- and 
 <italic>para</italic>-substituted methyl groups was moderately active. Changing the position of the methyl group from meta to ortho resulted in decreased inhibitory activity in compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.68 ± 0.08 μM). Nevertheless, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.38 ± 0.1 μM) with methyl groups para to each other showed superior activity among methyl-substituted compounds. Thus, compounds with dimethyl substitution were more active in comparison to mono methyl- and unsubstituted compounds 
 <bold>1</bold> and 
 <bold>2</bold>, which might be due to the better interaction of methyl groups within the active site of enzyme. Nevertheless, compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.42 ± 0.07 μM) and 
 <bold>7</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.43 ± 0.1 μM) with 
 <italic>para</italic>-substituted ethyl and butyl groups, respectively, have shown similar activity (
