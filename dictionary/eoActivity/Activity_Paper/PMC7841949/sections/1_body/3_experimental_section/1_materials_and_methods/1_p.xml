<p>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on precoated silica gel, GF-254 (Merck, Germany). Spots were visualized under ultraviolet light at 254 and 366 nm. EI-MS and HREI-MS spectra were recorded on MAT 312 and MAT 113D mass spectrometers. 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance AM spectrometer operating at 300 MHz. The chemical shift values are presented in ppm (d), relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard, and the coupling constants (
 <italic>J</italic>) are in hertz. The melting points of the compounds were determined on a Stuart SMP10 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected.
