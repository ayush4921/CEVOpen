<p>Indole-3-acetic acid (0.175 g, 1 mmol), pyridine (0.8 mL), and CDI 1 equivalent (0.168 g) were taken in a reaction flask along with acetonitrile (20 mL) and stirred for 45 min at room temperature. The corresponding anilines were then added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was continuously stirred for 2â€“24 h. The reaction was monitored with TLC, and the products were obtained by extraction with dichloromethane. The product was then washed with hexane to get pure product.
