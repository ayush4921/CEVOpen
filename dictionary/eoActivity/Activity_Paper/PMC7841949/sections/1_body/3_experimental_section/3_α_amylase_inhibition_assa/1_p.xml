 </sup> Phosphate buffer (0.2 mM, pH 6.9) in 500 μL of α-amylase solution obtained from 
 <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> (0.5 mg/mL) was incubated with 500 μL of test sample (100, 200, 400, 800, 1000 μg/mL) at 25 °C for 10 min. Sodium phosphate buffer (0.02 M, pH 6.9) with 1% starch solution (500 μL) was added to each tube and further incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was then incubated in boiling water for 5 min after addition of 1 mL of dinitrosalicylic acid. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm after the addition of 10 mL of distilled water. The percentage inhibition was calculated as illustrated
