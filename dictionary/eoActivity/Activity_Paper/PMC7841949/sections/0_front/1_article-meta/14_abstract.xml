 <p>Indole-3-acetamides (
  <bold>1–24</bold>) were synthesized via coupling of indole-3-acetic acid with various substituted anilines in the presence of coupling reagent 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole. The structures of synthetic molecules were elucidated through different spectroscopic techniques including electron ionization-mass spectroscopy (EI-MS), 
  <sup>1</sup>H-, 
  <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and high-resolution EI-MS (HREI-MS). These compounds were screened for their antihyperglycemic and antioxidant potentials. All compounds displayed good to moderate inhibition against α-amylase enzyme with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values ranging between 1.09 ± 0.11 and 2.84 ± 0.1 μM compared to the standard acarbose (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 0.92 ± 0.4 μM). Compound 
  <bold>15</bold> (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 1.09 ± 0.11 μM) was the most active compound of the series and exhibited good inhibition against α-amylase; in addition, this compound also exhibited good antioxidant potential with IC
  <sub>50</sub> values of 0.35 ± 0.1 and 0.81 ± 0.25 μM in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays, respectively. The binding interactions of synthetic molecules with the enzyme’s active site were confirmed via 
  <italic>in silico</italic> studies. The current study had identified a number of lead molecules as potential antihyperglycemic and antioxidant agents.
