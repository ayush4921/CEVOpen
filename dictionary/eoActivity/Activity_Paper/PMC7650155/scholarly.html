Abstract</div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p>Connections between China and the new Spanish colonies in America are known for an exchange of silver for silks and porcelains. That also medicinal drugs and medicinal knowledge crossed the Pacific Ocean is hardly known or discussed. <i>Myroxylon balsamum</i> (L.) Harms var. <i>pereirae</i> (Royle) Harms (â€œNew Worldâ€œ or â€œPeruvian balsamâ€œ) is a botanical balsam that has a long history of medicinal use, particularly as antiseptic and for wound healing. Except for a Chinese article discussing the reception of balsam in China and Japan, no scientific studies on its impact in China and Japan and the channels of transfer from the Americas to Asia exist.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p id="Par2">Description: (1) This section provides a general introduction into <i>Commiphora gileadensis</i> (â€œOld Worldâ€� balsam) as a medicinal category and discusses the specific medicinal properties of <i>Myroxylon balsamum</i> (L.) Harms var. <i>pereirae</i> (Royle) Harms. The section â€œHistorical research and usesâ€� provides a brief survey on some historical analyses of balsam. Aim, design, setting: (2) Applying a comparative textual and archaeological analysis the article critically examines Chinese and Japanese sources (texts, maps) to show (i) what Chinese and Japanese scholars knew about balsam, (ii) where and how it was used, and (iii) to identify reasons why the â€œdigestionâ€� of knowledge on balsam as a medicinal developed so differently in China and Japan.</p> </div> <div class="resultsanddiscussion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results and discussion</div> <p id="Par3">This chapter discusses the introduction of â€œPeruvian balsamâ€� into, its uses as a medicinal as well as its scholarly reception in early modern China and Japan and introduces the channels of transmission from Spanish America to Asia. It is shown that <i>Myroxylon balsamum</i> (L.) Harms var. <i>pereirae</i> (Royle) Harms was partly a highly valued substance imported from the Americas into China and Japan. But the history of the reception of medicinal knowledge on Peruvian balsam was significantly different in China and Japan.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par4">In Japan, the knowledge on <i>Myroxylon balsamum</i> was continuously updated, especially through mediation of Dutch physicians; Japanese scholars, doctors and pharmacists possessed a solid knowledge on this balsam, its origin and its medicinal uses. In China, on the contrary, there was no further â€œdigestionâ€� or development of the knowledge on either <i>Myroxylon balsamum</i> (L.) Harms var. <i>pereirae</i> (Royle) Harms or <i>Commiphora gileadensis</i>. By the late nineteenth century, related medicinal and even geographic knowledge had mostly been lost. The interest in â€œbalsamâ€� in late Qing scholarship was pure encyclopaedic and philosophic.</p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p id="Par6">Chinese scholars of the early seventeenth century knew that the region of Peru in Spanish America was rich in silver ore. In 1602, the world map <i>Kunyu Wanguo quantu</i> å�¤è¼¿è�¬åœ‹å…¨åœ– (Map of the Myriad Countries of the World; 1602; Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a</a>) of the Italian Jesuit missionary, Matteo Ricci (1552â€"1610), had been printed. Ricci had prepared it for Chinaâ€™s Wanli Emperor (r. 1572â€"1620). With this map, Ricci introduced Western geographical knowledge, including information about the new Spanish colonies in America to the Chinese. The map had a great impact in China; it was published in five successive editions, attracting the attention of many scholars. Of particular interest is a section on Peru (Bolu å­›éœ²), see Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a</a>. Some 20 years later, Giulio Aleni (1582<i>â€"</i>1649), following Ricciâ€™s format, drew his own map <i>Wanguo quantu</i> è�¬åœ‹å…¨åœ–, included in his geographical treatise <i>Zhifang waiji</i> è�·æ–¹å¤–ç´€ (Record of the Countries Beyond Imperial Administrations; 1623). Aleni also mentions Peru (Bolu å­›éœ²), and speaks of â€œextremely rich gold and silverâ€� ores (<i>gu jinyin zuiduo</i> æ•…é‡‘éŠ€æœ€å¤š) [<a href="#CR1">1</a>]. Under the entry â€œJinjiaxila é‡‘åŠ è¥¿è Ÿâ€�, referring to â€œCastilia Delâ€™oroâ€�, that is, the new Spanish colonies in Latin America, silver and gold reserves are mentioned that â€œrank first under Heavenâ€� (<i>tianxia cheng shou</i> å¤©ä¸‹ç¨±é¦–), and â€œat the foot of the mountain there is a city, called â€˜Silver Cityâ€™â€� (Yincheng éŠ€åŸŽ) [<a href="#CR2">2</a>]. This is definitely a reference to PotosÃ­, rendered on his map as Boduoxi æ³¢å¤šè¥¿ Mountain, but not described in the text, [<a href="#CR3">3</a>] see Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1</a>b, c. Rumours even had it that a certain Mount Jiyi æ©Ÿæ˜"å±± (also åŠ æº¢, äº¤é€¸ or ä½³é€¸), probably Cavite (?), the Spanish harbour on Luzon, would produce huge amounts of gold and silver [<a href="#CR4">4</a>]. The military official Yan Yinglong é–»æ‡‰é¾�, and a local merchant called Zhang Yi å¼µå¶·, memorialized the emperor that a certain Mount Jiyi â€œproduces gold and silver, and by proceeding there by ship to wash for it, it will be possible to obtain 100,000 <i>liang</i> of gold and 300,000 <i>liang</i> of silver every yearâ€� [<a href="#CR5">5</a>]. Also <i>Dongxiyang kao</i> speaks of gold and silver as local products [<a href="#CR6">6</a>]. Interestingly, as we will see below, in addition to the references to silver, the just mentioned maps also speak of â€œbalsamâ€�. Why should balsam be mentioned on maps portraying the East Asian maritime world? </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span></a></div>   <p><b>a</b> Peru section from Matteo Ricciâ€™s Kunyu Wanguo quantu å�¤è¼¿è�¬åœ‹å…¨åœ–;Â <b>b</b> Map Peru section from Giulio Aleniâ€™s Zhifang waiji è�·æ–¹å¤–ç´€; <b>c</b> Peru section from Giulio Aleniâ€™s Zhifang waiji è�·æ–¹å¤–ç´€</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par7">This brings us to the question of what else was known in China and Japan about Spanish America, and which products were, for example, imported into China other than silver? Medicinals were some of those other products, and medicinal knowledge definitely belonged to the kind of information that sometimes crossed oceans, perhaps unintentionally or even accidentally but that could revolutionize health systems in other countries. Balsams belonged to this kind of medicinals. In this connection, the present article wants to look at one particular plant, the resin of which was used for medicinal purposes, and for the embalming of corpsesâ€"this was the so-called â€œPeruvian balsamâ€�, a botanical balsam that has a long history of medicinal use, particularly as an antiseptic and for wound healing. Except for two Chinese articles discussing the reception of balsam in China and Japan [<a href="#CR7">7</a>], basicallyÂ no scientific studies on its impact in China and Japan and the channels of transfer from the Americas to Asia exist.</p> <div class="historicalcontextandsetting:balsamasaclassofmedicinaldrug" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Historical context and setting: balsam as a class of medicinal drug</div> <p id="Par8">Old World balsam was the most expensive aromatic plant in the ancient world. During Hellenistic and Roman-Byzantine times, <i>Opobalsamum</i> [that is, â€œjuice of the balsamâ€�] plant, or the â€œBalm of Judeaâ€� was frequently mentioned [<a href="#CR8">8</a>]. It grew wild in the Arab Peninsula but was rare. Only in Judea, and in the oases of Jericho and Ein Gedi was it cultivated, as Pliny the Elder (23â€"79 CE) noted [<a href="#CR9">9</a>]. Growing balsam was a monopoly of the ruler, and balsam sold for high prices. Originally cultivated under Jewish rule, the practice was continued under the Roman Empire, creating substantial revenue for the Roman treasury [<a href="#CR10">10</a>]. According to Pliny, pharmaceutical industries used every part of the plant: the wood (<i>xylobalsamum</i>), the fruit, the bark and the pure sap [<a href="#CR11">11</a>]. In the Roman middle period, cultivation moved to Egypt. As Zohar Amar and David Iluz emphasize, the balsam of the classical sources (<i>Commiphora gileadensis</i>) belongs to the incense plant family Burseraceae, including within it plants that still grow wild today in the dry, stony hills around the Red Sea [<a href="#CR12">12</a>]. While the collection of sap from frankincense and myrrh normally took many weeks to several months, the sap from the balsam tree, which was harvested at the same time, only needed an incision made with a knife, harvesting occurring relatively quickly [<a href="#CR12">12</a>].</p> <p id="Par9">Bertold Laufer provides a detailed discussion of the properties and uses of this â€œbalm of gileadâ€�, along with a physical description of the plant as described in ancient and middle period texts, as well as information on the treeâ€™s distribution. â€œBalm of gileadâ€� grew above all in the neighbourhood of Mecca and Medina, and in Abyssinia. It was transplanted to Palestine in historical times, where it was cultivated [<a href="#CR13">13</a>].</p> <p id="Par10">Carrying a unique aroma, â€œbalm of gileadâ€� was a valuable perfume among the social elites of the time, but was also renowned for its medicinal properties. To mention are its effectiveness against headaches, against early-stage cataracts and blurred vision. â€œBalm of gileadâ€� was also used as a diuretic, as a curative for respiratory diseases and coughing and as an anti-toxinâ€"for example, as a snake venom antidote [<a href="#CR14">14</a>]. In addition, it was used against cervical infections and in delaying menstruation [<a href="#CR15">15</a>], but, above all, for treating injuries and healing tissue [<a href="#CR10">10</a>]â€"an ability that balsam was also highly appreciated for in early modern times, as will be seen below. Balsam was, consequently, a renowned plant, similar to myrrh or frankincense, substances also highly valued in China since the early middle period.</p> <p id="Par11">Around 23 liters of resin sap could be produced per tree per year. In order to increase quantities, the sap was often mixed with a neutral carrier oil and other ingredients. As we will see, imported Peruvian balsam was also frequently used and traded as oil for this purpose. Balsam fetching high prices, it should surprise us little that various adulterations were also circulating. Pliny already stressed methods for detecting adulterations of the pure sap, namely involving its dilutability: balsam solidified in hot water and sank to the bottom of the container while the adulterated substance floated on top of the water like oil [<a href="#CR16">16</a>].</p> <p id="Par12">Balsam was traded across the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean worlds, and reached places as distant as China, where we find it transcribed in Tang times (618â€"906) as â€œ<i>aboshen</i>â€� é˜¿å‹ƒå�ƒ (Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>)â€"perhaps deriving from the Syriac word â€œ<i>Ä�pÅ«rsamÄ�</i>â€� (?) [<a href="#CR17">17</a>].

Balsam was particularly used in Muslim medicine, which was introduced into China after the Tang period, especially since the thirteenth century during Yuan times (1271â€"1367) [<a href="#CR22">22</a>]. Balsam appears as a remedy various times in the late Yuan, early Ming period <i>Huihui yaofang</i> å›žå›žè—¥æ–¹ (Muslim Medicinal Recipes) [<a href="#CR23">23</a>]. We find, for example, the following entries:</p> <p id="Par17"> </p><div class="disp-quote" title="disp-quote"> <p id="Par18">[Ar.] <i>á¸¤abb l-balasÄ�n</i> [balm of Gilead, <i>Commiphora opobalsamum</i>; <i>Sambucus nigra</i>] ([subtext] this is a pill medicinal made from an oil from a tree in the [al-]Misr [Egypt] land) <i>â€¦</i></p> <p id="Par19">[Pr.] <i>â€˜Ud-e balasÄ�n</i> [wood of <i>C. opobalsamum</i>] ([subtext] this is a black-colored myrrh) <i>â€¦</i></p> <p id="Par20">Use oil of [Ar.] <i>balasÄ�n</i> [balm of Gilead, <i>Commiphora opobalsamum</i>] ([subtext] [Pr.] <i>roughan-e balasÄ�n</i> [â€œoil of balmâ€�]) ([subtext] <i>roughan-e balasÄ�n</i>) to smear the hand. <i>â€¦</i></p> <p id="Par21">[Pr.] <i>BalasÄ�n</i> [balsam-tree, balm of Gilead, <i>Commiphora opobalsamum</i>] seeds ([subtext] <i>tukhm-e balasÄ�n</i> [â€œbalsam-tree seedâ€�]) [<a href="#CR24">24</a>].</p> </div> <p /> <p id="Par22">As we will see below, the expression <i>aboshen</i> appears in the sources until Ming times, and the Chinese knew balsam as a product originating from the eastern Mediterranean and the Arab worlds. And also the medicinal qualities of balsam, especially against skin diseases and sores, were already known in China during Tang times. It was only with the advent of the Jesuits that balsam from the New World, that is, from the new Spanish colonies in America, was introducedâ€"the balsam of Peru.</p> <p id="Par23">Actually, the balsam of Peruâ€"that belongs to a quite different family, Fabaceae, that is interestingly nowhere close to the family of the Old World balsam, Burseraceaeâ€"originally came from the part of Central America known as Salvador or balsam coast, so the name is at least misleading. Albert Hale traces this misnomer back to European ignorance of the American continent. Next to Mexico, Peru was the land of El Dorado and everything originating from the Pacific â€œwas apt to be called Peruvian, whether from Peru itself, from Chile, or the mysterious PotosÃ­â€� [<a href="#CR25">25</a>]. I would argue though that the misnomer has to be traced back to the fact that the balsamâ€"as well as many other products tooâ€"was originally shipped from the port of Callao, Lima, in the Viceroyalty of Peru. The so-called â€œbalsam coastâ€� extends along the western Pacific coast of Salvador between the ports of Ajacutla and La Libertad, just approximately 40 miles of coast. The tree grows in the coastal regions of modern El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and Cuba at approximately 300 to 700 m above sea level.</p> <p id="Par24">Albert Hale mentions that Peruvian balsam has been shipped in coconuts and, consequently the shipped product was also called â€œcocoa balsamâ€�. The ancient native name for it was â€œ<i>hoitziloxitl</i>â€� [<a href="#CR26">26</a>]. The outer wood of the balsam is white, the inner part red or even black, and due to its extraordinary hardness, Peruvian balsam wood is also good for furniture or even construction.</p> <p id="Par25">Although the Peruvian balsam trees produce sap the entire year, the sap is most abundant in the dry season, in summer. In the early twentieth century, when Albert Hale was writing, there were balsam gatherers living close to the trees. They collected and sold the sap to merchants for further distribution [<a href="#CR27">27</a>]. He describes the process of recovering the sap as follows: the gatherers make rectangular holes in the bark of the tree, between 25 to 28 holes of 15 to 16 cm in depth. For 5 to 8 days, the sap flows slowly, but steadily. The natives use very clean cloth to collect it.</p> <p id="Par26">After 8 to 10 days of slow, steady flow, the flow of the balsam stops and has to be reinitiated by very carefully applying heat using burning torches. This kind of procedure is repeated year after year. As a rule, trees recovered fast, but there was a need for care. One had to pay attention to trying not to extract too much sap at any one time in order to prevent injuring or even destroying the tree.</p> <p id="Par27">Adulteration is done by mixing the pure sap with raw sugar, or with the husks of cacao diluted in water. When the collection process is over, the pieces of cloth are put into water and boiled for half an hour, impurities skimmed off. As the balsam is still in the meshes of the cloth, the cloth is put into a primitive press to squeeze out the balsam substance, so as to make it settle to the bottom of a kettle (the specific gravity of balsam is higher than of water).</p> <p id="Par28">Another purification process follows. What remains is the pure or crude balsam that is then sold and, as a rule, undergoes another clarification process to drive out water through evaporation. A healthy balsam tree would, thereby, provide between 3 and 4 lb of sap annually [<a href="#CR28">28</a>]. The historical use of balsam, Albert Hale, expounds, was almost entirely surgical. â€œApplied to wounds, balsam seemed to have a wonderful power to stimulate the healing process, while being at the same time a natural anti-septic, incapable of doing harmâ€�â€"and it was still used like this in the early twentieth century, effective also in skin diseases and parasitic irritations. Cinnamic acid, one of its ingredients, has been considered helpful when applied, for example, against tuberculosis [<a href="#CR29">29</a>].</p> </div> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Description: medicinal properties and uses</div> <p id="Par30">Balsam of Peru is a resin obtained from the bark of the tree <i>Myroxylon balsamum</i> (L.) Harms var. <i>pereirae</i> (Royle) Harms (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">2</a>) [<a href="#CR30">30</a>]. Apparently, little information is available on the qualitative and quantitative chemical composition of Peruvian balsam. The oleoresin is said to contain some 250 ingredients with a resin content of 20% to 40% [<a href="#CR31">31</a>]. Major components are benzyl cinnamate and Benzyl benzoate and it is still used today and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [<a href="#CR32">32</a>]. It is approved and categorized today as a herbal medicine product [<a href="#CR33">33</a>]. Balsam of Peru increases blood flow to wound areas and also helps to fight bacteria, qualities that explain the excellent healing qualities that are ascribed to it in our historical sources. Today it is used, in combination with other medicinals, to treat sores and other skin ulcers. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 2</span></a></div>   <p><i>Myroxylon balsamum</i> (L.) Harms var. <i>pereirae</i> (Royle) Harms</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par31">Peruvian balsam, either black or white, was obviously very popular in the early modern world, although in seventeenth-century Europe also doubts about its efficiency arose [<a href="#CR34">34</a>]. The balsam constituted a definite component of many shipments from Spanish America to Asia. R. M.Â Pacheco Olivera hasÂ identified seven galleons departing from Mexico that carried Peruvian balm as part of the cargo, the <i>San Joseph</i> in 1772, <i>Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la Lu</i>z in 1775, <i>San Joseph</i> in 1780, <i>San AndrÃ©s</i> departing from San Blas in 1786, the <i>San JosÃ©</i> in 1788, one unidentified galleon in 1791, carrying also vinegar and the galleon <i>Nao Magallanes</i> in 1809 [<a href="#CR35">35</a>]. Balsam of Peru was, for example, used in wound treatments and chest ailments [<a href="#CR36">36</a>]. But we also know that other kinds of balsams, mostly as oils, were shipped from Spanish America to Asia, although the Spanish shipped large quantities to Spain as well, and the Spanish were, by far, not the only suppliers of medicinal plants from Spanish America [<a href="#CR37">37</a>]. As Stefanie GÃ¤nger stresses, â€œ(t) hough the exact routes and the volume of illegal trade in Americaâ€™s medicinal plants elude usâ€"the difficulty of pursuing the plants onto a contrabandistâ€™s vessel or through the bustle of a marketplace render any mapping or quantification necessarily fragmentaryâ€"the paper trail in Spainâ€™s archives leaves little doubt that foreign merchants handled a significant volume of contraband, and that Spain faced â€˜much difficultyâ€™ in closing the tradeâ€™s many â€˜gateways and entriesâ€™â€� [<a href="#CR38">38</a>].</p> <p id="Par32">By the early to mid-eighteenth century, Peruvian balsam, <i>cinchona</i> (<i>Cinchona officinalis</i>, Chin. <i>jinjiâ€™na</i> é‡‘é·"ç´�, also called â€œJesuitsâ€™ barkâ€�) [<a href="#CR39">39</a>], the bark of which was used for medicinal purposes [<a href="#CR40">40</a>], <i>sarsaparilla</i> [<a href="#CR41">41</a>] (very similar to the so-called â€œChina rootâ€�, <i>tu fuling</i> åœŸä¼�è‹" in Chinese) [<a href="#CR42">42</a>], that is, several plants belonging to the genus <i>Smilax</i> and used against the early modern scourge of syphilis, <i>jalap root</i>, whose turnip-shaped roots were used as purgative, <i>guaiacum</i> (<i>Guaiacum officinale</i> (LINN.) [<a href="#CR43">43</a>], a mild laxative and diuretic, and <i>ipecacuanha</i> (<i>Carapichea ipecacuanha</i>) [<a href="#CR44">44</a>], widely used as a syrup to cure diseases such as influenza, belonged to the basic stocks of pharmacies in Europeâ€™s cities [<a href="#CR45">45</a>]. According to the 1748 report of the Jesuit Juan Francisco Toro from Lima, <i>cinchona</i>, <i>guaiacum</i>, <i>ipecacuanha</i>, but also <i>contrayerva</i>, a medicinal rhizome of various tropical Central American and South American species of <i>Dorstenia</i> of the family Moraceae that is also used to induce sweating or used against snakebites, and Peruvian balsam, were among the most commonly used remedies in the practice of medicine in Peru [<a href="#CR46">46</a>].</p> <p id="Par33">Peruvian balsam was also tested as a treatment against scurvy. It is mentioned by James Lind (1716â€"1794) among various other medicinal drugs used for this purpose [<a href="#CR47">47</a>]. The effects of balsam in preventing scurvy, however, turned out to be disappointing and could be discarded after experimenting. Sir Gilbert Blane (1749â€"1834), in a list of drugs frequently used in the British Royal navy, records a total of sixty-three medicinals, among them Peruvian bark and balsam, but used for wounds [<a href="#CR48">48</a>].</p> <p id="Par34">It is clear that there also existed a market for certain medicinals from Spanish America in Asia, definitely in China and Japan. As Stefanie GÃ¤nger stresses with reference to a letter to the Marques de Sonora (1720â€"1787) dated October 19, 1786, the Viceroy Antonio Caballero y GÃ³ngora repeatedly mentioned plans to increase the consumption of <i>cinchona</i> in Asia and export it via Acapulco to the Philippines [<a href="#CR49">49</a>]. Peruvian balsam and <i>cinchona</i> were also among the medicinals that were imported into Japan through the port of Nagasaki by merchants from various countries, including Portuguese and Dutch, active in the resale of these drugs [<a href="#CR50">50</a>]. These medicinals were available and traded further across the Indian Ocean or via the Atlantic to cities as far away as Istanbul and Smyrna (modern Izmir), also reaching markets in Syria or Iran [<a href="#CR51">51</a>].</p> <p id="Par35">BernabÃ© Cobo (1580â€"1657), who lived in PotosÃ­, serving in the local Jesuit Mission there between 1615 and 1618, describes the Peruvian balsam as follows:</p> <p id="Par36"> </p><div class="disp-quote" title="disp-quote"> <p id="Par37">The tree which produces Balsam in these Indies is not of a single species, but of three or four. This liquor is very similar to that of the Syrian Balsam, and not inferior to it in aroma and virtues. One species of tree which yields this Balsam, and in the greatest quantity, grows in the diocese of Guatemala where I saw it, and in other warm lands. It grows larger than a mulberry, and has a thick trunk, and fragrant as well as tough wood â€¦ . On scarifying the trunk of this tree a liquid exudes which we call Balsam, the colour of treacle, a blackish red, of a sharp, somewhat bitter flavour and a strong but pleasing smell. This liquid is also extracted in another way, which is to boil in water the shoots and tender twigs especially picked for this purpose, immersing them in an earthenware vessel with nothing but water â€¦ [<a href="#CR52">52</a>]</p> </div> <p /> <p id="Par38">Cobo speaks here of several species of balsam trees. The first one, which he claims to have personally seen, was indigenous to the San Salvador district of Guatemala, and it was the balsam, which, according to A. W. Haggis, commercially supplanted the â€œrealâ€� balsam from Peru, which was shipped across the Pacific from the port of Callao, Lima [<a href="#CR53">53</a>]. The real and much superior balsam of Peru was that which Cobo describes by the Quichuan name of â€œQuina-Quinaâ€�, indigenous to Peru.</p> <p id="Par39">This is consequently an early description of the balsam tree, botanically <i>Myroxylon balsamum</i> var. <i>pereirae</i>. That neither of these two described balsam trees was identical with the <i>genus Cinchona</i>, or the â€œJesuitsâ€™ barkâ€� from Peru, becomes very obvious when we read Coboâ€™s description of a so-called fever tree: â€œIn the district of the city of Loja, diocese of Quito, grows a certain kind of large tree, which has bark like the cinnamon, a little more coarse, and very bitter; which, when ground to powder, is given to those who have a fever, and with only this remedy, it leaves them. Having taken a quantity of this powder, to the weight of two <i>reales</i>, in wine or in some other liquid, soon after it reduces the temperature. These powders are now very well-known and esteemed, not only in all the Indies but in Europe, and are urgently sent for and demanded from Romeâ€� [<a href="#CR53">53</a>].</p> <p id="Par40">This description clearly refers to <i>Cinchona</i>. An even earlier text, printed in 1638 and written by an Augustinian monk, Antonio de la Calancha (1584â€"1684), also describes this same â€œfever treeâ€�: â€œA tree grows which they call â€˜the fever treeâ€™ (<i>Ã¡rbol de calenturas</i>) in the country of Loxa, whose bark, of the colour of cinnamon, made into powder amounting to the weight of two small silver coins and given as a beverage, cures the fevers and tertianas; it has produced miraculous results in Limaâ€� [<a href="#CR54">54</a>]. I mention this here in this context because records on the balsam tree of Peru are sometimes confusing, so that one starts to ask which species or <i>genus</i> a description actually refers to [<a href="#CR55">55</a>]. And the bark of the tree that was commercially sold as a drug most probably did not always stem from the <i>cinchona</i> tree, but may well have come from the Peruvian balsam tree (or even other trees).</p> </div> <div class="historicalresearchanduses" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Historical research and uses</div> <p id="Par41">Research on the balsam of Peru started in the seventeenth century in early modern Europe. In this context, I would like to mention, for example, Johann Adrian Slevogt's (1653â€"1726) dissertation (1705) <i>Balsamum verum quod vulgo opobalsamum dicitur</i> [<a href="#CR56">56</a>]. This botanical dissertation, specifically dedicated to the investigation of balsam, explains its characteristics, varieties, and uses. It includes several references (p. 18, 25) to the balsam of Peru. At the end of this work, Slevogt also includes his opinions on Peruvian bark (<i>cinchona</i>). There is also the dissertation of Johann Wilhelm, carried out under the supervision of the German physician and chemist, Frederick Hoffmann the younger (1660â€"1742), professor of medicine at the University of Halle [<a href="#CR57">57</a>]. The dissertation examines the use of turpentine oil as a medium for applying Peruvian balsam in the treatment of various diseases. Accordingly, it could be used against scabies, worms, kidney disease, gonorrhoea, and conditions of the digestive and urinary tracts.</p> <p id="Par42">The balsam treeâ€"mostly used as an oil (that is, the resin of the balsam tree), fragrance or fragrance and incense balls (<i>xiangqiu</i> é¦™ç�ƒ)â€"and knowledge about its application and uses also entered China and Japan and became a highly valued substance among various members of society. It was especially used for medicinal purposes but also for preserving dead corpses. We also know that balsam was used as an ointing oil in churches and cathedrals: In 1756, for example, Juan de la Fuente Yepes, bishop of the cathedral Nueva Segovia in Manila, in a letter requested from the authorities in Mexico, among many other items, four ounces of an ointing oil for consecration (4 onzas de bÃ¡lsamo para la consagraciÃ³n de los Santos Ã"leos) [<a href="#CR58">58</a>].</p> </div> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Evidence from Chinese texts and maps</div> <p id="Par43">Under the entry Peru, the famous map by Matteo Ricci, <i>Kunyu Wanguo quantu</i> (see Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a</a>), refers to a â€œfragranceâ€� (<i>xiang</i> é¦™) called â€œ<i>baâ€™ershamo</i>â€� å·´å°"å¨‘æ‘©, a tree which produces an oil, that is a resin, when cut; â€œused to balsam corpses, they do not decomposeâ€�. And the point where the tree has been cut entirely recovers after 12 h (<i>zhou shiâ€™er shi ji ru gu</i> å‘¨å��äºŒæ™‚å�³å¦‚æ•…). (The balsam) also occurs in Judaea (<i>Rudeyaguo yi you zhi</i> å¦‚å¾·äºžåœ‹äº¦æœ‰ä¹‹) [<a href="#CR59">59</a>]. This balsam of Judaea (also â€œMecca balsamâ€�) was used in the ancient and middle period Mediterranean area, as we have seen above. Ricci was consequently aware of the use and importance of balsam in the ancient world, and links it up to the balsam from the New World. This implies that both balsams possessed similar or even almost identical properties, or were at least used in similar ways.</p> <p id="Par44">Chen Ming draws our attention to the novel <i>Sanbao taijian Xiyangji tongsu yanyi</i> ä¸‰å¯¶å¤ªç›£è¥¿æ´‹è¨˜é€šä¿—æ¼"ç¾©, attributed to Luo Maodeng ç¾…æ‡‹ç™». Scene 86 mentions that the king of Aden presented Zheng He with balsam (é˜¿å‹ƒå�ƒ) as a gift. But the description of this balsam is obviously taken directly from Luo Yuejiongâ€™s ç¾…æ›°è¤§Â <i>Xianbin lu</i> å’¸è³"éŒ" (Records on All Guests), preface dated 1591, so that Chen Ming concludes that knowledge and use of balsam during the Ming period was very restricted [<a href="#CR60">60</a>]. <i>Xianbin lu</i> states that â€œbalsam oil is very efficient as an ointment against scabies and sores, but its price is extremely highâ€� (é˜¿å‹ƒå�ƒæ²¹å®œå¡—ç™¬ç–¥å¤§æ•ˆåƒ¹æž�è²´) [<a href="#CR61">61</a>]. The information that Zheng He received balsam as a gift is not included in the Aden sections of Ma Huanâ€™s é¦¬æ­¡ (<i>ca</i>. 1380â€"1460) <i>Yingyai shenglan</i> ç€›æ¶¯å‹�è˜­ [<a href="#CR62">62</a>]. This does not, of course, prove that information from Luo Maodeng was incorrect. Against the background that the balsam was a very valuable product, and in fact originated from the local neighbourhood, it seems, on the contrary, quite possible that the king of Aden presented balsam as a special gift. And one would also wonder where Luo Maodeng should have gotten his information from, if this statement was pure fabrication.</p> <p id="Par45">The Ming period <i>Xiangcheng</i> é¦™ä¹˜ (Chariot of Aromatic Substances) by Zhou Jiashou å‘¨å˜‰èƒ" (1582â€"1658) changes the entry â€œ<i>zhi jiexuan</i>â€� æ²»ç–¥ç™¬Â to â€œ<i>zhi lai</i>â€� æ²»ç™©, specifying that the balsam is applied to cure skin diseases [<a href="#CR63">63</a>].

Here, we still encounter the balsam of the Middle East (é˜¿å‹ƒå�ƒ). Shen Maoguan says it originates from Fulin guo æ‰¶æž—åœ‹ [<a href="#CR65">65</a>].

Fang Yizhi aimed to comprehend the seminal forces of natural change and presented his opus as a collection of observations, findings and other sources. He was open-minded and generally accepted European explanations of natural phenomena, except when they resulted in religious explanations [<a href="#CR67">67</a>]. Most of his information when talking about the Peruvian balsam stems from the Peru-chapter in <i>Zhifang waiji</i>, which suggests that this work was circulating among scholars interested in knowledge brought to China by Jesuits and other Europeans. In Chapter 9, he adds that this balsam is intensely fragrant and that all wounds and injuries are healed (lit. â€œmuscles and flesh are reunitedâ€�) within one day and one night; applied on smallpox, no scars on the skin will be left, applied to dead corpses, they will not decompose even after myriads of years (ä¸­é€šæ›°ç©†å…¬äº‘å­›éœ²æœ‰æ¨¹ç"Ÿè"‚è†�æ¥µé¦™çƒˆå��æ‹"çˆ¾æ’’æ‘©å‚…è«¸å‚·æ��ä¸€æ—¥å¤•è‚Œè‚‰å¾©å�ˆå¡—ç—˜å­›ä¸�ç˜¢ä»¥å¡—å±�å�ƒå¹´ä¸�æœ½å£¤) [<a href="#CR68">68</a>]. This information is clearly taken from Aleniâ€™s Peru chapter.</p> <p id="Par49">The Flemish Jesuit missionary Ferdinand Verbiest (1623â€"1688) also mentions the Peruvian balsam in his 1674 <i>Kunyu tushuo</i> å�¤è¼¿åœ–èªª (Illustrated Explanation of the World), basically copying the information from Aleni [<a href="#CR69">69</a>]. The world map of a certain Francesco Sambiasi (1582â€"1649; Chin. Bi Fangji ç•¢æ–¹æ¿Ÿ), copies of which exist in the libraries of Ghent University and Turin, also draws on information from Matteo Ricci and Guilio Aleni and mentions the â€œbalsam of Peruâ€� [<a href="#CR70">70</a>].</p> <p id="Par50">During the Kangxi period, Fan Shouyi æ¨Šå®ˆç¾© (1682â€"1753), a Chinese Christian, born in Shanxi, and who later became a Jesuit missionary [<a href="#CR71">71</a>], was one of the first Chinese known to have travelled to Europe. He later left behind his travel records, <i>Shenjian lu</i> èº«è¦‹éŒ" (Record of Personally Seen Things) [<a href="#CR72">72</a>]. In his notes, he records that he left China through the port of Macao, and reached Bahia å·´ä»¥äºž (modern Brazil) from whence his journey took him further on to Lisbon. His notes also refer to a local â€œbalsam fragrance, an oil [used to treat] sword and knife injuriesâ€� (å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨é¦™åˆ€å‚·æ²¹) [<a href="#CR73">73</a>]. That he does not speak of Peru as place of origin but of Bahia might indicate that this was the region or port from where the balsam was further shipped to Europe. The large early eighteenth-century encyclopaedia <i>Gujin tushu jicheng</i> å�¤ä»Šåœ–æ›¸é›†æˆ� (Comprehensive Collection of Books and Pictures of the Past and Present, first published in 1726) mentions it in an entry on Peru ç™½éœ², in the section â€œBordersâ€� é‚Šè£"å…¸ [<a href="#CR74">74</a>].</p> <p id="Par51">Chen Ming also introduces Zhao Xueminâ€™s è¶™å­¸æ•� (1719â€"1805) <i>Bencao gangmu shiyi</i> æœ¬è�‰ç¶±ç›®æ‹¾é�º (Additions to the General Compendium on <i>Materia Medica</i>) that states: â€œBalsam â€˜<i>Kunyu tushuo</i>â€™: name of a tree, originating from Peru. This tree produces an oil that is intensely fragrant, it can be used to make medicine.

A circle is shown in the maritime space southeast of China, and includes the text â€œWhite mountain peak(s) [i.e. the Andes mountains?]. In Peru, there is a balsam tree that produces an oil; when the tree is cut with a knife, the oil leaks out, applied on dead corpses, these do not decompose (å­›éœ²åœ‹æœ‰å·´çˆ¾å©†[=æ’’]æ‘©æ¨¹ä¸Šæ²¹ä»¥åˆ€å�–ä¹‹å¡—å°¸ä¸�æ•—) [<a href="#CR76">76</a>]. On the one hand, this information attests to the relative importance of Peruvian balsam in the work of some map drawers. On the other hand, this entry clearly shows that the use of the balsam for mummifying corpses was obviously considered more important and interesting than its use for medicinal purposes.</p> <p id="Par53">According to the <i>Da Qing huidian shili</i> å¤§æ¸…æœƒå…¸äº‹ä¾‹ (Collected Statutes of the Qing Dynasty: Precedents), in 1727, the Portuguese royal envoy Alexandre Metello de Souza e Menezes (1687â€"1766) presented the Yongzheng Emperor several gifts, among them â€œSt. Thomas, Peruvian and Brazilian balsam oilâ€� (è�–å¤šé»™å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨æ²¹, å£�éœ²å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨æ²¹, ä¼¯è‚‹è¥¿ç�†å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨æ²¹) [<a href="#CR77">77</a>]. Also <i>DaQing yitong zhi</i> å¤§æ¸…ä¸€ç»Ÿå¿— (Records of the Unity of the Great Qing; 1790), an imperial geography and description of the Qing empire, mentions St. Thomas, Peruvian and Brazilian balsam as a product of the Europeans (lit.

That Zhang Peiren by the later nineteenth century considered this knowledge on Peru that had been copied and transported since approximately 1600 in Chinese literature and on maps, as strange and exotic, might suggest that knowledge about the background and the interest in this balsam had been lost by then.</p> <p id="Par55">Around the same time, Liang Tingnan æ¢�å»·æ¥ (1796â€"1861) in his <i>Haiguo sishuo</i> æµ·åœ‹å››èª¬ (Four Treatises on Maritime Countries; 1846), like <i>DaQing yitongzhi</i>, mentions Peruvian and Brazilian balsam as an Italian and Portuguese â€œtributeâ€� gift (è�–å¤šé»™å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨æ²¹, å£�éœ²å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨æ²¹, ä¼¯è‚‹è¥¿ç�†å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨æ²¹), used, for example, against a cold (<i>biyan</i> é¼»çƒŸ) [<a href="#CR80">80</a>].

Use of balsam as medicinal in China and Japan</div> <div class="china" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
China</div> <p id="Par57">Since approximately the mid-sixteenth century, European missionaries brought Peruvian balsam from Spanish America into Asia. Macao, founded by the Portuguese in China in 1557, played a major role in this as an international crossroads between East and West. In 1594, the ColÃ©gio de SÃ£o Paulo (Shengbaolu xueyuan è�–ä¿�éŒ"å­¸é™¢) was founded by Portuguese Jesuits as a first Western-style college in China. The college is often referred to as the cradle of Western sinology, and it played a significant role also in the transfer of medicinal and pharmaceutical knowledge from Europe to China. It also had its own pharmacy. Its collection of medicinal prescriptions, the â€œ<i>Yesuhui bifang</i>â€� è€¶ç©Œæœƒç§˜æ–¹ (Secret Recipes of the Jesuits), includes thirty-seven prescriptions containing mainly Western medicinals. Balsam (Port. â€œ<i>balsamo</i>â€�) is frequently mentioned in these recipes [<a href="#CR85">85</a>]. A famous Mexican Franciscan missionary who came from the ColÃ©gio de SÃ£o Paulo and later practiced in Changshu, Jiangsu, was Pedro de la PiÃ±uela (1650<i>â€"</i>1704). From Macao and Guangdong, Peruvian balsam gradually spread along the Chinese coasts and also reached the Manchu Qing court in Beijing, mainly as a valuable gift and precious medicinal.</p> <p id="Par58">Xiao Shiâ€™s è•­å¥­ <i>Yongxian lu</i> æ°¸æ†²éŒ", 1725 (Records from the Yongzheng Period) notes that, in 1722, a list of the Jiangxi commissioner, Wang Qijing çŽ‹ä¼�é�–, included one bottle of balsam fragrance oil against cold [<a href="#CR86">86</a>]. <i>Qingdai Guangdong gongpin</i> æ¸…ä»£å»£æ�±è²¢å"�, among many other medicinals, such as a box with nutmegs, six jars of sandalwood oil, two bottles of clove oil or eugenol (aromatic oily liquid extracted from certain essential oils especially from clove oil) also includes 1 cassette of balsam fragrance, 2 bottles of balsam oil and six jars of balsam against cold [<a href="#CR87">87</a>]. Such records attest to different composition and uses of balsam. High officials explicitly ordered foreigners to obtain specific Western medicines for the court, e.g. the Guangdong grand coordinator and provincial governor (<i>Guangdong xunfu</i> å»£æ�±å·¡æ’«) Fan Shichong èŒƒæ™‚å´‡ (1663<i>â€"</i>1720).</p> <p id="Par59">The Kangxi Emperor åº·ç†™ (r. 1662<i>â€"</i>1722) highly valued certain western medicinals and also asked missionaries to prepare these at court. He also provided his officials with certain of these drugs. Charlotte Furth and Marta E. Hanson even speak of a â€œmedical pluralismâ€� during his reign period [<a href="#CR88">88</a>]. Well-known is the story of how the Jesuits came to cure Kangxi of a malarial fever with so-called Peruvian bark. According to a 1698 account of the French Jesuit Joachim Bouvet, the leader of the French delegation, Father de Fontaney, had successfully used <i>quinquina</i> or Peruvian bark to cure the emperor of a malignant fever in July 1693, after the substance had successfully been tested on three men with malarial fever and four healthy members of the imperial clan [<a href="#CR89">89</a>]. Kangxi highly valued the Peruvian bark, and the story definitely demonstrates how promptly a new medicinal drug could be adopted at that time [<a href="#CR90">90</a>]. He is quoted with the words: â€œThe West has a kind of tree bark called <i>Jinjiqin</i> that cures illnesses of intermittent fevers (i.e. malaria) with just one dose. Thus, one can see that using medicines is a case of [using them for] the right syndromeâ€� [<a href="#CR91">91</a>].</p> <p id="Par60">Kangxi also ordered the French Jesuit Jean-FranÃ§ois Gerbillon (1654<i>â€"</i>1707) to translate western knowledge on medicinal drugs into Manchu, and Gerbillon, together with Dominique Parrenin (1665<i>â€"</i>1741), later composed a Manchu handbook of western medicinal drugs and practices, <i>Xiyang yaoshu</i> è¥¿æ´‹è—¥æ›¸ (Treatise on Western Medicinals) [<a href="#CR92">92</a>], which is preserved in the Gugong library in Beijing [<a href="#CR93">93</a>].</p> <p id="Par61">Although missionary activities were quite restricted under the Yongzheng é›�æ­£ Emperor (r. 1723<i>â€"</i>1735), western medicinal and pharmaceutical activities of the missionaries at the court continued. <i>Haiguo sishuo</i> speaks of balsam oil as a gift of Italian and Portuguese missions in 1725, 1727 and 1753 [<a href="#CR94">94</a>]. A document preserved in the First Historical Archive in Beijing offers us a kind of inventory list of a workshop within the palace from 1726. The inventory includes, for example, two glass and three tin bottles of balsam oil, eighteen balsam fragrance balls, two tin bottles of balsam oil originating from Peru (ç•¢éŒ"åœ°æ–¹å‡ºçš"å·´çˆ¾è–©æœ¨æ²¹äºŒéŒ«ç"¶) and a coconut box of balsam fragrance to prevent a cold. That here a distinction is made between the Peruvian balsam and two bottles â€œoriginating from Peruâ€� indicates either that they may have reached the court directly from Spanish America and were traded on the Manila galleons, or, it shows that this bark was also imported from some other regions in the Spanish American or Indian Ocean world (like the quinine that had been brought from India by Claude de Visdelou (1656<i>â€"</i>1737), and with which the Kangxi Emperor had been treated) [<a href="#CR95">95</a>], perhaps of lower quality.</p> <p id="Par62">We encounter here another use of the balsam, namely as fragrance balls.</p> <p id="Par63">Yongzheng is also quoted with the words: â€œThis oil, this fragrance is stored everywhere in the Hall of Martial Valour and the Hall of Mental Cultivation, it has become known through correspondence with Westernersâ€� (æ­¤æ²¹ã€�æ­¤é¦™æ­¦è‹±æ®¿ã€�é¤Šå¿ƒæ®¿ç›¡æœ‰æ"¶è²¯çš",è‘—è¥¿æ´‹äººé…�å�ˆ) [<a href="#CR96">96</a>].</p> <p id="Par64">At court, Peruvian balsam was valued and used against a cold or beginning influenza but, above all, it was very important in curing sword wounds and for external injuries and was, consequently, highly valued among the Manchu military. A Mongol general in the Qing army requested that the court should provide more of this substance:</p> <p id="Par65"> </p><div class="disp-quote" title="disp-quote"> <p id="Par66">On the 6<sup>th</sup> day at the beginning of the 2<sup>nd</sup> month of 1734 (Yongzheng 24), the Grand Minister Haiwang (?<i>â€"</i>1755) gave the following imperial order: â€˜According to what the consort Cering [1672<i>â€"</i>1750] [<a href="#CR97">97</a>] has memorialized, balsam oil is extremely useful in the army; You should take care of (provisioningÂ us) with this oil, the more the better, and store it in tin bottles, which are (normally) used as tea caddies, in order to make it into solid packages, and then take them all to Cering, the emperorâ€™s son-in-law, for his disposal (of it to the army). This was endorsed. On the 9<sup>th</sup> day of the same month, the manager of the Bureau of Provisions prepared 20 <i>jin</i> of balsam oil that was stored in 20 large and 4 small tin bottles as well as in 16 tea tin bottles at the palace workshop, in total more than 40 bottles.</p> </div> <p /> <p id="Par67">é›�æ­£å��äºŒå¹´äºŒæœˆåˆ�å…­æ—¥å…§å¤§è‡£æµ·æœ›å¥‰æ—¨:æ"šé¡�é™"ç­–æ·©å¥�ç¨±,å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨æ²¹è»�å‰�æ·±ç‚ºé�©ç"¨,çˆ¾å°‡æ²¹å¤šå¤šæ–™ç�†äº›,ç"¨ç››èŒ¶éŒ«ç"¶ç››è£�,å‹™æœŸå …å›ºåŒ…è£¹,å¸¶èˆ‡é¡�é™"ç­–æ·©æ‡‰ç"¨ã€‚æ¬½æ­¤ã€‚æ–¼æœ¬æœˆåˆ�ä¹�æ—¥å�¸åº«å¸¸ä¿�å°‡å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ¨æ²¹äºŒå��æ–¤ç››åœ¨é€ è¾¦è™•å�šå¾—å¤§éŒ«ç"¶äºŒå��ç"¶ã€�å°�éŒ«ç"¶å››ç"¶ã€�ç››èŒ¶éŒ«ç"¶å��å…­ç"¶,ä»¥ä¸Šå…±å››å��ç"¶ [<a href="#CR98">98</a>].</p> <p id="Par68">Faced with its usefulness as a remedy in the army, it is not surprising that the available Peruvian balsam from Spanish America circulated more widely and was more widely applied during Qing times than the balsam that originated from the Middle East.</p> <p>We have already mentioned that balsam was also appreciated in the form of fragrance or incense balls, aimed to improve the smell of the air. In 1763, the Qianlong ä¹¾éš† Emperor (r. 1736<i>â€"</i>1795) decreed that the Portuguese missionary Manuel de Mattos (1725<i>â€"</i>1764) provide â€œbalsam fragranceâ€� å·´æ‹‰è–©å—Žé¦™ [<a href="#CR99">99</a>]. A black bottle of balsam oil is still preserved in the Gugong Palace Museum in Beijing. It carries two lines of characters, one saying â€œdiluted balsam oil, net weight 1 catty and 9 <i>liang</i> (= approx. 586 g)â€� (ç¨€å·´çˆ¾æ’’æœ«æ²¹æ·¨é‡�ä¸€æ–¤ä¹�å…©), the other saying â€œIn the beginning of the 5<sup>th</sup> month, on the 7<sup>th</sup> day, 1763, [the imperial physician] Bai Shixiu asked for 8 <i>qian</i> (ca. 30 g) of balsam oil to use it for balsam fragrance to prevent colds (ä¹¾éš†äºŒå��å…«å¹´äº"æœˆåˆ�ä¸ƒæ—¥,ç™½ä¸–ç§€è¨ŽåŽ»å·´æ‹‰è–©å—Žæ²¹å…«éŒ¢,é…�é�¿é¢¨å·´æ‹‰è–©å—Žé¦™ç"¨) [<a href="#CR100">100</a>].</p> <p id="Par70">Such information does not only demonstrate the appreciation of the balsam among ruling elite circles but also attests to a relative strict control of the substance. Especially in face of its use for the curing of wounds in the army, its use against colds and chills and very obviously the appreciation of its fragrant flavour by the social and ruling elites turned balsam into a substance very much in demand, one that was, at the same time, not provisioned in very large quantities. Mostly, it reached the court as official gifts. In the Hall of Martial Valour æ­¦è‹±æ®¿ of the palace in the Forbidden City, there was a so-called Room for the Preparation of Aromatic Medicines and Liquids (<i>lufang</i> éœ²æˆ¿). This was the place where medicines from the Europeans (lit. the Western Ocean) and medicinal liquids distilled from flowers were stored. In the summer of 1814, an inventory was taken and at that time the store room was filled with lots of bottles, containing the oils of cloves, nutmegs, cinnamon, etc. The oils had mostly already thickened into a kind of paste, as it had been confined to bottles for a long time. In addition, there were all kinds of animal parts and essences, from spiders, dogs, turtles, lions or snakes, including snake eyes. Then there was also a substance called theriac (<i>deliyake</i> å¾·åŠ›é›…å™¶; a medical concoction, a kind of elixir, used as an antidote against snake bites and poisoning), that looked like an ointment, etc. Originally, all this was managed by western missionaries, which is why there were so many western medicines [<a href="#CR101">101</a>]. Also Yao Heng å§šè¡¡ (Qing) mentions the â€œRoom for the Preparation of Aromatic Medicines and Liquidsâ€�, where Europeans prepared their medicines. In total, there were 220 kinds of oils that had been bestowed as gifts, among all these substances balsam oil (3 <i>jin</i>, 1 <i>liang</i>, 3 <i>qian</i> and 5 <i>fen</i>), six glass bottles, able to cure sword and knife injuries (å·´çˆ¾æ’’ç±³æ²¹ä¸‰æ–¤ä¸€å…©ä¸‰éŒ¢äº"åˆ†å…­çŽ»ç’ƒç"¶,æ²»åˆ€å‚·) [<a href="#CR102">102</a>].</p> <p id="Par71">Missionaries not only brought medicinal knowledge and drugs from the New World, the Spanish colonies in America, via Europe or the Pacific and Manila to China and Japan, but also sent prepared medicines to Manila. As Cui Weixiao å´"ç¶­å­� has shown, due to the activities of Blasius GarcÃ­a (1635<i>â€"</i>1699), Franciscan physicians annually sent to Manila great quantities of medicinals and aromatics, such as theriac (<i>jiedu yao</i> è§£æ¯’è—¥), <i>Hyacinthus orientalis</i> (<i>fengxinzi</i> é¢¨ä¿¡å­�), brown sugar (<i>hongtang</i> ç´…ç³–, <i>Saccharon Granulatum</i> Rubrum), rhubarb pills and refined rhubarb, <i>bÃ¡lsamo apoplÃ©tico</i> (ä¸­é¢¨é¦™è"‚è—¥è†�) and others. The hospital in Guangzhou, vice versa, received from Manila substances such as jalap root resin (ç�ƒæ ¹ç‰½ç‰›æ ¹èŽ–), <i>Salvia japonica</i> Thunb. (é¼ å°¾è�‰), <i>carthamus</i> flower (ç´…èŠ±, <i>Carthami Flos</i>), <i>bÃ¡lsamo</i> (é¦™è"‚è—¥è†�), <i>Pini Resina</i> essence (æ�¾è"‚ç²¾),Â and <i>Tamarindus indica</i> (ç¾…æœ›å­�æžœ) [<a href="#CR103">103</a>]. The balsams mentioned here are not identical with the balsam of Peru. Most of these substances were probably shipped via Manila to China across the Indian Ocean, but, as ship records about cargoes and archaeological evidence show, other medicinal drugs were without question shipped across the Pacific.</p> <p id="Par72">After the Kangxi and Yongzheng reign periods, many of these western medicinals were apparently more and more seldomly used. Especially after the Qianlong reign, much of the former knowledge was lost, so that later in the nineteenth century many scholars were no longer acquainted with such substances, their uses and applications and their origins (see also below).</p> <p id="Par73">That interest in the embalming of corpses in Ming times obviously weighed higher than the use of balsam for medicinal purposes is also reflected by <i>Wuli xiaoshi</i>. Fang Yizhi includes a separate paragraph entitled â€œmethod for preserving corpsesâ€� (<i>liushi fa</i> ç•™å±�æ³•).</p> </div> </div> <div class="methodofpreservingcorpses" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

When pouring mercury, this is still more efficient, or soaking it with tea through the nose, then you can also prevent stinking during the summer. <i>Hanshu</i> says: The foul and despicable corpse of Empress LÃ¼ (?<i>â€"</i>180 BCE) was restrained with quicksilver. In Peru, there is a balsam tree that produces a resin to embalm corpses so that they do not decompose even after 1000 years. The <i>Quebian lu</i> says: when a disciple gives away his masterâ€™s [dead corpse] because he died in a sitting posture [<a href="#CR106">106</a>], <i>nao</i> mineral is mixed with Borneo camphor, and together with dry mercury put into the nose holes and the body is vapoured with medicinal aromatics. If one wants to pass away with the vapours peacefully and quietly exhausting, with the head not feeling warm, they must escape the dead body from the head. After a long time, [the corpse] will dry by itself; this is the special way of Theravada [Buddhism, lit. â€œthe small vehicleâ€�] to reach the status of [unification with nature]. Is this not sufficient to startle? Bones and hard matter do not decay, the will congeals and the essence is bound to become a demon. If one burns what is not evil, this is the origin of the Buddhist ÅšarÄ«ra relic. What is said in the explorations of thing is that hair and organ of a boy can be stuck to the ÅšarÄ«ra relic, when frankincense remains long, it can bear a ÅšarÄ«ra.â€�</p> <p id="Par75">ç•™å±�æ³• æ�Žé �æœ�çŽ‰å…¶å°¸æš‘ä¸­ä¸�æ® é»"é‡‘å¡žç«…äº¦ä¸�è…�ç�Œæ¾’æ›´æ•ˆæˆ–ä»¥èŒ¶ç�‚æ¾’ç´�é¼»äº¦å�¯æš‘ä¸­ä¸�æ® æ¼¢æ›¸è¨€æ±™è¾±å‘‚é›‰å°¸ä»¥æ°´éŠ€æ–‚ä¹Ÿå­›éœ²åœ‹æœ‰ä¸€æ‹"çˆ¾æ’’æ‘©æ¨¹è"‚å¡—å°¸å�ƒå¹´ä¸�æœ½ç¢ºè¾¨éŒ²æ›°æœ‰å¾’ä»¥å��è"±è²©å…¶å¸«è€…<span class="inline-graphic" title="inline-graphic" />å�ˆå©†å¾‹ä¹Ÿä¹¾æ¾’ç´�é¼»è€Œè€¨é¦™ç†�ç‚ºè‚‰èº«è€…ä¹Ÿå¯¡æ¬²æ�¬æ¾¹æ°"ç›¡è€Œé€�å¿ƒä¸�ä¿‚æˆ€ç…–å¾žé ‚è"±å°¸ç‚ºé�ºèœ•ä¹…ä¹‹è‡ªä¹¾å°�ä¹˜å°ˆè‡´å¸¸ç"¶è±ˆè¶³æ€ªä¹Žéª¨å‰›è€…ä¸�å£žå¿—å‡�ç²¾çµ�æœ‰æˆ�å¡Šç‡’ä¸�å£žè€…æ­¤èˆ�åˆ©å­�ä¹‹æ‰€ç"±ä¾†ä¹Ÿç‰©ç�†æ‰€æ›°ç«¥ç"·é«ªæ ¹å�¯é»�èµ·èˆ�åˆ©ä¹³é¦™ä¹…ç•™èƒ½ç"Ÿèˆ�åˆ©.</p> <p id="Par76">Why Fang Yizhi was so interested especially in the embalming of dead corpses in ancient Peru is an interesting question. We know from ancient, especially Han and pre-Han period, tombs that members of the ruling and social elites in China also frequently embalmed their dead. Lady Dai from the Mawangdui é¦¬çŽ‹å † tomb complex (168 BCE) is perhaps one of the most well-known examples. Well preserved mummies were also discovered from the Ming and Qing dynasties [<a href="#CR107">107</a>]. The practice was, consequently, still known during Fang Yizhiâ€™s time. He was obviously quite impressed by the fact that Andean people also possessed an ancient technique of preserving dead bodies. That information about the knowledge of mummification in a country overseas was more interesting and fascinating to scholarly elites in contemporary China is also attested to in the maps we have introduced above, which provide this information regarding their Andean â€œislands in the seaâ€�. Medicinal purposes, in contrast, were at least less intriguing.</p> <p id="Par77">The Spanish, too, were excited about the mummification practices of the Incas and the Andean people in general. In 1559, they confiscated and displayed the best-preserved mummies in Limaâ€™s most sophisticated centre of European healing and botanical knowledge, the Hospital of San AndrÃ©s [<a href="#CR108">108</a>]. Possibly, the knowledge was used to mummify notable deceased persons in the Spanish Philippines. There is one entry in the Archivo General de Indias (AGI) where a surgeon, JoaquÃ­n de Castro (<i>cirujano</i>), requested the authorities to pay for the medicines and the labour to embalm the cadaver of the archbishop of the Philippines (1729â€"1732), Carlos BermÃºdez de Castro (1678â€"1729) [<a href="#CR109">109</a>]. Obviously, also animals were embalmed, it seems even on board of ships, as an entry from the AGI dated 1778 suggest: Don Juan Francisco de Anda y Salazar [â€œoydor de la Audiencia de Manila and executor (<i>albacea</i>) of SimÃ³n de Anda y Salazarâ€� (1709â€"1776), governor of the Philippines from July, 1770 to October 30, 1776)] took care of a cargo of animals for the Spanish King, among them one elephant, four small deer from Batavia, two deer from Coromandel and a dove from Ternate; accordingly, the elephant and three of the four deer reached their destination alive and the others embalmed (â€œy los demas embalsamadosâ€�) [<a href="#CR110">110</a>].</p> <p id="Par78">Other entries by Fang Yizhi are directly referred to <i>Zhifang waiji</i>, for example a note stating that the Indians of the Peruvian Andes Mountains have a fountain of a liquid like grease that the local people extract to burn or use it as oil paint. All oil fires using oil from these wells burn even better when sprinkled with water, and are extinguished only when dabbed with earth dust (å¤–ç´€å¯¡æ–¯å¤§å±±å­›éœ²æœ‰æ³‰å¦‚è"‚è†�äººå�–ç‡ƒç‡ˆæˆ–ä½œæ²¹æ¼†ç"¨å‡¡äº•æ²¹ç�«ä»¥æ°´æ¾†ä¹‹æ"ˆç†¾ä»¥åœ°ç�°æ’²ä¹‹å‰‡æ»…) [<a href="#CR111">111</a>].</p> <div class="japan" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Japan</div> <p id="Par79">The reception of western medicine was different in Japan, where through Dutch medicinal knowledge a separate medicinal school evolved, â€œRangakuâ€� è˜­å­¸ (Dutch medicinal learning). Generally speaking, we can observe that Japanese scholars were more open towards new knowledge and practices from Europeans. The world map of Matteo Ricci, <i>Kunyu Wanguo quantu</i> å�¤è¼¿è�¬åœ‹å…¨, had a great impact on local scholars, after it became known in Japan. In 1708, Arai Hakuseki æ–°äº•ç™½çŸ³ (1657â€"1725), a well-known Neo-Confucian scholar, official and writer in the Japan of that time, produced a painted, coloured version of the map <i>Kunyu Wanguo quantu</i>. He also copied Ricciâ€™s entry on balsam å·´å°"å¨‘æ‘©, in his map written as å·´å°"å©†æ‘©. In 1713, he wrote a three-volume treatise on the Occident entitled <i>KeiyÅ� kibun</i> è¥¿æ´‹ç´€è�ž (Chronicle of the West), a work that was mainly based on his conversations with the Italian missionary Giovanni Battista Sidotti (1668â€"1714). The second volume is a description of the five continents, that is, Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and the Americas. There, Hakuseki translates the information from Ricciâ€™s map into Japanese, and explains that in Spanish America there is a country called Perukoku å­›éœ²åœ‹, where a fragrance is produced called å·´å°"å¨‘æ‘©. The tree, when cut with a knife, produces an oil which is used to embalm dead corpses so that they do not decompose. The balsam (ãƒ�ãƒ«ã‚µãƒ¢) that comes from the western countries (i.e. that is traded by the Europeans) is exactly the oil of this tree. I asked some Dutch people about the location of this product and they replied it was Peru. In Chinese, this is translated into Polu å­›éœ². <i>Baâ€™ershamo</i> å·´å°"å¨‘æ‘©, this is balsam (ãƒ�ãƒ«ã‚µãƒ¢) (see Fig. <a href="#Fig5">5</a>) [<a href="#CR112">112</a>]. In his <i>Sairan igen</i> é‡‡è¦½ç•°è¨€ (Strange Stories Acquired), he almost literally copies from Ricci, because, in contrast to his explanations in <i>KeiyÅ� kibun</i>, he uses mainly Kanji æ¼¢å­—. Interestingly, he also adds geographical information, stating that Peru lies in the north of Chile, lying adjacent to a large ocean in the west. And he introduces emus, large birds that cannot fly and have feet resembling horses (see Fig. <a href="#Fig6">6a, b</a>) [<a href="#CR113">113</a>]. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 5</span></a></div>   <p>Entry on balsam in KeiyÅ� kibun è¥¿æ´‹ç´€è�ž (p. 18b)</p>   </div> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 6</span></a></div>   <p><b>a</b> and <b>b</b> Entries on balsam in Sairan igen é‡‡è¦½ç•°è¨€</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par80">All this demonstrates that Arai Hakuseki intensively engaged with the knowledge about these foreign countries and their products. In <i>KeiyÅ� kibun</i>, he explicitly states that he discussed the location of Peru with Dutch people. Dutch medicine applied various balsams in its treatments. So Dutch physicians offered another channel to obtain more knowledge on the uses of balsam as a medicinal.</p> <p id="Par81">Katsuragawa HoshÅ« æ¡‚å·�ç"«å‘¨ (1751â€"1809), a Japanese physician and Rangaku scholar who served the Tokugawa Shogunate å¾³å·�å¹•åºœ (1603â€"1868) as a physician and translator of Dutch, translated the world map by Willem Janszoon Blaeu (1571â€"1638) into Japanese, <i>Honâ€˜yaku ChikyÅ« zenzu ryakusetsu</i> ç¿»è­¯åœ°ç�ƒå…¨åœ–ç•¥èªª (Translation and Brief Account of the Entire World Map) in 4 <i>juan</i> [<a href="#CR114">114</a>]. He also mentions balsam (æ‹"å°"æ’’æ‘©) as a product of Peru, together with gold, silver, mercury, cinnabar (æœ±ç ‚), sugar (æ²™å¡˜), cotton, olive oil (é˜¿åˆ©è¥ªç¾Žæ²¹) [<a href="#CR115">115</a>] and numerous kinds of medicinals, jade and precious stone, that are locally produced and since 1533 belong to Spain. He was even aware of the Spanish administrative-bureaucratic division, and the â€œaudienciasâ€� in their viceroyalties in the Americas, and mentions here Quito ç¥�å¤š, Lima åˆ©ç¦¡ and JurÃ­es é­¯ç§� (?) in Charcas å¯Ÿå°"åŠ æ²™ (see Fig. <a href="#Fig7">7a, b</a>) [<a href="#CR116">116</a>]. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 7</span></a></div>   <p><b>a</b> and <b>b</b>Â Entries on balsam in Honâ€˜yaku chikyÅ« zenzu ryakusetsu ç¿»è­¯åœ°ç�ƒå…¨åœ–ç•¥èªª</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par82">In 1817, Ema ShÅ�sai æ±Ÿé¦¬æ�¾æ–Ž (GenkÅ� å…ƒå¼˜, 1779â€"1820) translated and printed the <i>Oranda ihÅ� sanâ€™yÅ�</i> å’Œè˜­é†«æ–¹çº‚è¦� (Compendium of Dutch Medicinal Recipes) [<a href="#CR117">117</a>]. He also mentions various kinds of balsam. Especially interesting is the information about a PeruvianÂ balsam tree that produces an oil, is reddish in colour and fragrant. It is imported by ships (æ‹"å¾‹æ®ºæ²’çž¥å¾‹åŒªå�‘:å�³æ¨¹è"‚ä¹Ÿ,æˆ‘é‚¦ç"¡ç"¢,å‡ºæ–¼çž¥å¾‹åŒªå�‘åœ‹ã€‚ å…¶è‰²èµ¤,æœ‰é¦™æ°£ã€‚èˆ¶ä¾†é–"æœ‰ä¹‹) (see Fig. <a href="#Fig8">8</a>) [<a href="#CR118">118</a>]. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 8</span></a></div>   <p>Entry on balsam in Oranda ihÅ� sanâ€™yÅ�å’Œè˜­é†«æ–¹çº‚è¦� (4 fulu, p. 10a)</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par83">Yoshio ShunzÅ� å�‰é›"ä¿Šè—� (1787â€"1843) translated a manual written for physicians on board of ships by the seventeenth-centuryÂ Dutch official surgeon, Jan Kouwenburg, <i>Shinyaku Oranda neikai yÅ�hÅ�</i> æ–°è­¯å’Œè˜­å…§å¤–è¦�æ–¹ (New Translation of the Essential Methods of Dutch Internal Medicine and Surgery; 1820) that also explicitly refers to balsam of Peru (æ‹"çˆ¾æ’’è¬¨ç™¾éœ²æ¯"äºžæ³¥) [<a href="#CR119">119</a>]. In the nineteenth century, in contrast to China, interest continued unabated. In the 1820s, Udagawa Genshin å®‡ç"°å·�çŽ"çœŸ (1769â€"1834) and Udagawa YÅ�an å®‡ç"°å·�æ¦•è�´ (1798â€"1846) [<a href="#CR120">120</a>] translated and annotated <i>Ensei ihÅ� meibutsukÅ�</i> é� è¥¿é†«æ–¹å��ç‰©è€ƒ (A Study of Far-Western Medicinal Recipes and Notable Things) that provides even more information on the Peruvian balsam: â€œBoâ€™ersamo Poli, also called <i>barusamu peruviana</i> in Latin, and <i>zuid indiaanse balsam</i> in Dutchâ€� (æ‹"çˆ¾æ’’è¬¨å­›éœ² å�ˆã€Œãƒ�ãƒ«ã‚µãƒ .ãƒšãƒ«ãƒ"ã‚¢ãƒ‹ã€�ç¾…ã€Œã‚¹ãƒ¯ãƒ†.ã‚¤ãƒ³ãƒ‡ã‚¢ãƒ¼ãƒ³ã‚».ãƒ�ãƒ«ã‚»ãƒ ã€�è˜­). They describe the tree and also its medicinal uses and indications: it strengthens the nerves, prevents decomposition, can be used as a laxative, with cleaning functions, to sweat out excretions, can dissipate cold tuberculosis and is also effective against pneumoconiosis, asthma, gonorrhoea and other deficiency diseases [<a href="#CR121">121</a>]. This is definitely the most detailed and also the most up-to-date description about the balsam of Peru (see Fig. <a href="#Fig9">9aâ€"c</a>). In the later nineteenth century, one continues to encounter relatively frequent references to the Peruvian balsam and its medicinal properties and uses in Japanese medical literatureâ€"quite in contrast to China, where the knowledge that had existed during the Ming, early and high Qing seems to have been almost lost, as the following example may show. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 9</span></a></div>   <p><b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>c</b> Entries on balsam in Ensei ihÅ� meibutsukÅ� é� è¥¿é†«æ–¹å��ç‰©è€ƒ</p>   </div> <p /> <p id="Par84">Yu Yue ä¿žæ¨¾ (1821â€"1907) was a very prominent Qing scholar, specialized in philology and textual studies, including history. In his scholarly notes, <i>Chaxiang shi congchao</i>Â èŒ¶é¦™å®¤å�¢éˆ", he copies Fang Yizhiâ€™s <i>Wuli xiaoshi</i> and adds his remarks: â€œI do not know where the country of Peru is located, and also do not know what kind of tree this balsam isâ€� (å­›éœ²åœ‹ä¸�çŸ¥ä½•åœ°,æ‹"çˆ¾æ’¤æ‘©äº¦ä¸�çŸ¥ä½•æ¨¹) [<a href="#CR122">122</a>]. That an erudite intellectual in the late nineteenth century had absolutely no idea about the whereabouts of a country like Peru seems hardly credible. It demonstrates that Yu Yue was not sufficiently interested in the world beyond, nor in the knowledge that had been collected by scholars over the last centuries. As we have seen above, another late Qing scholar, Wei Yuan, simply copied the information from earlier works. There was no further â€œdigestionâ€� or development of the knowledge on the balsam of Peru in late Qing scholarship. The interest was pure encyclopaedic and philosophic.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par85">What conclusions can we draw regarding the transfer of knowledge related to the use and application of Peruvian balsam?</p> <p id="Par86">Knowledge about the substance was brought to China through European missionaries. Initially, balsam was probably only used in the hospitals and pharmacies of European missionaries. But the knowledge gradually reached the court and the social and ruling elites of China. Especially the Kangxi Emperor possessed a very positive attitude towards Western medicine, and even wished to have European physicians and pharmacists at court. He definitely sponsored the dissemination of Western medicine in China. The French Jesuits Joachim Bouvet (1656<i>â€"</i>1730) and Jean-FranÃ§ois Gerbillon (1654<i>â€"</i>1707) even set up a pharmaceutical laboratory with all the necessary equipment at the request of Kangxi [<a href="#CR123">123</a>]. The general commercialisation of medicine in Ming and Qing China quickly had so-called â€œnewâ€� drugs enter into contemporary pharmacies and pharmacopoeia, and social and ruling elites profiting from new ideas. We know that the Qing court, for example, basically received its provisions of Peruvian balsam through the networks of missionaries, via the trans-Pacific Manila galleon trade. But if there were special merchants and merchant networks engaged in its provision and cross-oceanic distribution remains a question to be investigated in more detail.</p> <p id="Par87">Textual and even archaeological evidence attest to the use of the balsam among the Qing elites and, as we have seen, during the high Qing, also in the Qing army (â€œbalsam oil is extremely useful in the armyâ€�), as it was very effective in curing external knife, sword, arrow and other injuries as well as skin diseases, including smallpox [<a href="#CR124">124</a>]. This is a clear and interesting indication of its use beyond the narrow elite circles. But how and when exactly the oil was used in military circles, this is a question that definitely requires further investigation. And textual evidence one way or the other is scanty.</p> <p id="Par88">After the Qianlong era, however, the â€œnewâ€� knowledge gradually was lostâ€"in a complete disparity with Japan where the knowledge was continuously updated. Living in an environment where contacts to the outside world were the exception rather than the rule, many Japanese physicians were eager to learn more about medical practices from abroad. Especially through the mediation of Dutch physicians and their medicinal knowledgeâ€"then among the most advanced in the early modern worldâ€"Japanese scholars, doctors and pharmacists came to have a solid knowledge about the balsam of Peru, its origin and its medicinal uses. By contrast, most Chinese physicians, medical theorists and intellectuals were preoccupied with metaphysical and cosmological interpretations of their own classical traditions, seeking a â€œreturn to antiquityâ€� (<i>fugu</i> å¾©å�¤). After the Opium Wars (1839â€"1842 and 1856â€"1860), many also felt threatened by the West and by Western traditions. In this context, starting in the second half of the nineteenth century, the idea of using â€œChinese learning as substance, and Western learning for practical useâ€� (<i>Zhongxue wei ti, Xixue wei yong</i> ä¸­å­¸ç‚ºé«", è¥¿å­¸ç‚ºç"¨) became very widespread and popular among Chinese thinkers. This may explain, at least partly, why their interests in Western knowledge were strictly limited. If such knowledge was not directly related to Western technology and military systems that could be used to strengthen the country (for â€œpractical useâ€�, in other words), it remained basically encyclopaedic and philosophic.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="glossary" title="glossary"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

What is called â€˜oliveâ€™ are the fruits at the head of the a tree; after being ripe, they are entirely used to produce olive oil, which has a very rich tasteâ€� (é˜¿åˆ©è¢œ:å…¶è†�æ²¹ä¹‹é¡ž, å‘³ç¾Žè€Œç"¨å¤šè€…, æ›°é˜¿åˆ©è¢œ, æ˜¯æ¨¹é ­ä¹‹æžœ, ç†Ÿå¾Œå�³å…¨ç‚ºé˜¿åˆ©è¢œæ²¹, æœ€é¥’é¢¨å‘³).
