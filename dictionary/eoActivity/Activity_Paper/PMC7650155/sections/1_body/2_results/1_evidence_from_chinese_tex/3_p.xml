 <italic>Xiangcheng</italic> 香乘 (Chariot of Aromatic Substances) by Zhou Jiashou 周嘉胄 (1582–1658) changes the entry “
 <italic>zhi jiexuan</italic>” 治疥癬 to “
 <italic>zhi lai</italic>” 治癩, specifying that the balsam is applied to cure skin diseases [

 <italic>Huayi huamu niaoshou zhenwan kao </italic> 華夷花木鳥獸珍玩考 (An Investigation of Plants, Animals and Rare Things of China and the Barbarians, 1581) introduces rare or exotic things from China and the rest of the world [

 <italic>ba’ershamo</italic>”) appear. This means that most scholars of the mid to late Ming period still received and copied their information from older texts, and that the balsam of Peru was actually only introduced through European missionaries, and included into Chinese literary and medicinal texts by those authors who took note of the newly introduced Western knowledge.
