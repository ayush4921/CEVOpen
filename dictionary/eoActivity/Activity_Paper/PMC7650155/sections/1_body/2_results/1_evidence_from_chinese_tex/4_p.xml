<p id="Par46">Aleni speaks of “a tree, which produces a grease that is extremely fragrant and is called 
 <italic>ba’ersamo</italic>; it is used to treat all kinds of injuries; within one night, the muscles and flesh are totally recuperated as before. Applied on smallpox, they do not leave scars, embalming dead corpses, they will not decompose in myriads of years”.
