<p id="Par43">Under the entry Peru, the famous map by Matteo Ricci, 
 <italic>Kunyu Wanguo quantu</italic> (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), refers to a “fragrance” (
 <italic>xiang</italic> 香) called “
 <italic>ba’ershamo</italic>” 巴尔娑摩, a tree which produces an oil, that is a resin, when cut; “used to balsam corpses, they do not decompose”. And the point where the tree has been cut entirely recovers after 12 h (
 <italic>zhou shi’er shi ji ru gu</italic> 周十二時即如故). (The balsam) also occurs in Judaea (
 <italic>Rudeyaguo yi you zhi</italic> 如德亞國亦有之) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. This balsam of Judaea (also “Mecca balsam”) was used in the ancient and middle period Mediterranean area, as we have seen above. Ricci was consequently aware of the use and importance of balsam in the ancient world, and links it up to the balsam from the New World. This implies that both balsams possessed similar or even almost identical properties, or were at least used in similar ways.
