<p id="Par48">The 
 <italic>Wuli xiaoshi</italic> 物理小識 (Notes on the Principles of Things) by Fang Yizhi 方以智 (1611
 <italic>–</italic>1671) also introduces the “balsam of Peru”. Fang Yizhi aimed to comprehend the seminal forces of natural change and presented his opus as a collection of observations, findings and other sources. He was open-minded and generally accepted European explanations of natural phenomena, except when they resulted in religious explanations [

 <italic>Zhifang waiji</italic>, which suggests that this work was circulating among scholars interested in knowledge brought to China by Jesuits and other Europeans. In Chapter 9, he adds that this balsam is intensely fragrant and that all wounds and injuries are healed (lit. “muscles and flesh are reunited”) within one day and one night; applied on smallpox, no scars on the skin will be left, applied to dead corpses, they will not decompose even after myriads of years (中通曰穆公云孛露有樹生脂膏極香烈名拔爾撒摩傅諸傷損一日夕肌肉復合塗痘孛不瘢以塗屍千年不朽壤) [
