<p id="Par50">During the Kangxi period, Fan Shouyi 樊守義 (1682–1753), a Chinese Christian, born in Shanxi, and who later became a Jesuit missionary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], was one of the first Chinese known to have travelled to Europe. He later left behind his travel records, 
 <italic>Shenjian lu</italic> 身見錄 (Record of Personally Seen Things) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In his notes, he records that he left China through the port of Macao, and reached Bahia 巴以亞 (modern Brazil) from whence his journey took him further on to Lisbon. His notes also refer to a local “balsam fragrance, an oil [used to treat] sword and knife injuries” (巴爾撒木香刀傷油) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. That he does not speak of Peru as place of origin but of Bahia might indicate that this was the region or port from where the balsam was further shipped to Europe. The large early eighteenth-century encyclopaedia 
 <italic>Gujin tushu jicheng</italic> 古今圖書集成 (Comprehensive Collection of Books and Pictures of the Past and Present, first published in 1726) mentions it in an entry on Peru 白露, in the section “Borders” 邊裔典 [
