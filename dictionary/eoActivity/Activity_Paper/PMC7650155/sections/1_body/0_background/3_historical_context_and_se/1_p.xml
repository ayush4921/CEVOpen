<p id="Par8">Old World balsam was the most expensive aromatic plant in the ancient world. During Hellenistic and Roman-Byzantine times, 
 <italic>Opobalsamum</italic> [that is, “juice of the balsam”] plant, or the “Balm of Judea” was frequently mentioned [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It grew wild in the Arab Peninsula but was rare. Only in Judea, and in the oases of Jericho and Ein Gedi was it cultivated, as Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) noted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Growing balsam was a monopoly of the ruler, and balsam sold for high prices. Originally cultivated under Jewish rule, the practice was continued under the Roman Empire, creating substantial revenue for the Roman treasury [

 <italic>xylobalsamum</italic>), the fruit, the bark and the pure sap [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the Roman middle period, cultivation moved to Egypt. As Zohar Amar and David Iluz emphasize, the balsam of the classical sources (
 <italic>Commiphora gileadensis</italic>) belongs to the incense plant family Burseraceae, including within it plants that still grow wild today in the dry, stony hills around the Red Sea [
