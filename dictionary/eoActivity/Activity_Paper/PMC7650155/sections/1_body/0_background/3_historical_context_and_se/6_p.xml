 <italic>“Aboshen</italic> originates from the Byzantine country. It is more than 1 
 <italic>zhang</italic> high [
 <italic>ca</italic>. 3.33 m]. Its bark has a greenish-whitish colour. The leaves are fine and always two face one another. The flowers are upright like rape turnips [
 <italic>Brassica rapa</italic> var. 
 <italic>rapa</italic>], and the buds are reddish like the colour of ripe black pepper (
 <italic>hujiao</italic> 胡椒). Cutting its branches, a sap [leaks] like oil. Taken against scabies and sores, there is no disease it cannot heal. Its oil is very valuable and is as expensive as gold.”
