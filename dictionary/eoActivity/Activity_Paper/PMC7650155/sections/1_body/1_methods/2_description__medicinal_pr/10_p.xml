<p id="Par40">This description clearly refers to 
 <italic>Cinchona</italic>. An even earlier text, printed in 1638 and written by an Augustinian monk, Antonio de la Calancha (1584–1684), also describes this same “fever tree”: “A tree grows which they call ‘the fever tree’ (
 <italic>árbol de calenturas</italic>) in the country of Loxa, whose bark, of the colour of cinnamon, made into powder amounting to the weight of two small silver coins and given as a beverage, cures the fevers and tertianas; it has produced miraculous results in Lima” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. I mention this here in this context because records on the balsam tree of Peru are sometimes confusing, so that one starts to ask which species or 
 <italic>genus</italic> a description actually refers to [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. And the bark of the tree that was commercially sold as a drug most probably did not always stem from the 
 <italic>cinchona</italic> tree, but may well have come from the Peruvian balsam tree (or even other trees).
