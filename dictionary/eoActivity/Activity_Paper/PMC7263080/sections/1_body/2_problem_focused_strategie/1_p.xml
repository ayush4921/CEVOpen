<p>Research in psychology provides a useful framework for understanding how an individual with endometriosis will respond to a serious health threat such as COVID-19. The transactional model of stress and coping (

 <xref rid="hoaa028-B35" ref-type="bibr">Folkman and Moskowitz, 2004</xref>) indicates that the way any person adapts to this kind of stressor varies according to how they think about the stressor and the actions and behaviors they initiate to manage the demands of the situation; that is, the pain and challenges of living with endometriosis (

 <xref rid="hoaa028-B58" ref-type="bibr">Kvillemo and Bränström, 2014</xref>), such as problem-solving, information-seeking, acceptance, seeking support and planning, one is more likely to effectively cope with the ongoing stresses of living with endometriosis. On the other hand, disengagement coping strategies that focus attention away from thoughts and feelings about endometriosis, such as denial, substance use and self-blame, are likely to heighten feelings of being out of control and being distressed (

Women with endometriosis who engage in positive, problem-focused coping strategies report lower stress levels and less depressive symptoms, which results in less non-cyclical pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea compared to those with maladaptive coping strategies (

 </xref>). The key here is for individuals with endometriosis to adopt self-management and self-care strategies that will enhance feelings of being in control and minimize feelings of worry in the face of the additional serious health threat of COVID-19. While medical and/or surgical intervention in endometriosis may be effective (
 <xref rid="hoaa028-B60" ref-type="bibr">Leonardi 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020
 </xref>), they are not a ‘magic bullet’ and do not stand alone. Encouragement from healthcare providers to implement other self-management strategies should improve the confidence patients have in those strategies. Below, we review a series of active and self-directed strategies that may assist in coping with endometriosis in the face of COVID-19.
