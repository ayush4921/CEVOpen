<p>In addition, a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (known as FODMAP) diet may reduce the gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, that many women with endometriosis report (

 <xref rid="hoaa028-B6" ref-type="bibr">Armour 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2019b
 </xref>) found that 18% of survey respondents who used a specific diet reported being able to reduce their endometriosis-related medication by 50% or more. In some cases, it is unclear if there are confounding reasons for improvements (e.g. coexisting celiac disease in the case of a gluten-free diet). There is increasing evidence that visceral pain comorbidities (e.g. bowel or bladder conditions) can exacerbate chronic pain conditions and vice-versa (
 <xref rid="hoaa028-B20" ref-type="bibr">Costantini 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). As such, mitigating visceral pain triggers may have a positive downstream effect on endometriosis-associated pain. While these findings are interesting, and in some cases promising, there is no strong evidence for dietary interventions improving endometriosis symptoms.
