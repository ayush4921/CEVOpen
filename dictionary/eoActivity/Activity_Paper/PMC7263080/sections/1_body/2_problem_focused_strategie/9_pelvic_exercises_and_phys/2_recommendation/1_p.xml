<p>Pelvic physiotherapy is not something a patient can initiate on their own at home while in isolation. However, if patients have established relationships with pelvic physiotherapists, they could consider connecting with that individual to receive advice on what they may achieve at home while in isolation. In some cases, often due to funding limitations for the services of physiotherapy, patients are given instructions or lessons to perform at home, minimizing the number of in-person appointments necessary. Patients should consider implementing these strategies whilst at home. Patients can be directed to this simple pelvic exercise program recommended by the patient organization ‘Endometriosis UK’ (
