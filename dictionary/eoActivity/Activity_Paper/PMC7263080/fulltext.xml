Medical and allied healthcare appointments and surgeries are being temporarily postponed. Mandatory self-isolation has created new obstacles for individuals with endometriosis seeking pain relief and improvement in their quality of life. Anxieties may be heightened by concerns over whether endometriosis may be an underlying condition that could predispose to severe COVID-19 infection and what constitutes an appropriate indication for presentation for urgent treatment in the epidemic. Furthermore, the restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 can impose negative psychological effects, which patients with endometriosis may be more prone to already. In combination with medical therapies, or as an alternative, we encourage patients to consider self-management strategies to combat endometriosis symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These self-management strategies are divided into problem-focused and emotion-focused strategies, with the former aiming to change the environment to alleviate pain, and the latter address the psychology of living with endometriosis. We put forward this guidance, which is based on evidence and expert opinion, for healthcare providers to utilize during their consultations with patients via telephone or video. Patients may also independently use this article as an educational resource. The strategies discussed are not exclusively restricted to consideration during the COVID-19 pandemic.

</p><sec><title>Introduction </title><p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the resultant required self-isolation, is having a huge impact on the care of patients with endometriosis worldwide. With the support of several gynecological associations (<xref rid="hoaa028-B1" ref-type="bibr">AAGL &#x02013; Elevating Gynecologic Surgery, 2020</xref>), many medical centers have temporarily stopped offering surgical management for endometriosis. Similarly, many outpatient appointments for endometriosis with family physicians, gynecologists, fertility specialists and/or other allied healthcare professionals (e.g. physiotherapists, psychologists, dieticians) have been canceled or postponed. In addition, the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology has recommended postponing ultrasound evaluation of non-acute pelvic pain (<xref rid="hoaa028-B16" ref-type="bibr">Bourne <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). In addition to the effects of restrictions on healthcare services, patients with endometriosis, like everyone else, are at risk of negative psychological effects from mandated self-isolation (<xref rid="hoaa028-B17" ref-type="bibr">Brooks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). To offset the direct healthcare obstacles, we hope that as much as possible, patients are still able to connect with their healthcare providers by telephone or virtually online. We encourage healthcare providers and patients alike to consider medical management options that they have not yet trialed and that are within reach during this period of self-isolation despite the closure of services they may otherwise access. In combination with medical therapies or as an alternative, we encourage patients to consider self-management strategies that may be effective in combating the negative physical or psychological effects triggered by COVID-19 restrictions. The importance of integrating self-management strategies into the broad biopsychological approach to endometriosis is not novel (<xref rid="hoaa028-B18" ref-type="bibr">Buggio <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>) nor will it be exclusively relevant during this time. The necessity of long-term and multimodal treatments for endometriosis, including the self-management strategies described here, means the usefulness of the content of this article will extend beyond the current situation. We have therefore prepared the following expert opinion-based guidance on self-management strategies for patients to consider using during self-isolation and beyond (<xref rid="hoaa028-T1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;I</xref>).

The transactional model of stress and coping (<xref rid="hoaa028-B59" ref-type="bibr">Lazarus and Folkman, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B35" ref-type="bibr">Folkman and Moskowitz, 2004</xref>) indicates that the way any person adapts to this kind of stressor varies according to how they think about the stressor and the actions and behaviors they initiate to manage the demands of the situation; that is, the pain and challenges of living with endometriosis (<xref rid="hoaa028-B35" ref-type="bibr">Folkman and Moskowitz, 2004</xref>). If one adopts active, engagement coping strategies (<xref rid="hoaa028-B58" ref-type="bibr">Kvillemo and Br&#x000e4;nstr&#x000f6;m, 2014</xref>), such as problem-solving, information-seeking, acceptance, seeking support and planning, one is more likely to effectively cope with the ongoing stresses of living with endometriosis. On the other hand, disengagement coping strategies that focus attention away from thoughts and feelings about endometriosis, such as denial, substance use and self-blame, are likely to heighten feelings of being out of control and being distressed (<xref rid="hoaa028-B22" ref-type="bibr">Dijkstra and Homan, 2016</xref>). Women with endometriosis often use both problem- and emotion-based coping strategies (<xref rid="hoaa028-B77" ref-type="bibr">Roomaney and Kagee, 2016</xref>). Women with endometriosis who engage in positive, problem-focused coping strategies report lower stress levels and less depressive symptoms, which results in less non-cyclical pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea compared to those with maladaptive coping strategies (<xref rid="hoaa028-B23" ref-type="bibr">Donatti <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). The key here is for individuals with endometriosis to adopt self-management and self-care strategies that will enhance feelings of being in control and minimize feelings of worry in the face of the additional serious health threat of COVID-19. While medical and/or surgical intervention in endometriosis may be effective (<xref rid="hoaa028-B60" ref-type="bibr">Leonardi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>), they are not a &#x02018;magic bullet&#x02019; and do not stand alone. Encouragement from healthcare providers to implement other self-management strategies should improve the confidence patients have in those strategies. Below, we review a series of active and self-directed strategies that may assist in coping with endometriosis in the face of COVID-19.</p><sec><title>Education about endometriosis</title><p>Having a coherent understanding of endometriosis is an important step in being able to effectively self-manage this condition, as is the case with other chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease (<xref rid="hoaa028-B40" ref-type="bibr">Griva <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B89" ref-type="bibr">Weinman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). While awareness of endometriosis is building amongst the general population thanks to efforts by advocacy organizations and academics working in the field, endometriosis remains an enigmatic disease. Many patients learn of the word &#x02018;endometriosis&#x02019; at the time of consultation with their healthcare provider as a possible explanation for their symptoms. Patients may be given a diagnosis following clinical assessment (<xref rid="hoaa028-B2" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>), imaging (<xref rid="hoaa028-B71" ref-type="bibr">Nisenblat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) or surgery (<xref rid="hoaa028-B91" ref-type="bibr">Wykes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Depending on how they receive a diagnosis and by whom they are diagnosed, the information they receive may be inconsistent and ambiguous. Endometriosis education in schools has recently been introduced in some countries to raise awareness early and standardize messaging (<xref rid="hoaa028-B19" ref-type="bibr">Bush <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), but this has not been successfully attempted with adults. The tangible nature of endometriosis means that education is often focused on what can be seen (i.e. endometriosis deposits, endometriomas) rather than on the invisible downstream effects like chronic pelvic pain and central sensitization.</p><p>Learning more about endometriosis independently has been useful for some individuals (<xref rid="hoaa028-B77" ref-type="bibr">Roomaney and Kagee, 2016</xref>). Education on the role of the nervous system in endometriosis would be helpful for patients to understand how the various non-medical and non-surgical treatments may be useful. Knowing how and where to access patient-friendly information can be challenging.</p><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>Beyond the education delivered to patients directly by healthcare providers, we recommend guiding patients to reputable organizations that have demonstrated clear dedication to advancing the care of individuals with endometriosis. For some during self-isolation due to COVID-19, there may be more opportunities to educate themselves and so this should be especially encouraged. Sources of education may include university websites, where &#x02018;Information for patients&#x02019; can be found (<xref rid="hoaa028-B29" ref-type="bibr">EXPPECT, 2020a)</xref> or other reputable sources, such as regional or national advocacy organizations, which often involve collaboration between healthcare providers and patient representatives (<xref rid="hoaa028-B25" ref-type="bibr">Endometriosis Australia, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B26" ref-type="bibr">Endometriosis New Zealand, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B27" ref-type="bibr">Endometriosis UK, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B86" ref-type="bibr">The Endometriosis Network Canada, 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Work and study</title><p>During normal circumstances, episodes of escalated pain (frequently often associated with the menstrual cycle) lead to an inability to complete work/school obligations resulting in loss of productivity (<xref rid="hoaa028-B84" ref-type="bibr">Soliman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). Working from home (WFH) or attending school virtually has become a new normal for many individuals. This may create unfamiliar challenges for reporting sickness that limits one&#x02019;s ability to complete work/school obligations. People may be sensing a change in attitude on what warrants a &#x02018;sick day&#x02019; since WFH no longer requires commuting or the same degree of human interaction.</p><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>During this unprecedented time, we should endeavor to be empathetic of new obstacles (e.g. WFH with children, exacerbations of mental health issues, the necessity to devote extra time to ensuring financial stability) that may lead to difficulty fulfilling typical obligations. Honesty with employers and educators about anticipated and possibly unanticipated episodes of endometriosis-related pain may help to set expectations and decrease anxiety when it is necessary to request a sick day (<xref rid="hoaa028-B77" ref-type="bibr">Roomaney and Kagee, 2016</xref>). This period of time could also be an opportunity to discuss modifications of work/school obligations during times of pain exacerbation, if appropriate, and deemed possible by the person experiencing the troublesome symptoms. As a positive, it may demonstrate that removing the commute and having a comfortable environment allows the woman to be adequately productive, meaning a sick day is not required.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Social activities</title><p>During normal circumstances, episodes of escalated pain (or associated menstrual symptoms) or the development of chronic pelvic pain may necessitate social isolation (<xref rid="hoaa028-B64" ref-type="bibr">Mellado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>). In the past, social activities, such as going to the theatre, having coffee with friends or hosting a games night, might have been canceled or postponed due to pain. Now, during mandatory social isolation, these activities and others are no longer viable. While social isolation is being mandated broadly globally due to COVID-19 and this might seem advantageous to those with endometriosis, isolation is recognized as a contributor to psychosocial issues, especially amongst those who are vulnerable (<xref rid="hoaa028-B87" ref-type="bibr">Usher <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). A frequent strategy for those suffering from endometriosis is to schedule social events during more reliable periods of decreased or no pain.</p><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>More than ever, making a concerted effort to maintain social activities (in the context of current isolation rules) is vital. Using video conferencing applications and social media portals should be considered as a replacement for in-person gatherings. Many arts and culture organizations are providing access to material online. For those living with others, honesty about when and why they may be able or unable to socialize could be helpful. As a positive, this experience may teach us ways to connect that do not require leaving the house, which may facilitate a greater sense of social connectivity for women unable to leave the house in the future due to endometriosis-associated symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Social support</title><p>During the pandemic, social support networks will undoubtedly change in appearance, but their function and critical importance to help with coping with the dual stressors of endometriosis and COVID-19 should not be underestimated. The World Endometriosis Society has long espoused the value of endometriosis support groups in providing a valuable forum for mutual sharing of experiences and quality of life improvement through teaching coping mechanisms (<xref rid="hoaa028-B52" ref-type="bibr">Johnson and Hummelshoj, 2013</xref>). As noted above, utilizing technology to fill the void of in-person social interaction will be essential. However, there is an increasingly common belief that social media use is negatively associated with health-related outcomes (<xref rid="hoaa028-B81" ref-type="bibr">Shakya and Christakis, 2017</xref>). While there is certainly evidence for a concerning association, there is a suggestion that how one uses social media matters more than the quantity of use (<xref rid="hoaa028-B12" ref-type="bibr">Bekalu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B53" ref-type="bibr">Killam, 2020</xref>).</p><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>If possible, patients should consider connecting with their social supports by video instead of messaging or the telephone. This method of communication allows for the next best thing to in-person interaction. There is also a plethora of established online support through social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook. An example is the &#x02018;Endometriosis Australia&#x02019; Facebook page, which is, in part, a social network for those living with endometriosis where they may get the emotional support they need from others who similarly suffer from endometriosis (<xref rid="hoaa028-B25" ref-type="bibr">Endometriosis Australia, 2020</xref>).

Dysfunction in the physiology of sleep is common in those suffering from chronic pain (<xref rid="hoaa028-B83" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Haythornthwaite, 2004</xref>). To face the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring good sleep practices is even more important because sleep can modulate physical and mental health. Thinking and planning about sleep are relevant as our routines have changed, whereby some individuals may be WFH or studying from home, possibly even in their bedroom. Individuals with endometriosis are prone to issues with sleep (<xref rid="hoaa028-B73" ref-type="bibr">Nunes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B61" ref-type="bibr">Leone Roberti Maggiore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). <xref rid="hoaa028-B4" ref-type="bibr">Arion <italic>et al.</italic> (2020)</xref> found that overall quality of sleep was poorer in those also reporting more severe pain, poorer functional quality of life on the Endometriosis Health Profile-30 questionnaire, and more depression symptoms. Thus far, the literature on sleep dysfunction in women with endometriosis is limited. However, one randomized controlled trial (RCT) implemented an administration of 10 mg of daily melatonin, which was found to improve the quality of sleep, reduce pain scores and reduce analgesia use (<xref rid="hoaa028-B80" ref-type="bibr">Schwertner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>Adult patients should attempt to obtain 7&#x02013;9 h of sleep each night (<xref rid="hoaa028-B49" ref-type="bibr">Hirshkowitz <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>). Mindfulness activities may be helpful in falling asleep. Since sleep can be affected by many factors, patients should try to assess what factors are immediately modifiable (e.g. surrounding noise, light, distractions in bed). For extra support, the National Sleep Foundation has produced ready-to-use patient guidelines, which can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-guidelines-covid-19-isolation#guidelines">https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-guidelines-covid-19-isolation#guidelines</ext-link> (<xref rid="hoaa028-B70" ref-type="bibr">National Sleep Foundation, 2020</xref>). Talking to one&#x02019;s family physician about dysfunctional sleep or improving sleep is recommended before initiating over-the-counter agents such as melatonin. Online sleep programs based on sound scientific approaches (cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia (<xref rid="hoaa028-B50" ref-type="bibr">Horsch <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>)) are also available and may be of benefit to those women with significant sleep disruption.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Physical exercise</title><p>Exercise is increasingly being recommended to manage a range of chronic pain conditions (<xref rid="hoaa028-B38" ref-type="bibr">Geneen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>), including primary dysmenorrhea (<xref rid="hoaa028-B5" ref-type="bibr">Armour <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019a</xref>) and endometriosis (<xref rid="hoaa028-B8" ref-type="bibr">Awad <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B66" ref-type="bibr">Mira <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>).

However, if patients have established relationships with pelvic physiotherapists, they could consider connecting with that individual to receive advice on what they may achieve at home while in isolation. In some cases, often due to funding limitations for the services of physiotherapy, patients are given instructions or lessons to perform at home, minimizing the number of in-person appointments necessary. Patients should consider implementing these strategies whilst at home. Patients can be directed to this simple pelvic exercise program recommended by the patient organization &#x02018;Endometriosis UK&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref> S1). Besides this document, which has been approved by experts in physiotherapy and contains important instructions on safety, patients should be cautious about using videos without previous consultation with a physiotherapist. In some cases, the pelvic floor muscles can already be hypertonic or non-relaxed, requiring relaxation and coordination of pelvic floor muscles rather than strengthening (<xref rid="hoaa028-B32" ref-type="bibr">Faubion <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).

Though often limited by bias intrinsic in the data collected from observational studies and the complexity of the subject being evaluated, there is evidence that there may be an increase in endometriosis risk with increased red meat consumption (<xref rid="hoaa028-B92" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and a decrease in risk with increased consumption of fish oils, green vegetables, fruits (especially citrus fruits) (<xref rid="hoaa028-B45" ref-type="bibr">Harris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018</xref>) and dairy products (<xref rid="hoaa028-B67" ref-type="bibr">Missmer <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B44" ref-type="bibr">Harris <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="hoaa028-B72" ref-type="bibr">Nodler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>). However, we do not currently have evidence that altering the consumption of these potential risk factors once endometriosis has occurred leads to any symptomatic improvements. There is some evidence for the following dietary modifications that may improve symptoms:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>dietary factors (e.g. green tea, resveratrol, fish oil, soy isoflavones) with known anti-inflammatory effects have been shown to mitigate disease progression, assessed as lesion size in mouse models;</p></list-item><list-item><p>there may be a decreased risk for advanced endometriosis stage and/or reduction in pain symptoms in afflicted patients who use an anti-inflammatory diet;</p></list-item><list-item><p>a gluten-free diet showed a significant positive effect in reducing pain symptoms in endometriosis patients (<xref rid="hoaa028-B63" ref-type="bibr">Marziali <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>In addition, a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (known as FODMAP) diet may reduce the gastrointestinal symptoms, such as bloating, that many women with endometriosis report (<xref rid="hoaa028-B68" ref-type="bibr">Moore <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). <xref rid="hoaa028-B6" ref-type="bibr">Armour <italic>et al.</italic> (2019b</xref>) found that 18% of survey respondents who used a specific diet reported being able to reduce their endometriosis-related medication by 50% or more. In some cases, it is unclear if there are confounding reasons for improvements (e.g. coexisting celiac disease in the case of a gluten-free diet). There is increasing evidence that visceral pain comorbidities (e.g. bowel or bladder conditions) can exacerbate chronic pain conditions and vice-versa (<xref rid="hoaa028-B20" ref-type="bibr">Costantini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017</xref>). As such, mitigating visceral pain triggers may have a positive downstream effect on endometriosis-associated pain. While these findings are interesting, and in some cases promising, there is no strong evidence for dietary interventions improving endometriosis symptoms.</p><p>There is some preliminary evidence that dietary supplements may be beneficial in the treatment of endometriosis. A small observational cohort study found that, compared to no treatment, daily consumption of 1800 mg of N-acetylcysteine for 3 months was associated with a greater likelihood of canceling planned laparoscopic surgery compared to the no treatment group (<xref rid="hoaa028-B76" ref-type="bibr">Porpora <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

Resveratrol, commonly found in significant quantities in grapes, wine and berries, may also assist in the reduction of endometriosis-related pain, however, the results from clinical trials in humans are mixed (<xref rid="hoaa028-B24" ref-type="bibr">Dull <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Finally, palmitoylethanolamide, in combination with a fatty acid and myrrh, taken twice daily for 6 months resulted in a reduction of non-cyclical pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea, however, there was no placebo group so caution is advised (<xref rid="hoaa028-B21" ref-type="bibr">De Leo <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>).</p><sec><title>Recommendation</title><p>It is too early to make formal recommendations on dietary changes that will improve the lives of those living with endometriosis. Nevertheless, simple advice like ensuring adequate fiber and fluid intake to avoid constipation and avoiding known triggers of bladder symptoms (personal to the individual but may include alcohol, acidic fruits, etc.) may be useful. The potential positive impact of dietary improvements extends far beyond endometriosis. Therefore, patients may consider experimenting as the risk of adverse events is low and there may be a potential benefit, especially during COVID-19 where spending more time eating at home may allow more opportunities to modify dietary intake. New practices that one may initiate during COVID-19 self-isolation to combat endometriosis-pain could lead to longer-lasting positive health effects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Heat</title><p>There are no RCTs directly looking at the effectiveness of heat in endometriosis.

While these are promising findings, several caveats may reduce heat&#x02019;s effectiveness in real-world use compared to clinical trials. Most women in the community are unlikely to be able to maintain constant heat at 38&#x02013;40&#x000b0;C for 8&#x02013;12 h using heat packs or hot water bottles, which are the most common forms used (<xref rid="hoaa028-B74" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Connell <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).

Along with the problem-based self-management strategies, individuals with endometriosis must adopt strategies to manage negative emotional responses to these threats posed by COVID-19. These strategies are always important, but there is a heightened need for adopting these strategies during this time. There are many self-help options to assist with managing these concerns, along with readily available support from psychologists and counselors. Consequently, several strategies that address the negative psychological effects of living with endometriosis exist and may be helpful for patients (<xref rid="hoaa028-B77" ref-type="bibr">Roomaney and Kagee, 2016</xref>). It is the responsibility of healthcare providers to guide patients through these emotion-focused, non-medical and non-surgical strategies. Some of these approaches are outlined below.</p><sec><title>Relaxation and mindfulness</title><p>A systematic review of psychological and mind&#x02013;body interventions for endometriosis highlighted several studies that identified a significant reduction in pain when patients were exposed to physical therapy with CBT, yoga, biofeedback, mindfulness and psychotherapy, psychotherapy combined with acupuncture and progressive muscle relaxation (<xref rid="hoaa028-B28" ref-type="bibr">Evans <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019</xref>). Not all of these interventions are relevant to self-management at home during isolation, but some are within reach of patients. Moreover, this category of treatment is included and encouraged by <xref rid="hoaa028-B85" ref-type="bibr">The British Pain Society (2013)</xref> guidelines on pain management for adults.

These strategies could be attempted in combination with medical management strategies that may still be prescribed via telephone or video consultations. In addition, regardless of whether exacerbated by endometriosis or not, the COVID-19 restrictions may trigger negative psychological effects (<xref rid="hoaa028-B17" ref-type="bibr">Brooks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020</xref>) in patients with endometriosis, which require diverse and multimodal strategies. The strategies discussed here may have merit not necessarily because they specifically target endometriosis, but because they target overall well-being. In relation to endometriosis, the literature on these self-management strategies is scarce and/or limited by lower methodological quality. In many cases, no RCTs have been completed within endometriosis populations to test the efficacy or safety of the strategies. For some (e.g. diet, sleep, mindfulness), the likelihood and severity of possible adverse events are low enough that the potential benefits would outweigh the risk. These may be more reasonable to attempt as novel strategies and patients could use their judgment and independent research to guide their decisions. For other strategies (e.g. pelvic floor exercises, cannabis), the risks are greater or they require guidance by healthcare providers. As such, greater caution should be used in initiating these strategies, though maintenance may be easier if the patient had initiated them before COVID-19 and had a period of adequate supervision or training.</p><p>For many of the problem-focused strategies, access to electricity, technological devices and the internet is required. Not all individuals may have access or the knowledge to navigate online resources. Some individuals may also experience difficulty accessing other necessities such as food to fulfill new diet trials or exercise equipment to complete at-home exercises. Unfortunately, providing solutions to this larger-scale disparity is beyond the aim of the article, which hopes to guide those who may read this article themselves or via their healthcare providers whom they may still be seeing through the telephone/virtual consultations.</p><p>While the postponement of surgeries and the limits to visiting healthcare providers for diagnosis and management of endometriosis are tragic, this is a time to seek alternative solutions. While they may be initiated as &#x02018;temporary bandages&#x02019; until the traditional options resurface, some individuals may find the lessons learned and outcomes experienced valuable, resulting in long-lasting changes to how their endometriosis is managed. Besides, in many ways, the strategies laid out here have possible benefits for general well-being and non-endometriosis conditions that may be useful during the present global scenario of COVID-19, which is undoubtedly eliciting new stressors.</p><p>It should be noted that this article is not meant to prescribe specific self-management strategies to patients, but rather provide education so patients may discuss options with their healthcare providers or make independent decisions that might be right for them. Healthcare providers may also direct their patients to the following article lay summary on &#x02018;Medical and self-care advice for women with endometriosis during the COVID-19 pandemic&#x02019;, which has been recently published by Endometriosis UK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Data</xref> S2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>hoaa028_Supplementary_Data</label><media xlink:href="hoaa028_supplementary_data.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the input of Mrs Tiffaney Marlow, pelvic floor physiotherapist of Bluewater Pelvic Health Centre in Ontario, Canada.</p><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; roles</title><p>All authors meet justification criteria of authorship as per ICMJE that is they all provided substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data, were involved in drafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content, gave final approval of the version to be published and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>No external funding was either sought of obtained for this study. </p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>Dr M.L. reports grants from Australian Women and Children&#x02019;s Research Foundation, outside the submitted work.
