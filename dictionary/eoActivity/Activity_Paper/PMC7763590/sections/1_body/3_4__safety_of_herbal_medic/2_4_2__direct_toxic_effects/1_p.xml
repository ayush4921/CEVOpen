<p>As with any conventional medication, herbal medicinal products have the potential to be accompanied by toxic and often significant adverse effects. Some of these may simply be difficult to digest, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and abdominal pain, commonly seen in patients ingesting wheat grass juice (

Other herbal products may contain directly toxic components, although it is important to differentiate between potential toxicities, which are based on the findings of pre-clinical research, and true toxicities, as observed in clinical human research. An example of a severely toxic herbal product is laetrile, or “vitamin B17”. Laetrile is prepared from amygdalin, a compound extracted from the inner contents of fruit pits, primarily apricots. While claimed to be a “wonder cure”, a 1982 study showed that the product contained high levels of cyanide, with patients exhibiting overt signs of cyanide toxicity at high doses of the treatment (nausea and vomiting, headache and dizziness, mental obtundation, and dermatitis). At the same time, laetrile injections were not found to be effective in improving survival-related outcomes [
