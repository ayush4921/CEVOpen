<p>More often, it is unclear as to why certain herbs with clear effects on drug metabolism in preclinical research do not result in altered serum levels of the drug in the clinical setting. An example of this is the popular herb 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic>, which has been shown to significantly induce pregnane X receptor (PXR)-regulated CYP3A4 transcription in HepG2 (human liver carcinoma) cells [

 <italic>Astragalus</italic> on serum levels of anticancer agents [
 <xref rid="B55-pharmaceuticals-13-00455" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], including the drug docetaxel, an anticancer drug metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer [
 <xref rid="B56-pharmaceuticals-13-00455" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Another example is the green tea component epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which significantly inhibits CYP3A4 activity and, thus, should reduce the metabolism of tamoxifen to its active component endoxifen, as mentioned in the previous section. Yet, in a randomized, controlled crossover trial of patients with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen, no difference was found in geometric mean endoxifen AUC 0–24 h in the period with green tea versus tamoxifen monotherapy (−0.4%; 95% CI, −8.6% to 8.5%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.92). Furthermore, no differences in C
 <sub>max</sub> (−2.8%; 95% CI, −10.6% to 5.6%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.47) nor C
 <sub>trough</sub> (1.2%; 95% CI, −7.3% to 10.5%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.77) were found [
