<p>The effects of hypericum on drug pharmacodynamics may have implications in the oncology setting as well. An example of this is the chemotherapy drug irinotecan (CPT-11), a commonly used agent in the treatment of gastrointestinal malignancies, usually in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid (leucovorin; FOLFIRI protocol), often with the addition of oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX protocol). The concurrent use of hypericum with irinotecan was shown to lead to a reduction of 42% in serum levels of the drug [

A similar effect was seen when hypericum was used in conjunction with the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, with a resultant 43% increase in imatinib clearance, up to 32% lower mean area under the concentrationâ€“time curve (AUC), and significantly lower C-max and half-life (t

Naringin is a potent inhibitor of intestinal organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs 1 and 2), decreasing exposure of co-administered substrates by as much as 85%) [
