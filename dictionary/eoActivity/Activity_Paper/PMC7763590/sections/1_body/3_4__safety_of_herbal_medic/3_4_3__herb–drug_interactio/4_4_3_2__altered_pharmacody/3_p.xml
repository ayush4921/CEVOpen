<p>It is important to note that while the increase in drug metabolism induced by herbal compounds such as hypericum may lead to reduced serum levels, and thus the efficacy of anticancer agents, the reduction in drug metabolism may also have a negative effect on cancer treatment. An example of this is the drug tamoxifen (used by the patient in the case vignette), an estrogen antagonist which is the mainstay of treatment for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen is metabolized primarily in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 to the active metabolite endoxifen. Endoxifen is then excreted, primarily in the feces, following phase II metabolism through UDP-glucuronyltransferases (UGTs) and sulfotransferase (SULT) [

The use of a curcumin supplement was found to reduce endoxifen levels in patients with breast cancer, through inhibition of the second-pass metabolism enzyme UGT [
