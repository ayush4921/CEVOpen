<p>Integrative physicians are medical doctors who have undergone training in one or more complementary medicine modalities, incorporating these practices into their biomedical work [
 <xref rid="B68-pharmaceuticals-13-00455" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The integrative physician can therefore understand the “language” of both conventional and complementary medicine, mediating between the often conflicting healthcare paradigms of the two and, thus, offering patients “the best of both worlds”. This is especially true for the oncology setting, where the integrative physician serves as a “gatekeeper”, providing patients and oncology HCPs with evidence-based guidance on the use of modalities such as herbal medicine, in both an effective and a safe environment.
