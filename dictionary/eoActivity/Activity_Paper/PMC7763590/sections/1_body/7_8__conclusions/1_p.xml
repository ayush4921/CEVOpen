<p>Healthcare professionals who treat oncology patients need to be aware that many of them are using herbal medicinal products, often without their knowledge. In order to effectively address the benefits and risks of this practice, oncologists, pharmacists, and integrative physicians need to work together and communicate effectively, conducting open and nonjudgmental conversations with their patients about this practice. In this way, informed and evidence-based decisions can be made, and the patient can be monitored for any untoward effects of the nonconventional treatment. While some herbal medicinal products can provide relief from symptoms, they may also result in harmful effects which include direct toxicity and herbâ€“drug interactions.</p>
