  <title>Questions to consider about the oncologist–pharmacist–integrative physician collaboration regarding herbal medicine use among oncology patients.</title>
 </caption>
 <p>* Are you interested in undergoing training/further training in herbal medicine? If so, what would be the goals of this process? Would it include understanding the indications and evidence for the effectiveness of herbal medicine in the relief of oncology-related symptoms; contraindications of specific herbal medicinal products; quality/quantity control of the herbal medicinal products being used by patients; and/or resources for further training which will meet your expectations regarding what you need to know about the use of herbal medicine in oncology?</p>
 <p>* Would you be interested in working with/joining an integrative oncology team/participating in the consultation on herbal medicine use? Who are the professionals which you feel would be most helpful for this goal (integrative physician, naturopath, dietician, herbalist)? How can you locate an integrative medicine practitioner/physician who can provide a high level of complementary medicine, including the use of herbal medicine, to your multidisciplinary team of oncology healthcare professionals?</p>
 <p>* In which kind of setting would you like to implement your training in herbal medicine, within your multidisciplinary team of oncology healthcare professionals? Would it be in the public/private sector or a research/academic-focused setting?</p>
 <p>* How much do you wish to become involved in the clinical treatment of the patient? How much time can you dedicate to working in an integrative capacity, including providing guidance on herbal medicine use by your oncology patients?</p>
