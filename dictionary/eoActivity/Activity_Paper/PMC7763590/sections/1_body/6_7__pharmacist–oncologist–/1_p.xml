<p>In order to provide patients and their oncology HCPs with patient-oriented guidance on the use of herbal medicinal products during and after active cancer care, there needs to be effective communication among oncologists, oncology pharmacists, and integrative physicians. The interaction among these three participants in the patient’s care, with the patient in the center, needs to be studied far more than it has until now, both quantitatively and qualitatively. However, our experience has shown that this interaction can significantly promote patient wellbeing and increase the trust of patients and their caregivers in the oncology HCP team. The collaborative efforts of oncologists, pharmacists and integrative physicians can be even more effective when a number of practical steps are taken, using a list of questions to consider asking oncology patient when addressing their use of herbal medicine (

These steps can help identify herbal medicine use among oncology patients, encourage them and their caregivers to talk about their expectations from this practice, as well as their safety-related concerns, and facilitate a more open and informative communication with their team of oncology HCPs. Additional questions regarding the oncologist–pharmacist–integrative physician collaboration should also be taken into consideration, since they can enhance this collaboration and further promote the safe and effective use of herbal medicine by their patients (
