<p>c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) is a serine/threonine kinase that is one of the members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>1</sup>
 </xref>. Activation occurs as a result of stimulation by factors such as oxidative stress, cytokines, and ultraviolet rays, thus inducing the apoptosis pathway of cells

  <sup>2–6</sup>
 </xref>. These JNKs have three isoforms. Among them, JNK1 and two are widely distributed in cells and tissues, but JNK3 is known to be distributed specifically in the brain

 </xref>. These facts suggested that JNK3 may be a target for therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>8–10</sup>
 </xref>. Through many studies, it has been shown that inhibiting JNK3 suppresses the formation of beta amyloid, one of the causes of Alzheimer’s disease, and has proven its potential as a therapeutic target

  <sup>11</sup>
 </xref>. However, all three JNK isoforms have an ATP binding pocket with a highly conserved sequence; thus far very few drugs that exhibit only high selectivity for JNK3 have been discovered

  <sup>1</sup>
 </xref>. Due to the side effects that appear in response to these selectivity issues, there is increasing interest in research to find a JNK3-selective inhibitor.
