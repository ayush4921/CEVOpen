<p>A docking study was conducted to understand the binding mode of the novel JNK3 inhibitors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>). When we performed the docking experiment of 
 <bold>8a</bold> with a known JNK3 structure (3OY1), it was shown that many of the interactions could contribute to complex stabilisation. First, the amino pyrimidine used as the hinge binder was found to form two hydrogen bonds with Met149 of JNK3 and another hydrogen bond is plausible between the oxygen of the cyclopropyl carboxamide group in 
 <bold>8a</bold> and Gln155 in the extended hinge region. The third hydrogen bond seems possible between the nitrile located in the three position of pyrazole, which forms two hydrogen bonds between the backbone and the side chain of Asn152. Lastly, the aryl group at position 1 of pyrazole also fits into the hydrophobic pocket formed by residues such as Met148, Val79, Val145, Leu144, Ala91, Ile92, Ile124 and Leu128, especially noting that the dichlorophenyl ring could form a halogen bond with Lys93.
