<p>The synthetic process of 3-alkyl-5-aryl-1-pyrimidyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrazole derivatives is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001">Scheme 1</xref>. We started with methyl ketones containing various aryl groups substituted (

 <bold>7e–f</bold>, 
 <bold>8a–f</bold>, and 
 <bold>9a–f</bold>, cyclopropylcarboxylated amine were directly incorporated. The terminal nitrile group was changed to an ester (
 <bold>11a</bold>) and carboxamide (
 <bold>12a</bold>) through
