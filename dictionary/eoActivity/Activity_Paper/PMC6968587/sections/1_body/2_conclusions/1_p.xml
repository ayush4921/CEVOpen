<p>We have successfully synthesised 3-alkyl-5-aryl-1-pyrimidyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrazole derivatives that were designed as novel JNK3 selective inhibitors in an effort to reduce the molecular weight from previous lead. Twenty-six compounds were synthesised and measured for their enzyme activity against JNK3. Particularly, compounds 
 <bold>7a, 7b, 8a,</bold> and 
 <bold>8b</bold> showed competitive activities against JNK3 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.635 μM, 0.824 μM, 0.227 μM, and 0.361 μM, respectively. Compound 
 <bold>7a</bold> was, indeed, a selective JNK3 inhibitor with an excellent selectivity profile, especially compared to the activity towards similar protein kinases such as p38α, GSKβ, Erk, JNK1, and JNK2. We believe that this novel scaffold, 3-alkyl-5-aryl-1-pyrimidyl-1
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrazole will be highly useful in the development of JNK3 selective inhibitors, as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases.
