 <bold>1</bold> was isolated as amorphous powder, displaying a positive response to Liebermann-burchardt reagent, as indicative for a triterpene moiety. The molecular weight of 
 <bold>1</bold> was determined as 414 Daltons according to GC–MS, which has been further confirmed by ESIMS, exhibiting a quasi-molecular ion peak at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 415 [M + H] with a corresponding molecular formula C
 <sub>29</sub>H
 <sub>50</sub>O. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR exhibited two doublets of high field shifted signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 0.22 and 0.45 (
 <italic>J</italic> = 4.0 Hz) which characteristic for non-equivalent methylene protons of cyclopropane, being mostly for the cyclopropyl-9,19 methylene moiety, together with an-oxymethine proton at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.17 (
 <italic>ddd</italic>, J = 15.5, 9.0, 4.5) attributed to H-3. The coupling constant value of the latter suggested its 
 <italic>β</italic>-configuration, meanwhile the C-4 bounded doublet methyl (
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.02, CH
 <sub>3</sub>-28) is of α- orientation. Further three doublet methyl signals (
 <italic>J</italic> = 6.5) appeared at δ, 0.94 (6H, H
 <sub>3</sub>-26, H
 <sub>3</sub>-27) and 0.93 (H
 <sub>3</sub>-21) along with two singlet methyl at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 1.06 (H
 <sub>3</sub>-18), 0.98 (H
 <sub>3</sub>-30) were assigned. According to 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR, the oxymethine carbon (C-3) was shown at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 77.2 with δΔ ~ −1.0 compared to those moieties containing two methyl groups at C-4 (
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">Kamisako et al., 1987</xref>). Based on the revealed chromatographic properties and spectroscopic features and comparison with literature, compound 
 <bold>1</bold> showed high similarity to 3β-hydroxy-29-nor-cycloart-24-one (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2001</xref>) except disappearance of carbonyl group at C-24, and hence it was finally assigned as 29-norcycloartanol (
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Agarwal et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). According to our search in literature and so for knowledge, this is the first time to assign 29-norcycloartanol on the bases of 1D and 2D NMR data (see
