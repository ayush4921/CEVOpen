<p id="p0125">According to GC–MS analysis, compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was confirmed as mixture of two major peaks with retention times of 32.86 and 33.48 (see 
 <xref rid="s0135" ref-type="sec">Figures S9-S10</xref> in 
 <xref rid="s0135" ref-type="sec">Supplementary data</xref>). Their molecular weight was identically confirmed as 414 Daltons, with corresponding molecular formula C
 <sub>30</sub>H
 <sub>52</sub>O. The unresolved mixture of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> was further established by 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectral data: In compound 
 <bold>2a</bold>, two quaternary carbon signals were deduced at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 134.51 and 134.48 which are being attributed to a 
 <sup>Δ</sup>8/9 structure. On the other hand, the second compound (
 <bold>2b</bold>) showed two characteristic signals in 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 0.31 and 0.54 (
 <italic>J</italic> = 4.0 Hz) indicating the presence of non-equivalent protons of a methylene cyclopropane. The oxymethine protons were shown at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.21 for both compounds (
 <italic>dd</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 4.4, 11.6, 2H, H-3), and their corresponding carbon signals were established at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 79.05 and 79.09. Further study of the spectral data of compound 
 <bold>2</bold> and comparison with literature confirmed its mixture nature of lanost-8-en-3-ol (
 <bold>2a)</bold> and cycloartanol (
 <bold>2b)</bold> (see 
 <xref rid="s0135" ref-type="sec">Figures S11-S12</xref> in 
 <xref rid="s0135" ref-type="sec">Supplementary data</xref>).
