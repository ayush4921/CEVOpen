<p id="p0130">As yellow solid, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> was obtained showing an UV absorbance during TLC. The molecular weight (
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 314) and corresponding molecular formula (C
 <sub>17</sub>H
 <sub>14</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>) of 
 <bold>3</bold> were established on the bases of ESIMS. According to 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum, structure 
 <bold>3</bold> showed two aromatic spin systems: Two 
 <italic>m</italic>-coupled protons of AB spin system for H-6 and H-8 were shown at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 6.26 and 6.39; and two doublet signals (each with 2H integration, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 9.0 Hz) being for AA'XX' spin system (i.e. 1,4-disubstituted aromatic residue) were shown at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 8.05, 7.0 corresponding to H-2′/H-6′ and H-3′/H-5′ in ring B, respectively. In the aliphatic region, two methoxy signals appeared at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.84 and 3.88 with corresponding carbon signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 56.0 and 60.0 through HMQC experiment (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Complete analysis of 1D (
 <sup>1</sup>H,
 <sup>13</sup>C) and 2D NMR (HMQC and HMBC) and comparison with literature established the structure of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> as kampferol −3,4′ dimethyl ether. So far as we know, compound 
 <bold>3</bold> was isolated herein to first time from 
 <italic>E. balsamifera</italic>.
