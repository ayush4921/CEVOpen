<p id="p0135">As polar colourless solid, with an UV absorbance (254 nm) during TLC, compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was obtained. According to the negative mode of ESIMS, a 
 <italic>pseudo</italic> ion peak was shown at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 343 [M−H], and the corresponding molecular formula as C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>20</sub>O
 <sub>9</sub>, indicating the presence of six degrees of unsaturation (DBE). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> showed two 
 <italic>m</italic>-coupled (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.6 Hz) aromatic signals of AB spin system at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 6.22 and 6.29 and anomeric proton at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 5.0 (d, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 9.4 Hz) establishing the presence of 
 <italic>β</italic>-configured sugar moiety. The sugar unit was identified as 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucose by the signals in the range of 3.38 – 3.82 with a coupling constant ≈ 9.0 Hz as well as comparison the 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR data with the reported literature (
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Atta et al., 1982</xref>). Two singlet signals, corresponding to methyl ether (
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.93) and aromatic bounded acetyl group (2.61) were assigned, respectively. Based on the 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum, 15 carbon signals were deduced, which classified into six sugar carbons, six aromatic signals, acetophenone carbonyl (
 <italic>δ</italic> 203.5), one methoxy (
 <italic>δ</italic> 54.9) and a 
 <italic>sp</italic>
 <sup>3</sup> acetyl carbon (
 <italic>δ</italic> 31.8) (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). HMBC showed a 
 <sup>3</sup>
 <italic>J</italic> -linkage between the anomeric proton H-1′ and the quaternary aromatic carbon C-4 (
 <italic>δ</italic> 163.3), meanwhile H-3 (
 <italic>δ</italic> 6.22) showed HMBC connectivities with C-2 (
 <italic>δ</italic> 166.3), C-4 (164.1), C-5 (91.4) and C-1 (106.4). Based on the chromatographic and intensive spectroscopic data, the structure of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was confirmed as 4-O-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranosyl-2-hydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone. The latter was isolated previously from the roots of 
 <italic>Prunus armeniaca</italic> and 
 <italic>Euphorbia fischeriana</italic> (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">Prasad, 1999</xref>), meanwhile it is reported herein to first time from 
 <italic>E. balsamifera</italic>.
