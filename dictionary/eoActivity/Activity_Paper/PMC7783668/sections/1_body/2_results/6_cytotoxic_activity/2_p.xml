<p id="p0170">The plant fractions, 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, ethyl acetate, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol were evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for their cytotoxic activity against three human cancer cell lines HepG2, HCT116 and MCF7. Interesting result was observed for 
 <italic>n</italic>- hexane fraction against HCT116 and HepG2 with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 76.2 µg/ml and 54.7 µg/ml respectively with low cytotoxicity against normal retina cell line RPE1 of IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 79.2 µg/ml (see 
 <xref rid="s0135" ref-type="sec">Figure S32</xref> in 
 <xref rid="s0135" ref-type="sec">Supplementary data</xref>). A significant activity was observed for crude compound 
 <bold>3</bold> while the pure compound 
 <bold>3</bold> displayed higher activity than the reference drug against HCT116, HepG2 and MCF7 (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 111.46 µM, 42.67 µM and 44.90 µM, respectively. Unfortunately, the cytotoxicity of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> on normal cell was high with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 16.6 µg/ml. Therefore, the crude 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction could be applied 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> as it is much safe on the normal cell compared to pure compound 
 <bold>3</bold>. No significant activities observed for other compounds and sub-fractions (see Table S34 in 
 <xref rid="s0135" ref-type="sec">Supplementary data</xref>). The literature showed complete agreement for inactivity of compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold> against human cancer cell lines (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2017</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to our results, isooreintin (
 <bold>7</bold>) showed a moderate activity against four cancer cell lines including HepG2 and MC7 (
