<p id="p0210">The cytotoxic activity of the plant’s extracts, and afforded fractions and corresponding isolated compounds were investigated against three human cell lines, MCF7, HePG2 and HCT116. Accordingly, the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction among the three fractions showed a significant IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 54.7 and 76.2 µg/ml against HCT116 and HePG2, respectively, and low cytotoxicity against normal retina cell line RPE1 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 79.2 µg/ml). Kampferol-3,4′-dimethyl ether (
 <bold>3)</bold> exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 111.46, 42.67 and 44.90 µM) against HCT116, HePG2 and MCF7, respectively (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) than those reported by doxorubicin. However, the cytotoxicity of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> on normal cell was high with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 16.6 µg/ml, excluding it as anticancer agent or it needs further modification into other safe drugs to decrease such cytotoxicity. Therefore, the crude 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction could be applied in vivo as it is much safe on the normal cell compared to pure compound 
 <bold>3</bold>. In contrast to our negative cytotoxic results, isooreintin (
 <bold>7</bold>) showed a moderate activity against four cancer cell lines including HepG2 and MCF7 (
