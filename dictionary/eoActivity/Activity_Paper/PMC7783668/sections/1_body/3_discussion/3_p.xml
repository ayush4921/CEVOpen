<p id="p0180">In our ongoing for search of bioactive compounds from plants and study their broad biological activities, we report herein the isolation and structure assigning of 
 <italic>Euphorbia balsamifera</italic> produced metabolites and investigate their antibacterial and cytotoxic activity to first time so far. In accordance, an application of the plant’s extract into fraction using 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, followed by GC–MS analysis for the un polar fractions (
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction and sub-fractions 
 <bold>I&amp;III</bold>) tentatively revealed the presence of 24 compounds, at where lupeol acetate, cycloartenol, α-amyrine, lanostenol and germanicol, represent the most abundant metabolites, respectively.
