 <italic>Euphorbia balsamifera</italic> is a valuable natural source for antibacterial agents which could be useful 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study. Antibacterial assays showed that 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fraction is the most active against tested strains while cytotoxic assays revealed that 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane fraction is the most active against HCT116 and HePG2 cancer cell lines. The antibacterial activities of glycoside compounds are lower than non-glycosides which were observed for a significant antibacterial activity of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> while no activity for compound 
 <bold>5</bold> in addition to higher activity of compound 
 <bold>3</bold> than compounds 
 <bold>6</bold>,
 <bold>7</bold> confirmed the antibacterial activity decrease with glycosylation. Kampferol-3,4â€²-dimethyl ether is the most cytotoxic compound against three human cancer cell lines in crude and pure form while other tested compounds isolated from 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fractions are not active, but it is toxic against normal cell line. All compounds were isolated for the first time from 
 <italic>E. balsamifera</italic> and it is first full assignment of 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR of 29-nor-cycloartanol compound based on 1D and 2D NMR
