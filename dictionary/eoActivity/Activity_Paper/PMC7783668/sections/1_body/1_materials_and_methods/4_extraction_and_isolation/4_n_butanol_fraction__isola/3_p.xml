<p id="p0050">An application of fraction 
 <bold>III</bold> (1.0 g) to column chromatography on polyamide eluted with water/methanol afforded two sub-fractions. The first sub-fraction (350 mg) was subjected to sephadex LH-20 (MeOH), and the obtained semi pure compound 
 <bold>6</bold> was re-purified by PTLC (preparative thin layer chromatography) using chloroform/methanol/water (7.5:2.5:0.25) system to give quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>6,</bold> 10.0 mg). The second sub-fraction (420 mg) was purified on silica gel column and elution with chloroform/methanol (7:3) and the obtained compound was re-purified using RP-PTLC eluted with water/methanol (4:6) and visualized by UV lamp to afford isoorientin (
 <bold>7</bold>, 12.7 mg).
