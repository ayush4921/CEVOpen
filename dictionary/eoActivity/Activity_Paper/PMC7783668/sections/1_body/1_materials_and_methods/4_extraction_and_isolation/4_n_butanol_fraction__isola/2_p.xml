 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fraction (36.7 g) was subjected to column chromatography on silica gel and eluted with a gradient system of chloroform and chloroform/methanol leading to three main fractions 
 <bold>I, II</bold> and 
 <bold>III</bold>. Fraction 
 <bold>I</bold> (960 mg) was chromatographed on sephadex LH-20 column with a methanol/chloroform (6:4) to afford a sub fraction which was purified on silica gel column using chloroform/methanol (8:2) to give 4-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2-hydroxy-6-methoxyacetophenone (
 <bold>4</bold>,2.8 mg). Fraction 
 <bold>II</bold> (1.5 g) was purified on sephadex LH-20 column, eluted with MeOH, and followed by silica gel using chloroform/methanol (7.5:2.5) giving the major compound 
 <bold>5</bold>, which was further purified by reversed phase-preparative thin layer chromatography (RP-PTLC) using water/methanol (1:1) system and visualized by UV lamp (245 and 366 nm) to give 4-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-L-rhamnosyl-(1 → 6)-β-D-glucopyranosyl-2-hydroxy-6-methoxy-acetophenone (
 <bold>5</bold>, 4.4 mg) in pure form.
