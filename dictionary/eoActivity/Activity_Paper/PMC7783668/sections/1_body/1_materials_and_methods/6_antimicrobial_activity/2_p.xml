<p id="p0090">The antibacterial activity of the plant’s extract, corresponding fractions and obtained compounds was performed against eight bacterial strains according to Murray et al (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Murray, P.R., Baron, E.J., Pfaller, M.A., Tenover, F.C. &amp; Yolken, 1995</xref>). The bacterial suspension was adjusted to a density of bacterial cells of 1.2 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL. A sterile swab immersed in this bacterial suspension was used to inoculate the entire surface of Mueller-Hinton Agar (MHA: M173, India) plates. Wells of 6-mm diameter were made on MHA plates using sterilized gel puncture. About 30 μL of each plant extract concentrations 0.0 up to 100 μg/mL) diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were transferred onto each well of all plates then, the plates were then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The inhibition zones (mm) were measured (

The following eight bacterial strains were served during the present antibacterial activity study: Gram positive bacteria (
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> Scott A, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 6538), 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>) and Gram negative bacteria (
 <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serotype Enteritidis, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 8739) were obtained from Egyptian Microbial Culture Collection, Microbiological Resource Center (The Cairo MIRCEN: Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt). Each strain was aseptically sub-cultured in Tryptic Soy broth (TSB: Merck 1.05459, Darmstadt, Germany) and checked for purity onto Tryptic Soy agar plates (TSA: Merck 1.05458, Darmstadt, Germany), incubated for 24 h at 37 
 <sup>◦</sup>C.
