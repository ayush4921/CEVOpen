<p>The different functional groups in different solvent extracts of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root were determined by FTIR analysis. The FTIR spectra revealed that the four extracts studied showed a strong, broad stretching band at 3300 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>, with methanolic and aqueous extracts showing broader bands than those of other extracts (chloroform extract, 3332 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>; ethanol extract, 3423; aqueous extract 3242; methanolic extract 3251 cm
 <sup>–1</sup>). A broad stretching band at 3300 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> indicates the presence of intermolecular −OH groups (

 </xref>). In addition, bands at 2924, 2906, 2949 and 2837, and 2879 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> in chloroform, ethanol, methanol, and aqueous extracts, respectively, indicate the presence of a C–H stretching alkane. Further, bands at 1614 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C=C stretching conjugated alkene), 1455 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C–H bending alkane methylene group), 1214 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C–N stretching amine), and 754 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C–Cl stretching halo compound) for the chloroform extract; 3195 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (broad O–H stretching alcohol intramolecularly bonded) and 1035 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C–O stretching primary alcohol) for the ethanol extract; 1652, 1565, 1480 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C=N stretching imine/oxime), 1411 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (O–H bending carboxylic acid), and 606 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C–I stretching halo compound) for the methanolic extract; and 1550 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (N–O stretching nitro compound), 1413 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C–H bending alkane methyl group), and 603 cm
 <sup>–1</sup> (C–I stretching halo compound) for the aqueous extract were observed.
