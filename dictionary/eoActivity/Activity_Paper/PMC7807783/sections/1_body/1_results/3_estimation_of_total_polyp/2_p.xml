<p>The methanol extract of the root of 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> has the highest total polyphenols, followed by aqueous, ethanol, and chloroform extracts (

  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref>). Similarly, the methanol extract of the root of 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> possessed the highest amount of flavonoids, followed by ethanol, aqueous and chloroform extracts. This shows that methanol is a more potent solvent to extract the maximum amount of total polyphenols and flavonoids. The least amount of polyphenols and flavonoids was extracted from the chloroform extract among all of the other extracts.
