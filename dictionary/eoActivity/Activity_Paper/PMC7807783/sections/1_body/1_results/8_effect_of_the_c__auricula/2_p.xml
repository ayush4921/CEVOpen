<p>In this present study, diabetes was induced with a combination of high fat diet and a low dose of streptozotocin (STZ) and the effect of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root extracts was evaluated. The change in the body weight of mice of different groups is presented in

 </xref>. The mice were fed with the high-fat diet for 11 weeks; thus, a considerable increase in body weight was observed among the high-fat-diet-fed mice as compared to the control group. After the induction of diabetes, the weight of mice in the diabetic group significantly reduced, whereas the treatment with the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root extract could help in regaining the weight much better than the metformin-treated group.
