 </sup> with slight changes. Briefly, 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) containing 6.7 mM sodium chloride was prepared, and porcine pancreatic α-amylase and 1% (w/v) starch solution was prepared using the above buffer. Different concentrations of extracts were taken, to which 500 μL of starch was added and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. About 50 μL of porcine pancreatic amylase (0.15 unit/mL) was added to initiate the reaction and was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Then, 1 mL of dinitro salicylic acid reagent (1 g of DNSA, 30 g of Rochelle salt was dissolved in 20 mL of 2 N sodium hydroxide and made up to 100 mL with distilled water) was added to all test tubes and incubated for 5 min in boiling water to terminate the reaction. Test tubes were cooled to room temperature and diluted with 5 mL of water, and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm. Acarbose (1 mg/mL) was used as a positive control. The α-amylase inhibitory activity of the extract was calculated using the following formula:

 </disp-formula>Based on the percentage of inhibition of the enzyme activity, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated and the inhibitory effect of the extract was compared with that of the standard.
