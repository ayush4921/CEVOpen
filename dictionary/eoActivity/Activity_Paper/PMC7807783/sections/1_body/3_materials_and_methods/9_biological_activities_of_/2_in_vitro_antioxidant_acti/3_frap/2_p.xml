 </sup> About 8.5 mL of the reaction mixture consisting of 1 mL of different concentrations of the standard (ascorbic acid) and solvent extracts was mixed with 2.5 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), and 2.5 mL of 1% of potassium ferricyanide [K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>] was thoroughly mixed and incubated for 30 min at 50 Â°C. About 2.5 mL of 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid was added, and the solution was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Last, 2.5 mL of the supernatant was taken and diluted with the same amount of distilled water and 0.5 mL of 0.1% (w/v) ferric chloride. The absorbance was measured at 700 nm, and an increase in the absorbance of the reaction mixture indicates increasing reducing power.
