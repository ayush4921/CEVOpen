<p>After acclimatization, animals were divided into two sets: the first set (

  <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="other">9</xref>
 </xref>) and the second set (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15) received a high-fat diet (
 <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl9" ref-type="other">9</xref>
 </xref>) for 8 weeks, followed by a single small dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg body weight) dissolved in 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.5) and 5% of sucrose solution for 24 h. After 5 days, fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were measured and it was confirmed that second group mice were with FBG levels ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L). Then, the second set of mice were divided into three groups, 
 <italic>viz</italic>., group 2: diabetic (positive control), group 3: diabetic + metformin (102.74 mg/kg bw) (standard group) (the human dose: 500 mg is converted into mouse dose using “DoseCal” calculator of Janhavi et al.

 </sup>), and group 4: diabetic + the methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root (150 mg/kg bw) (treatment group). The treatment of metformin and the methanolic extract of root of 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> was given for 8 weeks, and the mice were maintained with the AIN 93 diet. After the last treatment, mice were fasted overnight, euthanized and blood and muscle samples were collected. The blood was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min, and the plasma obtained as the supernatant was separated. The muscle sample was stored in 10% formalin for the histological study. The remaining muscle and plasma were stored at −20 °C until further use.
