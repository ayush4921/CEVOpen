<p>The imbalance between the antioxidant and pro-oxidant levels results in oxidative stress, and antioxidants scavenge the free radicals to reduce the oxidative stress. In this study, to determine the antioxidant potential of different solvent extracts of the root, DPPH and FRAP assays were performed. The results of the DPPH assay revealed that the methanolic extract showed better antioxidant activity compared to other extracts and standard. This was further confirmed by the FRAP assay, which showed a similar pattern of the result. The earlier studies had shown that

 </sup> have antioxidant properties. However, the methanolic extract in this study showed the least IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of about 42.87 ± 1.51 μg/mL for the DPPH assay and 47.13 ± 0.37 μg/mL for the FRAP assay. This may be because of the highest polyphenol content, as polyphenols are known for their antioxidant potential.

 </sup> It is further confirmed by FTIR analyses, the results of which revealed that the methanolic extract has a broader peak at 3300 cm
