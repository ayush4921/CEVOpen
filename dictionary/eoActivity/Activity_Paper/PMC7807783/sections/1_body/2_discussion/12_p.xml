<p>In addition to the elevated fasting blood glucose levels, decreased plasma insulin levels, and alterations in the lipid profile as characteristic features of diabetes, oxidative stress is also associated with diabetes. Hyperglycemia is known to generate reactive oxygen species, which in turn cause oxidative stress.

 </sup> In the present study, there was a significant increase in the levels of oxidative stress markers, 
 <italic>i.e</italic>., ROS and NO, in both the plasma and muscles with a concomitant decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT in the T2D mice compared to control mice. However, mice treated with metformin and the methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root showed an increase in the activities of SOD and CAT in the plasma and muscles, confirming the antioxidant property of the methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root. The oxidative stress in the muscle tissue is further supported by the deleterious alteration in the histological architecture of the muscle in diabetic mice as there was a deposition of fat and infiltration of leukocytes, indicating inflammation or damage to the tissue.
