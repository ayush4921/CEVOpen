<p>The herbs are used for medicinal purposes because of their less or no side effects. The bioactives present in the herbs may be the reason for their health-benefiting properties. However, the phytocomponents of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root are not well known/understood. Hence, this study investigated the total polyphenols as well as flavonoids present in different solvent extracts and the antidiabetic activity of the methanolic extract of the root both in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. The methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root showed the highest amount of total polyphenols, followed by aqueous, ethanol, and chloroform extracts in the order mentioned. The HPLC profile of polyphenols showed that coumaric acid in the methanolic extract, gallic acid in the chloroform extract, and syringic acid in ethanolic and aqueous extracts are present in the highest concentrations compared to other polyphenols present in respective solvent extracts. Further, the flavonoid content was also found to be highest in the methanolic extract compared to other extracts studied. The methanolic extract was followed by ethanolic, aqueous, and chloroform extracts. Furthermore, the results of this study revealed that the antioxidant potency of the methanolic extract was high, with the least IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (42.87 ± 1.51 μg/mL), followed by ethanol, aqueous, and chloroform extracts compared to the standard. The potent methanolic extract, among four extracts studied, showed antidiabetic properties both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>.
