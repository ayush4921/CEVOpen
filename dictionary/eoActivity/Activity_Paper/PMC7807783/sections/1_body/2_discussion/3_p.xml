<p>The methanolic extract reduced the hyperglycemia in the high-fat-diet-fed + STZ-injected type-2 diabetic C57BL/6 mice (T2D mice), suggesting the hypoglycemic/antidiabetic property. The administration of a high-fat diet + STZ injection resulted in a decrease in the body weight, an increase in the fasting blood glucose level, the concentration of ROS and NO in the plasma and muscles, with a concomitant decrease in the plasma insulin and activities of antioxidant enzymes. The above results are further authenticated by the alteration in the normal architecture of the muscle tissue in the diabetic mice compared to other control mice. Further, there was a significant increase in the activities of plasma AST, ALT, and ALP as well as the plasma concentration of urea, uric acid, and BUN in the high-fat-diet-fed diabetic mice compared to control mice. The levels of plasma TC, TG, LDL, VLDL, and the atherogenic index were found to be elevated significantly, with a significant decrease in the HDL level in T2D mice compared to control. However, the administration of 150 mg/kg body weight of the methanolic extract of the

 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root extract act as an antidiabetic agent.
