<p>The body weight of all the T2D mice was increased over control mice in this study. After STZ induction, the body weight of diabetic mice decreased compared to other group mice. This may be because in the diabetic condition, the muscle protein is degraded to provide amino acids as substrates for gluconeogenesis

 </sup> as the decreased level of insulin due to STZ-induced diabetes cannot transfer glucose into the cells and utilize the same. However, it has been mentioned earlier that insulin and glucose levels were normalized to the level of control mice in metformin and extract-treated mice and hence the body weight is not reduced as there may be increased glucose uptake and thereby reduced gluconeogenesis in treated diabetic mice.
