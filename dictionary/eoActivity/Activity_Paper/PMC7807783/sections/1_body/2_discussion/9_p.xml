<p>The plasma lipid profile of T2D mice was altered in this study compared to other groups mice. These results are similar to those of earlier studies where Holmes et al.

 </sup> reported that high-fat-diet-fed rats showed increased plasma TG and TC levels. Studies reported that diabetes increases hepatic TG.

 </sup> The increased amount of TG leads to the accumulation of fats and causes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

 </sup> Increased levels of LDL-C and TG have been proven to contribute to the development of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.

 </sup> Indeed, in this study, there is a significant increase in the plasma levels of TG and LDL, which might lead to cardiovascular diseases. In recent years, the lipid profile alteration has been determined by the atherogenic index. The atherogenic index of plasma is a logarithmically transformed ratio of TG and HDL-C. It is considered as an indicator of dyslipidemia and associated diseases.

 </sup> The atherogenic index of diabetic mice in this study is significantly high compared to control, metformin, and extract-treated mice, indicating a significant damage/alteration in the diabetic mice, which may lead to cardiovascular diseases. This is because the atherogenic index is linked with cardiovascular diseases.
