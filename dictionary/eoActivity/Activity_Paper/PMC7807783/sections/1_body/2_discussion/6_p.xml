 </sup> Hyperglycemia for prolonged periods results in diabetes and its associated secondary complications like diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, 
 <italic>etc</italic>. Hence, maintaining the near-normoglycemic condition is a dire need in a diabetic patient. The blood glucose level increases soon after the digestion of food and the absorption of monomers; hence, the inhibition of oligo/polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes, 
 <italic>viz</italic>., α-amylase and α-glucosidase, could delay the hydrolysis of polysaccharides. In this study, the methanolic extract of the 
 <italic>C. auriculata</italic> root, the potent extracts among all the extracts studied, suppressed the activities of hydrolyzing enzymes, suggesting potency in reducing the hyperglycemic condition.
