<p>According to the so-called “cholinergic hypothesis”, AD is linked to decreased levels of acetylcholine (ACh) accompanied by a loss of cholinergic neurons in the central nervous system. In order to raise the concentration of this neurotransmitter, inhibitors of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), the main enzyme responsible for the degradation of ACh, have found use in clinical practice, improving functional autonomy and cognitive functions in AD patients [

 <italic>Amaryllidaceae</italic> alkaloids, isolated from 
 <italic>Narcissus tazetta</italic> L., was recently evaluated. Their structures were determined by NMR and mass spectroscopy, while in vıtro AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) inhibitory activity was evaluated using Ellman’s colorimetric method, with galantamine as reference. (+)-11-Hydroxygalanthine had the highest selective inhibitory activity on AChE, and narcissidine also inhibited AChE rather than BChE; while (−)-pancratinine-C was a selective BChE inhibitor. Docking studies confirmed bioactivity results [
