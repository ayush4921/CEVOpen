<p>Monoamine oxidases (MAOs) are enzymes responsible for the oxidative deamination of both xenobiotic and endogenous neurotransmitters. Both MAO isoforms (MAO-A and MAO-B) are involved in the degradation of dopamine; however, MAO-B is the predominant isoform in the human brain. For this reason, MAO-B selective inhibitors, like selegiline and rasagiline, are used for the treatment of PD, raising striatal dopaminergic activity through the inhibition of dopamine metabolism [
