<p>Meanwhile, Rupcic et al. discovered two new metabolites of the medicinal mushrooms 
 <italic>Hericius erinaceus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hericius flagellum</italic> (a rare species). They determined the chemical structures of these new compounds and of other metabolites previously isolated from the two species through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and High-Resolution Mass Spectroscopy (HRMS), identifying them as cyathane diterpenes. All these compounds were tested in vitro on PC12 cells for their neurotrophic activity, showing that, although none of them was endowed with intrinsic neurotrophic properties, all of them promoted the production of neurotrophins NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) and BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) in astrocytic cells [
