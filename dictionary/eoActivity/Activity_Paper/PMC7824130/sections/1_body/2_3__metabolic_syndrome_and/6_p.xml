 <italic>Acalypha fluticosa</italic> extracts were recently screened for PPAR agonism and anti-inflammatory properties. Following a preliminary screening, four compounds were isolated from the methanol extract, namely 2-methyl-5,7-dihydroxychromone-5-
 <italic>O</italic>-b-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranosid, acalyphin, apigenin, and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside. Moreover, an acetylated derivate of chromone glucoside was synthesized and tested. In vitro on human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, acalyphin exhibited a specific PPARγ agonist activity, while apigenin revealed a weak PPARα agonism. Chromone glucoside displayed activity as a dual PPARα/γ agonist, while its acetylated derivative showed increased activity towards PPARα. These molecules, in particular acalyphin, also had anti-inflammatory properties, probably due to the inhibition of NF-κB and/or iNOS. Importantly, tested extracts and compounds were not found to be cytotoxic in vitro against human cells [
