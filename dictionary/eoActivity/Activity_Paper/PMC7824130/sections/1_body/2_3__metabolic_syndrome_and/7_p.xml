<p>The ethanolic extract of stems of the Panamanian plant 
 <italic>Talisia nervosa</italic> was also studied, along with its isolated components, for potential use in metabolic disorders. The extract displayed dual PPARα/γ agonism and also increased liver X receptor (LXR) activation. Therefore, four secondary metabolites, namely (–)-catechin, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, and β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranose-1,4,6-tris(3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate) were isolated and characterized. In vitro assays on HepG2 revealed that while (–)-catechin activated only PPARγ and not PPARα, the other three compounds activated PPARα, PPARγ and LXR, with methyl gallate being more potent than ethyl gallate on all three targets. The two gallates also reduced nitric oxide (NO) production in mouse macrophages (RAW 264.7) cells [
