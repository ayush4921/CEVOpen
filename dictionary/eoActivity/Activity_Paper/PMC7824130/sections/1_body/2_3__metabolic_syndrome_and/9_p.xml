<p>Other than plants and fungi, marine cyanobacteria have been a promising source of secondary metabolites with potential medicinal use. As an example, chlorophyll derivatives 13
 <sup>2</sup>-hydroxy-pheopytin-a and the novel 13
 <sup>2</sup>-hydroxy-pheofarnesin-a were recently isolated from 
 <italic>Cyanobium</italic> sp. LEGE 07,175 -and 
 <italic>Nodosilinea</italic> sp. LEGE 06001, respectively. The zebrafish Nile red fat metabolism assay confirmed a neutral lipid-reducing activity of both compounds after 48 h of exposure, with no toxic effects. In order to explain the biological mechanism behind this activity profile, 13
 <sup>2</sup>-hydroxy-pheopytin-a was found to increase PPARÎ³ mRNA expression. In light of these data, the presence of this compound in several foods, such as spinach, cabbage, 
 <italic>Spirulina</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlorella</italic>, makes it an important nutraceutical agent [
