<p>Over the years, the different aspects of metabolic syndrome have been thoroughly studied, and a number of potential molecular targets have been identified and characterized. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors (PPARs), a family of nuclear receptors involved in all aspects of energetic metabolism, have attracted much interest as targets for therapy, considering their important role in the recent past in the treatment of both dyslipidemic and glucose-related pathologies [

 <xref rid="B61-foods-10-00029" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Three PPAR receptor subtypes have been identified to date, respectively PPARα, PPARγ and PPARδ, each of which binds different endogenous ligands and is selectively expressed in different organs and tissues [

 <xref rid="B64-foods-10-00029" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Their differential expression and ligand specificity mirror their different physiological roles: PPARα and PPARδ are mostly responsible for catabolic functions such as lipid oxygenation and glucose consumption, while PPARγ regulates glucose uptake and anabolic functions, particularly lipid storage and adipose tissue formation [
