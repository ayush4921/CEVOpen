<p>A very promising way to prevent cardiovascular risk related to hyperinflammation and atherosclerosis is to target the macrophages that accumulate in the site of the atherogenic lesion and bind low density lipoprotein (LDL), transforming in foam cells and driving inflammation further [

 <italic>Terminalia Arjuna</italic>, containing a number of polyphenols including gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate and ellagic acid, displayed significant activity in stimulating apoptosis in macrophages and foam cells during the early stages of atherogenesis, thereby driving back inflammation and potentially reducing cardiovascular risk [
