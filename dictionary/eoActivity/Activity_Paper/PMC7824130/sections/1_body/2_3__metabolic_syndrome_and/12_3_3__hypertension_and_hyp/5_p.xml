<p>Finally, three new alkaloids (communesin I, fumoquinazoline Q and protuboxepin E) and nine known alkaloids (communesin A and B, cottoquinazoline A, prelapatin B, glyantrypine, protuboxepin A and B, chaetoglobosin C and penochalasin E) were recently isolated from the marine-derived fungus 
 <italic>Penicillium expansum</italic> Y32. All molecules were screened in vivo on a zebrafish model for their cardiovascular effects. All of them exhibited a mitigative activity on bradycardia induced by astemizole; moreover, all compounds, except for communesin B, showed vasculo-genetic effects [
