<p>The formation of advanced-end glycation products (AGEs) is involved in several pathologies such as atherosclerosis, arterial stiffness, but also Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. In a recent study, a group of lichen secondary metabolites and one semisynthetic derivative were shown to possess relevant inhibitory activity towards AGE formation. Although some of these compounds were endowed with antioxidant activity, it was not necessarily linked to the inhibition of AGE formation. Moreover, the tested compounds proved to have vasodilative effects, potentially useful in alleviating hypertension linked to atherosclerosis [
