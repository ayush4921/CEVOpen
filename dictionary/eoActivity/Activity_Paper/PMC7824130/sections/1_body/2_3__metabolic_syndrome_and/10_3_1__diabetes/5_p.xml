<p>Similarly, flavonoids kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside and kaempferol, isolated from 
 <italic>Cassia bakeriana</italic> (pink cassia) extracts, were also recently studied for their antidiabetic activities. While kaempferol was unambiguously able to inhibit Î±-amylase, the evaluation of the antioxidant activities of these compounds led to somewhat contrasting results, with both being active when tested via oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method, and only kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rhamnoside being active in DPPH assay. It is worth noting that the isolated compounds are less active than the whole extract, suggesting the importance of synergic effects between the various components of the extract [
