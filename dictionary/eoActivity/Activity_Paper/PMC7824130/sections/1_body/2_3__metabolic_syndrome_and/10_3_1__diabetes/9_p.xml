<p>Another fungus from the 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> genus, 
 <italic>Aspergillus sydowii</italic>, was found to produce a compound with significant antidiabetic potential, asperentin B. In vitro, this compound inhibited PTP1B six times more strongly than the positive control suramin. Interestingly, the structurally related compound asperentin did not display any inhibitory activity towards PTP1B. Future studies on structure-activity relationships and chemical modifications will be necessary to explain and enhance the antidiabetic activity of asperentin B [
