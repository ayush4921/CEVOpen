<p>The therapy of T2DM usually focuses on reducing postprandial glycemia, restoring peripheric insulin sensitivity and improving β-cell survival. Other than the previously discussed PPARγ, molecular targets for the therapy of T2DM include intestinal α-glucosidase and pancreatic α-amylase [
 <xref rid="B91-foods-10-00029" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], which catalyze the hydrolysis of dietary carbohydrates and whose inhibition leads to decrease of postprandial blood glucose levels, thanks to a decreased digestion and uptake of carbohydrates [

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is another target for the treatment of this pathology: this enzyme metabolizes glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone which stimulates insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion and delays gastric emptying [
