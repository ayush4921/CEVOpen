<p>Two natural compounds from 
 <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic>, known as butyrolactone I and II, along with three synthetic acetylated derivatives of butyrolactone I, were also screened in a different study for their activity as α-glucosidase inhibitors and as antioxidants. Butyrolactone I showed both α-glucosidase inhibitory and antioxidant activities, while butyrolactone II was the most potent antioxidant compound, but had a lower inhibitory activity toward α-glucosidase. Synthetic derivatives were less active, probably because of the acetylation of the hydroxyl groups of butyrolactone I [
