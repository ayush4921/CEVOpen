<p>However, the use of secondary metabolites requires in many cases a specific formulation, when we consider that they are often insoluble in water, and the problems related to the abuse of supplements containing bioactive molecules, while outside the scope of this review, must still be carefully considered, taking into account the side effects of the active ingredients themselves and the possibility of external contamination [
