<p id="p0080">To examine the mechanism by which TCEO-induced apoptosis, the expression levels of various pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes was quantified using qRT-PCR analysis. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with TCEO 12.5 and 25 µg/mL for 24 h caused a dose-dependent decrease in anti-apoptotic 
 <italic>Bcl-2</italic> gene expression (p &lt; 0.05), however, treated MCF-7 cells showed

 <italic>Bax</italic> and 
 <italic>caspases 8, 9, 3</italic> upregulation by TCEO relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) internal control (
