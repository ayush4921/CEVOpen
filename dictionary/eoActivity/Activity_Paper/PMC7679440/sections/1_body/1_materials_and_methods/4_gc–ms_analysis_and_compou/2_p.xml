<p id="p0030">The chemical constituents of TCEO were determined using gas chromatography and a mass spectrometer (Turbomass, PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The temperature program was set to 40 °C, followed by a 2 min hold, then raised to 200 °C at a rate of 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup>, which was also then put on hold for 2 min. From 200 °C, the temperature was raised by 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 300 °C and held for another 2 min. The TCEO chemical composition were determined by comparing the mass spectra obtained with the mass spectra from the National Institute of Standard and Technology and WILEY Spectral libraries. The mass spectra TCEO compounds were also compared with those of similar compounds in the Adams Library (
