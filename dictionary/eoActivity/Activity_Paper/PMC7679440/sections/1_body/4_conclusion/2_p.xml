<p id="p0120">Our results established the presence of fenchol, borneol and 3-cyclohexene-1-methanol the as a main constituent of TCEO. The anticancer activity of the essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> is mediated through halting cell cycle in dose-dependent manner that subsequently prompted apoptosis. Our results indicate the potential applications of TCEO in complementary and alternative herbal treatment especially in cancer treatments. The presence of several constituents in TCEO such as fenchol, borneol, cadinene and linalool may serve as an efficient natural antitumor compounds to enhance the human health. Similar investigations using different types of cancer cell lines should be performed to further confirm our findings and explore the detail mechanism for possible pharmaceutical application.
