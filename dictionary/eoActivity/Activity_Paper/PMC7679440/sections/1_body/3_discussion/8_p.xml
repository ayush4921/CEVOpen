<p id="p0115">The essential oils anticancer activities of many plant species have been referred to the presence of monoterpenes and its derivatives in their constituents (
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">Sobral et al., 2014</xref>). Our GCâ€“MS data on the essential oil compositions of 
 <italic>T. camphoratus</italic> showed that fenchol and borneol monoterpenes were the primary compounds. It was found that some of these compounds detected in TCEO were previously known to exhibit anticancer activities. Among these ingredients, borneol compound which represents 9.66% of all constituents of TCEO. A recent study established that borneol promoted apoptosis, downregulated the expression of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax and caspase-3 in glioma cells (

 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki et al., 2016</xref>). According to the obtained results, it could be predicted that the anticancer activity of TCEO is due to these constituents, which can synergistically perform these effects with remaining compounds.
