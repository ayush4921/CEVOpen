<p>Total flavonoid contents were estimated using the method described in 
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Ebrahimzadeh et al. (2008)</xref>. The extract (0.5 mL of 1 mg/mL) was mixed with 1.5 mL of methanol. To this mixture, 0.1 mL of 10% aluminum chloride was added, followed by 0.1 mL of 1 M potassium acetate and 2.8 mL of distilled water. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The absorbance was measured by a spectrophotometer at 420 nm. The results were expressed as milligrams quercetin equivalents (QE) per gram of extract (mg QE/g extract).
