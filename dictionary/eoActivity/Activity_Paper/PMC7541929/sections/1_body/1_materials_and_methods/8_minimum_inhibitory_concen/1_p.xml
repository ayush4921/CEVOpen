<p>The organisms that showed susceptibility to the different solvent extracts were introduced into the broths containing different concentrations of each extract (serial dilutions of the extracts corresponding to 200, 100, 50, 25, and 12.5 μg/mL). The tubes were then incubated for 24 h at 37°C. The MIC was taken as the lowest concentration of the extracts that did not permit any visible growth (
