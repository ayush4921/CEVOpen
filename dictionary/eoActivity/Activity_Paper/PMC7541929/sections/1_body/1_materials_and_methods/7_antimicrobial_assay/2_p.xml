 </italic>: This was carried out using the protocol described by 
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">Owoseni and Ajayi (2010)</xref>. Test organisms were sub-cultured onto fresh suitable broth medium. Broth cultures were then incubated at 37°C till the turbidity of 0.5 McFarland’s standard (1.5×10
 <sup>8</sup> colony forming unit/mL) was obtained. Mueller-Hinton agar was used as bacterial medium and Sabouraud agar as fungal medium. All were incubated appropriately as specified for each test organism. The turbidity of the actively growing broth culture was then adjusted with sterile saline to obtain 0.5 McFarland’s standard turbidity. This was used to flood and then drain dry the surface of solid Mueller-Hinton agar plates. Wells of 5 mm in diameter and about 2 cm apart were punched in the culture media with a sterile cork borer. The extracts were thereafter used to fill the boreholes. Each plate was kept in the refrigerator at 4°C for 1 h before incubating at 37°C for 24 h (bacteria) and 72 h (fungi). Zones of inhibition around the wells, measured in millimeters, were used as positive bioactivity.
