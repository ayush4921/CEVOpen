<p>Total phenolic content was determined according to Folin-Ciocalteu reagent method (
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Cicco et al., 2009</xref>). Different concentrations (0.2âˆ¼1.0 mg/mL) of gallic acid were prepared in methanol. Concentrations of the extracts were also prepared in methanol. Distilled water (4.5 mL) was added to 0.5 mL of the extract and mixed with 0.5 mL of a 10-fold diluted Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. Subsequently, 5 mL of 7% sodium carbonate and 2 mL of distilled water were added. The mixture stood for 90 min at room temperature before the absorbance was read at 760 nm. All determinations were performed in triplicates with gallic acid utilized as the positive control. The total phenolic content was expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE).
