<p>In conclusion, the results of this study show differences in the antimicrobial activities of the oil and non-oil extracts against the bacterial and fungal strains studied. This study has provided preliminary 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data on the antimicrobial potential of extracts obtained from seeds of 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic>. The results in this study provide information on potential antibacterial and antifungal leads. More extensive studies for the potential identification and isolation of lead compounds as well as confirmatory 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies will be carried out.
