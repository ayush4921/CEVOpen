<p>Upon completion of the Soxhlet extraction process, a yield of 15.69% was obtained (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This consisted predominantly of oil (13.05%) and a denser non-oil portion (2.64%). Both components were separated by draining off the oil and then used for further analysis. The 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> oil seed extract was observed to contain significantly higher amounts of total flavonoids and total phenols compared to the non-oil extract (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). Total tannins were however significantly higher in the non-oil extract compared to the oil extract (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). The result of the ferric reducing antioxidant potential assay revealed that there was no significant difference between the FRAP values of both seed extracts and the reference antioxidant, ascorbic acid (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). This result suggests that the seeds may possess good reductive properties comparable to ascorbic acid and this could be attributed to the presence of phenolics such as flavonoids and tannins present in both extracts.
