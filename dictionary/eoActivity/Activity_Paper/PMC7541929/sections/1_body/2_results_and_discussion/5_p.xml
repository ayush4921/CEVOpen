<p>Several studies have reported lower zones of inhibition in Gram-negative organisms compared to Gram-positive organisms. This is attributed to the Gram-negative outer membrane functioning as a barrier that prevents the penetration of antimicrobial compounds directed against the bacteria. The presence of hydrolytic enzymes that break down foreign molecules in the periplasmic space is also another factor that limits the susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to antimicrobial substances (

 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> oil has good inhibitory action against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp. The 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> seed oil may therefore be a potent source of antimicrobials targeted against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp. The effectiveness of the seed oil against 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp. is particularly important due to the prevalence of 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp. in food-borne infections.
