 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the minimum inhibitory and bacteriocidal concentrations of oil and non-oil extracts for dry 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> seed against some bacterial strains. The MIC is the lowest concentration of a drug that is bacteriostatic, preventing the visible growth of bacteria. MICs are used by diagnostic laboratories mainly to confirm resistance, but mostly as a research tool to determine the activity of novel antimicrobial agents. On the other hand, MBC is the minimum concentration of an antimicrobial agent that can kill 99.9% of bacteria (
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Andrews, 2001</xref>). The MIC values ranged from 50 to 100 μg/mL, while MBC values ranged from 100 to 200 μg/mL for both extracts studied. The results obtained showed that the MIC values for both the oil and non-oil extract were lower than their MBC values. This suggests that both extracts possess bacteriostatic effect at lower concentrations and bacteriocidal effect at higher concentrations.
