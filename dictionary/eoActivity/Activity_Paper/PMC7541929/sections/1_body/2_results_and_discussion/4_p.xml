<p>The antibacterial susceptibility test for oil and non-oil extracts of dry 
 <italic>C. sinensis</italic> seed against some bacterial strains is shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The observed zones of inhibition varied from one organism to another and at different concentrations of either extract. The Gram-positive strain 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> showed concentration-dependent susceptibility to both extracts at 200, 100, and 50 μg/mL, the zone of microbial inhibition corresponded to 6, 4, and 2 mm, respectively. However, 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> was insensitive to either extract at 50 μg/mL but at 200 and 100 μg/mL, the degree of susceptibility of the organism to the seed oil was 8 mm and 6 mm, respectively. Susceptibility was however lower for the non-oil extract (2 and 1 mm, respectively). Inhibition of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp. growth was observed at 100 and 200 μg/mL for both extracts. Zones of inhibition observed for 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> sp. were 16 and 18 mm, respectively for the oil extract and 2 and 4 mm, respectively for the non-oil extract. 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> inhibition zones were much smaller (2 and 4 mm, respectively for the oil extract; 1 and 2 mm, respectively for the non-oil extract).
