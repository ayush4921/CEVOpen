<p>Used since ancient times, cocoa-based products continue to represent the option of choice for many people; however, the increased degree of awareness in terms of negative aspects of sugar consumption has created the need for artificial sweeteners with low calories and similar taste. Although originally used, chemical sweeteners have been involved in several health issues thus triggering the search for vegetal sweeteners which ideally would contribute to oral hygiene. The current study proposes the preparation of two hot chocolate products with vegetal compositions which, in addition to agreeable taste, may provide antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. A variety of plant products was used, either herbs of fruits, with high polyphenolic contents and strong antioxidant activity. Both products exhibited antimicrobial effects, in particular on germs that populate the oral cavity; however, the VHC1 product was revealed with the highest antibacterial properties. When the two final products were tested in vitro on human gingival keratinocytes, all tested concentrations not only proved non-toxic but induced a slight stimulatory effect on cell viability thus revealing that both products can be safely used in oral administration. Also, this result may suggest the potential beneficial effects on the oral mucosa thus providing an opportunity for future research. When applied on dermal cell lines, the two chocolate products exhibited safe toxicological profiles even in high concentrations; nevertheless, low concentrations should be used in skin treatments.</p>
