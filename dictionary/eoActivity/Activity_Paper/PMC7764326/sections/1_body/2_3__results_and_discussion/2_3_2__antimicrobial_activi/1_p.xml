 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01844-f002">Figure 2</xref> exhibits the antimicrobial activity of VHC1 and VHC2 samples on the nine tested bacterial strains; one can notice that on all strains the VHC1 product induces lower optical density (OD) values compared to VHC2 thus indicating higher antimicrobial activity. For the VHC1 product, lower OD values compared to the reference sample were recorded for all tested strains and concentrations, respectively, which denote an antibacterial activity exerted through the inhibition of the micellar development. VHC2 exhibited higher than reference OD values for most strains and concentrations. For 
 <italic>S. mutans, S. aureus,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic> the OD values increase with increasing VHC2 concentrations thus emphasizing the stimulatory effects on the micellar development induced by the main component matrices. On the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> type B cultures, VHC2 produced weak antimicrobial effects when 75 si 100 µL were applied, as reflected by its lower OD values compared to the reference; for the fungal cultures of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>C. parapsilopsis</italic>, increased product concentrations lead to the inhibition of micellar development but the OD values are superior to the control brain heart infusion (BHI) sample. Considering the composition of the two analyzed products, VHC1 and VHC2, and their effects on the tested bacterial cultures, one can conclude that the VHC1 antibacterial effects are attributable to its components (cardamom, wild thyme—
 <italic>Thymus serpyllum</italic> L., green tea, alfalfa, sage, Echinacea—
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> L.) while the VHC2 components (black currant, blueberry, hibiscus—
 <italic>Hibiscus rosa-sinensis</italic> L. and clove) exhibit weaker antimicrobial effects.
