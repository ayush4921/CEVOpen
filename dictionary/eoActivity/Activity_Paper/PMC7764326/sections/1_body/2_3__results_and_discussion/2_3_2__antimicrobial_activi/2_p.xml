<p>Plants produce numerous secondary metabolites with antimicrobial properties as part of their normal growth process with the purpose to inhibit the attack of environmental pathogens; therefore, plant extracts are usually revealed with effective antibacterial properties. Previous studies have identified antibacterial and antifungal effects for: (i) black currant (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>A. niger, P. vulgaris, C. albicans</italic>—[
 <xref rid="B64-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]); (ii) clove and thyme (
 <italic>S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, S. pyogenes, Corynebacterium</italic> spp, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> spp, 
 <italic>B. fragilis, C. albicans</italic>—[
 <xref rid="B65-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]); (iii) blueberry (
 <italic>L. monocytogenes, S. enteritidis</italic>—[
 <xref rid="B66-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]); (iv) hibiscus (
 <italic>S. typhimurium, S. aureus</italic>—[
 <xref rid="B67-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]); (v) green tea (
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, dental bacteria—[
 <xref rid="B68-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]); (vi) cardamom (
 <italic>C. albicans, S. mutans, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, B. cereus, S. typhimurium</italic>—[
 <xref rid="B69-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]); (vii) alfalfa (
 <italic>S. pneumonia, H. influenza, M. catarrhalis</italic>—[
 <xref rid="B70-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]); (viii) sage (
 <italic>S. mutans, S. aureus, E. coli</italic>—[
 <xref rid="B71-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]); (ix) Echinacea (
 <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic> complex bacteria—[
 <xref rid="B72-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]). One mechanism through which plant extracts exhibit antimicrobial properties is the synergism between phytochemical compounds or between phytochemicals and associated antibiotics [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]; the synergistic mechanism can be explained by the association of numerous different molecules in plant extracts so that bacterial resistance through genetic mutations triggered by external stimuli is more difficult to develop [
 <xref rid="B74-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In addition, the presence of inactive compounds in plant extracts may influence the absorption, metabolization rate, and subsequently, the bioavailability of active compounds [
 <xref rid="B75-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. In our study, the association of various plant extracts in the VHC1 product produced a strong antibacterial effect as a result of the combined activities of individual extracts and active compounds, which may act in an additive or synergistic manner.
