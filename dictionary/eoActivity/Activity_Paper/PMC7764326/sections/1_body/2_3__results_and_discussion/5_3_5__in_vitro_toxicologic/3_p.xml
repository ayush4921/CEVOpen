One can notice that no toxicity effects occurred on the healthy HaCaT and 1BR3 skin cells after the application of both products even for the highest tested concentrations (50 µg/mL); moreover, both products induced a stimulatory effect, especially on 1BR3 fibroblast proliferation rate when applied in low concentrations (5 and 10 µg/mL, respectively) (
