<p>Our in vitro studies involved primary gingival and dermal keratinocytes and fibroblasts as well as immortalized skin cell lines; studies indicate that primary cell cultures may provide more useful clinical data than immortalized ones due to their natural ploidy and similar biological parameters with in vivo cells [
