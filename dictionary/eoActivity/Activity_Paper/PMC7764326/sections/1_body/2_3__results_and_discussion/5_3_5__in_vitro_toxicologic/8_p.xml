<p>Our study on human gingival keratinocytes as well as on the two healthy skin cell lines (human keratinocytes, HaCaT, and human fibroblasts, 1BR3 revealed not only a lack of cytotoxicity for both products but stimulatory effects in terms of cell growth. In a normal environment, healthy mammalian cells divide and multiply; the presence of a toxic agent causes the decrease of cell viability [

The addition of either product, VHC1 or VHC2, respectively, in various concentrations, to healthy cells has resulted in two distinct events: (1) The product did not affect cell viability, thus indicating the suitability of the product for safe administration in humans, without adverse effects; and (2) the product increased cell growth thus indicating cell turnover and resulting in the formation of new cells [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-09-01844" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. When the two final products were applied on human gingival keratinocytes one could notice that all tested concentrations induced a slight stimulatory effect on cell viability. This result suggests that both products are safe for oral administration and more importantly, lays the groundwork for further studies that will prove that the tested products are beneficial for different oral mucosa pathologies. The two dermal cell lines reacted differently to the two products; the HaCaT cells showed no cytotoxic effects after the application of the VHC1 product, regardless of concentration, while cell turnover occurred when the VHC2 product was applied in high concentrations. This behavior recommends the VHC2 product for topical application against skin ageing as it provides the formation of new skin cells thus making the skin more smooth and supple; the VHC1 product, although it does not provide stimulatory effects on the skin cells, is considered nontoxic and can be used safely in the biomedical field. Dermal fibroblasts 1BR3 showed a similar reaction to both chocolate products: low concentrations of the product induced cell growth while high concentrations were documented as nontoxic; therefore, we may conclude that the two chocolate products can be safely applied on human skin even in high concentrations but low concentrations should be used in skin treatments.
