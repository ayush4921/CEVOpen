<p>The identification and quantification of 11 individual polyphenols were conducted by using a Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS) Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) equipment with spectral power distribution ultraviolet lamp SPD-10A UV (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and LC-MS 2010 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) detectors and electro chemical (EC 150/2 NUCLEODUR C18 Gravity SB 150 × 2 mm × 5 um) separation columns. Gradient mobile phases were used for the separation of compounds: water with formic acid at pH-3 (mobile phase A), acetonitrile with formic acid at pH-3 (mobile phase B), gradient program: 0.01–20 min 5% B, 20.01–50 min 5–40% B, 5–55 min 40–95% B, 55–60 min 95% B, mobile phase 0.2 mL/min, temperature 20 °C. The monitoring wavelengths were 280 nm and 320 nm and the calibration curves were built between 20 and 50 µg/mL. The experiment was conducted in duplicate and results were expressed in mg/g.</p>
