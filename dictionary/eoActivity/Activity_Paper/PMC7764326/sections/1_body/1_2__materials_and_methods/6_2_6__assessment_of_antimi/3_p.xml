<p>For each bacterial and fungal strain tested, a fresh culture 10
 <sup>−3</sup> fold dilution, presenting an inoculum equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard (1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL), was used to perform the analysis. The resulting suspensions (100 μL) were added to a 96-well flat-bottomed microdilution plate (total volume of 200 μL). Increasing volumes (25, 50, 75, and 100 µL) of ready-to-drink products (VHC1 and VHC2 beverages) were applied on each bacterial and fungal suspension used [

The plates were covered and left for 24 h incubation at 37 °C, followed up by the OD measurement (ODT24). The tests were performed in triplicate for all samples; the mean values were calculated and used subsequently.
