<p>The two chocolate preparations, VHC1 and VHC2, were tested for their antimicrobial activity on bacterial and fungal strains obtained from our own laboratory culture collection (Laboratory of Microbiology, Interdisciplinary Research Platform within Banat’s “King Michael I of Romania” University of Agricultural Science and Veterinary Medicine Timisoara). The bacterial strains used are as follows: 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923), 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> (ATCC 19615), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (ATCC 27853), 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> (ATCC 12022), 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (ATCC 14028), and 
 <italic>Haemophillus influenzae</italic> type B (ATCC 10211) whereas the fungal strains used are 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231) and 
 <italic>Candida parapsilopsis</italic> (ATCC 22019). The strains were maintained at −50 °C and were revived prior to the experiment day by overnight incubation at 37 °C in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Oxoid, CM1135).
