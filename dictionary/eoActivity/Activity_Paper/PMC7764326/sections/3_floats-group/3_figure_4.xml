  <p>The effect of VHC1 and VHC2 on the viability of human skin cell lines—human immortalized keratinocytes—HaCaT, human skin fibroblasts—1BR3, and human primary dermal fibroblasts—HDFa, at 72-h post-stimulation. The cell viability percentage was normalized to control cells (no stimulation), considered 100% viability. The data represent the mean values ± SD of three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA analysis was applied to determine the statistical differences followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test (*
