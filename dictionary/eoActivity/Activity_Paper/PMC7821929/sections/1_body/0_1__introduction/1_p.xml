<p>Medicinal plants have the capacity to produce a variety of chemical compounds that are used to perform important biological functions. Majority of health care products available on the market are known to be derived from plants. Recently, the World Health Organization estimated that 80% of the world population relies on herbal medicines for some aspect of their primary health care needs, and, according to them, around 21,000 plant species have the potential to be used medicinally [

 <italic>Alangium salviifolium</italic> (L.f) Wang is a medicinal plant reported in Ayurveda and Chinese medicine. This plant is used traditionally to treat several diseases such as cancer, leprosy, diabetes, paralysis, microbial infections, and others. Plant parts such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, or the entire plant extract are consumed orally or applied dermally, depending on the type of disease that is treated. Experiments correlating this medicinal plant with specific diseases or activities were reported earlier [

 <xref rid="B17-cells-10-00001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] effects. Comprehensive untargeted metabolomics provides an unbiased analysis of all biochemical intermediates in a sample. This is achieved by using complementary universal analytical techniques such as LC/MS, GC/MS, and NMR. The factors that can affect the evaluation of a metabolome include the method used for sample harvesting/extraction procedures, fractionation, chromatographic separation chemistry, ionization techniques/modes, acquisition parameters, data processing/analysis, and identification [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-10-00001" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, by using orthogonal LC/MS and GC/MS techniques, we aimed for a comprehensive analysis, including identification of the metabolites present in stem bark for this plant.
