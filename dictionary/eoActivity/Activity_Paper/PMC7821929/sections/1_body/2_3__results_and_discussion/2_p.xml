<p>Five compounds reported to be present commonly in 
 <italic>Alangium</italic> species could not be identified in this study by LC-MS/MS spectral matching, since the spectra for these compounds were not available in the METLIN MSMS library. The spectral information was used to identify the compounds by using Agilent MassHunter MSC software (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00001-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The overall MSC score for all the compounds was &gt;97%, except for cephaeline which was 80%. Using the accurate mass precursor and fragment ion information for cephaeline, and the METLIN accurate mass database, we were able to identify the putative structures based on the MSMS spectra obtained for cephaeline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00001-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, using MSC for tentative ID confirmation can be a useful tool in shortlisting the number of compounds for subsequent confirmation using actual standards.
