<p>The separation chemistries for LC-MS/MS were performed using HILIC and three orthogonal reverse phase columns (ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18, SB-AQ, and Phenyl Hexyl) for the separation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds, respectively. The maximum number of compounds were identified in C18 (197) followed by SB-AQ (187), HILIC (175), and Phenyl Hexyl (139) columns (

Only 10 compounds were common to all 4 column types. The three different reverse phase columns, namely C18, SB-AQ, and Phenyl Hexyl, separated 79, 73, and 28 unique compounds, respectively, and HILIC revealed 80 unique compounds. Similar observations on enhanced metabolite coverage have been made by using HILIC and a reverse phase C18 column [
