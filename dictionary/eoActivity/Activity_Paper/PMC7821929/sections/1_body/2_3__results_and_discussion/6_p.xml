<p>The compounds found by GC/Q-TOF were mostly flavonoids, fatty acids, sugars, terpenes, etc. As an example, D-lyxose identified from GC/Q-TOF analysis of aqueous extract using MassHunter Unknown Analysis software is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-10-00001-f008">Figure 8</xref>. The top trace is the acquired GC/Q-TOF spectra, while the bottom trace is the Fiehn library spectra. The matching score was89.6. In addition, the retention time (RT) in the library (14.74 min) matched the RT of the acquired spectra (14.75 min).
