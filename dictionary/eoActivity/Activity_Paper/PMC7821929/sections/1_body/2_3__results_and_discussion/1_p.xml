<p>In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of 
 <italic>A. salviifolium</italic> bark metabolites using multi-separation protocols/ionization modes and multi-platform approaches. Initially, we performed fraction collection of the aqueous and organic extracts by injecting 1 mL of the extract for preliminary separation and enrichment of the metabolites. The Accurate Mass MS results when matched with METLIN database tentatively found 954 compounds with database match score &gt;90%. Literature search revealed 81 of 954 compounds have therapeutic properties. The majority of these therapeutic compounds were secondary metabolites that are reported to have anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities (
