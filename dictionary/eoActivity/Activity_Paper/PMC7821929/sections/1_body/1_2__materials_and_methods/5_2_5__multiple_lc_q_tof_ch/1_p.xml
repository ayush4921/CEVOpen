<p>The dried aqueous fractions were resuspended in 250 μL of 50:50 of methanol:water containing 0.2% acetic acid and sonicated for 10 s, whereas the organic fractionsweresuspended in 30:70 of mobile phase A and B (
 <xref rid="cells-10-00001-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>—organic), followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. Five microliters of the resuspended fractionswas injected into an Agilent 1260 Infinity LC System, interfaced to an Agilent 6540 accurate mass Q-TOF LC/MS system (Santa clara, CA, USA). The reference solution was prepared using API-TOF Reference Mass Solution Kit (p/n: G1969-85001 (Santa clara, California, USA).Ten microliters of HP921 and 5 μL of purine were dissolved in one liter of methanol:acetonitrile:water (750:200:50) containing 0.1% acetic acid and were sprayed using an isocratic pump at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The chromatographic parameters are shown in
