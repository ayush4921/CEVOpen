<p>The LC-MS/MS data were processed by using the tool “Find by AutoMSMS”, and the spectral pattern generated was searched against the METLIN metabolite library, comprising accurate mass MS/MS information for 19,714 compounds. A few selected compounds found in 
 <italic>Alangium</italic> species that were detected in METLIN database but lacked entry in METLIN library were processed using Molecular Structure Correlator software (MSC) (Santa clara, CA, USA). The MSC software (version B.05.00 build 19) performs systematic in silico bond breaking for the proposed structure and matches with the observed fragment ions, followed by assignment of an overall score. Here, the interface provided visualizations of the formula and the overall score, which was combined from the MS and MSMS score, along with the molecular formulas for the fragment ions with ppm
