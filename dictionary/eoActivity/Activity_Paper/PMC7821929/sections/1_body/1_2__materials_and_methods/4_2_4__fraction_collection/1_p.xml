<p>To the dried aqueous and organic layers, 200 Î¼L of 50:50 and 30:70 of mobile phase A and B of respective fractionation method (see 
 <xref rid="cells-10-00001-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were added. The vials were sonicated to resuspend the compounds. HPLC separation was performed by injecting the resuspended mixtures from 5 vials to an Agilent 1, (Santaclara, CA, USA) 260 Infinity analytical purification system equipped with a 1 mL Manual FL-Injection valve (p/n: 5067-4191).The fractionswerecollected in 45 wells of a 96-well plate and dried in a speed vac.
