<p>This study demonstrates the utility of applying a comprehensive metabolite separation and detection strategy to aid in identification of metabolites in 
 <italic>A. salviifolium</italic> bark. A multi-platform approach was used to detect compounds with different degrees of polarity. In addition, fractionation was used for enrichment, as well as four different column chemistries, along with two ionization modes for increasing the total number of metabolites identified. The compounds not found in the METLIN library were identified by using MSC software. Eighty-one secondary metabolites, such as ankorine, deooxytubulosine, ipecac, lacinilene C7-methyl ether, tubulosine, etc., which were identified in this study, are reported to have therapeutic value.
