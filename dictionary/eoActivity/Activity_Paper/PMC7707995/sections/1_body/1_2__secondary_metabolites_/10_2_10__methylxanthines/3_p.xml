<p>Caffeine is a methylxanthine that nonselectively antagonizes adenosine receptors and is the most widely used psychoactive substance in the world. Its chronic consumption has proven to be protective against neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson [

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. For many years, it was believed that caffeine consumption could be associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. However, Fondell and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>] performed a longitudinal analysis based on more than 1,010,000 men and women in five large cohort studies, in which they evaluated the association between caffeine, coffee, and tea consumption and ALS risk. The results showed that a total of 1,279 cases of ALS were documented during an average of 18 years of follow-up. Caffeine intake was not associated with the risk of ASL; the combined multivariate adjusted risk (RR) ratio was 0.96 (95% CI 0.81-1.16). Similarly, neither coffee nor tea has been associated with ASL risk. Therefore, the results of this large study did not demonstrate any associations of caffeine or caffeine drinks with the risk of ASL [
