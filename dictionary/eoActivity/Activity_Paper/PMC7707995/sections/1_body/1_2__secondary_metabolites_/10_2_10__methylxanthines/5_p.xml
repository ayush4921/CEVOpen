 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>] report that caffeine consumption improves cognitive function, prevents neurodegeneration, and restores neuronal plasticity and mitochondrial production in middle-aged rats and in the APPswe mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Regarding ALS, caffeine is believed to be neuroprotective, antagonizing A
 <sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors in the brain and thus protecting motor neurons from excitotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. In this sense, Monteiro et al. [
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], Kolahdouzan and Hamadeh [
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>], and Herden and Weissert [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>] also reinforce the beneficial effects of caffeine consumption in improving motor activity in the context of neurodegenerative diseases through mechanisms of neuroprotection and neurorestoration by trophic proteins, suggesting that caffeine is a promising compound for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
