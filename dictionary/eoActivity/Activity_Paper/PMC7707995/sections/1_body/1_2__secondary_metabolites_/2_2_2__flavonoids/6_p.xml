<p>Studies in mice revealed that the first steps in the development of ALS may comprehend the increased presence of SOD1 monomers and their aggregation to motor neurons. In this perspective, Ip and collaborators carried out tests 
 <italic>in silico</italic> with a library of 4,400 drugs and natural compounds that were coupled in the SOD1 dimer. Between these compounds, seven with best results were tested for aggregation and splitting of SOD1 induced by hydrogen peroxide in vitro at concentrations ranging from 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. Compound 22 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) revealed that quercetin-3-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucoside presented one of the best results, and for that, it may be a potential therapeutic inhibitor of misfolding and aggregation of SOD1 and, therefore, can delay clinical symptoms of ALS [
