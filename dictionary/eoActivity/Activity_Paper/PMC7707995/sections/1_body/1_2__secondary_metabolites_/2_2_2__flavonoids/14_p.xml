 <italic>In silico</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests of the cited studies demonstrated that extracts enriched with flavonoids, as well as their isolated, may act in the treatment of ALS by different mechanisms of action, such as decreased spinal cord injury, SOD1 inhibition, inhibition of motor neuron aggregation, inhibition caspase3, and decrease reactive oxygen species. These compounds may cause a delay in the appearance of the disease's signs and decrease the clinical manifestations. Therefore, by evaluating the toxicity of these compounds and establishing a therapeutic dose, they could potentially be qualified to undergo more advanced pharmacological tests, such as clinical trials.
