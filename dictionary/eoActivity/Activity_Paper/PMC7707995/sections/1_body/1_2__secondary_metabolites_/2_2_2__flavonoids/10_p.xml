<p>Excessive neuronal stimulation of glutamate leads to a large influx of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> which, when accumulated in mitochondria, triggers an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species for the formation of oxygen free radicals, just as this excitation leads to the activation of caspase3, which seem to be involved in the etiology of many neurodegenerative disorders, such as ALS. In this context, Shimmyo et al., through 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with mice induced by glutamate and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> tests with neuronal cells, showed that myricetin 24 (

 <italic>N</italic>-methyl D-aspartate receptor), inhibition of free oxygen radicals, and inhibition of capase-3 [
