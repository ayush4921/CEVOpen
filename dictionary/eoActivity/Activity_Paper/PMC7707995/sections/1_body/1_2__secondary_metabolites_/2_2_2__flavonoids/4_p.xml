<p>Ueda and collaborators also proved the action of kaempferida and kaempferol, extracted from Brazilian green propolis, as a possible alternative for the treatment and prevention of ALS. In this study, kaempferida (15 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) and kaempferol (3.0 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) were tested against Na
 <sup>2+</sup> cells (superoxide induced) with mutant SOD1. The results showed significant inhibition of mutant SOD1, as well as in Western blot analysis, which showed that kaempferol induced autophagy through the protein kinase activated by AMP, suggesting this as a probable mechanism for neuroprotection and emphasizing this compound as a good therapeutic alternative on the treatment of ALS [
