<p>Banerjee et al. reported an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study that evaluated the antioxidant activity of black plum peel and juice extract scientifically known as 
 <italic>Syzygium cumimi</italic> of the 
 <italic>myrtaceae</italic> family. The antioxidant activities of the aqueous extracts were verified for hydroxyl radicals, superoxide radicals, and stable free radicals 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazil (DPPH). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the fruit peel were 468 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 260 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 168 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. Thus, it can be said that the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>S. cumini</italic> has significant antioxidant activity. The author attributes this activity to the presence of tannins in the extracts and the peel of the fruit may be important for further studies in the fight against diseases, including ALS [
