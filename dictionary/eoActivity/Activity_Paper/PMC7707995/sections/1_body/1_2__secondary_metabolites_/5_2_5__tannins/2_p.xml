<p>In this perspective, Auddy and collaborators evaluated through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> tests, in an unprecedented way, the toxicity and the effect of eliminating radicals with ethanolic and aqueous extracts of three plants commonly used in Indian medicine: 
 <italic>Sida cordifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>Evolvulus alsinoides</italic>, and 
 <italic>Cynodon dactylon</italic>. The results demonstrated that the water infusion of the three plants (up to 1 mg/mL) did not show toxic effects on the PC12 cell line in the MTT tests. As for the verification of antioxidant effects, it was shown that in the ABTS test, the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>S. cordifolia</italic> presented a better result, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 16.07 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, followed by 
 <italic>E. alsinoides</italic> and 
 <italic>C. dactylon</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 33.39 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 78.62 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. As for water infusions, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were, respectively: 172.25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 
 <italic>E. alsinoides</italic>, 273.64 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 
 <italic>C. dactylon</italic>, and 342.82 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for 
 <italic>S. cordifolia</italic>. In the results of lipid peroxidation (TBARS), the water infusion of 
 <italic>E. alsinoides</italic> demonstrated the best result out of the three infusions with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 89.23 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have not shown significant results, and the author attributes the experimental model as being ineffective due to the high, rapid, and extensive degradation of the antioxidant inside the body. The results were promising for the continuity of tests and verification of activity in neurodegenerative diseases [
