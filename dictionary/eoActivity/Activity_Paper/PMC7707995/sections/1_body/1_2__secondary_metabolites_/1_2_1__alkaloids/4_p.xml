 <italic>Alternanthera littoralis P. Beauv</italic>. is a tree common in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Koolen et al. isolated seven chemical alkaloids from the aerial parts of this plant, which include two known alkaloids, hydroxytyrosol (9) and uridine (12), and five new alkaloids, namely, alternamide A (6), alternamide B (7), alternamine A (8), N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl) formamide (10), and alternamine B (11) (

The biological evaluations showed the high antioxidant free radical scavenging effect of the ethanolic extract containing alkaloids alternamide B (1.10 relative Trolox equivalentâ€”RTE), alternamide A (0.85 RTE), and alternamine B (0.65 RTE) in relation to positive control quercetin (5.62 RTE) [
