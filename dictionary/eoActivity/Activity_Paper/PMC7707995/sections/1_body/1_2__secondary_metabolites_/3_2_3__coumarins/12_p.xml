<p>In neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, compounds that activate signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation (ERK) and element response-binding protein (CREB) are considered as possible neuroprotective agents. Based on this information, Nakamura et al. tested phosphorylation capacity in human A172 cells of felopterin (39) and auraptene (40) isolated from citrus fruits (
