<p>Varier et al. performed molecular docking, using Auto Dock tools 1.5.6 program and the MGL tools 1.5.6 package, to predict the inhibitory capacity of esculin and hinokitol. In the target monooxidase b, esculin (37) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) obtained a more favorable binding affinity, with free energy result of -9.6 Kcal/mol, while the cocrystallized ligand levodopa and hinokitol (38) presented binding energies of -7.7 Kcal/mol and -7.2 Kcal/mol, respectively. For all six evaluated different targets, esculin exhibited the best results in comparison to the aforementioned ligands. Monooxidase B is found in the external mitochondrial membrane, whose dysfunction of this organelle may be associated with common neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Alzheimer's disease [
