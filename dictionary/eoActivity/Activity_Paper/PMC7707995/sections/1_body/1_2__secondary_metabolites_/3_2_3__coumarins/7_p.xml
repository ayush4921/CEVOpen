<p>To test the ability to inhibit oxidative stress from the extract of 
 <italic>Angelicae dahuricae radix</italic>, which presents furanocoumarin as a secondary metabolite, Moon and colleagues examined its effect on reducing the level of ROS in BV2 cells activated by lipopolysaccharides (LPS). It was observed a significant decrease in ROS levels at the concentrations of 10 and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> tests were performed using a dose of 100 mg/kg administered orally to rats during 14 days. The results indicated the extract's neuroprotective effect after spinal cord injury. In this way, the extract has a possible neuroprotective capacity for diseases such as ALS, mainly due to the decrease in cytokine levels when damage to BV2 cells is inferred [
