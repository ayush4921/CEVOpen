<p>The effects of 
 <italic>Caragana turfanensis</italic> on neuroinflammation inhibition were evaluated by Song et al. Among the 36 compounds present in the extract, a new coumarin, caraganolide A (34), was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The evaluation of each compound was performed on LPS-induced BV2 cells, and caraganolide A demonstrated an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.01 ± 1.57
