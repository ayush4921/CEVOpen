<p>Another fatty acid of importance in ALS is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (69) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), an essential fatty acid that modulates the main functions of the nervous system, including neuroinflammation, and regulation of pre- and postsynaptic membrane formation, being reduced in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and preclinical murine models [
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Based on this information, Torres et al. [
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] performed dietary supplementation of DHA in a murine model fASL B6SJL-Tg (SOD1 ∗ G93A), in which they observed that a diet rich in DHA significantly increases the survival of male rats by 7% (average of 10 days over 130 days of life expectancy) and delays motor dysfunction (based on stride length) and loss of weight associated with ALS transgene (

The literature also suggests the antioxidant action of fatty acids as the main mechanism of action.
