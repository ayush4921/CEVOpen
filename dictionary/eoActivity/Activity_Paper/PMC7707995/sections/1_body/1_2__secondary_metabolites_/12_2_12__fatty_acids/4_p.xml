<p>According to Días-Amarilla et al., nitro-fatty acids (NO
 <sub>2</sub>-FA) are electrophilic signaling mediators formed in tissues during inflammation, capable of inducing cytoprotective pathways and pleiotropic antioxidants, including the regulation of genes responsive to factor 2 (Nrf2) related to the erythroid nuclear factor. These researchers demonstrated that nitro-arachidonic acid (NO
 <sub>2</sub>-AA) or nitro-oleic acid (NO
 <sub>2</sub>-OA) administered in astrocytes that express hSOD1G93A bound to ALS at a concentration of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M induces an antioxidant effect through the activation of Nrf2 concomitantly with the increased levels of glutathione. In addition, the treatment of astrocytes expressing hSOD1G93A with NO
 <sub>2</sub>-FA prevented its toxicity to motor neurons, proving its antioxidant effect on astrocytes capable of preventing the death of motor neurons in an ALS culture model [
