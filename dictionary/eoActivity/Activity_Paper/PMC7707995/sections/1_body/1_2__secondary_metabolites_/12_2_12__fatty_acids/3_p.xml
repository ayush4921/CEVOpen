<p>Assessing the therapeutic potential of fatty acids for the treatment of ALS, Tefera and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>] observed the effects of triheptanoin fatty acid (68) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), a heptanoate triglyceride, in the treatment of mice that overexpress the SOD1G93A human gene mutant. They observed that rats fed the SF11-028 diet (composed of ingredients typical of other rat diets), modified with 35% oral triheptanoin, starting at P35 (35th day), showed attenuation in the loss of motor neurons at 70-day old by 33%. This result, combined with the pressure strength of the hind limbs, which demonstrated a delay in the loss of strength in hSOD1G93A mice treated with triheptanoin, suggests that this compound delays the loss of motor neurons and the appearance of motor symptoms in mice.
