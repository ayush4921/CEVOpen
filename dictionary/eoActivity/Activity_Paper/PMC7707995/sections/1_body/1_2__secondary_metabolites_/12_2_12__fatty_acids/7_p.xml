<p>Due to the importance of fatty acids for the structure and integrity of cell membranes, these compounds have been investigated with a potential neuroprotective effect. Studies in murine models have shown a beneficial effect obtained by the supplementation with fatty acids, such as DHA, omega-3 (
 <italic>Ω</italic>-3), and omega-6 (
 <italic>Ω</italic>-6). Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that the amount to be supplemented is not yet well established. Some studies have suggested that the neuroprotective effect is derived from a balance between fatty acids [
