<p>Lignans are a group of phytochemicals, which are produced by oxidative dimerization of two phenylpropanoid units [

 <italic>Sesamum indicum L</italic>) and bark of 
 <italic>fagara</italic> plants, for neuroprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects on neuronal cells PC12. The compound 1-methyl-phenylpyridine (MPP+) was used as an oxidative damage inducer. The results showed that in picomolar doses (10
 <sup>−12</sup> M), sesamine protected the PC12 neuronal cells from oxidative stress, attenuating by up to 60% the cell death caused by MPP+, in addition to reducing the production of reactive oxygen species. Further results revealed an increase in the production of SOD proteins, as well as a reduction in catalase. Sesamine showed potential in preventing neurodegenerative diseases [
