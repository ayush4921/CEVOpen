 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), as reported previously, was also the object of the study of Shimoyoshi et al. They examined the possibility of sesamine affecting the cognitive decline in mice accelerated by senescence (SAMP10). Analytical methods showed changes in oxidative stress related to age in reactive brain carbonyl species (CRs) in mice treated with sesamine. The results showed that mice treated with sesamine obtained better results in tasks of avoidance and forced swimming with aging. Oxidative stress in the cerebral cortex and liver showed a reduction in mice treated with lignan. These results suggest that sesamine prevents brain dysfunction by antioxidative activity [
