<p>In another study by Liu et al., in which researchers evaluated the protective effect of madecassoside (52) on the cognitive process induced by LPS and neuroinflammation in rats, it was observed that the treatment with madecassoside (120 mg/kg, i.g.) for 14 days reduced LPS-induced neurotoxicity, decreasing cognitive deficiencies and suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1-beta (IL-1
 <italic>β</italic>), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), through the activation of nuclear factor 2 signaling related to erythroid nuclear factor 2 (Nrf2). In addition, the treatment improved heme oxygenase (HO
 <sup>−1</sup>) protein levels, through the positive regulation of Nrf2 in LPS-stimulated neurotoxicity. Collectively, these results suggest that madecassoside is effective in preventing neurodegenerative diseases by improving memory functions due to its anti-inflammatory activities and activation of Keap1-Nrf2/HO
 <sup>−1</sup> signaling [
