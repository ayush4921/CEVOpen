<p>Additional studies with madecassoside (52) extracted from 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> (CA) were also carried out evolving the evaluation of its potential to inhibit the enzyme Serina Racemase (SR), an enzyme responsible for converting L-serine into D-serine, an amino acid coagonist at glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, whose hyperexcitation is involved in several neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS. The authors observed that the activity of the SR enzyme was significantly inhibited in the presence of CA extract. The CA extract at a concentration of 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL inhibited 85% and 99% of SR activity (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001), respectively. The enzyme inhibition assay indicates that madecassoside is an inhibitor of human SR. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for madecassoside is 26 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, which is the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> among SR inhibitors reported up to date, giving this compound anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antiapoptotic, and antioxidative activity in animal models of ALS [
