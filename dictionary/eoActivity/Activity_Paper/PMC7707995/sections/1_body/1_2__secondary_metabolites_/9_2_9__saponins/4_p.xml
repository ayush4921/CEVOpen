<p>According to a study by Sasmita et al., madecassoside (52) is introduced as a potent antineuroinflammatory agent, which is able to influence genetic and protein components that are implicated in neuroinflammation and to reduce the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 56.84% in BV2 microglia cell line, in comparison to the group stimulated only with LPS. The results of the present study suggest that madecassoside successfully and significantly regulated the gene and protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), signal transducer and transcription activator 1 (STAT1), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B), which are all proneuroinflammatory components. In addition, madecassoside significantly increased the gene expression of the anti-inflammatory component heme oxygenase 1 (HO
 <sup>−1</sup>) by 175.22% compared to the LPS group, suggesting that this compound is an important ally in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases [
