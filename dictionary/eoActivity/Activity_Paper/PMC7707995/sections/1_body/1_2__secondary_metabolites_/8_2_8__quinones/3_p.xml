<p>Vegás-Hernández and collaborators evaluated the antioxidant effects of rapanone (51) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), a natural benzoquinone isolated from the 
 <italic>Myrsine</italic> plant, against the chelation, iron removal activity, and protective potential against damage induced by 
 <italic>tert</italic>-butyl hydroperoxide in mitochondria. The results showed the formation of complexes with irons II and III, oxidation of iron II, and peroxide radicals, inhibiting Fenton-Haber-Weiss reactions, effectively demonstrating the protective effect against oxidative stress at concentrations of 50 and 300 
 <italic>μ</italic>M. The results demonstrate the protective potential of rapanone against mitochondrial lipid peroxidation with IC
