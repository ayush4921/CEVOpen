<p>One of these reports, presented by Lu et al., demonstrated the antioxidant effects of ethanolic extracts from the roots of the 
 <italic>Rheum officinale baill</italic> plant of the 
 <italic>Polygonaceae</italic> family, popularly known as rhubarb. Phytochemical analysis of the extracts demonstrated the presence of anthraquinones (emodine 49) and dianthraquinones (aloe-emodine 50) (

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (at concentrations 2 and 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL the results were inferior). The study showed a protective role for rhubarb extract against cell oxidation, which may bring significant results in further studies in the treatment of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases [
