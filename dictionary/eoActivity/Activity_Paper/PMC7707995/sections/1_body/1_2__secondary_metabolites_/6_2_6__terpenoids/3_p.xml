<p>Lee et al. investigated the neuroprotective effects of a sesquiterpenoid, ECN (7

 <italic>α</italic>-(2-methylbutyryloxy)-3,14-dehydro-Z-notonipetranone) 42) (

 <italic>Tussilago farfara</italic> sprout, from the 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family, mediated by Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2) against oxidative stress in the PC12 cell line, as well as the potential of ECN to activate Nrf2 inducing OH
 <sup>−1</sup>, also observing the protective effects of ECN (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) in an experimental model of animals with neurodegeneration. The results demonstrated a protective effect against H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) with 91.8 ± 6.6% and 87.9 ± 1.7% inhibition in the concentration of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>M of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>M of 6-OHDA, respectively. The ECN also showed good results in the positive regulation of ARE-luciferase activity (cell line designed to monitor the induction of antioxidant response elements), as well as in the induction of Nrf2 and OH
 <sup>−1</sup> mRNA expression. The results also suggested an interaction between ECN and Keap1 modifying the cysteine thiols of Nrf2, causing a positive regulation of OH
 <sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, the administration of ECN improved dopaminergic and motor neuronal damage [
