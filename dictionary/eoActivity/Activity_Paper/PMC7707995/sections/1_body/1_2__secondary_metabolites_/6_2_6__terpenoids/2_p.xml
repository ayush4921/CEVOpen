 <italic>In silico</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluations of phytochemicals present in the root extract of the 
 <italic>Asparagus adscendens</italic> (AAE) plant of the 
 <italic>Liliaceaee</italic> family were carried out by Pahwa and Goel, aiming to evaluate the nootropic, antiamnesic, and antioxidative activities. Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) and Pharmaexpert were used for 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies of antiamnesic activity were assessed by scopolamine induction. Finally, nootropic activity was assessed by evaluating the effect of the extract of AAE against antioxidant enzymes on the cortex and hippocampus of mice and acetylcholinesterase. The extracts showed, in addition to other secondary metabolites, the presence of terpenoids. The results 
 <italic>in silico</italic> pointed to a significant decrease in memory loss that was proven by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Besides, the AAE extract considerably reduced the levels of oxidative stress in the cortex and hippocampus of mice [
