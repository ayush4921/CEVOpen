<p>Glucosinolates are abundant compounds in the 
 <italic>Moringa</italic> species, mainly in the 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, having been reported to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, and antidiabetic activities. The most abundant glucosinolate present in the species is 4-O-(
 <italic>α</italic>-
 <italic>L</italic>-ramnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl glucosinolate, also known as glucomoringin (GMG) (63). Glucosinolates and related hydrolytic products, isothiocyanates (ITCs) (64), have attracted researchers due to their neuroprotective effect [
