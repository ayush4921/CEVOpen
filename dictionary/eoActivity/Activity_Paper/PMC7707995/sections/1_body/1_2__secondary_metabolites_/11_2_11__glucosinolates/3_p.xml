<p>In this sense, Jaafaru and collaborators [

 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) before the development of the oxidative stress condition decreased the expression of cyt-c (cytochrome C), p53 (also called TP53 gene and tumor protein p53 gene), Apaf-1 (apoptosis-activating factor 1), Bax (BCL-2-associated protein X), CASP3, CASP8, and CASP9 (proteins involved in the caspase pathway) with simultaneous positive regulation of the Bcl-2 gene (B cell lymphoma protein 2) in the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. In view of these results, the authors suggest that pretreatment with GMG-ITC can relieve the condition of oxidative stress in neuronal cells, reducing the level of ROS production and protecting cells against apoptosis through possible neurodegenerative pathways of disease [
