<p>The oxidative stress is highly correlated with the development and progression of the neurodegeneration in ALS. Changes in the homeostatic balance of ROS production are particularly associated with mutant forms of the antioxidant enzyme SOD1 (encodes for copper/zinc ion-binding superoxide dismutase), which is reported to be the most common causative factor for ALS. Over 150 different mutations have been described in different parts of the enzyme, which include G93A (glycine 93 changed to alanine), H46R (histidine at codon 46 changed to arginine), and A4V (alanine at codon 4 changed to valine). This particular enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of superoxide (O2
 <sup>−</sup>) into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Its mutation provokes a structural instability that promotes enzyme misfolding, and consequent formation of cytotoxic protein aggregates alone or with other proteins. Consequently, there is a loss of enzyme activity and an increase in the production of ROS that results in deterioration in the regulation of vital cell processes and mitochondrial dysfunction [
