<p>Focusing on the influence of ROS for the onset and progression of the disease, the interest in natural compounds with antioxidant potential has become increasing. According to epidemiological studies focused on neurodegenerative diseases, it was observed that there is a significant difference in the incidence of such diseases among ethnic groups with different eating habits, recording that the diet rich in antioxidants is related to a decrease in the incidence rate. Thus, different types of compounds with antioxidant properties can be highlighted, such as the following: polyphenols, which provide protection against ROS and modulate metabolic cascades [

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Hence, this review is aimed at presenting and summarizing the main articles published within the last years, which represent the therapeutic potential of antioxidant compounds of natural origin for the treatment of ALS. In this sense, the keywords “antioxidant activity,” “amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,” “natural products,” and “secondary metabolites,” among others, were included in the search into the databases “ScienceDirect,” “Pubmed,” “Periódicos Capes,” “Clinical Trials,” “Web of Science,” and “Google Acadêmico,” during the period of March 14 to April 10 2020.
