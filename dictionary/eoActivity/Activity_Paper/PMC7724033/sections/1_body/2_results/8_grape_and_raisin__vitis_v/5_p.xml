<p>The cardioprotective effect of the extract was also demonstrated in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity, evident from the modulation of electrocardiogram (ECG) and an improvement of endogenous antioxidants activity (

Another specific cardioprotective mechanism that has been reported for grape proanthocyanidins is the modification of protein kinase RNA−like ER kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor−2 (eIF2α). In endoplasmic reticulum oxidative stress conditions, overactivation of PERK/eIF2α stimulates C/EBP−homologous protein (CHOP) and subsequently, apoptosis. Grape seed extract could reverse the I/R-induced upregulation of these pathways and prevent the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes (
