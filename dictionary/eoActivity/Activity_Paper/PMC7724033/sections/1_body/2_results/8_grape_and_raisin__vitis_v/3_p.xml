<p>In lead and arsenic-induced lung inflammation, the extract reduced pulmonary levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, oxidative damage, and pro-apoptotic markers (

In carrageenan-induced acute lung inflammation, a single oral dose of grape seed extract could significantly balance the level of several pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, it modulated tumor necrosis factor receptor, a co-activator of effector T lymphocytes, upregulated during lung inflammation (

In pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin, the extract prevented leukocytes infiltration and markers of fibrosis including matrix metalloproteinase and collagen deposition and increased the anti-fibrotic marker E-cadherin. The potency of the higher extract dose, 100 mg/kg, was equal to 0.5 mg/kg of dexamethasone in most parameters (
