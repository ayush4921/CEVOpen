<p>1ʹ-Acetoxychavicol acetate has been proved to have a protective effect on the lungs, as well. In an ovalbumin-induced mouse model of asthma, the compound reduced the infiltration of eosinophils into the BALF. The secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by both types 1 and 2 T cells was also significantly decreased and the effect of the higher dose (50 mg/kg) was equal to 1 mg/kg of dexamethasone (
