<p>Saffron aqueous extract exhibited cardioprotective effects on an animal model of ISO-induced cardiac damage 
 <italic>via</italic> reduction of CK-MB and LDH leakage from myocardial cells and improvement of endogenous antioxidants in cardiac tissue (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Sachdeva et al., 2012</xref>). A similar result was obtained with safranal from a significantly lower effective dose in comparison to the aqueous extract, suggesting these effects are partially due to this saffron component (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">Mehdizadeh et al., 2013</xref>). In DOX plus I/R-induced cardiotoxicity, saffron could restore the level of contractile proteins including α-actinine, myosin light chain, and troponine C. It could prevent mitochondrial dysfunction and recover the phosphorylation level of the AKT/P70S6K and ERK1/2 cardioprotective pathways (

 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">Razmaraii et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, crocin was effective in the reduction of LPS-induced cardiotoxicity 
 <italic>via</italic> a decrease in the protein level and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. COX-2 enzyme and its product, PGE2, which are increased in LPS-induced damages were returned to the normal level by crocin administration (
