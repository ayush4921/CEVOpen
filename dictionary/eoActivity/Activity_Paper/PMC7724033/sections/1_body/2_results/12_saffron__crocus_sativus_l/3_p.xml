<p>Safranal has demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects on OVA-induced airway inflammation 
 <italic>via</italic> modulation of type 1 and 2 helper T lymphocytes balance, evident from the reduced serum IL-4 and elevated IFNγ (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> in T lymphocytes (

 <italic>via</italic> the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of fibrosis, improvement of endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, and the induction of the Nrf2 cytoprotective pathway. Likewise, the compound was an inhibitor of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, a receptor participating in leukocytes infiltration, neutrophils activation, TNF-α-dependent inflammation, and TGF-β-dependent fibrosis. The antifibrotic effect of crocin at 20 mg/kg was higher than 0.2 mg/kg of halofuginone (

Additionally, crocin has been shown to relieve the effects of LPS-induced acute lung injury by suppressing NF-κB and MAPK pro-inflammatory cascades. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), heparanse, and two glycocalyx shedding enzymes overactivated in inflammatory lung diseases were also decreased by crocin (

In a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with mild to moderate asthma, a saffron powder supplement was administered for two months. Spirometry parameters, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, and forced expiratory flow 25-75% were significantly improved in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, serum levels of CRP and the anti-HSP70 antibody were significantly decreased. A direct correlation between the severity of asthma symptoms and anti-HSP70 antibody was observed and thus, its reduction is an indicator of decreased pulmonary inflammation (
