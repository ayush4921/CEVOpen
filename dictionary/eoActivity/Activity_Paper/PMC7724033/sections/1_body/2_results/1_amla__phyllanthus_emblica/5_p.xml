<p>The cardioprotective effect of amla fruit has been demonstrated in several studies (

Emblicanin-A and B, two small-sized hydrolysable gallotanins, have exhibited a protective effect in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R)-induced cardiac damage in rats. Emblicanins could represent cardioprotective properties mostly through the induction of endogenous enzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms and the prevention of lipid peroxidation. The effect of 50 mg/kg of this compound was equal to 200 mg/kg of vitamin E (standard antioxidant); whereas 100 mg/kg of emblicanins showed a higher potency compared with vitamin E (

In terms of the cardioprotective effects of amla extract, another target, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (PI3K/GSK3β) pathway, was identified in the I/R model. The phosphorylation of Akt and subsequently GSK3β leads to the release of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and β-catenin nuclear translocation which further activates anti-apoptotic signaling pathways like B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and endothelial Nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), finally resulting in cardioprotection (
