<p>Licorice has been traditionally used for cough in the form of a medicinal candy or lozenge. In a clinical study, patients who underwent thoracic surgery and post-operative double-lumen endotracheal intubation gargled a liquid licorice preparation as a prophylaxis for post-extubation coughing. The incidence of cough and sore throat was significantly lower with licorice compared with placebo (simple sugar syrup) (

In ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation, glycyrrhizic acid caused a dose-dependent regulation of cytokine production by types 1 and 2 of helper T lymphocytes, and the effect of the highest dose (40 mg/kg) was equal to 2 mg/kg of dexamethasone in several parameters (

 <italic>via</italic> PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Likewise, the compound demonstrated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> protective effects on LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation through the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It also decreased the high mobility group box (HMGB)-1, a product of damaged cells further activating pro-inflammatory pathways (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, glycyrrhizin represented a stimulatory effect on the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in macrophages 
 <italic>via</italic> the p38 MAPK pathway, an important intracellular signaling modulating apoptosis and autophagy in response to pathologic conditions (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Glycyrrhizin could reduce abnormally-increased mucus production both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo via</italic> suppression of MUC5AC mRNA expression, confirming the mucolytic properties of licorice mentioned in TPM. The effect of 45 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin on goblet cell hyperplasia was nearly equal to 1 mg/kg of dexamethasone, while 135 mg/kg of this compound was higher than dexamethasone (
