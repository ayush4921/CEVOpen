<p>The most important effects of the medicinal plants and their isolated phytochemicals include anti-inflammatory activity and antioxidant properties (

 </xref>). These two mechanisms comprise several cellular and subcellular pathways such as NF-κB, Nrf2, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines balance, and endogenous enzymatic/non-enzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms. It should be considered that such mechanisms are general cytoprotective cascades observed in nearly all body organs and that the beneficial effects of phytochemicals in one tissue can be extrapolated to other tissues. For instance, if a compound has shown a stimulatory effect on Nrf2 signaling in myocardial cells, the same activity could be expected in lung tissue or kidney tubules. This is in line with the holistic view of TPM, which encompasses the idea that treatments should improve the overall health of the human body as a whole, instead of focusing on the damaged organ. It is believed in TPM that reinforcement of the body’s inner power is one of the best ways to combat a disease. Most of the discussed medicinal plants stimulate cytoprotective mechanisms to face pathogenic factors, which can be considered as equivalent to these ideas of improving the body’s inner power.
