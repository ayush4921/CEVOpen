<p>One of the key pro-inflammatory cytokines affecting clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is IL-6. In patients with COVID-19, organ failures have been observed and the subsequent deaths of many patients are often due to cytokine storm, an exaggerated inflammatory response (

 <sup>®</sup>) has been evaluated in several clinical studies in patients. Another systematic review has also discussed the value of this agent in treating COVID-19, highlighting that current evidence suggests that the drug could be beneficial in this infection (
