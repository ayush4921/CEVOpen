<p>Edible plants, particularly grape, jujube fruit, amla, and damask rose, are well-known and used medicinally every day by people all over the world, which indicates that they are safe. Such plants can be prepared as a juice or in a standardized liquid dosage form for COVID-19 patients. Where the guidelines on effective drugs for treating this infection vary day-by-day, increasing amounts of new data are being released from ongoing clinical trials regarding the pros and cons of the medicines recommended. In such a situation, physicians may be willing to stay on the safe side and avoid using multi-ingredient complementary medicinal preparations with several possible side effects/drug interactions. As a more acceptable and safer approach, natural tonics that are based on these popular food plants could be recommended as part of the healthy daily diet for people prone to or who are vulnerable to the disease. This includes healthcare providers caring for COVID-19 patients in hospitals, the family members of the patients in home-quarantine, and people with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular problems or diabetes who are more vulnerable to this infection. Studies on healthy populations are encouraged due to the lower risk of adverse effects and the fact that they would indicate the safety and efficacy of natural products, with use in patients as the second step in developing these adjunct therapies.</p>
