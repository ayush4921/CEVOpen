<p>The HPLC method was used to verify the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-qNMR. The above extract was accurately weighed to 10.00 mg and completely dissolved in 10 mL of 70% absolute ethanol by ultrasonic treatment which was transferred to a sample vial for HPLC determination. Each batch of plant material was performed in triplicate. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-qNMR method was also used to determine the composition of three batches of plant materials, each batch of samples was repeated 3 times, and the results were compared with HPLC. The details of the HPLC are shown 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">in Supplementary Materials</xref>. The results are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. There was no significant difference between the two measurement methods.
