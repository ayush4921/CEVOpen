<p>The same reference standard was measured six times to get precision results; six sample solutions were used to get repeatability results, and the same sample was measured within 12â€‰h to get the stability results. The standard deviations of precision for liquiritin, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin were 1.18%, 1.13%, and 1.24%, respectively. The standard deviations of repeatability for liquiritin, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin were 1.68%, 2.29%, and 4.43%, respectively. The standard deviations of stability for liquiritin, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin were 1.08%, 2.25%, and 1.24%, respectively.</p>
