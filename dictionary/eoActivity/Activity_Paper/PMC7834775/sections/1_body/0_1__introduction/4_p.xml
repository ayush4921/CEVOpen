<p>In previous studies, Farag et al. reported the metabolite profiling and fingerprinting of medicinal licorice roots [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR method was used to qualitatively identify the unknown components of the established fingerprints. 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch was investigated though centrifugal partition chromatography by Simmler et al. [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and qNMR was used to determine the purity and residual complexity of the isolated compounds through orthogonal analysis. As known to us, there have been no reports about the simultaneous determination of liquiritin, liquiritigenin, and isoliquiritin by qNMR method, which are the active constituents of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. Therefore, the purpose of this study was firstly to simultaneously quantify the three main components liquiritin, liquiritigenin, and isoliquiritin. in 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. by 
 <sup>1</sup>H-qNMR. The structural formula of the three components is shown in
