<p>Therefore, the content of liquiritin, liquiritigenin, and isoliquiritin in 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. was determined in this study. Analytical methods of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. flavonoids include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and gas chromatography (GC). Some people also used gravimetric methods to measure the content of

 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch. using these traditional methods requires two or more instruments. Considering the high requirement for efficacy and safety of 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic> Fisch., an easier and faster method is needed for routine quality control [
