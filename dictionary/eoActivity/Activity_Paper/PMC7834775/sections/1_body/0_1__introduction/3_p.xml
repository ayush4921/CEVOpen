<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is commonly used for structure elucidation, but the potential for its quantitative ability is increasing nowadays. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H-qNMR method could simultaneously detect multiple components in very short time (1–5 mins) using a very cheap internal standard reference, which has found applications in quantitative analysis of natural products and other areas [

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In our previous study, we have developed a quantitative NMR (qNMR) method for

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Major peaks in 
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and MS spectra contributing to the discrimination among species were assigned as those of glycyrrhizin, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, and glycosidic conjugates of liquiritigenin/isoliquiritigenin.
