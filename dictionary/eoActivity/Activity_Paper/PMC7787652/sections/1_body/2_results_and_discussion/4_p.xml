<p id="Par14">Throughout human history, thousands of biologically active plants have been discovered, identified and used in medicine. Most cultures around the world rely on medicinal plants for disease treatment (Halberstein 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>). Plants possess the ability to produce a wide range of compounds including flavonoids, alkalis, lignans and tannins, and are responsible for the primary functions of plant growth and development (Saxena et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). Molecular docking studies and explores the interaction mechanism between ligands and receptors. Interactions between the compound and the receptor play a crucial role in the discovery of drugs. All these 21 molecules were docked against the target enzyme SARS-COV2 M

Naringin and its aglycone naringenin belong to this series of flavonoids and were found to display strong anti-in flammatory and antioxidant activities (Alam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>). Naringenin (flavanones), quercetin (flavonols) and Catechins (flavans) which are found in

Various flavonoids have been investigated for their potential antiviral activities and many have shown important antiviral properties in the laboratory and even in live studies (Zakaryan et al.
