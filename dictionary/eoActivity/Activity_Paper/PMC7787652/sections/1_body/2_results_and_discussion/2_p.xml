<p id="Par12">The results showed that the compounds have a rank scores ranged from − 17.45 to − 8.20 kcal/mol. The docking simulations resulted in five compounds that were assigned as the most potential candidate among the docked ones; the compounds’ poses were ranked with respect to their binding energy values. We noted that the inhibition potentials of the Gallic acid (1) are very encouraging. The compounds including Quercetin (2), Naringin (3), Capsaicin (4), and Psychotrine (5) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), have larger inhibition potentials than that of chloroquine as a reference too. The standard was docked to protomer A of the dimeric COVID-19 Mpro (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The co-crystallized ligand (RZG; methyl 4-sulfamoylbenzoate) is interacting with the enzyme residues in the substrate-binding site located in a cleft between domain I and II (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c shows the interaction of RZG. The other compounds also possess certain inhibition properties against SARS-COV2 M
