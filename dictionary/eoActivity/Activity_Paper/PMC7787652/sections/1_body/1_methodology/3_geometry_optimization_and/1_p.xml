<p id="Par9">Hydrogens and Gasteiger charges were added and all the hetero-atoms and water molecules were removed from protein structure. The protonated protein initially optimized in order to remove all the bad steric clashes using AMBER99 force field (Cornell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1996</xref>), while MMFF94s force field parameters (Halgren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1996</xref>) and (Halgren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1999</xref>) were performed for small molecules. The protonated and optimized structures were saved for further preparation and analysis. All the minimizations were performed with MOE (grade &lt; 0.001).
