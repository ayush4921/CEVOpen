<p>The antioxidant capacity of extracts from the 
 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> (L.) varieties was assessed using three different methods: the scavenging activity of DPPH radical as reported by Hamada et al. [
 <xref rid="B65-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], the scavenging activity ABTS radical (2,2-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid) [
 <xref rid="B63-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and the reducing power [
 <xref rid="B66-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), Trolox, and ascorbic acid were used as standards. The results of each test were given in IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (the sample concentration required to scavenge 50% of free radicals).
