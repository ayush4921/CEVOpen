<p>The well plate-based method was used to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A serial dilution of the extracts was performed in a well plate; each well was inoculated with 20 μL of bacterial suspension and 20 μL of extract. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. To the suspension, 1 mg/mL of 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was added into each well to indicate bacterial growth. Afterward, 1 mL of the incubated solution with a defined MIC was cultured and conserved at 37 °C for 24 h. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of the extract that inhibited bacterial growth, while the concentration which exhibited no bacterial growth was considered the MBC value.
