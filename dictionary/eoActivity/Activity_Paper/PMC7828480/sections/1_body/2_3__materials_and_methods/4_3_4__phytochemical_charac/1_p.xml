<p>The silylation of different samples was performed according to the protocol reported by Kabran and al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Briefly, a total of 10 g of each sample was treated with 50 mL of 2 N HCl and petroleum ether before heating for two hours. After cooling, the residues were treated again with 3 × 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The fractions obtained were dried on anhydrous MgSO4 before being concentrated under a vacuum. Next, 200 μL of the 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-
 <italic>N</italic>-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) agent was added to the fraction obtained and was then heated at 37 °C for a further 30 min; 0.1 μL of the sample was injected into the GC-MS apparatus for analysis using Brand Agilent Technologies Model 5973. Helium was used as a carrier to perform analysis with a pressure range (psi) of 0.9 mL/s. The injector and detector temperatures were set to 250 °C and 260 °C, respectively. The oven temperature was set to 60–300 °C for 10 °C/min and then maintained at 300 °C for 20 min.
