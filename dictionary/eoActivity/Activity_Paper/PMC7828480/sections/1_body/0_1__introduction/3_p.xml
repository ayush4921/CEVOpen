<p>To the best of our knowledge, no previous literature has investigated the pharmacological activities of the two varieties 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus (Ball) Maire and A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum.</italic> (L.). It is thus fitting that we study for the first time the mineral and the chemical compositions and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of different parts from the two varieties. The antimicrobial activity was studied using the agar diffusion, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) methods. The antioxidant activity was studied using three in vitro assays: inhibition of the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and ABTS+ (2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) free radical scavenging activity. The phytochemical, mineral, total phenolic, and flavonoid contents of hydroalcoholic extracts were determined as described within this study. Data in its entirety were used to study the correlations between the evaluated parameters and to run the principal component analysis (PCA) for discrimination of the samples.
