<p>The present study revealed that different parts of 
 <italic>Anacyclus pyrethrum</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> (L.) and 
 <italic>Anacyclus pyrethrum</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) Maire are rich in phytochemicals that may be involved in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties investigated in this work. In brief, the information presented here could serve as a valuable database for further research to exploit new natural substances present in different parts of the two varieties to fight free radical damage, and fungal and bacterial infections.
