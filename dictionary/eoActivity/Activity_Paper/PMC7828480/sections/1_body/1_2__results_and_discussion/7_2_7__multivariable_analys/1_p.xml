<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a good tool for data extraction from multivariate matrices and represents the data as a set of a few orthogonal variables [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The samples are plotted in red, and the parameters are plotted in blue. In the present work, the first two principal components accounted for 35.90% and 27.93% of the data of the original matrix successively (

Therefore, a negative correlation can be observed between the same PC and antioxidant activities as well as the rest of the antibacterial activities (MIC and MBC) except ABTS.
