<p>Considering the similarities of the samples, PCA allowed the distinction of three groups: A, B, and C, each of which had similar characteristics in terms of antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The first group (A), composed of Ff and Fm samples, had high total phenolic and flavonoids and, thus, high antioxidant and antibacterial activities in comparison to the other samples. There was a large difference between the Rm and Rf samples; Rm was characterized by a high content in polyphenol and flavonoids and better antibacterial activities compared to the Rf sample, which was characterized by better antioxidant activities.</p>
