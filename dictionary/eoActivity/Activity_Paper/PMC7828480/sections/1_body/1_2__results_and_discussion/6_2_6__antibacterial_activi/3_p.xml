<p>Besides, analysis of the antibacterial power also revealed a variation not only according to the nature of the extract used but also from one strain to another. The Cm sample had interesting antimicrobial activities against all strains studied. The inhibition zone diameter recorded for this sample ranged from 7.5 to 15.65 mm. Likewise, the Cf sample inhibited growth of all strains except 
 <italic>E. coli57</italic> that showed resistance to this extract. The Gm sample generated an inhibition zone diameter ranging from 5.65 to 10 mm on 
 <italic>E. coli97</italic> and a value ranging from 5.65 to 6.35 mm in diameter for 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. The Gf sample had an inhibition zone of 8.5 mm against 
 <italic>E. coli97</italic>, and inhibition zones of 7, 7.5, 7.5, and 7.8 mm were observed for 
 <italic>staphylococus, Klebsiella</italic>, and 
 <italic>pseudomonas</italic>, respectively. Meanwhile, 
 <italic>E. coli57</italic> resisted this extract. The Ff sample was active on 
 <italic>E. coli97, pseudomona,</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> with inhibition zones ranging from 5.5 to 11 mm; Fm was more active on 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>, with an inhibition diameter of 15.3 mm than other strains. The Rm was active on 
 <italic>E. coli97</italic>, 
 <italic>pseudomonas,</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> with inhibition zone diameters of 6.6, 5.5, and 6.1 mm, respectively. Rf had a bacterial growth inhibitory effect on 
 <italic>staphylococcus, pseudomonas,</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> with values ranging from 5.75 to 11 mm. Meanwhile, 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) Maire extracts (Cf, Gf, Ff, and Rf) were inactive against 
 <italic>E. coli57.</italic>
