<p>The best activity was obtained by the extracts Rf and Rm; these effects were observed on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with MIC values of 0.39 and 0.78, respectively. These results were in accordance with those reported in earlier works on the antimicrobial potency of plant extracts studied [

 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> (L.) against various infections. The antimicrobial power of essential oils from the roots of 
 <italic>A. pyrethrum</italic> (L.) against 
 <italic>E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> was confirmed elsewhere [
