<p>In the present work, twenty-two compounds were detected by GC-MS after silylation, and among them, propanedioic acid; levulinic acid; sarcosine, 
 <italic>N</italic>-(trifluoroacetyl)-butyl ester; morphinan-6-one; 4,5α-epoxy-3-hydroxy-17-methyl; palmitic acid; isovaleric acid; and 2,4-undecadiene-8,10-diyne-
 <italic>N</italic>-tyramide compounds were newly detected, to the best of our knowledge. Some of the compounds identified in the studied extracts of 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> (L.) and 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball), such as pellitorine, are antibacterial, insecticidal, anticoagulant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory agents [

 <xref rid="B27-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Alkylamides (
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-2,4-octadiene-6-monoynamide; (2,4)-

 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-dodeca-2,4,8,10-tetraenamide; and 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl-2,6,8-datrienamide) were previously confirmed to have activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, antithrombotic, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, analgesic, antiprotozoal, and antidiabetic activities [

 <xref rid="B30-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, propanedioic acid was found to be a monoamine oxidase inhibitor agent with antimycobacterial, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-HIV, anticancer, antiparasitic, anticonvulsant, antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and anti-hyperlipidemic activities [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Cinnamic acid is well-known for its antioxidant, antimicrobial, antitumor, and antimycobacterial properties [

 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, cinnamic acid possesses many biological activities, as reported by Hafizur et al. (2015), stating that this compound exhibited antidiabetic activity by decreasing blood glucose levels and by improving glucose tolerance in diabetic rats in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The cinnamic acid enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated islets [

 <italic>A. sobria, A. salmonicida, L. anguillarum, V. crassostreae,</italic> and 
 <italic>Y. ruckeri</italic> bacteria [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Levulinic acid was found to have antioxidant, anticonvulsant, and anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,

 <xref rid="B40-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The mechanism of action of levulinic acid in bacteria inhibition was also investigated in previous literature [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], which showed that levulinic acid reacts in synergy with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to reduce the cytoplasmic pH of microbes by ionization of undissociated acid molecules, affects the electrostatic charge of SDS molecules and cell surfaces, disrupts substrate transport, reduces proton motive force, chelates metal ions, and thereby induces the release of lipopolysaccharides from the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Isovaleric acid has a therapeutic effect as an anti-dyslipidemic anticonvulsant [

 <xref rid="B44-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Morphinan-6-one and 4,5α-epoxy-3-hydroxy-17-methyl have analgesic activities [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Each component may represent different mechanisms of action, whether it reacts individually or synergizes with another, ultimately resulting in many effective therapeutic properties of extracts [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-10-00149" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The richness of the studied extract in different chemical compounds with numerous activities as reported in the earlier literature could justify the results obtained in terms of antioxidant and antibacterial activities as described in the present work.
