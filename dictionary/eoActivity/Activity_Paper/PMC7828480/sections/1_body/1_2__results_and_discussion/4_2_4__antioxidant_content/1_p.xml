<p>Polyphenols have a very important role in determining the biological activities of natural products. Their contents are largely impacted by environmental conditions like harvest period, extraction solvent, and storage conditions [

 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) Maire leaves were 51.78 ± 0.49 and 38.75 ± 2.91 mg GAE/g, respectively. The total flavonoid contents in leaves were 13.53 ± 0.05 and 9.57 ± 0.02 mg QE/g, respectively. On the other hand, the hydro-alcoholic root extract had the lowest amount of total phenolic (25.96 ± 1.9 and 5.44 ± 0.21mg GAE/g, respectively) and flavonoid contents (0.88 ± 0.02 and 2.40 ± 0.02 mg, QE/g respectively). The hydro-alcoholic extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>pyrethrum</italic> were richer in total phenolic and flavonoid than those of 
 <italic>A. P</italic> var. 
 <italic>depressus</italic> (Ball) Maire. These findings were consistent with the results reported by Cherrat et al. [
