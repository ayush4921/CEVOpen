<p id="Par12">Enclosure has emerged as a successful ecological rehabilitation tool for degraded rangelands in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa (Nyberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>; Verdoodt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>; Wairore et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2015</xref>). Although, Nyberg et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019</xref>) uphold that enclosures are not only panacea for dry land development, establishment of enclosures has become an important measure to combat land degradation in semi-arid rangelands (Verdoodt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>). Tradition reserved land (enclosure) has been used as indigenous practices for many years among pastoral and agro-pastoral communities in Tanzania to provide dry season feeds for livestock and promote environmental conservation (Mwilawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>). These enclosures influence restoration of depleted rangelands by allowing quick vegetation recovery. Angassa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>) reported significant higher herbaceous biomass yield, grass basal cover, species richness and diversity in enclosed land than grazed land in Southern Ethiopia. Similarly, Selemani et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>) established significantly higher biomass yield and vegetation cover in the enclosures of North Western Tanzania compared to open land. Given the shrinkage of grazing land in Tanzania, many pastoral communities in the country are shifting from pastoral mobility strategy to enclosure practices. These enclosures are well managed by respective ethnic groups or tribes using devised local rules and regulations (TableÂ
