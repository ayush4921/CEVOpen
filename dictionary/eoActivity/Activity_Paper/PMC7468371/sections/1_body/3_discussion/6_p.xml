<p>In the present study, cyclophosphamide administration increased both serum creatinine and BUN levels compared to normal group animals. These results were consistent with previously reported studies.

 <xref rid="cit0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Increased levels of serum creatinine and BUN might be due to the cyclophosphamide-induced kidney damage, which resulted in the leakage of these cytosolic enzymes to the circulatory system. Acrolein decreases the activities of antioxidant enzymes by enhancing oxidative stress and results in an increase in lipid peroxidation and the formation of reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen, superoxide anion radicals, and hydroxyl radicals.
 <xref rid="cit0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> This is an indication of disturbances in the biosynthesis of these marker enzymes, with alteration in the membrane permeability as a result of kidney damage.
