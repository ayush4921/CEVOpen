 <xref rid="molecules-26-00487-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> represent the LC-MS/MS result. PCS analytes have very close retention times. However, accurate identification was made according to their typical fragments and through comparison with standards available in the developed database. The results indicated that PCS comprises nine molecules belonging to polyphenols (Vanillic acid: C8H8O4, chlorogenic acid: C16H18O9, catechin: C15H14O6, epicatechin: C15H14O6, oleuropein: C25H32O13, epicatechin gallate: C22H18O10, rutin: C27H30O16, gallocatechin: C15H14O7, epigallocatechin: C22H18O11); five of them belong to the flavonoid family, which make this extract a flavonoids-rich extract (
