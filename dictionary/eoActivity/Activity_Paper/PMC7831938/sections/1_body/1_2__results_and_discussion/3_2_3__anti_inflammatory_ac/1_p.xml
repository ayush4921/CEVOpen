<p>A progressive edema formation is due to the injection of carrageenan into the ratâ€™s hind paw, reaching its maximum within the first 60 min. The inhibition rate of the treatments is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00487-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Within the first hour, the inhibition rate reached 29% for the group of rats treated with PCS at 25 mg/kg b.w. and 48% for the group treated with the dose of 50 mg/kg b.w. against 34% marked for the groups treated with Diclofenac. The inhibition rate continues to rise to reach at the 3rd hour 39, 55, and 57% for groups treated with PCS at 25, 50 mg/kg b.w. and Diclofenac, respectively, those numbers set on a final inhibition rate of 87, 92, and 95% at the end of the test.
