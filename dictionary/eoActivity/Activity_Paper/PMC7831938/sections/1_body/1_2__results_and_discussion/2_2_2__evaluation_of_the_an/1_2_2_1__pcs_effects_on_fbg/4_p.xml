 <xref rid="molecules-26-00487-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> indicates the body weight changes of the various experimental groups. For four weeks, diabetic groups treated with PCS demonstrated a significant increase (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in bodyweight when comparing it to the diabetic control group, which exhibited a substantial decrease. A high blood glucose level is due to the lack of insulin. The kidneys work to get rid of the excess glucose and as a result weight loss occurs in this process (because of the dehydration and the calories loss) [
