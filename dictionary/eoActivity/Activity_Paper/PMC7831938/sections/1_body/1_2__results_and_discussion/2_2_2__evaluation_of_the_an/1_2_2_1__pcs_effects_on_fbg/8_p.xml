 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00487-f004">Figure 4</xref> summarizes the plasma lipid profile of the experimental groups (triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)). The levels of TC and TG were increased in the diabetic control group by +57% and +31%, respectively, in comparison to the normal control mice. This is in contrast to the other treatment, which showed a decrease compared to the diabetic control mice.
