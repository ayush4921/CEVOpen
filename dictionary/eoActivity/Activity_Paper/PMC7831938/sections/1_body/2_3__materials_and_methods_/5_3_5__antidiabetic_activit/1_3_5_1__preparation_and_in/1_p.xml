<p>The alloxan monohydrate solution needs to be freshly prepared just before the induction (in 0.9% cold saline without any contact of light). For the blood glucose level wanted to be induced in the animals the dose should be adjusted. in our study severe experimental diabetes was the objective, so the dose used of alloxan was 180 mg/kg given to the animals via an intraperitoneal injection after at least 12 h fast. In response to the alloxan rapid action (partial destruction of 
 <italic>β</italic> cells) and liberation on their insulin content, a severe hypoglycemia was expected, so as a preventive action, the animals were given an oral administration of 0.2 mL of a glucose solution at 5 g/L. After 96 h and the stabilization of the animal’s blood glucose levels, first measurements were taken to select those with a BGL over 450 mg/dL for the test.
