<p>Qualitative analysis of PCS was performed developing an in-house database comprising the secondary metabolites of polyphenols. In particular, mass fragments and mass spectra of phenolic compounds were obtained injecting the standards of each molecule in LC-MS/MS and identifying them according to their chromatographic separation on a Phenomenex Kinetex polar C18 column (3 × 100 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, 2.6 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, USA) with mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile:water + 0.01% formic acid (5:95, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>; isocratic). Such chromatographic separation was also confirmed by flow injection analysis mass identification based on the precursor ion’s detection and at least one characteristic fragment ion using a Shimadzu Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (Nexera XR LC 40, Shimadzu Italy, Milan, Italy), coupled to an MS/MS detector (LCMS 8060, Shimadzu Italy, Milan, Italy) and controlled by Lab Solution software (Multi LC version) (see 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00487">supplementary file</xref>). The MS/MS was operated in negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) setting the nebulizing gas flow at 3 L/min, heating gas flow 10 L/min, interface temperature 370 °C, DL temperature 250 °C, heat block temperature 450 °C, drying gas flow 10 L/min. Identification of PCS polyphenols, was performed suspending the coriander seeds fraction in 2 mL of water: acetonitrile 1:1. 20 μL of this solution was diluted in 980 μL of acetonitrile and injected for LC-MS/MS analysis.
