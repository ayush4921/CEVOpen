<p>The free radical scavenging capability of PCS was checked by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay, as demonstrated by Kedar and Singh [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-26-00487" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The decoloration of the DPPH methanol solution determines the capacity of the hydrogen donation. DPPH (purple color) fades to yellow when antioxidants are present in the solution. Methanol was used to prepare a solution of 0.004% of DPPH (750 μL) and a sample solution (100 μL). Both prepared solutions were mixed and incubated at laboratory temperature for 30 min. Optic density was measured spectrophotometrically afterward at 517 nm. BHT was used as a positive and pure methanol as a negative control. The following equation determined the Percentage of DPPH radical scavenging activity:
