<p>The target site specificities of newly prepared SF
 <sub>5</sub>-based meta-diamide insecticide 
 <bold>4d</bold> should differ in insect and mammalian GABA and glycine receptors. In this regard, the cell-based antagonist activities of the meta-diamide 
 <bold>4d</bold> against the human GABA
 <sub>A</sub>R and glycine receptor (GlyR) A1 were investigated. According to the results obtained from previous studies, the mammalian GABA
 <sub>A</sub>R α1β3γ2 and the human glycine receptor (GlyR) A1 were selected for this study [

 <sub>50</sub> values of SF
 <sub>5</sub>-containing meta-diamide 
 <bold>4d</bold> and broflanilide against GABA

 <bold>4d</bold> has much higher selectivity toward targeted insects.
