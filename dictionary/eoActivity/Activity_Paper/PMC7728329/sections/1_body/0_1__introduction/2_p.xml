<p>As a part of our ongoing efforts to discover new eco-friendly insecticides [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05536" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05536" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05536" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we are particularly interested in small molecules containing the fluorine atom. One of the outstanding representatives of this category is broflanilide, which is known as an efficient broad-spectrum meta-diamide insecticide containing a high number of fluorine atoms [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05536" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Taking into account the suggested potential bioisosteric relationship between the SF
 <sub>5</sub> and CF
 <sub>3</sub> substituents [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-05536" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05536" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], we proposed the novel design of the SF
 <sub>5</sub>-containing meta-diamide insecticide 
 <bold>4d</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05536-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In order to examine the influence of SF
 <sub>5</sub> moiety on the properties of the meta-diamide 
 <bold>4d</bold> (R
 <sup>1</sup> = H, R
 <sup>2</sup> and R
 <sup>3</sup> = CH
 <sub>3</sub>) and investigate the significance of the effect caused by the replacement of the CF(CF
 <sub>3</sub>)
 <sub>2</sub> group to SF
 <sub>5</sub> functionality, the known meta-diamide insecticide 
 <bold>BPB1</bold> (R
 <sup>1</sup> = H, R
 <sup>2</sup> and R
 <sup>3</sup> = CH
 <sub>3</sub>) was selected for this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05536-f002">Figure 2</xref>). According to the previous studies on the development of meta-diamide-based insecticides, it was discovered that the insecticide 
 <bold>BPB3</bold> (R
 <sup>1</sup> = CH
 <sub>3</sub>) can be metabolized to its active form, 
 <bold>BPB1</bold> (R
 <sup>1</sup> = H), which in its turn demonstrates insecticidal activity by acting on the target RDL GABARs gene subunit and inhibiting its expression [
