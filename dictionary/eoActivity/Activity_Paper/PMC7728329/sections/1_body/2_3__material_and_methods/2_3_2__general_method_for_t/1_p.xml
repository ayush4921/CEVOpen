<p>A mixture of 3-benzamido-2-fluorobenzoic acid 
 <bold>3</bold> (50 mg, 0.193 mmol) and SOCl
 <sub>2</sub> (3.0 eq., 0.579 mmol) was refluxed for 2 h. The solution of aniline (0.9 eq., 0.174 mmol) and NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> (2.7 eq., 0.52 mmol) in acetone/water (0.4 mL/0.04 mL) was added in the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 1 h, quenched with water, and extracted with EtOAc (10 mL). The organic layer was dried over NaSO
 <sub>4</sub>, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography on a silica gel (hexane:EtOAc = 10:1) to give the desired product.
