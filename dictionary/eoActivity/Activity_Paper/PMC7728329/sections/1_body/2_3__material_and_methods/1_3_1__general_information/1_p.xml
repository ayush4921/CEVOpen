<p>Melting points: Barnstead/Electrothermal 9300—measurements were performed in open glass capillaries. NMR spectra: Bruker AV 300 MHz (Bruker corporation, Billerica, MA, USA)(
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR: 300 MHz, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR: 75 MHz), AV 400 MHz (
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR: 400 MHz, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR: 100 MHz), AV 500 MHz (
 <sup>1</sup>H-NMR: 500 MHz, 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR: 125 MHz), and AV2 500 MHz (
 <sup>19</sup>F-NMR: 470 MHz); the spectra were recorded in CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> and DMSO-d
 <sub>6</sub> using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard and are reported in ppm. 1H-NMR data are reported as follows: (s—singlet; d—doublet; t—triplet; q—quartet; dd—doublet of doublet; m—multiplet; coupling constant(s) J are given in Hz; integration, proton assignment). High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS): JEOL JMS-700.
