 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-05536" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A mixture of 2-bromo-4-(pentafluorothio)aniline (500 mg, 3.223 mmol), methylboronic acid (2.0 eq., 6.446 mmol), Pd(dppf)Cl
 <sub>2</sub>.DCM (0.1 eq., 0.322 mmol), and Cs
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (3.0 eq., 9.669 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (8.6 mL) was stirred at 105 Â°C for 5 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed with aq. NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub>. The organic layer was dried over Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography on a silica gel (hexane:EtOAc = 15:1) to give the desired product 
 <bold>1b</bold> as a yellow solid (481 mg, 64%).
