<p>In summary, starting from the known meta-diamide 
 <bold>BPB1</bold> containing a heptafluoroisopropyl group and its isosteric replacement with pentafluorosulfanyl moiety (-SF
 <sub>5</sub>) led to the meta-diamide insecticide 
 <bold>4d</bold>, a compound with good potency, high selectivity toward insects, and a similar level of lipophilicity with broflanilide. For the preparation of SF
 <sub>5</sub>-containing meta-diamide insecticides 
 <bold>4aâ€“d</bold>, an efficient synthetic route was established. This study has demonstrated that the pentafluorosulfanyl group (-SF
 <sub>5</sub>) could be an appealing structural scaffold for the discovery of a new crop-protecting agent.
