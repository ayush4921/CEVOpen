<p id="Par43">AuNPs were synthesized by mixing a stock solution of tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate (0.5 mM) with BRP crude extract solution (200 μg/mL) or its fractions solution (hexane, acetate and dichloromethane), followed by NaOH addition until pH 7.0. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at optimized temperature. The gold nanoparticles formation was observed by color changed from pale yellow to dark red.</p>
