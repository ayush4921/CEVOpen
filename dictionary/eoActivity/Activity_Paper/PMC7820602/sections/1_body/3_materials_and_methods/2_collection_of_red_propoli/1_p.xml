<p id="Par41">Red propolis sample collected in Canavieiras, State of Bahia, Brazil, was supplied by the beekeepers cooperative COAPER (Bahia, Brazil) in April of 2018. For the extraction, the propolis samples were frozen and grinded. Two hundred grams of red propolis were submitted to maceration with 70% hydroalcoholic ethanol solution in the ratio of 1:10 (w/v); propolis maceration was performed at 30 °C and 120 rpm using a shaker incubator (INNOVA 4300). The extracts obtained were concentrated under vacuum using a rotary evaporator and then lyophilized to complete dryness.</p>
