<p id="Par45">Antibacterial and antifungal properties of biosynthesized nanoparticles were investigated using the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) methods. The microorganisms used in this study belong to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and are kept in the collection of the Applied Microbiology Research Laboratory (LaPeMA), University of Franca (UNIFRAN), under cryopreservation at  − 80 °C. Gold nanoparticles were tested against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 29213), 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> (ATCC 25175), and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 28366). MIC was determined by the broth microdilution method, in triplicate, at the exponential phase of bacterial growth using 96-wells microplates (CLSI 2007)

 </sup>. The AuNPs samples were diluted in Brain Infusion Broth (Difco) and different concentrations of the samples (7.3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> to 7.5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> AuNP/mL) were added to each well. Then, the microorganism (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL) was added to all wells. Tetracycline (0.0115 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> to 5.9 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was used as a positive control for bacteria and Amphotericin B (0.031 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> to 16 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was used as a positive control for yeast. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Afterward, a resazurin solution (0.02%) was added to determine the microorganism viability. Before Resazurin addition, an aliquot of the inoculum was removed from each well and seeded on BHI agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood for the MBC test. The plates were incubated as previously described. MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of the sample without microbial growth.
