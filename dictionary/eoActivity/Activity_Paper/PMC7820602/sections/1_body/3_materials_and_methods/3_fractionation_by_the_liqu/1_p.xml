<p id="Par42">The lyophilized red propolis crude extract (87 g) was subjected to a solid-phase extraction process. The extract was mixed with 200 g of microcrystalline cellulose, and the mixture was transferred to a 13 × 11 cm i.d glass column and submitted to successive extraction with organic solvents in increasing polarities: hexane (2 L), dichloromethane (2 L) and ethyl acetate (2 L). The fractions obtained were concentrated under vacuum and lyophilized to complete dryness.</p>
