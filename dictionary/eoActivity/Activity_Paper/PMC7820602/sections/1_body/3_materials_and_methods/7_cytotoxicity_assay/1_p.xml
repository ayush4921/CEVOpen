<p id="Par46">The cytotoxic activity of biosynthetic gold nanoparticles was evaluated in human urologic cancer cell lines. T24 bladder cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines were obtained from the Rio de Janeiro Cell Bank (BCRJ). T24 cell was cultured in RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and PC-3 cell was cultured in DMEM-Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), both containing 1% antibiotic (Penicillin–Streptomycin-Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (SBF-GIBCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). These cells were maintained in continuous culture under a humid atmosphere at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. T24 or PC-3 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and treated with different concentrations of biosynthesized AuNPs for 24 h. Afterward, the medium containing nanoparticles was removed and the cells were washed with PBS. Subsequently, a Resazurin solution (25 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was added to each well and incubated for an additional 4 h. Then, fluorescence was evaluated on a Microplate reader (Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader, Biotek) using 530 nm and 590 nm as the excitation and emission wavelengths respectively. The negative control received only medium and the positive control was treated with DMSO 1%. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined using the Graph Pad Prism version 8 software (GraphPad Software Inc. San Diego CA, USA).
