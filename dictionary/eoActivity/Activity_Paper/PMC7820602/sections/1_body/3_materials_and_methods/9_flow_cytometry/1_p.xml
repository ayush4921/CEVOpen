<p id="Par48">The percentage of apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using FITC Annexin V (emission) as the apoptosis marker and FVD eFluor 450 (emission) as the viability marker. PC-3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (6 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cell/well) and exposed to a concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values) of BRP crude extract and fractions and biosynthesized AuNPs. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated on ice with the FVD eFluor 450 for 30 min under dark condition. Then, cells were washed and marked with FITC Annexin V. After incubation with apoptosis marker, samples were acquired using a BD Accuri flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Gating of the viable cells and apoptotic cells was performed using the BD Accuri software.
