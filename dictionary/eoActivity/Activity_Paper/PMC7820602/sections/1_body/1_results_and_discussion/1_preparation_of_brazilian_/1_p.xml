 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These biomolecules were identified in the chromatographic profile of BRP extract (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The solid-phase extraction of the red propolis hydroalcoholic extract left 23.8 g of the hexane fraction (27.3% yield), 54.2 g of the dichloromethane fraction (62.3% yield), 4.3 g of the ethyl acetate fraction (5%), and 3.6 g of the ethanol fraction (4.1% yield). The phytocompounds identified by HPLC in each fraction are shown in Table
