 </sup>. This difference might be explained by the oxidation of some active compounds of plant extracts during the reaction with metals. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the reduction of metal ions using plant extracts. Several authors suggest that the phenolic compounds are the main reducing and capping agents involved in the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles
