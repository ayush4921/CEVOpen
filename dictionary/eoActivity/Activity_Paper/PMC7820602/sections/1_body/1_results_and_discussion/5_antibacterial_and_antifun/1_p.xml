 </sup>, plant materials with MIC up to 500 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> are considered strong inhibitors of bacterial activity. Moderate inhibition is given by plant extract with MIC values between 600 and 1500 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>; whereas MIC above 1600 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> is classified as weak inhibition. The BRP crude extract and the fractions hexane and dichloromethane showed a pronounced antimicrobial effect. No significant antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate fraction and AuNP
 <sub>ethyl acetate</sub> was observed at the concentrations assessed. The AuNP
 <sub>extract</sub> showed only fungicidal activity (MIC = 12.4 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of extract, equivalent to 0.2 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> nanoparticles mL
 <sup>−1</sup>), whereas the AuNP
 <sub>dichloromethane</sub> and AuNP
 <sub>hexane</sub> demonstrated antibacterial and antifungal activity against all tested strains. AuNP
 <sub>hexane</sub> exhibited the highest activity among the nanoparticles, showing MIC and MBC values similar to the values presented by the BRP crude extract (MIC = 50.8 and 101.7 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of extract equivalent to 0.5 and 1.9 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> particles mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). Among the strains, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> yeast showed the highest susceptibility, while 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> demonstrated the highest resistance to the AuNPs treatment.
