<p id="Par32">The difference in the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values between PC-3 and T24 cells can be related to the malignant degree of the cells. T24 cell is derived from transitional cell carcinoma grade II, whereas the PC-3 cell line is derived from bone metastasis from grade IV adenocarcinoma. Thus, the PC-3 cell is more malignant and resistant to treatment
