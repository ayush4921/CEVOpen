<p id="Par34">Although biosynthesized gold nanoparticles did not display a better cytotoxic effect than their precursors, exhibiting only residual cytotoxicity from BRP active compounds, they still constitute a great advantage compared with gold nanoparticles synthetized by chemical methods. El Domany et al.
