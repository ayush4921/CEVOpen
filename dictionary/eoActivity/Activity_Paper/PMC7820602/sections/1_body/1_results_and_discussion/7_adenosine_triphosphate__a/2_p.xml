<p id="Par36">The results of ATP tests in PC-3 cells showed that biosynthesized AuNPs and its precursors (crude BRP extract and its fractions) present the same cytotoxic profile obtained by resazurin colorimetric determination (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). This strain was chosen for the experiment because it is considered more resistant than T24 cells. Thus, as obtained in the resazurin assay, the hexane fraction was the most cytotoxic between the extract and fractions. Among the nanoparticles, AuNP
 <sub>extract</sub> was the most effective in reducing cell viability, followed by AuNP
 <sub>dichloromethane</sub>. Therefore, these results confirm the cytotoxic profile previously verified by the resazurin assay.
