<p id="Par22">The TGA graphs of the BRP extract, fractions, and AuNPs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) showed a steady weight loss in the temperature range of 150–600 °C with a total weight loss of up to 800 °C. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the percentage of weight loss of the AuNPs. The percentage differences in the weight loss shown in the table are related to the difference in organic composition present on the AuNP's surface. It is expected that the weight loss between 100 °C and 200 °C refers to the evaporation of adsorbed water of the capping extract

 </sup>. The largest weight loss observed in the range of 250 to 500 °C may be a result of the thin layer burning of organic material surrounding the nanoparticles
