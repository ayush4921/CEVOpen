 </sup>. In this study, we produced gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with BRP extract (AuNP
 <sub>extract</sub>) and its fractions (AuNP
 <sub>hexane,</sub> AuNP
 <sub>dichloromethane</sub>, AuNP
 <sub>ethyl acetate</sub>) using the green synthesis method. In order to increase the solubility of the compounds present in the extract, the pH of the mixture of gold solution with the propolis extract was adjusted to 7.0. Moreover, this pH alteration is also involved in the activation of phytochemical compounds, which facilitates the donation of electrons to the metal, reducing Au
