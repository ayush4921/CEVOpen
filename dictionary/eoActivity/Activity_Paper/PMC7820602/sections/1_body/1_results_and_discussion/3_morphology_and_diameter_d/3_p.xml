<p id="Par17">The Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS) was performed to gather information about the chemical composition of samples for elements with atomic numbers (Z) &gt; 3. All AuNPs spectra showed an absorption band peak of approximately 2.2 keV, which is characteristic of gold absorption

 </sup>. The HR-TEM images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a–d) of all AuNPs demonstrated highly ordered planar spacing consistent with the internal spacing of the gold plane. The AuNP
 <sub>hexane</sub> showed inter-planer spacing of 1.9 Å, whereas the AuNP
 <sub>ethyl acetate</sub> and AuNP
 <sub>dichloromethane</sub> exhibited 2.2 Å of d-spacing, which is in agreement with the (200) and (111) lattice of face-centered cubic (fcc) gold (JCPDS card N
