<p>In anticholinesterase assay, the % inhibition of standard drug (eserine) was 91.27 ± 1.17 and IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 0.04 ± 0.0001, whereas result of crude aqueous methanol extract and its different organic fraction were negligible. An enzyme urease helps to hydrolyze urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide, hence used medically against bacteria (

 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Crude aqueous methanol extract of bark as well as their organic fractions were subjected to anti-urease activity and results were compared with standard drug thiourea. Percent inhibition and IC
 <sub>50</sub> were calculated and compared with standard drug. Percent inhibition of crude aqueous extract of bark, its methanol fraction, and DCM fraction are 94.48 ± 0.16, 67.31 ± 0.21, 96.23 ± 0.17, and 98.21 ± 0.18 (standard), respectively. IC
 <sub>50</sub> of crude aqueous methanol extract, DCM fraction, and MeOH fraction are 72.35 ± 0.12, 45.26 ± 0.13, and 134.82 ± 0.16, respectively, which were compared with standard IC
 <sub>50</sub> (21.25 ± 0.15). Result shows that all fractions have potential against this enzyme, but DCM fraction of crude aqueous extract has significant IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (45.26 ± 0.13) than other fractions.
