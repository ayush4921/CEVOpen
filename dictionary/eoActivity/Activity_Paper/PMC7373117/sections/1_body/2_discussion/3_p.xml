 <italic>In vitro</italic> enzymatic assays, that is, anticholinesterase, anti-urease, and α-glucosidase, were carried out on crude as well as different organic fractions of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) bark. The most important enzyme responsible for the carbohydrates digestion is α-glucosidase, which is present in the intestinal membrane surface. The inhibitors of α-glucosidase cause the retardation of 
 <sc>D</sc>-glucose liberation of lipopolysaccharides and disaccharides from dietary complex carbohydrates resulting in suppression of postprandial hyperglycemia, which ultimately causes delay in the absorption of glucose.[

 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The inhibitory activity of crude aqueous extract of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) bark and its fractions toward α-glucosidase was significant, whereas DCM fraction showed a very strong inhibitory activity more than standard. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value for DCM fraction was 8.45 ± 0.13, for MeOH fraction it was 64.24 ± 0.15, and for aqueous fraction it was 42.62 ± 0.17 as compared with standard IC
 <sub>50</sub> that is 37.42 (acarbose). From this, it can be concluded that molecules in DCM fraction can be considered against diabetes, which needs further investigation.
