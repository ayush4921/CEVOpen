<p>Because of complicated and diversified nature of phytoconstituents of plants, it is difficult to evaluate the nature of compound responsible for antioxidant activity of a crude extract and different organic fractions of plants.[
 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Phenolic compounds and flavonoids are present as major constituents in plants and are very important medicinally. The constituents belonging to this class mainly possess antioxidant activity and are, therefore, assessed for the said activity. Phenolic compounds express their antioxidant potential by scavenging radicals, taking the singlet oxygen, and donating a hydrogen atom. For screening of antioxidant potential of samples,[
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] DPPH assay was used, which is a well-known, fast and sensitive method.[
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In this technique, purple-colored DPPH solution is reduced into yellow-colored diphenyl-picrylhydrazine in the presence of hydrogen-donating antioxidants. The antioxidant potential of the samples[
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] is directly proportional to the hydrogen-donating capacity of the sample resulting in less absorbance. The crude methanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) bark and its organic fractions were also tested for antioxidant activities. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> calculated for aqueous extract was 335.3 ± 0.21, and organic fractions has shown negligible values as compared with a standard (propyl gallate) IC
 <sub>50</sub> that was 46.38 ± 0.11 µM.
