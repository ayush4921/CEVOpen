<p>The study was performed on crude methanolic extract of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) bark and its organic fractions. All equipment used in the following study were clean and incubated for 5min at 37°C. A total volume of 100 μL reaction mixture was prepared containing 60 µL of disodium phosphate of 50-mM concentration (as a buffer with 7.7 pH value), test sample having volume of 10 μL with 0.5mM concentration and enzyme having volume of 10 μL with 0.005 concentration
