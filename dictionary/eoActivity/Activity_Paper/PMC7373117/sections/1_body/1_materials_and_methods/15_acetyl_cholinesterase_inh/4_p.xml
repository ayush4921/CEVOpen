<p>Through serial dilutions from 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.625, 0.03125, up to 0.015625mM of the compound, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined. With the help of graph, using EZ-Fit enzyme kinetics software (Perrella Scientific, MA, Amherst), the concentrations showing 50% or more inhibition were considered as IC
 <sub>50</sub>. All the values were presented as mean of three independent replicates.[
