<p>IC
 <sub>50</sub> of samples were calculated with the help of EZ-Fit enzyme kinetic software (Perrella Scientific, MA, Amherst). By serial dilutions of compounds to different concentrations, that is, from 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.625, 0.03125, up to 0.015625mM, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated. With the help of graph, the concentration at which the inhibition was 50% or more was calculated as IC
 <sub>50</sub>. Acarbose was positive control in the study. All values are mean of three independent variables.[
