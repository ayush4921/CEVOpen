<p>Four isoflavonoids have been isolated from 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb) roots, which are designated as α-hydroxyerysotrine, 4′-methoxy lico-flavanone (MLF), alpinumiso-flavone, and wighteone.[
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Moreover, a new derivative alkaloid of erythrinia, (+)-11α-hydroxyerythravine was isolated from the flowers of 
 <italic>E. mulungu</italic>. Also, from the flowers of 
 <italic>E. mulungu</italic>, the known derivatives (+)-erythravine and (+)-α-hydroxyerysotrine were isolated.[
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the phytochemical investigation, various alkaloidal constituents were isolated from the seeds of 
 <italic>E. suberosa</italic> (Roxb). These alkaloids include erythraline, erysodine, erysotrine, and hypaphorine. Erysotrine was found to occur naturally and was isolated for the first time from natural source.[
