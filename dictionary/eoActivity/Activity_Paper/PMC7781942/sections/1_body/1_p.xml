<p>In many tropical countries, especially in Southeast Asia, 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> is popular for its edible fruit and medicinal benefits (Ragasa et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ana et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Until now, there have been many studies on 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>, but most of them are about its medicinal effect or chemical compounds obtained from it. However, there are very few reports on the genomics of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>, and the chloroplast genome has not been reported yet. In this study, the chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> was sequenced, assembled, and annotated.
