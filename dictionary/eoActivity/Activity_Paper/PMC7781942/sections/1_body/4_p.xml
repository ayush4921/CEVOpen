<p>In order to study the phylogenetic relationship between 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and other plant species, 19 plant species were considered which were closely related to 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>, and a maximum likelihood tree based on the DNA sequences of the protein-coding genes common to chloroplast genomes of all species was constructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). The 19 species belong to three families of Magnoliales order, of which 13 species belong to the Magnoliaceae family, 5 species belong to the Annonaceae family and only one species belongs to the Myristicaceae family. 
 <italic>Kadsura longipedunculata</italic> belong to Schisandraceae family of Austrobaileyales order which was used as the out-group. The multiple sequence alignment was carried out by MAFFT (Katoh and Standley 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and maximum-likelihood (ML) analysis was carried out by MEGA7.0 (Kumar etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In the phylogenetic analysis, 20 species were divided into three groups, among which 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and 
 <italic>Annona cherimola</italic>, 
 <italic>Uvaria macrophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>Greenwayodendron suaveolens,</italic> and 
 <italic>Chieniodendron hainanense</italic> were added in the same group. The results indicated that they had a close phylogenetic relationship. This study not only reported the complete chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> firstly but also provided abundant basic data for the genomics study of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic>.
