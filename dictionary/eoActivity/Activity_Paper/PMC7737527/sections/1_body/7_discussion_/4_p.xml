<p>An aim of this study was to compare these multiple-dose studies to the published safety data of the single-dose FiH studies of a similar time period [
 <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which included 10 compounds tested in the presented multiple-dose studies; no generally higher risk for harm could be detected for multiple-dose in comparison to single-dose treatment, and the nature of the TEAEs was comparable, as expected. The results were similar regarding the differences between active drug and placebo in the percentage of affected subjects by TEAEs (after single dose: 42.1% on active, 34% on placebo). The higher total percentages in the multiple-dose studies in active and placebo groups can be explained by the longer treatment periods, which by nature go along with a higher likelihood of experiencing an event.
