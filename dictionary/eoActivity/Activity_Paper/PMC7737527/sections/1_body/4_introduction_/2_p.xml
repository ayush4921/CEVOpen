<p>In order to contribute to the general knowledge for risk stratification, we analyzed safety data of our in-house FiH multiple-dose studies in healthy subjects for all compounds that went into human development between 2006 and 2019. Systematic safety data from preceding FiH single-dose studies has recently been published, and an overall low risk for participants was shown [
 <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A similar result was also demonstrated for previous FiH studies [
 <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The aim of this analysis was to determine if a relevant increase of risk occurs at the important step from first single- to multiple-dose administration in humans.
