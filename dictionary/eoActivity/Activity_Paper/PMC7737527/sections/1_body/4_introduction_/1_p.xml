<p>An important extension in the scope of the valid guideline for early clinical trials with investigational medicinal products of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is the coverage of studies beyond single-dose first-in-human (FiH) trials [
 <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While previous regulation focused on determination of a safe starting dose and dosing selection in single-dose FiH trials [
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], considerations for the ensuring of safety during the first multiple-dose administration in humans have become an important part of the new regulation. The death case in the Bial trial in 2016, which happened in the multiple-dose part of this FiH study [
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], illustrates dramatically the importance of paying particular attention to safety in this step of early clinical development. Potential accumulation might become evident and relevant for target-related side effects and can possibly also lead to off-target effects [
 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite the general perception of an acceptable risk in early clinical trials in healthy subjects, systematic data for risk determination remain rare [

 <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] especially in regard to the different types of early clinical studies.
