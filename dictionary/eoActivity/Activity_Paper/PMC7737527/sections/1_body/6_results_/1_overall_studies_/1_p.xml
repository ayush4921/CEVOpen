<p>Of all 16 analyzed studies, 12 studies had reported data at the timepoint of analysis and were included, 4 studies were still ongoing and were not included. All included studies tested small molecules and only multiple-dose escalation, parallel group comparison, single blind, placebo-controlled designs were used. Three of the included studies had comparator arms and/or interaction parts that were all excluded from this analysis. Routes of administration were in 11 cases oral (immediate-release tablets), and in 1 case intranasal (solution). The number of dose steps was 3 or 4 in most of the studies, only 1 study had 5 dose steps. Escalation factors between daily doses ranged from 1 (once versus twice daily dosing of the same daily dose) to 2.5, the ratios between the highest and lowest daily doses ranged from 3 to 10. Indications for development were for 7 compounds cardiovascular, for 3 pulmonary, for 1 kidney, and for 1 hematology diseases. In all studies, the investigated doses were justified by the estimated dose range for later therapeutic use, mostly starting at the lower and escalating up to the upper boundary as evidenced by results of a FiH study and/or preclinical studies [

In 1 study, administration in the planned highest dose step was assessed as not well tolerated (vasoactive compound with exaggerated effects and/or response related to the mode of action of vasodilation). In the others, good tolerance was seen up to the highest dose step. At cut-off, 6 compounds were still under development (2 in phase III, 4 in phase II). The other 6 were terminated, thereof 5 in phase II. In 1 case, the results of the included multiple-dose escalation study led to termination thereafter (insufficient dose-response relationship).
