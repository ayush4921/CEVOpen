<p>Overall, 621 TEAEs occurred during the studies and were assigned to 172 adverse event (AE) terms. The most frequent TEAE was headache (14.8% of all TEAEs, for further TEAEs see 
 <xref rid="Table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 499 TEAEs were reported in treatment with active drug and 122 in placebo. For 293 subjects, at least 1 TEAE was reported (59.1%), thereof in 231 (62.4%) subjects after active treatment and in 62 (49.2%) after placebo treatment. Most of these subjects had a mild intensity (54.2% of all subjects), 4.6% of all subjects a moderate, and only 1 subject a severe maximum intensity of a TEAE. Percentages of subjects with a maximum TEAE intensity of moderate were comparable between active and placebo treatment. The rate of subjects with a TEAE in active treatment was higher at higher dose steps with a clear difference to placebo from dose step 2 and higher. However, the proportion and the overall percentage of subjects within a dose group with a maximum TEAE intensity of moderate were not higher at higher dose steps and did not differ between active and placebo treatment.
