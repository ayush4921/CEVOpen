<p>The results showed no relevant differences between active treatment and placebo in the percentages of affected subjects by increases of amylase, lipase, CK, ALT, AST, GLDH, bilirubin, AP, GGT and creatinine above 1.5-fold of the upper limit of normal during the in-house phases of the studies. Relative risks for such increase were higher under active treatment as compared to placebo for lipase, ALT, AST, GLDH, and GGT without reaching significance level for any of them and showed high variability. For details of subjects with laboratory value increases above 1.5-fold see
