<p>The tissues homogenates were prepared in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) using tissue homogenizer (Scilogex, Cromwell Avenue, Rocky Hill, CT, USA). One portion of each tissues homogenate was stored at −20 °C, which was used for assessing lipid peroxidation and remaining portion of homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C at 13,500 rpm for 30 min (Allegro 64A centrifuge) to obtain post mitochondrial supernatant (PMS). The PMS was stored in clean labeled eppendorf and stored at −20 °C until used for further biochemical assays.</p>
