<p>During the experimental period, water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH were monitored on a daily basis using portable meters (YSI EcoSense DO200A, Yellow Springs Incorporated, Yellow Springs, OH, USA; ADWA, AD1020 pH/mv/ISE). The average water dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH were 5.6 mg L
