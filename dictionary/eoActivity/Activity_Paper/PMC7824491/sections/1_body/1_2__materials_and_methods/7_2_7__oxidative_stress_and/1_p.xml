<p>The oxidative stress and antioxidant defense enzymes activities were estimated in the liver, kidney, gills and brain of the fish. The lipid peroxidation level was estimated following the protocol of Faheem and Lone [
 <xref rid="B35-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The reaction mixture (1 mL of 10% tissue homogenate, 1 mL of 10% tricholoro acetic acid and 1 mL of 0.67% thiobarbituric acid) was incubated in boiling water bath for 45 min and cooled at room temperature followed by its centrifugation (2500×

The absorbance of supernatant was recorded at 532 nm and values were expressed as nmole of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) formed per gram of tissue. The biochemical analysis for estimating the tissue antioxidant enzymes activities, catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), was performed using PMS [
