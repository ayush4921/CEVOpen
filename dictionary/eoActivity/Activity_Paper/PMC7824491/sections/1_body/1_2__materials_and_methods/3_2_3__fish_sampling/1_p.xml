<p>Fish sampling was done on a weekly basis (7th, 14th, 21st and 28th day). On each sampling day, 15 fingerlings/group (5 from each replicate) was harvested using a hand net. The fish were anesthetized using clove oil and their length-weight was recorded prior to their dissection. The liver, kidney, gills and brain of experimental fish were excised, cleaned of extraneous tissues in phosphate buffer solution then immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. In the laboratory, all collected tissues were shifted into an ultra-low freezer (−86 °C) until used for further analysis. Fish dorsal muscles were stored at −20 °C until used for their proximate composition analysis.</p>
