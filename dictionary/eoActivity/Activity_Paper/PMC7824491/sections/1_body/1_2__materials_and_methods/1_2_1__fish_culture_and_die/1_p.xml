<p>Healthy rohu fingerlings were procured from a government fish seed hatchery in Lahore and acclimatized under laboratory conditions for two weeks prior to this feeding trial. Experimental fish (8.503 Â± 0.009 g) were randomly distributed into three groups and kept in well-aerated glass aquaria filled with 50 L of water (60 fingerlings/group). The experiment was done in triplicates and lasted for 28 days. The commercially available floating carps feed prepared using soybean meal and plant protein products, grain and cereal products, yeast, DCP, vitamins and trace minerals, was purchased from Oryza organics, Pvt. Ltd., Lahore, Pakistan, and used as a basal diet for the present study. Black seed was purchased from a local shop in Lahore and grinded into powder form. Three diets containing 0.0%, 1% and 2.5% black seed were prepared by mixing black seed powder into the basal diet and fed to group 1, 2 and 3 fish respectively. The concentrations of black seed used in this study were selected following Bektas et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-11-00048" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Fish were fed twice a day at the rate of 5% of their wet body weight and ration size was adjusted on weekly basis after each sampling. The three quarters of aquaria water was siphoned daily and replaced by clean well-aerated water.
