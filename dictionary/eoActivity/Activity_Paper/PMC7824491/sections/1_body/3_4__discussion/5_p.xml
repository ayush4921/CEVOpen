<p>Liver is an important organ with high metabolic rate. Phosphatases and transaminases are vital for assessing liver function as they regulate several metabolic processes involving synthesis and deamination of amino acid during fluctuating energy demands under different nutritional, physiological and environmental situations [

The hepatoprotective action of black seed has been largely attributed to its thymoquinone contents, which protects the liver from injuries through different mechanisms such as increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, inhibition of iron dependent lipid peroxidation and lipogenesis in the hepatocytes [
