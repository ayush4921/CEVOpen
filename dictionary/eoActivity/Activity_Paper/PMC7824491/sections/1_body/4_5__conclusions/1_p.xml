<p>In conclusion, the results of the present study gave a new insight on the use of black seed as natural growth promoter, antioxidant and hepatic-nephric protector in aqua feed of rohu. The results of the present study elucidated that all the studied levels of black seed (1% and 2.5%) are safe and have positive effects on the growth performance, antioxidant and histo-biochemical parameters of rohu. Black seed is suggested as a potential candidate to be used as feed additive in intensive fish culturing practices to avoid stress-related losses and ultimately to enhance the overall fish production.</p>
