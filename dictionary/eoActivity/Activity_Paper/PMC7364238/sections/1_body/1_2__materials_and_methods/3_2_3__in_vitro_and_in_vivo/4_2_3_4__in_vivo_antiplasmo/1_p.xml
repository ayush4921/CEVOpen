<p>Male Swiss albino mice (6–8 weeks old, weighing 20 ± 2 g) were used as subjects. The mice were bred in standard macrolon type II cages in air-conditioned rooms at 22°C, with 50–70% relative humidity, and fed the standard diet and water 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. 
 <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, a rodent malaria parasite maintained at the parasite bank of CBRD, KEMRI, was used. The assay protocol was based on Peter's 4-day suppression test [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The parasite strain was maintained by a serial passage of blood from an infected mouse to a naïve mouse. 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic>-infected blood was obtained by cardiac puncture and parasitemia adjusted downwards to 1% by diluting it using phosphate-buffered saline with glucose (PSG; pH 7.4).
