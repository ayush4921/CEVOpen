<p>Vero (E196) cell line from the African Green Monkey's Kidney was maintained in Eagle's Minimum Essential Media (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A cell density of 20,000 cells per well in a suspension of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l was seeded on 96-well plates and incubated for 24 hours at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 37°C to achieve &gt;90% confluence. Samples of the assay drugs and control were then added after 24 hours at a starting concentration of 1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Positive control (Chloroquine) was added at a concentration of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml.
