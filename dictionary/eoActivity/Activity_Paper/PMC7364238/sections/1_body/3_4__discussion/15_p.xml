<p>In this study, all the extracts of 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> leaves were observed to exhibit low antiplasmodial activity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50-100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). This concurs with previous studies by [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Water and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>S. africana</italic> were in this study observed to exhibit high 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). In 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, aqueous extracts of this plant exhibited moderate activity (39.09%) while methanol extracts showed low activity (27.06%), thus confirming the use of this plant for treatment of malaria.
