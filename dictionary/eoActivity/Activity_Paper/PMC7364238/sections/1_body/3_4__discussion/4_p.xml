<p>Mice treated with all extracts of 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> leaves (including dichloromethane extracts that exhibited moderate 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> suppression) significantly have shorter survival period (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) than the untreated control, thus an indication of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> toxicity. Toxicity of this plant has been reported by [
