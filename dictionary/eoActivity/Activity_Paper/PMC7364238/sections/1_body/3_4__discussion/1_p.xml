<p>Dichloromethane extract of 
 <italic>E. abyssinica</italic> stem bark was observed to exhibit high antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) in this study while both water and methanol extracts were moderately active (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 11-50) against both chloroquine-sensitive (D6) and chloroquine-resistance (W2) strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. However, although none of 
 <italic>E. abyssinica</italic> extract was highly active 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (suppression of &gt;60%), the dichloromethane extracts exhibited a moderate suppression of 38.85% (
