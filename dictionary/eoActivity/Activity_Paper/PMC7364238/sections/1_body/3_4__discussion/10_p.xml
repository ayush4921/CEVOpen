<p>For the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> assays, both water and dichloromethane extracts exhibited a low suppression (21.9% and 23%, respectively) while the methanol extract showed moderate suppression (38.31%). However, [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported high 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> suppression (64.27%) for the water extract, thus the lack of concurrence with this study. The lack of concurrence could be explained by the fact that studies by [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] had the extract administered intraperitoneally while in this study all the extracts were orally administered to mimic the method commonly used by the herbalists. The route of drug administration influences bioavailability and the pharmacodynamics associated with therapeutic effects.
