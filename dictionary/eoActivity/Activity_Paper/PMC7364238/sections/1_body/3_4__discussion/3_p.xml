<p>For 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> leaves, both water and methanol extracts exhibited moderate antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 11-50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) while the dichloromethane extract exhibited high 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &lt; 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). High 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity was also reported for the dichloromethane extracts of the leaves collected in Rwanda [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which coincides with the finding of this study. Similarly, the best parasitemia suppression 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (40.9%) was exhibited by the dichloromethane extract while both water and methanol only exhibited low suppression (19.0% and 20.38%, respectively). These findings concur with those reported by Oyewole et al. Additionally, prophylactic activity against Plasmodium has been reported in 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].
