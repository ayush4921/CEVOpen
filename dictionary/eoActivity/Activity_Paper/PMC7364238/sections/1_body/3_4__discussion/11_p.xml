<p>All the other extracts of 
 <italic>Senna didymobotrya</italic> were inactive dichloromethane extracts of the leaves and pods that exhibited moderate (IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and low (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50-100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiplasmodial activity, respectively, thus the possibility of active constituent being lipophilic in nature. Elsewhere, aqueous extracts of both pods and leaves have been reported to be inactive 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus the concurrence with this study [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similarly, water and methanol extracts of the leaves collected in Kenya were also inactive [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], while the dichloromethane extracts of the leaves collected in South Africa were found to be moderately active 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study, it is only the dichloromethane extracts of the leaves that exhibited low suppression (14.74%), thus strengthening the suggestion of the active constituent in this plant parts being lipophilic in nature.
