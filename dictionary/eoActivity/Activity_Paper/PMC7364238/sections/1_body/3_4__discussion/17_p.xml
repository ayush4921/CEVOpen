<p>Additionally, aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> (leaves) collected from Brazil had been reported to being safe [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>E. abyssinica</italic>, 
 <italic>Z. chalybeum</italic>, 
 <italic>S. didymobotrya</italic> (leaves and pods), 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. africana</italic> were observed to exhibit low selectivity indices, an indication of cytotoxicity. Elsewhere, nitidine, the main compound responsible for antiplasmodial activity in 
 <italic>Z. chalybeum</italic>, has been reported to be cytotoxic [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], thus supporting the observation in this study where all the extracts of 
 <italic>Z. chalybeum</italic> exhibited low selectivity indices.
