 <italic>In vitro</italic> antiplasmodial results were interpreted as follows: high activity (IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), moderate activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 11-50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), low activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50-100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), and inactive (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ≥100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. In this study, out of all the aqueous and organic extracts of the studied plants that were tested against both D6 (CQ-sensitive) and W2 (CQ-resistant) strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 24% exhibited high activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 1 0 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), 43% moderate activity (IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), 18% low activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50-100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml), and 15% were inactive (IC
