 <italic>In vivo</italic> antiplasmodial results of different plant extracts assayed against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> in mice on day four postinfection (pi) and their corresponding survival time in days are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Suppression of parasitemia was used as a measure of antiplasmodial activity and was interpreted as follows: highly active (&gt;60%), moderately active (30-60%), lowly active (10-30%), and no activity (&lt;10) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Overall, none of the extracts exhibited high parasitemia suppression &gt; 60%. However, 18% of the extracts exhibited moderate antiplasmodial activity and 39% exhibited low activity while 42% were inactive (
