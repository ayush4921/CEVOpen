<p>It is generally considered that the biological efficacy is not due to the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity when the selectivity index (SI) ≥ 10 (Vonthron-Senecheau et al., 2003). In this study, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cytotoxicity was interpreted as follows: low selectivity index &lt; 10 and high selectivity index &gt; 10 according to Irungu et al. (2015). The results are summarized and are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The results revealed that the aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>T. brownii</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pinnata</italic>, 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> (leaves and flowers), and 
 <italic>C. edulis</italic> and methanol and dichloromethane extracts of 
 <italic>T. diversifolia</italic> (flowers) as well as dichloromethane extracts of 
 <italic>S. africana</italic> indicated high selectivity indices (SI) ≥ 10 against the studied strains (
