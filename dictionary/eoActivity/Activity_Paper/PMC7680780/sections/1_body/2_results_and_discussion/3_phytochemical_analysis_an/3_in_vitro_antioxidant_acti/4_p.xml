<p id="p0150">From the results in 
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref>, the CECR and the nanoparticles have the ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation in a dose-dependent manner, like the standard antioxidant (ascorbic acid). Only the AECR-AuNPs showed reduced inhibition of lipid peroxidation at all concentrations. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation at the highest concentration tested is in the following order: AECR-AgNPs (90%) &gt; CECR-AgNPs (90%) &gt; CECR (88%) &gt; CECR-AuNPs (87.22%) &gt; Ascorbic acid (87.05%) &gt; AECR-AuNPs (69.71%) (
