<p id="p0110">Further, elemental composition of synthesized AgNPs and AuNPs was determined by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum, and higher percentage of silver signals when compared to other elements was revealed (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a and b, respectively). The AgNPs spectrum reveals strong signals (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a) in the silver region (92.78%), which indicates the formation of AgNPs. However, elements such as oxygen, sulphur and carbon are present at low concentrations, which could have resulted from the compounds present in the extract. For the AuNPs, it was noted that gold (79.50%) was the major element, with some other elements at low percentages (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b), which might be from the compounds from the extract. This indicates the reduction of gold ions to elemental gold. Strong signal of gold metal have reportedly been observed around 2 keV, which is a characteristic peak of AuNPs [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and around 3 keV for silver metal, which is a characteristic peak of silver nanocrystalline [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].
