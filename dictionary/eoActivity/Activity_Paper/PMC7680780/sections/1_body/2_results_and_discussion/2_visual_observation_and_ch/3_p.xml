<p id="p0105">The formation of AgNPs and AuNPs from extracts of 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic> were monitored by a reaction change in colour to light brown within 30 min for AgNPs, and to purple within 20 min for AuNPs. These colour changes suggest reduction and the synthesis of the nanoparticles, which are related to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band of both AgNPs and AuNPs [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The SPR bands of the biosynthesized AgNPs and AuNPs using 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic> were within the range of previously synthesized AgNPs [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and AuNPs [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] from various medicinal plants.
