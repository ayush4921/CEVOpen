<p id="p0120">As shown in Figures 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the FTIR spectra of CECR and CECR-AuNPS, respectively, were recorded in the frequency range between 4400 and 350 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the % transmittance (%T). It was shown that there were slight shifts in the FTIR peaks of

 <sup>−1</sup>). The absence of some peaks (4384, 1354.66 and 1245 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) in the synthesized AuNPs compared to the CECR, and the slight shifts noted in the peaks suggests the involvement of some functional groups in the reduction process. The bands from 4384 up to 3426 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in the FTIR spectra corresponds to O–H stretching vibration, which indicates the presence of alcohol and phenol. It was reported that hydroxyl groups (O–H) have stronger binding ability with gold ions [

 <sup>−1</sup> corresponds to C–H bond.
