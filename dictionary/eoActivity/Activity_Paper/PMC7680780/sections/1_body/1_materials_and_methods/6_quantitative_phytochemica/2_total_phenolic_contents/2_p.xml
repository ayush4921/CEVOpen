<p id="p0075">The total phenolic contents (TPC) of the extract and nanoparticles was determined using Folin Ciocalteu's reagent, as described by [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Each sample (100 μL, 100 μg/mL) or gallic acid (100 μL, 100 μg/mL) was mixed with 500 μL Folin Ciocalteu's reagent and 1.5 mL sodium carbonate (20%). The mixture was shaken thoroughly and made up to 10 mL with distilled water. The mixture was allowed to stand for 2 h. The absorbance was determined at 765 nm against a blank containing all reagents without samples or gallic acid at the same conditions. All determinations were carried out in duplicates. The total phenolic contents were calculated from standard curve obtained using varying concentrations of gallic acid (5–20 μg/mL), and result presented in mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per g sample.
