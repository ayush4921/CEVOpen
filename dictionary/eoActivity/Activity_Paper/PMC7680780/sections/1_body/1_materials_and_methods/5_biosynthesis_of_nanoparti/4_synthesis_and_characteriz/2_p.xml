<p id="p0060">Either 10 mL of AECR (0.1 g extract/mL distilled water) or CECR (from section 
 <xref rid="sec2.3" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref> above) was added to a beaker containing aqueous solution of gold (III) chloride trihydrate (190 mL, 1 mM) on a hot plate at 50 °C, and the reaction was continuously stirred for 10 min using a magnetic stirrer. The resultant nanoparticles were centrifuged twice at 15,000 x
