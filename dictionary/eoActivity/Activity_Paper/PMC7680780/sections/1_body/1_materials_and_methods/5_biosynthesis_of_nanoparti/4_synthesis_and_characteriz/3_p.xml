<p id="p0065">The reaction mixture ratio was optimized by measuring five different volumes of AECR/CECR (0.1 g extract/mL) were added to aqueous solutions of gold (III) chloride trihydrate (1 mM) at synthesis ratio 10:190, 20:180, 30:170, 40:160, 50:150, respectively. The addition was performed in a single step. This is because bio-reduction of metal ions usually occur readily in solution, resulting in stable nanoparticles [
