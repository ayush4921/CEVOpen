<p id="p0160">From the results obtained in this study, it can be concluded that the leaves of 
 <italic>Crassocephalum rubens</italic> contains a wide variety of secondary metabolites that could serve as reducing and capping agent in the synthesis of nanoparticles. These compounds also enhance the antioxidant capabilities of the synthesized nanoparticles based on the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant assays performed. Overall, it can be deduced from this study that AECR-AuNPs presented the least antioxidant capabilities to scavenge free radicals. As observed in this study, extraction method is a major factor that influences antioxidant properties of the nanoparticles. It can therefore be suggested that extraction of 
 <italic>C.Â rubens</italic> through the decoction method is more suitable than the maceration method for the synthesis of AuNPs, while either of the methods for the synthesis of AgNPs. Further studies would be carried out to investigate the biomedical applications of these nanoparticles, including the anti-inflammatory and anticancer potentials
