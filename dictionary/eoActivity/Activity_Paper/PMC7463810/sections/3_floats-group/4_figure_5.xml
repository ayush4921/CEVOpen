  <p>Effects of tricin and FOLFOX on immune cell populations and cytokine productions in orthotopic colon tumor-bearing mice. Spleens and lymph nodes were collected from different groups including naïve group (without tumor cell inoculation). Populations of (
   <bold>A</bold>) MDSC in spleens and (
   <bold>B</bold>) Treg in lymph nodes were determined by flow cytometry. Spleen lymphocytes were isolated and then activated with PHA (10 μg/mL). (
   <bold>C</bold>–
   <bold>F</bold>) Cell supernatant was collected after 24 h incubation and subjected to ELISA for determination of cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α) productions. Results were expressed as box and whisker plots, n = 7–13. Differences among treatment groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, *
