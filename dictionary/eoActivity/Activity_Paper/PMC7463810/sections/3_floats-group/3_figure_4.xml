  <p>Effects of tricin and FOLFOX on lung metastasis in orthotopic colon tumor-bearing mice. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Representative images of lungs obtained from different groups at end point of IVIS scan, and the fractional number revealed the frequency of metastasis detected in mice of each group. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Graph showed the bioluminescence measurements (expressed as average radiance) in lungs. Lungs were also collected and embedded in paraffin. Sections of lungs were stained with H &amp; E and photographed. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Representative photos showed tumor nodules (yellow arrows) in lung sections. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Tumor burden were presented as the mean percentage of metastatic area. Mean + S.E.M., n = 7–13 in each group. Differences among treatment groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, *
