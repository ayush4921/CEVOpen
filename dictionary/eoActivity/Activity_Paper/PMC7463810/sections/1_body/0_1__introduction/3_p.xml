<p>Tricin was found to be the most abundant among the commonly reported flavonoids in bran [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are the rich sources of tricin, they are seldom consumed in regular diet. Nonetheless, rice bran such as Oryzae Fructus Germinatus can be used as Chinese medicines. In fact, there are several kinds of grains used as Chinese medicines which are often prescribed by Chinese medicine practitioners, namely Hordei Fructus Germinatus (germinated barley or malt), Oryzae Fructus Germinatus (germinated rice) and Setariae Fructus Germinatus (germinated millet) (

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A clustering and correlation analysis showed that Setariae Fructus Germinatus (SFG) was frequently used for advanced colorectal cancer patients, whereas Hordei Fructus Germinatus (HFG) and Oryzae Fructus Germinatus (OFG) were commonly used for improving cancer patients’ appetite [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, based on the traditional usage of these medicinal grains in gastrointestinal disorders and the presence of the chemopreventive flavone tricin in HFG (in the amount of 5.7 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>% dry weight) [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we hypothesized that tricin would also be present in OFG and SFG and it could exert beneficial effects on colorectal cancer treatment. Previous studies demonstrated the inhibitory activities of tricin on self-renewal capacity of colon cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and invasion of C6 glioma cells [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in vitro, as well as the anti-inflammatory activity in human immune cells [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, the potential inhibitory activities of tricin in a metastatic colon tumor animal model have not yet been reported. In the present study, attempts have been made to investigate the inhibitory activities of tricin in human and mouse colon cancer cells as well as in syngeneic orthotopic colon tumor-bearing mouse model. The systemic efficacy of orally administered tricin on tumor metastasis and microenvironment have also been elaborated.
