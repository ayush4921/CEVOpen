<p>Immunocompetent mice bearing syngeneic colon tumors could display the efficacies of tricin or FOLFOX treatments on immunomodulation in mice. Lymphocytes isolated from spleens and lymph nodes from different treatment groups were subjected to flow cytometry to quantify the relative numbers. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f005">Figure 5</xref>A, population of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in spleens was higher in tumor bearing control group than that in naïve group (without tumors) (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.084). Tricin treatments could reduce the number of MDSC in tumor-bearing mice, with Tricin-H showing significant decrease when compared with control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Similarly, population of regulatory T (Treg) cells was shown to be significantly higher in tumor bearing mice lymph nodes than that in naïve mice (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Tricin-H treatment also reduced the elevated Treg cell number in tumor-bearing mice, however, the difference between Tricin-H and control groups was not significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.22). Nevertheless, the ex vivo cytokines productions from mouse spleen lymphocytes were modulated after the mice received different treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f005">Figure 5</xref>C–F). IL-2 production was higher in Tricin-H group than that in control group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). While the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α productions were decreased in tricin-treated or FOLFOX-treated groups, though not statistically significant.
