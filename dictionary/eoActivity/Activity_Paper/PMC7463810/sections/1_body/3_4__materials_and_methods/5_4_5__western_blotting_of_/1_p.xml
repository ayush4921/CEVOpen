<p>HT-29 cells treated with tricin (100–400 µM) for 24 h were collected for protein. Cells were scraped on ice and then lysed with lysis buffer purchased from Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Protein concentration was assessed using a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Equivalent amount of protein samples, which have been heated at 95 °C, were loaded at 10% SDS-PAGE gels for 2 h at 100 V. Proteins on gel were then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) electrophoretically at 90 V for 1–1.5 h. The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk (

Antibodies against Akt, p-Akt, Erk1/2, p-Erk1/2, NF-κB, pNF-κB (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used. After incubation, membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence solution (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) was used to detect the protein bands, which were captured by a molecular imager, ChemiDoc XRS+ (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Signals were quantified by Image J software (NIH, MD, USA) and normalized by β-actin. Quantitative data were represented as relative expression level (fold changes of untreated control). All western blotting assays were independently performed for at least three times.
