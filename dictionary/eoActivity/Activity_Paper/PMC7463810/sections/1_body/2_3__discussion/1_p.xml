Our chemical analysis showed that tricin was present in 3 tested medicinal grains, HFG, OFG, SFG, which are usually used as Chinese herbal medicines for digestive system disorders. This is the first report of the relatively high amount of tricin found in OFG (23.6 µg/g). This amount was higher than those present in rice bran (10 µg/g) [
