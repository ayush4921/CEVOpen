Introduction</title><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) prevalence in different populations is increasing and it now shows the second highest rate of cancer mortality worldwide [<xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. New prevention strategies are thus urgently needed to reduce the burden of CRC. CRC is influenced by genetics, lifestyle, diet, intestinal microbiota, etc. The awareness of maintaining colon health through diet and health supplements consumption draws great attention. Diet and lifestyle modifications for patients are highly recommended in order to alleviate the impact from colon disorders on the quality of life. A healthy pattern diet, generally characterized by high intake of fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes, fish and other dairy products, was associated with lower CRC risk [<xref rid="B2-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Besides, a meta-analysis revealed that one of the food items that has convincing epidemiological association with colorectal cancer risk reduction is whole grains [<xref rid="B3-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Grains (rice, corn, barley, wheat, oat, millet, etc.) are staple foods worldwide. Grains belong to the monocot Poaceae family and are widely cultivated to obtain the edible components of their fruits. Whole grains have an outer bran coat, a starchy endosperm, and a germ. Concerning the medicinal values of grains, previous studies have demonstrated that active ingredients such as polyphenols in sorghum bran [<xref rid="B4-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], protein and peroxidase in millet bran [<xref rid="B5-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], soluble phenolic content [<xref rid="B6-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and oil [<xref rid="B7-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] of rice bran, and fermented rice bran-containing diet [<xref rid="B8-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], could have suppressive effects on colitis and colon cancer cell growth. The bioactive phytochemicals present in rice bran such as ferulic acid, tricin, &#x003b2;-sitosterol, g-oryzanol, tocotrienols/tocopherols, phytic acid are regarded to possess chemo-preventive potential [<xref rid="B9-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In fact, one of the flavones found in brown rice and rice bran, tricin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B), was reported to inhibit growth of breast and colon cancer cells in our early study [<xref rid="B10-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The subsequent animal studies demonstrated the interference of tricin on carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer in <italic>Apc<sup>Min</sup></italic> mouse model [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the inhibitory effects of tricin on inflammation-related colon carcinogenesis mouse model [<xref rid="B13-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Tricin was found to be the most abundant among the commonly reported flavonoids in bran [<xref rid="B14-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although wheat hull [<xref rid="B15-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and rice bran [<xref rid="B16-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are the rich sources of tricin, they are seldom consumed in regular diet. Nonetheless, rice bran such as Oryzae Fructus Germinatus can be used as Chinese medicines. In fact, there are several kinds of grains used as Chinese medicines which are often prescribed by Chinese medicine practitioners, namely Hordei Fructus Germinatus (germinated barley or malt), Oryzae Fructus Germinatus (germinated rice) and Setariae Fructus Germinatus (germinated millet) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2015, these three types of medicinal grains are for digestive problems, such as food retention, spleen deficiency with reduced food intake, and promote digestion [<xref rid="B17-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A clustering and correlation analysis showed that Setariae Fructus Germinatus (SFG) was frequently used for advanced colorectal cancer patients, whereas Hordei Fructus Germinatus (HFG) and Oryzae Fructus Germinatus (OFG) were commonly used for improving cancer patients&#x02019; appetite [<xref rid="B18-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, based on the traditional usage of these medicinal grains in gastrointestinal disorders and the presence of the chemopreventive flavone tricin in HFG (in the amount of 5.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>% dry weight) [<xref rid="B19-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we hypothesized that tricin would also be present in OFG and SFG and it could exert beneficial effects on colorectal cancer treatment. Previous studies demonstrated the inhibitory activities of tricin on self-renewal capacity of colon cancer cells [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and invasion of C6 glioma cells [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in vitro, as well as the anti-inflammatory activity in human immune cells [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, the potential inhibitory activities of tricin in a metastatic colon tumor animal model have not yet been reported. In the present study, attempts have been made to investigate the inhibitory activities of tricin in human and mouse colon cancer cells as well as in syngeneic orthotopic colon tumor-bearing mouse model. The systemic efficacy of orally administered tricin on tumor metastasis and microenvironment have also been elaborated. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-molecules-25-03730"><title>2.

Tricin Reduced Cell Viability and Migration of Human and Mouse Colon Cancer Cells</title><p>Cell viability of colon cancer cells after 24 or 48 h tricin treatment was assessed by an MTT assay. Tricin reduced the cell viability of both human and mouse colon cancer cells after 48 h incubation, with IC<sub>50</sub> values at 107.9 &#x000b5;M and 34 &#x000b5;M in HT-29 and Colon26-Luc cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f001">Figure 1</xref>D), while tricin (up to 400 &#x000b5;M) did not affect the viability of HT-29 cells and the IC<sub>50</sub> value for Colon26-Luc cells was greater than 500 &#x003bc;M after 24 h incubation. Tricin was shown to inhibit colon cancer cell motility in scratch wound healing assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f001">Figure 1</xref>E, the closed wound areas in tricin-treated groups (25 or 50 &#x003bc;M) were fewer than that in untreated group after 24 h in HT-29 cells or 18 h in Colon26-Luc cells. The migration phenotype of Colon26-Luc cells was more obvious than that of HT-29 cells. Nevertheless, the closed wound area (as a percentage of control) was shown to be significantly lower in cells treated with 25 or 50 &#x003bc;M tricin when compared to control (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f001">Figure 1</xref>F). These data suggested that tricin could significantly decrease the cell motility in Colon26-Luc cells in a concentration-dependent manner. </p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-molecules-25-03730"><title>2.3.

HT-29 cells were treated with tricin at 100, 200 and 400 &#x003bc;M for 24 h, at which time the viability of HT-29 cells was not affected as mentioned above. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f002">Figure 2</xref>, tricin significantly reduced the expressions of phosphorylated protein kinase B (or Akt), phosphorylated extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B) and phosphorylated NF-&#x003ba;B in dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,D&#x02013;G), while the Akt and Erk1/2 expressions were less sensitive to the tricin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f002">Figure 2</xref>B,C).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-molecules-25-03730"><title>2.4. Tricin Suppressed Mouse Orthotopic Colon Tumor Growth</title><p>On the other hand, since Colon26-Luc cells were shown to be more sensitive to tricin treatment when compared to HT-29 cells in the migration assay, and previous studies also reported the immunomodulatory activities of tricin in vitro [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and in <italic>Apc<sup>Min</sup></italic> mice [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], syngeneic Colon26-Luc tumor-bearing Balb/c mice model was therefore adopted to reveal the systemic effects as well as the tumor-related immunomodulatory activity of tricin. In particular, the potential inhibitory effect of tricin on metastasis was evaluated in mice, which were orthotopically injected with Colon26-Luc cells and were under real-time monitoring of tumor growth by IVIS during treatment. Tricin was orally gavaged daily at 19 or 37.5 mg/kg, the latter dosage was previously reported to be effective in controlling carcinogenesis in <italic>Apc<sup>Min</sup></italic> mice [<xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Results showed that tricin treatments at these two tested dosages did not affect the final body weights of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f003">Figure 3</xref>A), while the chemotherapeutic treatment FOLFOX slightly decreased the body weight. Tumor growth in the rectum was monitored using IVIS imaging as the colon tumor cells were tagged with luciferase. The tumor burden in terms of bioluminescent signal emission (expressed as average radiance) increased from day 9 onwards in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f003">Figure 3</xref>B,C). Treatment with Tricin-H or FOLFOX resulted in obvious inhibitory effects on tumor growth in rectum as lower average radiance was observed in these groups.

Tricin Reduced Orthotopic Colon Tumor Metastasis</title><p>The metastasis of Colon26-Luc cells in lungs was also examined by bioluminescence imaging. In control group, signal emission from lungs was detected in nine out of thirteen mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f004">Figure 4</xref>A), i.e., 69.2% incidence of metastasis was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Mice received Tricin-H and FOLFOX treatments resulted in lower metastasis incidence, which were 46.2% (6 out of 13 mice) and 41.7% (5 out of 12 mice), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f004">Figure 4</xref>A).

These data offer some insights into the development of medicinal grains (containing tricin) as health food supplement for colon health. </p><p>Various in vitro regulatory activities of tricin on colon cancer stem cells [<xref rid="B20-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], endothelial cells [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], C2C12 myotubes [<xref rid="B27-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], mesenchymal stem cells [<xref rid="B28-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and dermal fibroblasts [<xref rid="B29-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have also been reported. In the present study, tricin was shown to inhibit migration of colon cancer cells HT-29 and Colon26-Luc cells at the non-cytotoxic concentrations. In fact, another human colon cancer cell line HCT-116 has also been tested for tricin&#x02019;s inhibitory effect on viability and migration (data shown in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03730">Supplementary Information</xref>). Results showed that the IC<sub>50</sub> value of tricin in HCT-116 cells was over 600 &#x003bc;M and the significant inhibition on transwell migration could only be achieved by 50 &#x003bc;M or higher of tricin. Thus, HT-29 cells were used for the further experiments. The phosphorylation of key molecules involved in colorectal cancer progression and metastasis, such as Akt [<xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], Erk1/2 [<xref rid="B31-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="B32-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], were down-regulated by tricin in HT-29 colon cancer cells, which the results were in line with previous studies. Shalili et al. showed the anti-inflammatory activity of tricin in hPBMCs which was via modulating the p38MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Another study demonstrated that tricin could inhibit proliferation and invasion of C6 glioma cells by downregulating focal-adhesion-kinase (FAK) and thus affecting the downstream Akt pathway [<xref rid="B21-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Besides, expression of migration-related proteins, such as integrins, can be evaluated in the future study to illustrate the underlying mechanism of anti-migratory action of tricin.</p><p>Recent animal studies demonstrated the broad-spectrum bioactivities of tricin, ranging from anti-obesity effect in high-fatdiet-induced obese mice [<xref rid="B33-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] to protection against UVB-induced wrinkle formation [<xref rid="B34-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, the anti-metastatic and/or immunomodulatory effects of tricin in colon cancer model have not yet been reported. Therefore, the present study aimed to verify the systemic efficacy of tricin in treating colorectal cancer using mouse model, of which the promising results might in turn translate to clinical uses. Here, a syngeneic orthotopic colon tumor-bearing mouse model using immune-competent mice was adopted to mimic the clinical pathological condition of metastatic CRC patients. Our results demonstrated apparent anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of tricin treatment at 37.5 mg/kg, which was comparable to the effects of chemotherapeutics FOLFOX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03730-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The real-time monitoring of the tricin inhibitory effect on orthotopic colon tumor growth was reported here for the first time. This also provided evidence for demonstrating how oral dosage of tricin could gradually control colon tumor progression. Furthermore, in the immune-competent tumor-bearing mice, the ability of modulating tumor immunogenicity of tricin appeared to be stronger than that of FOLFOX since the populations of MDSC in spleens, regulatory T cells in lymph nodes, macrophages and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in tumors were altered after Tricin-H but not FOLFOX treatments. It is possible that the immunomodulatory efficacy of tricin was similar to that of its derivative, antartina (tricin 7-<italic>O</italic>-&#x003b2;-D glucopyranoside, isolated from grass <italic>Deschampsia antarctica</italic>) [<xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Intraperitoneal treatment with antartina for three weeks could inhibit colorectal carcinoma growth and liver metastasis in mice. The potent specific cytotoxic T-cell response against colorectal carcinoma and activation of dendritic cells induced by antartina were suggested to be responsible for the anti-tumor effect [<xref rid="B35-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Nonetheless, antartina was administered by intraperitoneal injection while tricin was administered by oral gavage in the study. The oral bioavailability of tricin was reported [<xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and we showed the efficacy of ingested tricin in colon tumor-bearing mice. Hence, the feasibility to develop tricin as one of the health food ingredients for improving colon health is demonstrated here. Furthermore, based on the immunomodulatory properties of tricin, the potential benefit of combined use of tricin-containing food or medicinal herbs with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy in colorectal cancer management is worth further investigation.</p><p>On the other hand, population changes of MDSC and Treg cells induced by tricin treatment were also revealed in the present study. The tumor microenvironment is composed of tumor cells, fibroblasts, blood vessels, immune cells including T cells, B cells, macrophages, MDSC, dendritic cells, NK cells as well as specific cytokine, chemokines, extracellular matrix milieu, etc. [<xref rid="B36-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. MDSC have been regarded as promotor of tumor progression through multiple mechanisms in colorectal cancer [<xref rid="B37-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], while Treg was shown to play key role in immunosuppression and cancer progression [<xref rid="B38-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The multifunctional activities of tricin were now illustrated clearly as the reduction of MDSC and Treg populations and the augmented CD8<sup>+</sup> T tumor infiltrating lymphocytes population, which is responsible for the anti-tumor effects [<xref rid="B40-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], have been observed in tricin-treated mice. Furthermore, tricin also reduced the number of macrophages in tumors and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines production by spleen lymphocytes, such changes were consistent with the previous reports on the anti-inflammatory activity of tricin [<xref rid="B22-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B41-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Together with the anti-angiogenic activity reported from other group [<xref rid="B26-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the important role of tricin on modulating tumor microenvironment was further validated in the immune-competent tumor-bearing mouse model.</p><p>In conclusion, basing on our data, tricin appears to be an attractive candidate for future clinical study. Tricin has been shown to be safe for clinical development as a cancer chemopreventive agent [<xref rid="B42-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and be bioavailable when consumed with the diet in mice [<xref rid="B43-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Upon the newly confirmed edible source (i.e., medicinal grains) of tricin, the tricin-containing food can be further developed so that the multifunctional nutraceutical values of tricin can be translated into clinical uses and improve CRC patients&#x02019; colon health.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-molecules-25-03730"><title>4.

Syngeneic Orthotopic Colon Tumor-Bearing Mouse Model</title><p>The effects of tricin were evaluated in syngeneic orthotopic colon tumor-bearing mouse model, in which the growth of tumor and metastasis of colon cancer cells were monitored using an In Vitro Imaging System (IVIS). The luciferase-tagged mouse cancer cells Colon26-Luc (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells per 40 &#x003bc;L PBS) were injected into the posterior wall of the rectum of BALB/c mouse under anesthesia. Three days after cell inoculation, live animal whole-body imaging to monitor luciferase-expressing cells in mice was performed to ensure the successful inoculation using IVIS 200 (Xenogen, Alameda, CA, USA). Images were acquired for 1 to 180 s and the photon emission transmitted from each mouse were quantified using Xenogen Living Image (Igor Pro version 3.2 software), and the data were processed to produce graphs according to the average radiance (photons/s/cm<sup>2</sup>/sr) [<xref rid="B47-molecules-25-03730" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].
