<p>Given adequate legal, operational, and financial support, the EAC MRH initiative can help pioneer novel regulatory roles for Africa on the global stage. For example, medicines for health conditions that are primarily found in Africa are best evaluated in African countries, where the experts with the most experience with those conditions reside. In the future, the entire world may rely on African regulatory authorities to assess these types of medicines. Moreover, if the trials testing these medicines are conducted in Africa and are supported by appropriate local regulations, the patients who participate have the potential to benefit tremendouslyâ€”not only from the development of effective new medicines that address important health problems in Africa, but also from the access to the health system that is provided by enrolling in a clinical trial.</p>
