<p>Given the vast workload faced by the EAC MRH initiative, as well as by other regulatory programs across the world, collaborating with peer institutions has become a necessity. Could the initiative deliver a greater public health benefit if it started relying more on existing product assessments carried out by trusted regulatory authorities, as urged by the World Health Organization (WHO) [

This could free up the EAC MRH initiative’s time and resources to focus on which aspects of the assessments done by other agencies are relevant to EAC countries, as well as on carrying out more good manufacturing practice inspections and pharmacovigilance activities. The EAC MRH initiative has already decided to focus its joint assessments on products that are not eligible for WHO’s Prequalification Programme; this is a great example of using reliance to liberate resources for other important activities.
