<p>Another best practice is to focus the scope of a program’s activities on those most likely to have the greatest public health return. One important example would be the EAC MRH initiative’s plans to begin assessing biologics and biosimilars in the near future. Evaluating applications for these complex, expensive medicines requires a great deal of time and expertise. On the one hand, the more complex an application is, the more suitable it is for a regulatory pathway that pools expertise, such as the EU’s centralized procedure (mandated for such applications) or the EAC’s joint assessment program. On the other hand, given the resources required to assess these applications, perhaps it would be helpful if, when possible, the EAC relied on a trusted regulatory authority’s previous work when making decisions about biologics and biosimilars. This could allow the initiative to focus on registering medicines with a greater potential public health impact, such as affordable generic drugs, small-molecule new molecular entities, or even local versions of biosimilars. By contrast, the initiative’s plan to broaden the scope of its activities to regulating regional clinical trials has the potential to provide substantial benefits to EAC residents. If conducted properly and ethically, clinical trials could improve access to medicines for EAC residents, both in the short term for trial participants and in the long term for the broader population, which will benefit from the knowledge gained.</p>
