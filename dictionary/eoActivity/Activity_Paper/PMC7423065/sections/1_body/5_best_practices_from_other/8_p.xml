<p>We believe all regulatory authorities should collect a few key metrics (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1003092.g001">Fig 1</xref> revealed that a long queue time (approximately 200 days) resulted in a large backlog of applications. By implementing changes targeting queue time, Health Canada reduced its backlog by 99% between 2000 and 2006 and halved overall application approval times [

After analyzing key metrics, the Japanese government revised the country’s Pharmaceutical Affairs law, dedicated more staff to assessments, and invested in regulatory skill building [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003092.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Finally, the US FDA has kept detailed metrics on submissions and approvals for decades, as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 and its subsequent renewals require the agency to set and achieve annual goals based on the previous year’s metrics. All of these organizations were able to speed up the assessment process without abandoning their primary focus on quality, safety, and efficacy by using metrics to identify and address the points in the system where unnecessary delays were occurring.
