<p>A final best practice is to use metrics and benchmarks to identify roadblocks and perform comparisons with peer institutions, so programs can become more efficient [

It may be difficult to justify collecting data (on the time spent assessing an application, for example) whose public health impact is not immediately obvious. A program may also find the idea of collecting and publishing metrics of its own performance daunting when it is new or struggling, for fear the resulting data could prove “embarrassing.” However, early metrics should be viewed as a baseline; when they start to improve, so does the morale of program staff and the trust that outside partners have in a program.
