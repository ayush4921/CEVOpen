Indeed, it is essential for a harmonization program to describe all regulatory processes in detail in a form readily accessible to all stakeholders. The EMA provides a great deal of information on its website, including scientific guidelines and assessment reports, which contain comprehensive descriptions of its product evaluations [

In addition, public debates in which multiple viewpoints can be discussed and public forums for gathering comments are extremely valuable; decisions made in closed-door meetings cannot secure the broad buy-in needed to make harmonization programs successful.
