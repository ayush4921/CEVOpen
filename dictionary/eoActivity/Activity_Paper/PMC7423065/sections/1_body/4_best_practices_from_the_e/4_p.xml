<p>A second best practice is the involvement of the pharmaceutical industry. To be clear, the EU’s system exists to regulate industry. However, the system also needs industry to produce medicines and comply with regulations, and industry representatives have often provided valuable feedback about how to improve regulatory processes. Industry can thus be viewed as a “partner” in the effort to make regulatory assessments more efficient, predictable, and credible. Beyond the EU, different regional harmonization programs have identified different roles for industry. For example, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)’s Pharmaceutical Products Working Group invites industry representatives to attend dedicated sessions held prior to when regulators have their meetings and also allows industry representatives to attend regulators’ meetings as observers. In the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)’s Life Sciences Innovation Forum–Regulatory Harmonization Steering Committee, industry plays a more active role, joining in discussions and helping to prioritize work areas. Finally, the time, funding, resources, and motivation of industry members played a critical role in the early successes of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH; originally the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use), including establishing the Common Technical Document (CTD) and numerous guidelines on product quality, safety, and efficacy. Industry members, who had (and still do have) seats on the ICH Steering Committee, drew on their deep knowledge of regulatory processes to help select which regulatory guidelines to work on and to help create and refine those guidelines. Although ICH is not a regional harmonization program, this example highlights the potential of industry representatives to identify important regulatory inefficiencies and also potential solutions.</p>
