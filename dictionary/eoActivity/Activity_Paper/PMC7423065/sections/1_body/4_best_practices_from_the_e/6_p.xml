<p>A third, and related, best practice is making joint regulatory processes attractive to industry users, who value reliability, efficiency, and convenience. The EU’s system gained and retains industry’s support in large part because of its ability to complete high-quality assessments of marketing authorization applications in less than 1 year, paving the way for licenses that are valid across Europe. This is a much more attractive prospect than the lengthy wait time that companies previously experienced [

Currently, however, EAC partner states have no such legal obligation and are, instead, motivated only by goodwill. Once the initiative demonstrates that it reliably meets its deadlines and its decisions are respected throughout the region—preferably by making data from external audits public—industry users will be likely to participate in greater numbers.
