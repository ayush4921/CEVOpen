<p>The EAC MRH initiative has other well-thought-out features. For example, the EAC’s twinning program, in which more mature national regulatory authorities carry out joint activities alongside less mature authorities, is an excellent way to build the capacity of all partner states. We are also impressed by the initiative’s decision to assign 2 teams to each joint assessment or evaluation. “Healthy cooperation and friendly competition” between regulatory authorities ensures high-quality, consistent assessments and also supports the continued education of assessors. The program also appears to enjoy a high degree of involvement from all partner states. Small countries have the potential to make outsized contributions to regional harmonization initiatives (for example, a senior drug-quality expert from Luxembourg has been a tireless and highly respected contributor to the EU’s regulatory system for many years). By actively involving both large and small partner states, the EAC MRH initiative is poised to capitalize on regional talent, wherever it comes from. Finally, the initiative has an unusually clear roadmap for the future, which will make it easier to stay focused on the program’s most important goals.</p>
