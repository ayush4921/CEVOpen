<p>In the final article in this Special Collection in

 <xref rid="pmed.1003092.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="pmed.1003092.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], we, a group of authors who have had no involvement in the EAC MRH’s work to date, provide an independent perspective on the program’s work thus far and its plans for the future. The initiative’s goal is to improve access to essential medicines in East Africa by simplifying the process of registering medicines and increasing the speed at which registration applications are reviewed while ensuring that only high-quality medicines are approved. Here, we share our thoughts on the global context in which this initiative operates, highlighting successful practices from around the world that may be helpful to the EAC MRH initiative as it moves forward. In turn, we call attention to some of the EAC MRH initiative’s practices and achievements that may be helpful to other harmonization initiatives.
