<p>In a study on human colon cancer cell line (HT-29), a methanol extract was shown to have strong antiproliferative activity using the sulforhodamine B assay. However, the 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol fraction had even higher activity [

 <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> are a bacterial species that targets the gastric epithelium and may cause gastric cancer. The infection is dependent on the binding of bacteria to gastric epithelial cells, and this binding requires MUC1 and MUC5AC, which are mucins found on the gastric cells. The high level of proteins in the 
 <italic>P. tetragonolobus</italic>, namely, lectins, is used as a diagnostic tool because it binds certain blood cells and specialized transport cells [
