 <italic>Psophocarpin</italic> B1, B2 and B3, winged bean proteins, were shown to have similarities with lectins of soybean. Hemagglutinin activity was detected in winged bean accounting to 77 to 154 hemagglutinin unit/g of winged bean [

However, hemagglutinin along with trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors are destroyed when heated, therefore only raw seeds will contain that amount of these anti-nutritive factors. Autoclaving the flour obtained from seeds for brief time led to a decrease in the activity of the three of them; from 30 to 40% decrease in activity in case of trypsin inhibitors, 15% decrease in case of chymotrypsin inhibitor and the great decrease was for hemagglutinins which ranged between 75 and 96%. After autoclaving the flour for 30 min, the activities of all the three components was abolished. However, a high percentage of protein became insoluble [
