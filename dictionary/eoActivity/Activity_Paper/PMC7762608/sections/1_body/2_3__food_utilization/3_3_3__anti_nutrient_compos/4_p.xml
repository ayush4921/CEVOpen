<p>Tannins and other phenolic compounds are also present in the seeds in quantities ranging from 0.03 to 7.5 mg/g of beans, lower than the amount of tannins in other beans [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. They can inhibit enzymes non-specifically and precipitate with proteins and thus lower the amount of available protein in the food. Phytates are other anti-nutritional factors that are present in seeds in amounts between 6.1 and 7.5 mg/g of seeds, which is similar to the amount present in soy bean. However, these amounts are not very high, so it is not harmful [
