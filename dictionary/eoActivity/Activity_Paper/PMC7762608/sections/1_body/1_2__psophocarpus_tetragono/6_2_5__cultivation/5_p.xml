<p>Winged bean is affected by five main fungal diseases; Choanephora blight (caused by 
 <italic>Choanephora cucurbitarum)</italic>, collar rot disease (caused by 
 <italic>Fusarium semitectum</italic>, 
 <italic>F. moniliforme, F. equiseti, Rhizoctonia solani and Macrophomina phaseolina)</italic>, powdery mildew (caused by 
 <italic>Erysiphe cichoracearum</italic>), dark leaf spot disease (caused by 
 <italic>Pseudocercosa psophocarpi)</italic>, and finally, the false rust disease, one of the most common diseases, caused by 
 <italic>Synchytrium psophocarpi</italic>. This disease is characterized by orange pustules that appear on leaves, pods and stems. In a study on 
 <italic>Synchytrium psophocarpi</italic> infected winged bean plants from Malaysia, it was found that the sporangia were 20.69 µm in size and their shape was spherical to ovoid, the spores were 2.02 µm in diameter with flagella of length equal to 10.75 µm. Three more fungal diseases also appeared in Sri Lanka; pulvinus rot disease (caused by 
 <italic>Fusarium pallidoroseum</italic>), leaf scorch disease (caused by 
 <italic>Phomasogina</italic>) and pod rot disease 
 <italic>(Botryodiploidea theobromae</italic>) [
