<p>Understanding the genetic diversity of a plant species is important for producing genetic improvement for better characteristics and benefits. Moreover, analyzing the variability in traits between plants of different origins, and comparing those traits to the genome and transcriptome may help in molecular breeding to produce plats of winged bean with desirable agronomic traits [
