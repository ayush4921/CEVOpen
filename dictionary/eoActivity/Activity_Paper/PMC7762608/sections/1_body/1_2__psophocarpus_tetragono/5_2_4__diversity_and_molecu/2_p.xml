<p>The genetic resources for winged bean are not rich because its ancestor is not yet identified. Nevertheless, the comparison of its genome with other legumes that were fully sequenced can be interesting. Those legumes include: 
 <italic>Glycine max, Cicer arietinum, Lotus japonicas, Cajanus cajan, Phaseolus vulgaris and Medicago truncatula</italic> [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. More studies are now performed also for sequencing of the genome of 
 <italic>Lupinus angustifolius, Trifolium pratense, Pisum sativum and Arachis hypogea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Nowadays, in conjugation to the already published sequencing data, the available inexpensive genomic techniques open an avenue for investigating the genomic makeup of the winged bean. A study on 24 accessions of winged bean was done and identified that ISSR markers were more efficient than RADP markers. Consequently, Chen et al. studied ISSR markers in 45 accessions to understand genetic variability, and the results of genetic distance and genetic identity between the accessions of winged bean showed a closed relationship and narrow genetic background.

 <italic>Psophocarpus tetragonolobus</italic> by producing a 
 <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly and annotation of two Sri Lankan accessions (denoted herein as CPP34 [PI 491423] and CPP37 [PI 639033]), developing simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between geographically separated genotypes [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another transcriptomic study was done on seedling from winged bean (Ibadan Local-1) and identified around 1900 microsatellites and around 1800 conserved orthologous loci [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], also Wong et al. sequenced transcriptomes of plants from Malaysia and found 9682 SSR markers, among which 18 were validated for nine accessions [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01730" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], these sets of microsatellite markers could be used to contribute to genetic linkage maps in winged bean, with the integration of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers for higher density.
