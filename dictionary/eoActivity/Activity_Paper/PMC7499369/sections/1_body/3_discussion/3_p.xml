<p id="p0090">Owing to environmental and other oxidative stress, plants produce secondary metabolites that decrease the production of free radicals and helps in the protection of cellular damage due to oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Kasote et al., 2015</xref>). These secondary metabolites are most commonly polyphenolic compounds including flavonoids. The polyphenolic compounds exhibit antioxidant potential by reducing the level of reactive oxygen species and prevents lipid peroxidation (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Ghasemzadeh and Ghasemzadeh, 2011</xref>). Previous studies revealed that the presence of polyphenolic compounds in plant extracts have promising antioxidant activity to neutralize free radicals (

 <italic>T. articulata has</italic> abundant total phenolic as well as flavonoid content. Most importantly, among all four methanolic extracts, methanolic extract of dry leaves possesses the highest amount of total phenolic (409.92 ± 4.21 mg GAE/gDW) as well as flavonoid content (177.71 ± 3.76 mg QE/gDW). The considerably higher phenolic and flavonoid content in dry leaves reflect a greater ability to neutralize free radicals. However, when subjected to analyze the antioxidant potential of all methanolic extracts of T. 
 <italic>articulata,</italic> all the four extracts exhibit significant antioxidant activity, nonetheless, methanolic extract of dry leaves displays the highest antioxidant activity and exhibit IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 49.08 ± 1.98 followed by methanolic extract of root 49.13 ± 1.46.
