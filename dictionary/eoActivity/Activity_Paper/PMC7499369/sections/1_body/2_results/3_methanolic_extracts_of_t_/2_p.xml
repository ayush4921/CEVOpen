<p id="p0075">The antibacterial activity of all methanolic extracts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> was determined by using a well-known well-diffusion method. As summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, the methanolic extracts of different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> were significantly active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. The highest antimicrobial activity was exhibited by methanolic extract of dry leaves of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> (5 mg/ml) against both Gram-negative bacteria exhibit zone of inhibition (20.1 ± 0.30 mm, 19.9 ± 0.18 mm, 18.1 ± 0.18 mm against P. 
 <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, K. 
 <italic>pneumonia</italic>, E. 
 <italic>coli</italic>) and Gram-positive bacteria (22.7 ± 0.23 mm, 25. 3 ± 0.34 mm, 19.4 ± 0.12 mm against S. 
 <italic>aureus</italic>, S. 
 <italic>epidermidis</italic>, S. 
 <italic>pneumonia</italic>) respectively.
