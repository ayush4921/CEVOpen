<p id="p0080">To evaluate the antiproliferative effect of methanolic extracts of different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic>, cancer cells (MCF-7 and RKO cells) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium and exposed to increasing (100–10000 µM) concentrations of methanolic extracts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> for 24 h. As confirmed (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a and b), all the four methanolic extracts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> reduces the cell viability of both MCF-7 and RKO cells as the concentrations increase above 100 µM and the effect is significant above 200 µM concentrations of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic>. Using GraphPad Prism the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of all the methanolic extracts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> on MCF-7 cells are (fresh leaves-220 ± 5.243 µg/ml, dry leaves-219 ± 5.112 µg/ml, stem-220 ± 5.643 µg/ml, root-253 ± 5.231 µg/ml) and RKO cells are (fresh laves-225 ± 2.39 µg/ml, dry leaves-220 ± 4.330 µg/ml, stem-266 ± 5.120 µg/ml, root-325 ± 6.213 µg/ml). Although the results reveal that all the extracts show promising antiproliferative activity against tumor cells, however, the methanolic extract of dry leaves exhibit maximum antiproliferative effect against both breast cancer (MCF-7) and colorectal cancer (RKO) cells.
