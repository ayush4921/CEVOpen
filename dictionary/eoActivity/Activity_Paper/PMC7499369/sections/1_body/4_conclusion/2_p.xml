<p id="p0105">T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> is one of the most abundant wild plants growing in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. Our results demonstrated for the first time the biological activities of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> and showed promising antioxidant activity, which was strongly supported by total phenolic and flavonoid content. The antimicrobial activity was also exhibited by all the methanolic extracts against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria significantly. Furthermore
 <italic>,</italic> all the methanolic extracts exhibit antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 (breast cancer) and RKO (colorectal cancer). In summary, these findings provide evidence that T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> has promising biological activities and can be used for many pharmaceutical activities in the future.
