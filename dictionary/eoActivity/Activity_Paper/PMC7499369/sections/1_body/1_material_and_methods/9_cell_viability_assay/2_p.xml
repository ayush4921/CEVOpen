<p id="p0055">The proliferation of cells was analyzed by MTT assay as per the standard protocol (
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Rah et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, MCF-7 and RKO cells were processed for trypsinization and plated at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells per well of 96-well plate. The cells seeded in triplicates were treated with varying concentrations of different extracts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> (100–10000 µg/ml) and control DMSO for 24 h, incubated in an incubator containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, cells were saturated with MTT dye (2.5 mg/ml) for 3 h at 37 
 <sup>◦</sup>C. The crystals formed of formazan were solubilized in DMSO, mixed properly by vortex and the optical density was measured at 570 nm by multi-plate reader. The percentage of cell proliferation was analyzed as the percent cell viability of treated cells compared with the control of DMSO cells.
