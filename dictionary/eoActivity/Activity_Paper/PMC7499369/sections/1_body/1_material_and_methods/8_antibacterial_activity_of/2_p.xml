 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">Ahmad and Beg, 2001</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Ramesh et al., 2002</xref>). Briefly, 0.1 ml of bacterial inoculum (10
 <sup>5</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/ml), was inoculated with a sterile cotton swab on plates containing Muller Hinton agar. 8.0 mm wells were made by punching into the solidified agar medium plate and seal the bottom of well with sterile melted agar. Add 100 µl extract (2.5 and 5 mg/ml) in each well separately, along with solvent blank (95% methanol) and positive controls (gentamycin and ampicillin). Incubate plates overnight at 37 °C. The next day the antibacterial activity was analyzed by measuring the zone of inhibition of different concentrations against the test organism. The entire set of experiments was conducted in triplicates.
