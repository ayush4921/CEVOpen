<p id="p0020">Methanolic extracts were prepared as per standard protocol (
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Wannes et al., 2010</xref>). The different parts of T. 
 <italic>articulata</italic> were completely air-dried; the fine powder was obtained after grinding 100 g of each plant part (fresh leaves, dry leaves, stem, and root) in a kitchen blender. 12 g of each part was weighed, dissolved in 100% methanol, and were constantly stirring at room temperature for 3 days. Mixtures obtained were filtered through Whatman filter paper in a clean autoclaved glass beaker. The solvent was evaporated completely to get a fine powder of residue. The residue powder was stored at 4 °C and dissolved in 90% methanol for further experiments to evaluate the biological activities of the various residues of different parts of T.
