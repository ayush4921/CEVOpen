<p>Several of the decoctions tested in this study displayed noteworthy inhibition of MS2 phage replication, with the 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction being the most potent (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 427 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). This may indicate that this decoction would be particularly useful in treating gastrointestinal diseases caused by viral pathogens such as 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic>. These results compare favourably to other studies, which have reported antiviral activity using MS2 assays. An earlier study from our group reported comparable inhibitory activity for 
 <italic>Scaevola spinescens</italic> R.Br. against the same virus and classified it as strong antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Notably, that study used 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> (L.) Kuntze as the positive control and reported a substantially lower anti-MS2 phage activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Our study chose to screen the decoctions against the MS2 bacteriophage as a model for viral pathogens. Whilst this virus has previously been reported to be a good model to indicate activity against RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we did not screen the decoctions against specific human viral pathogens, and further work is required to confirm the potential of these decoctions in treating viral gastrointestinal pathogens.
