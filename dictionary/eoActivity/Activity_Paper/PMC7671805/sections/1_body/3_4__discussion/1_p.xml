<p>Recent increases in the rates of microbial resistance to clinically used antibiotics have rendered many frontline treatments to be ineffective against pathogenic diseases. This is particularly true for diarrhoea-causing pathogens. The gastrointestinal system is an ideal environment not only for microbial growth but also for the exchange of genetic information between different microbial strains, and even between different species. When a pathogen in this environment possesses antibiotic resistance genes, it can readily exchange those genes with other microbes, and individual pathogens can accumulate resistance to multiple conventional antibiotics. There is an urgent need to develop new antibiotic therapies to treat diseases caused by these pathogens. For reasons reviewed elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the previous methods of antibiotic discovery are unlikely to yield many new antibiotics in the future, and medical science must explore new methods to treat pathogenic diseases. A reexamination of traditional medicine is an attractive option as many traditional medicines have been used effectively for hundreds or even thousands of years. Furthermore, this use has often been well documented, allowing for selection of traditional therapies for screening. Indeed, there has been a significant increase in published studies into traditional herbal therapies to treat pathogenic diseases in most regions of the world. In contrast, the traditional remedies used by the first Australians have been relatively neglected. This may be due to a less extensive reporting of Australian Aboriginal traditional remedies, which hampers studies based on directed species selection. However, the use of plant-based medicines by some groups of first Australians, including the tribes inhabiting Groote Eylandt, has been more extensively reported, allowing for more directed studies.
