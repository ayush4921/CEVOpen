<p>Whilst the MIC values reported in our study are noteworthy and validate the use of these plants for the treatment of bacterial diarrhoea, substantially higher MIC values are reported compared to several other Australian native plants. In particular, 
 <italic>Terminalia ferdinandiana</italic> Excell. fruit and leaf extracts have been reported to have substantially lower MIC values against some gastrointestinal and diarrhoea-causing bacterial pathogens, with MIC values as low as 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL against some species [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, the 
 <italic>T. ferdinandiana</italic> extracts were not only inhibitory against susceptible reference strains of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> but also had similar potency against extended spectrum beta-lactamase and methicillin-resistant strains, indicating that the extracts may function by distinct pathways, allowing them to bypass the bacterial resistance mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. That study identified a diversity and relative abundance of tannins, flavonoids, and terpenoids in the extracts and deduced that they contribute to their antibacterial activity. The phytochemical constituents of the decoctions tested in our study are yet to be evaluated, and future studies are planned to assess this. Furthermore, further work is required to determine whether the decoctions tested in our study are also inhibitory towards resistant bacterial pathogens.
