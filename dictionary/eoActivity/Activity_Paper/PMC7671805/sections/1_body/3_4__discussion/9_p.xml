<p>The findings reported here also show that none of the decoctions displayed significant toxicity towards 
 <italic>A. franciscana</italic> or HDFs. Whilst this indicates that these decoctions are safe to use therapeutically, further toxicity studies using other human cell lines are needed to further evaluate the suitability of the decoctions for medicinal purposes. The results of this study indicate that all the decoctions screened in this report are worthy of further study due to their antipathogenic activities and their abilities to block cancer cell proliferation.
