<p>All decoctions were tested against 2 cancer cell lines (Caco2 human colorectal carcinoma cells, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>; HeLa human cervical cancer cells, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(b)</xref>) to determine their effects on cell proliferation. The Caco2 cell line was selected as it is a colorectal line and thus is consistent with intestinal disease. The HeLa cells were chosen as a comparison as they are well studied and allow for comparisons with other reports. Interestingly, with the exception of 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic>, all of the decoctions significantly inhibited the proliferation of both Caco2 and HeLa carcinoma cells compared to the proliferation of the untreated cells. 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> was a particularly strong inhibitor of Caco2 growth, inhibiting proliferation by approximately 80% compared to the untreated control cell growth (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(a)</xref>). All the other decoctions (except 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic>) also significantly inhibited Caco2 proliferation, albeit by substantially lower levels (15–30%). However, it is noteworthy that the 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was substantially more concentrated than the other preparations, and this may account for its higher apparent activity. Inhibition of Caco2 growth by the 
 <italic>T. carpentariae</italic> decoction was dose-dependent, and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 885 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL was determined by screening the decoction across a range of doses. We were unable to determine the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of any of the other preparations against Caco2 as the cell proliferation did not decrease below 50% at any concentration tested.
