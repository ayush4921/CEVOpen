<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that nearly nine million children under the age of five die every year as a result of diarrhoea [

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This translates into more than 1400 young children dying each day, or about 530,000 children a year. To exacerbate this problem, many bacteria have developed resistance to conventional antibiotics, rendering them of little use against some diarrhoea-causing pathogens [
