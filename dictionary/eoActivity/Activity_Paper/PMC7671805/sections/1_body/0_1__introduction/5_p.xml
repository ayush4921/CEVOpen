<p>Six plant species were selected for screening in our study, based on their ethnobotanical used. 
 <italic>Buchanania obovata</italic> Engl. (family Anacardiaceae; commonly known as green plum and wild mango) is a small- to medium-sized tree native to the northern regions of the Northern Territory, Australia [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It produces small (1–1.5 cm diameter) fleshy green fruit that are high in antioxidants. As well as being considered as nutritious food, the First Australians used 
 <italic>B. obovata</italic> as a bacteriocide to treat skin diseases and as a wound antiseptic, as well as for treating eye infections and diarrhoea [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. 
 <italic>Casuarina equisetifolia</italic> L. (family Casuarinaceae; commonly known as whistling tree and Australian pine tree) is native to northern regions of Australia, as well as Papua New Guinea, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Its leaves and inner cambium are used as traditional antiseptics on Groote Eylandt [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>Eucalyptus tetrodonta</italic> F. Muell. (family Myrtaceae; commonly known as Darwin stringybark and messmate) was also selected due to its traditional use as an antiseptic and to treat diarrhoea [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is a medium-sized tree with rough fibrous bark. Several parts of the tree, including the inner bark, leaves, and kinos have been used traditionally as antibacterial medicines [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. 
 <italic>Planchonia careya</italic> (F. Muell.) R. Knuth. (family Lecythidaceae; commonly known as cocky apple and cockatoo apple) produces edible fruit that were prized by the First Australians. The cambium layer inside the bark and the leaves were used as medicines to treat skin diseases and diarrhoea [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The outer bark and the roots were also used as fish poison, indicating that they may also be useful in blocking cancer cell proliferation. 
 <italic>Terminalia carpentariae</italic> C. T. White (family Combretaceae; commonly known as wild peach) is a small tree native to coastal regions of northern Australia. The edible fruit of this species have high antioxidant contents. The fruit, inner bark, and leaves were traditionally used to treat skin diseases and diarrhoea [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly
 <italic>, Vigna vexillata</italic> (L.) A. Rich. (family Fabaceae; commonly known as wild cowpea) is a climbing plant with a wide distribution. It is native to tropical regions globally, including northern regions of Australia. The root is used as food, whilst the cambium layer and the leaves are used to treat skin disorders and diarrhoea by Groote Eylandt Aborigines [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The ethnobotanical uses of these plants indicate that they are good candidates for screening studies. Despite these, there are few reports confirming the bioactivities of these plants, and those studies that have been published invariably report on the activity of solvent extracts or essential oils. Studies testing these plants the way that they were originally used do not yet exist.
