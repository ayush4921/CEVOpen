<p>Despite being one of the oldest continuous civilisations globally, far less information is available describing the ethnobotany of the First Australians than for many other ethnic groups globally. The First Australians had a good understanding of the medicinal properties of Australian plants and had used them successfully for at least 50,000 years to treat a variety of illnesses. However, little of this information has been recorded as the First Australians did not have a written language. Instead, traditional knowledge was passed between generations orally, and most ethnobotanical texts have collated data from the perspective of European settlers. As a result, substantial ethnobotanical information has been irretrievably lost. Furthermore, many of the seminal texts that summarise Aboriginal plant usage are old and difficult to access, taxonomic classifications are outdated and often dubious, and the information is incomplete. Compounding the problem, the First Australians consist of diverse groups, with individual communities having their own language, culture, customs, and belief systems, as well as their own traditional knowledge. Members of one language group were generally unable to communicate effectively with other groups. Within the language groupings, the First Australians are further divided into local groupings, which often had regional dialects, further complicating communication. Furthermore, many of the First Australian groups lived in isolation from other groups. As such, exchange of knowledge between groups was often not viable. Additionally, Torres Strait Islanders have distinct heritage from the Aborigines, with substantially different customs and traditional knowledge. Thus, plants used traditionally by one group of First Australians may not have been used for the same purposes by other groups. Despite this relative dearth of rigorous ethnobotanical studies on Australian flora, several studies have identified plant species with noteworthy antimicrobial activity. In particular, the ethnobotany of the inhabitants of Groote Eylandt has been relatively well recorded, allowing for selection of relevant species to treat microbial pathogens [
