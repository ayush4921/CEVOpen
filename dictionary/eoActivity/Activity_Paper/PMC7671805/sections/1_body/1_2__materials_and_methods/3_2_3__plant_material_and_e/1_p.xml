<p>Gayangwa Lalara and Gwen Lalara, elders of the Warnindhilyagwa tribe on Groote Eylandt, were consulted to identify local plant species that were traditionally used to treat gastrointestinal diseases by the Warnindhilyagwa people.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(c)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(d)</xref>) used in these studies. The plant species highlighted and collected on Groote Eylandt were initially identified by the tribe elders involved in the collection. High-definition photographs were taken of the entire plant as well as various morphological features (leaves, flowers, etc.) for confirmation identity. Additionally, further samples were collected for identification purposes. The identity of each species was later confirmed by botanists at the Darwin Botanical Gardens from the collected material and the photographs. Voucher specimens of all collected species are stored in the School of Environment and Science, Griffith University. All decoctions were prepared by traditional methods immediately after harvesting. The traditional preparation method was the same for all the collected materials or each plant material. Trunks of immature plant specimens were cut, and the outer bark was scraped away with a knife. The inner cambium layers were carefully collected and processed separately. The cambium of each species was pounded with the inner wood from which it was removed to soften it for extraction, and the cambium was teased apart into strands by hand to increase the surface area for extraction. Each of the plant materials was placed into individual bowls, and enough deionised water was added to just cover the plant material. The plant material was allowed to extract for an hour, and the decoction was decanted from the cambium into clean plastic bottles. The bottles were stored on ice for transport to the laboratory where they were filtered through Whatman No. 54 filter paper under vacuum. Aliquots (1 mL) of each decoction were dried in preweighed 1.5 mL microfuge tubes to determine the mass of extracted plant material/mL of decoction. The remaining aliquots of each extract were stored at −30°C until use.
