<p>The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts was also determined by disc diffusion assays following the methods of Rabadeaux et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] across a range of doses, and graphs of the zone of inhibition versus the natural log of the concentration were used to calculate the MIC values of each extract.
