<p>The antimicrobial activity of all the plant extracts was initially determined using a modified disc diffusion method [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, bacterial cultures were grown in nutrient broth until they reached a count of approximately 10
 <sup>8</sup> cells/mL; then, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each suspension was spread uniformly onto individual agar plates. The extracts were screened for antibacterial activity by applying 6 mm sterilised filter paper discs infused with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the test sample onto the agar surface and incubating for 24 hours at 37°C. Following incubation, the diameters of the inhibition zones were measured to the closest whole millimetre. Each antimicrobial assay was performed three times in triplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9), and mean values were determined. Standard discs of ampicillin (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g) and chloramphenicol (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g) served as positive controls. Discs infused with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of distilled water were included as negative controls.
