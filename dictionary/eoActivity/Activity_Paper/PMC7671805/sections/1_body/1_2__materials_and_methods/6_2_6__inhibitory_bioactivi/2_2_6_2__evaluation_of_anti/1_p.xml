<p>Anti-Giardial activity was determined as previously described [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Briefly, 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the test extracts or the vehicle solvent or culture media (for the negative controls) was added to trophozoite suspensions (70 
 <italic>μ</italic>L containing approximately 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> trophozoites) in 96-well plates. The plates were incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 12 h in a humidified anaerobic atmosphere. CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay Reagent (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L; Promega) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for further 3 h. The absorbances were recorded at 490 nm using a Molecular Devices, SpectraMax M3 plate reader. All tests were performed three times in triplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9). The antiproliferative activity of each test was expressed as a percentage of the negative untreated control.
