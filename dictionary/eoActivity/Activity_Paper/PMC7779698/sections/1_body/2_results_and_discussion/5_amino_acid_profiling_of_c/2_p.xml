<p id="p0130">The 
 <italic>C. cristata</italic> inflorescences were analyzed for the composition of various “essential” and non-“essential” amino-acids. The results of the study are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. As can be depicted clearly from 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, twelve amino- acids were detected and quantified which included 10 essential and two non-essential (alanine and proline) amino acids. Among essential amino- acids, tryptophan (precursor of serotonin synthesis) was found in appreciable amounts (26.29mg/100g) in the sample followed by L- arginine and threonine at a concentration of 22.43 mg/100g and 19.08 mg/100g respectively. Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) i.e., leucine, isoleucine and valine were found in moderate amounts. These benefit muscle growth by stimulating protein synthesis and decreasing muscle fatigue. Methionine exhibited the lowest concentration of 0.79 mg/100g. Alanine and proline were the two non-essential amino acids found in the sample. All of these amino acids are required by the body to regulate hormonal secretion and act as ergogenic aids.
