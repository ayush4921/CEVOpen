<p id="p0150">Transition metals are considered to be very active pro-oxidants that catalyze oxidative reactions resulting in ROS generation. Furthermore, these metal ions, particularly ferrous ions, affect the taste and flavor of food systems thereby causing deterioration. The reactivity of such metals can be inhibited by chelators that offer antioxidative effects by eliminating the possibility of endogenous metals to participate in redox reactions. The

 <sup>2+</sup> complex disrupted in presence of metal chelators. The study revealed that metal chelating ability of the extract increased with increasing concentration and was 81.07% at highest concentration (1000 μg/ml). This implies that extract is capable of preventing generation of free radicals and thereby preserving the aesthetic value of food. The metal-binding property may be due to polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids such as kaempferol and quercetin present in the flower. These have been demonstrated to be capable of complexing Fe

Oxidation of lipids is an accumulated effect of ROS that attack the lipids and lipid containing molecules such as lipoproteins resulting in their oxidative deterioration. These ROS mostly attack polyunsaturated fatty acids where activated methylene bridges are the critical target sites, generating lipid peroxides. LP results in development of rancidity and off-flavors in fatty foods and oils. The consequences of lipid peroxidation (LP) are severe and are linked to various disorders including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The study reveals that the CCF extract inhibited LP in dose- dependent manner ranging from 53.35% to 76.10%. Previous reports suggest that phenolic compounds present in plant extracts are responsible for suppressing LP though various mechanisms (
