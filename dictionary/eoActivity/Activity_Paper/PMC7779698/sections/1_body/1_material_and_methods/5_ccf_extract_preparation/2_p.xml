<p id="p0035">The CCF was first dried using traditional drying technique. The cleaned flowers excluding seeds were hung upside down in bunch and shade dried under the roof so as to retain the biologically active ingredients. The dried CCF was subjected to pulverization to obtain finely ground powder. This powdered CCF was extracted with 70% ethanol (v/v) at room temperature (27 °C) in dark for 24 h. The extraction was carried twice and the combined extracts were filtered through Whatman No. 1 and centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was concentrated under vacuum in rotary vacuum evaporator (HAHNSHIN, South Korea) at 35 °C. The resulting extract was stored at 4 °C until use.</p>
