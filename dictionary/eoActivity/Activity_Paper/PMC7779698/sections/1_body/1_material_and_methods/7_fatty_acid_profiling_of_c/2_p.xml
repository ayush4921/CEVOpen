 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">AOAC Method 996:06 (2001)</xref> was adopted for extraction of sample for fatty acids analysis, followed by their methylation to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) using methanolic boron trifluoride (BF
 <sub>3</sub>) as an acid catalyst. FAMEs were measured quantitatively by a Gas Chromatograph, GC-FID (Agilent 6890 N, Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). A DB-23 column (30 m × 0.25 mm i. d., 0.25μm, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA) containing 23% methylpolysiloxane was used as stationary phase for fatty acid analysis. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas.
