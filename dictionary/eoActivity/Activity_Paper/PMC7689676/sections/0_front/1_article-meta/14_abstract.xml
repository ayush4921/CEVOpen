 <p>BGR-34 is a polyherbal formulation frequently used to combat diabetes around the globe especially in Asian countries. It provides an attractive treatment option to prediabetics, diabetics, and in metabolic disorders by controlling the altered blood glucose level. The lack of phytopharmacological studies on BGR-34 prompted as to reveal the compounds responsible for the antidiabetic and free-radical scavenging activity of BGR-34. An attempt was made to assess 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition of BGR-34 along with its free-radical scavenging potential via DPPH scavenging activity. Further, HPTLC profiling and quantitative analysis of berberine and palmatine in BGR-34 were carried out. Thereafter, the TLC-bioautographic-MS analysis was performed to identify the compounds responsible for antidiabetic and antioxidant activities in BGR-34. The results had shown a significant and dose-dependent inhibition potential of BGR-34 against 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymatic reactions along with significant inhibition in DPPH free-radical scavenging activity. The HPTLC profiling and quantitative validation studies showed the presence of berberine and palmatine 44.926 ± 0.2907 and 10.507 ± 0.154 μg/g, respectively. The TLC-MS bioautography revealed a total of four DPPH-active, two α-amylase-active, and nine α-glucosidase-active compounds in BGR-34. It was observed from the study that BGR-34 possesses verities of bioactive compounds, which are reasonable not only for its antidiabetic effect but also for its antioxidant activity.
