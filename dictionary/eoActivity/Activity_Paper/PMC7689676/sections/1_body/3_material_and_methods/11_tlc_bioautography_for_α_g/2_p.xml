<p>Bioautographic-based determination of α-glucosidase active compounds was identified as per the protocol with some modification.

 </sup> Briefly, a stock solution of α-glucosidase (100 U) was prepared in 10 mL of sodium acetate buffer solution and the stock solution was kept at 4 °C. Thereafter, the sample was applied and developed in solvent system; after drying it was separated in two halves from mid as above. The developed plate was then dipped in a prepared enzyme solution and incubated for 1–2 h in a humid desiccator containing a little amount of enough water inside the chamber so that the plate should not come in contact with water but enough to maintain the humid environment inside the chamber. After the incubation period, the TLC plate was further dipped in the mixture of 2-naphthyl-α-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (2 mg/mL) and Fast-Blue B salt solution (2.5 mg/mL) in a ratio of 1: 1 as the substrate for enzyme and substrate reaction and incubated for 2 h for completion of the reaction. Glucosidase activity was visible on the TLC plate by the appearance of the white spot on a purple/violet background, and the images were captured of developed bioautogram.
