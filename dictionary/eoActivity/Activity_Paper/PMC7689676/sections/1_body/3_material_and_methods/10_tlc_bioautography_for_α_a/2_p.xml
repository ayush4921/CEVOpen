 </sup> Briefly, a stock solution of α-amylase (10 mg) was prepared in 20 mL of sodium acetate buffer solution and the stock solution was kept at 4 °C. Thereafter, after the sample was applied, it was developed and separated on two halves as above. The developed plate half portion was then dipped in a prepared enzyme solution and incubated for 1.5 h in a humid desiccator containing a little amount of enough water inside the chamber so that the plate should not come in contact with water but enough to maintain the humid environment inside the chamber. After the incubation period, the plate was dipped in 1% of the starch solution as substrate and further incubated for 20–30 min for enzyme and substrate reaction. Finally, the plate was dipped in Gram’s iodine solution and the α-amylase activity was visible on the TLC plate by the appearance of the violet spot on a dark brown color background and then images were captured of developed bioautogram.
