 </sup> An amount 20 μL of the sample from each batch was mixed with 180 μL of DPPH solution in methanol (0.01 mM) solution in each defined well of 96-well plates. The obtained mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a relatively dark place, and then absorbance was read using a spectrophotometer at 517 nm. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control and considered the efficacy of BGR-34 in the proportion of ascorbic acid. The % scavenging curve was plotted against the extract concentration and their respective IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. DPPH scavenging effect was calculated using the following equation
