<p>A 30 mg amounts of each extract were dissolved individually in HPLC grade methanol and then filtered using a PTFE membrane filter of 0.2 μM. Further, from the stock solution, berberine and palmatine were mixed so that the final concentration of berberine and palmatine was obtained 0.5 mg/mL. Thereafter, with the help of Camag Linomat-V (CAMAG, Switzerland), 6 μL of the sample from each of BGR-34 was applied individually with a 6 mm wide-band length to prewashed and activated Silica gel 60 F254 precoated HPTLC plates (20 × 10 cm; Merck, Germany) with the nitrogen flow providing a delivery speed of 150 nL/s. The TLC plate was developed in a presaturated TLC development chamber containing 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol:water:glacial acetic acid (6:3:1, v/v/v) as a solvent system. The plates were prepared in duplicate and developed to a distance of 7.5 cm at room temperature (25 °C). After drying the spots on the developed plates, one was visualized under visible (white), short UV (254 nm), and long UV (366 nm) light. The other plate was sprayed with anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent and heated for 5 min for color reaction and visualized at 540 nm. The quantification of berberine and palmatine was carried out at 366 nm using a Camag TLC scanner III using Wincats1.2.3 software.
