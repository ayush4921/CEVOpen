<p>The obtained sample from the bioautographic assay, MS analysis, was coupled to identify the active metabolite based on their molecular mass as obtained from spectral data. The MS was performed on a Water’s ACQUITY UPLC (TM) system (Waters Corp., MA, USA) equipped with a binary solvent delivery system, an auto-sampler, column manager, and a tunable MS detector operated through Empower software (Waters, Manchester, UK). For optimum chromatographic separation, acetonitrile (A) and water (B) were run on a monolithic capillary silica-based C18 column (ACQUITY UPLC(R) BEH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm). The flow rate of the nebulizer gas was set at 500 L/h; for cone gas, it was set at 50 L/h, and the source temperature was fixed at 100 °C. The capillary and cone voltage was set at 3.0 and 40 KV, respectively. For collision, argon was employed at a pressure of 5.3 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup> torr. The obtained spectral data from MS was processed by Mass Lynx V4.1 (Waters, USA) and further used for metabolomics analysis of the samples. Separated metabolites present in different samples were tentatively identified based on their
