<p>The gift sample of the BGR-34 was obtained from AIMIL Pharmaceutical Ltd. Thirteen tablet each (three batches) was powdered and processed for the extraction by the maceration process for 6 h at room temperature using 100 mL of methanol as a solvent. Then, the contents were filtered, and the filtrates were dried on a water bath at 50 °C temperature. After completion of the extraction, the extractive value of each sample was calculated and the residue were stored in a suitable container for further analysis at −20 °C.
