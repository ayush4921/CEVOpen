<p>TLC-bioautographic-based determinations of DPPH free-radical scavenging active compounds were identified as per the protocol with some modifications.

 </sup> A stock solution of DPPH (5 mM) was prepared in methanol, and the stock solution was kept at 4 °C. Further, the methanolic extract of BGR-34 6 μL was applied in duplicate to a TLC plate G
 <sub>60</sub> F
 <sub>254</sub> at a distance of 15 mm using Camag Linomat automatic sample applicator. The plate was developed in a TLC development chamber containing 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol:water:glacial acetic acid (6:3:1, v/v/v) as a solvent system. Thereafter, the developed TLC plate was dried and cut from mid to separate both the tracks. Further, half of plate was sprayed/dipped in methanolic solution of DPPH. The yellowish color bands appeared against the purple background, indicating that the bands are active as an antioxidant.
