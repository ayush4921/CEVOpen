<p>The α-amylase is a calcium-containing metalloenzyme that breaks down the α-1,4 linkages of polysaccharide to monosaccharide in the oral cavity. The imbalanced cellular carbohydrate and lipid metabolism can cause an increase in the postprandial blood glucose level, which eventually leads to the onset and progression of T2DM.

 </sup> Therefore, it is important to find natural alternatives to drugs that can inhibit α-amylase. Amylase-inhibitory potential of different batches of BGR-34 had shown significant dose-dependent inhibition with an average inhibition of 88.31% ± 2.53 at the concentration of 1000 μg/mL and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 45.65 ± 1.855 μg/mL, whereas acarbose, which was used as a positive control, showed a 56.5 ± 0.27% inhibition at the concentration of 1000 μg/mL and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 775.27 ± 3.44 μg/mL. The measurement was taken in triplicate for three different batches, and average reading is presented. BGR-34 was found to possess the significant α-amylase inhibitory property with

 <italic>p</italic>-value (one-tailed) 0.0006. The average percentage of amylase inhibition of different samples of BGR-34 at different concentrations (μg/mL) is shown in

 </xref>. Hence, the study supports that α-amylase inhibition potential of the methanolic extract of BGR-34 found more efficient and significant than acarbose.
