 </sup> The Î±-amylase inhibitors block or slows down the absorption of starch into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) mainly by blocking the hydrolysis of 1,4-glycosidic linkages of starch and other oligosaccharides into maltose and other simple sugars.

 </sup> Diabetes-induced oxidative stress occurs as a result of slow progress in the treatment of diabetes due to the formation of free radicals generated through glucose oxidation and the subsequent oxidative degradation of glycated proteins in the body. Therefore, the phenol, flavonoid, and alkaloid compounds are frequently recommended avoiding such complications.
