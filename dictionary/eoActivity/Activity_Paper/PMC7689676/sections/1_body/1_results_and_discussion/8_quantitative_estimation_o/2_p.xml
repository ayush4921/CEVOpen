<p>For the quantitative estimation of berberine and Palmatine, a presample-applied HPTLC plate was developed in a development chamber containing 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol:water:glacial acetic acid (6:3:1, v/v/v) as a solvent system and densitometry scanning was performed at 366 nm. The developed method for berberine and palmatine was linear, ranging from 100 to 4000 ng for both with regression coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) 0.999 and 0.998, respectively. The limit of detections (LODs) of the developed method for berberine and palmatine were 12.0 and 12.7 ng/spot, whereas the limit of quantifications (LOQs) were 36.3 and 38.4 ng/spot, respectively. The percentage accuracy values of the developed method for berberine and palmatine were 99.71–100.13% and 99.36–100.6%, respectively. The average quantity of berberine and palmatine in all three batches was found to be 44.926 ± 0.2907 and 10.507 ± 0.154 μg/g, respectively. The HPTLC plate and their chromatogram are shown in
