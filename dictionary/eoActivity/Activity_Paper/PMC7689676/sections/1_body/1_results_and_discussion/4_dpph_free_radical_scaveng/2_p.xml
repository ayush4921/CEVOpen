<p>The varieties of phytochemicals present in BGR-34 are contributed to exert antioxidant activity. The free-radical scavenging activity of different batches of BGR-34 methanolic extract on DPPH radicals has shown significant and dose-dependent inhibitory potential with average inhibition of 64.18 ± 2.60% at the higher concentration of 1000 μg/mL with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 677.69 ± 2.29 μg/mL. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control, which showed an average inhibition of 99.35 ± 1.97% at the concentration of 1000 μg/mL with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 80.07 ± 2.15 μg/mL. BGR-34 was found to possess statistically significant antioxidant properties with
