<p>Polyphenols are one of the key factors that play a crucial role in the management of diabetes by regulating postprandial blood glucose levels and protection against the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Further, the author claims that the antioxidant effect of polyphenols enhances insulin sensitivity and catalytic activity in glucose phosphorylation, which are considered as core alternatives in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Polyphenol-rich medicinal herbs/foods inhibit insulin resistance and pancreatic Î²-cell damage induced by oxidative stress (ROS/RSN) resulting in prevention from the progression of T2DM. Similarly, in our findings, BGR-34 possesses a high content of phenol and flavonoid, which acts as a factor to exert an antioxidant and antidiabetic effect.
