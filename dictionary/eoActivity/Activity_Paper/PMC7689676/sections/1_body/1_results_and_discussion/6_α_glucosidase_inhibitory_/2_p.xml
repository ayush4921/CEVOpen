<p>The α-glucosidase enzyme can significantly increase the postprandial blood glucose in type-2 diabetes patients. Therefore, α-glucosidase inhibitors regulate postprandial hyperglycemia by delaying carbohydrate absorption.

 </sup> BGR-34 is the most credible natural and alternative therapy that has an immense potential against the α-glucosidase activity. The present study was conducted to evaluate the inhibitory potential of BGR-34 against α-glucosidase activity. The results show a significant dose-dependent inhibitory potential with an average inhibition of 84.05 ± 2.33% at the concentration of 1000 μg/mL and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of value 136.35 ± 2.35 μg/mL, whereas acarbose showed 46.5 ± 0.53% inhibition at the concentration of 1000 μg/mL. The mean values of three different batches (
 <italic>n</italic> = 9) are presented. BGR-34 was found to possess the significant α-glucosidase inhibitory property with 
 <italic>P</italic>-value summary*** and 
 <italic>P</italic>-value (one-tailed) &lt;0.0001. The average percentage of α-glucosidase inhibition of different samples of BGR-34 at different concentrations (μg/mL) is shown in

 </xref>. Hence, the study suggests that α-glucosidase inhibition potential of BGR-34 is more efficient and significant than acarbose.
