 </sup> Phenolic compounds such as vanillic acid and ellagic acid and kaempferol 7-O-glucoside were also detected as α-glucosidase inhibitors and also considered as a strong candidate for antidiabetic and antioxidant activity. These compounds lead to strong credentials of α-glucosidase inhibitors and a natural approach to treat diabetes.

 </sup> Ishaq et al. reported that flavonoid such as isorhamnetin ameliorates the hyperglycemic effect through its α-glucosidase inhibitory potential and antioxidative stress potential also.
