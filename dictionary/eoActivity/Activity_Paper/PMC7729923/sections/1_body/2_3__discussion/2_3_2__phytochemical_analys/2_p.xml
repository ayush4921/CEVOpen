<p>The phytochemical analyses performed by us have demonstrated that biosynthetic profile of cells from in vitro cultures is different as compared to those of parent plant grown in vivo. Iridoids (verbenalin and hastatoside) dominate quantitatively in the herb of the plant. Quite large amounts of phenylpropanoid glycosides (verbascoside and isoverbascoside) and moderate amounts of phenolic acids and flavonoids were also found.</p>
