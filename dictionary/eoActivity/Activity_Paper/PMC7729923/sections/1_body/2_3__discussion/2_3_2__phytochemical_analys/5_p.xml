<p>In the present work, high amounts of verbascoside were obtained in the agar callus cultures (max. 7248.66 mg/100 g DW), suspension cultures (max. 7059.37 mg/100 g DW), BB bioreactor (max. 7685.00 mg/100 g DW), and extremely high in the STB bioreactor (max. 9176.87 mg/100 g DW). Cultures were maintained in 14 days growth cycles which gives us the specific productivity 120.49, 74.36, 104.39 and 115.20 mg/L/day, respectively (

The amounts of this metabolite were, respectively, 3.2, 3.1, 3,4 and 4.1 times higher than its maximum concentration in the soil-grown parent plant (2263.85 mg/100 g DW). The amounts of isoverbascoside were also significant: max. 609.26 mg/100 g DW (specific productivity 10.13 mg/L/day) in the agar callus cultures, max. 477.25 mg/100 g DW (4.85 mg/L/day) in the suspension cultures, max. 306.40 mg/100 g DW (4.16 mg/L/day) in the BB bioreactor, and max. 339.91 mg/100 g DW (4.27 mg/L/day) in the STB bioreactor. The total amounts of verbascoside and isoverbascoside obtained in both suspension (7446.56 mg/100 g DW) and bioreactor (BB—7991.4 mg/100 g DW, STB—9516.79 mg/100 g DW) cultures are very high (
