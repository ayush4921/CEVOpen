<p>The secondary metabolism pathways that are dominant in the cells of in vitro cultured biomass are shikimate and cinnamate pathways leading to the formation of verbascoside and, to a lesser extent, isoverbascoside. Cell culture extracts were also found to have a phenolic acid profile comparable to that of the parent plant grown in vivo. The maximum amounts of phenylpropanoid glycosides obtained in cell cultures exceeded the values recorded for parent plant material. These results suggest that tissue differentiation in 
 <italic>Verbena</italic> does not favour the accumulation of verbascoside and isoverbascoside. On the other hand, iridoids were absent in embryogenic calli and suspension cultures of vervain. These observations are in agreement with other studies. Sesterhenn et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] demonstrated that callus cultures of 
 <italic>Scrophularia nodosa</italic> were devoid of iridoids which are otherwise abundant in organized biomass of the species. Another example is the study by GrÄ…bkowska et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] which showed that tissue dedifferentiation in 
 <italic>Harpagophytum procumbens</italic> in vitro cultures is positively correlated with verbascoside content and negatively correlated with the production of iridoids. The ability of non-organized cultures to accumulate verbascoside was also documented in the study on callus and suspension cultures of 
 <italic>Scrophularia striata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B34-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
