<p>In the all tested types of in vitro cultures, identified metabolites were the same. The cells cultured in vitro produced primarily verbascoside and isoverbascoside, and lower amounts of phenolic acids. The amounts of these metabolites varied between the types of tested cultures. Noteworthy is the extremely high production of verbascoside in STB. Moreover, in this system, isoverbasoside production was also high, and the accumulation of phenolic acids was sufficient. The biomass increments in this system were about 5 times in two weeks, which is very good result from a biotechnological point of view.</p>
