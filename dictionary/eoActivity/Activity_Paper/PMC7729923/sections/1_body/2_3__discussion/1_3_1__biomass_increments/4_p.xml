<p>After the suspension cultures of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> had been established, attempts were made to introduce them to bioreactor cultivation which is a crucial step in scale-up operations. In the current work, two bioreactors were employed: BB (balloon bioreactor) and STB (stirred-tank bioreactor). Both of these bioreactor types have been commonly used for plant cell cultivation, in the laboratory and on an industrial scale [
