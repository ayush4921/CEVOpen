<p>As demonstrated in numerous studies on cell cultures of higher plants, the selection of optimum inoculum size is crucial for obtaining high biomass yield [

 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> agar callus cultures cultivated now on the best growth and production medium selected in our previous studies (MS, BAP—1 mg/L, IBA—1 mg/L), high, but strongly varied, increases in dry biomass were obtained, from 6.34 to 18.06 times, during 2-week culture cycles, depending on the ratio of the amount of inoculum to the volume of the medium. An increase in the inoculum size from 0.3 to 0.9 g resulted in biomass increments becoming gradually lower.
