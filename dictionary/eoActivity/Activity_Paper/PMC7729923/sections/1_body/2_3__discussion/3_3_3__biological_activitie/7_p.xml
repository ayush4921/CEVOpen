<p>The results of our biological activity studies suggest that verbascoside and isoverbascoside, present in high quantities in in vitro grown biomass of vervain, likely contribute to the observed effects. Antioxidant, antiproliferative and antibacterial activities of the examined extracts could be connected with the high production of verbascoside which is present in much higher amounts than other compounds. The strongest potential was highlighted for 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB cultures which accumulated the highest amounts of this constituent [
