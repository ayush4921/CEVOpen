<p>The analyses provided evidence of significant differences in the verbascoside content, dependent on the amount of inoculum. The concentrations ranged from 6288.95 (4.5 g of inoculum) to 7059.37 mg/100 g DW (3.0 g of inoculum). With the smallest inoculum size used (1.5 g of inoculum), the concentration of verbascoside was 6845.25 mg/100 g DW (
