<p>The qualitative metabolite profile found in the analyzed extracts from the biomass of the suspension cultures was identical to that obtained for the agar cultures (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05609-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The presence of verbascoside and isoverbascoside, together with the same 6 phenolic acids was confirmedâ€”these were protocatechuic, chlorogenic, vanillic, caffeic, ferulic and rosmarinic acids. As in the case of callus cultures, no iridoids and flavonoids were found in the analyzed samples, and also none of the metabolites was found in the extracts from the lyophilized media samples.
