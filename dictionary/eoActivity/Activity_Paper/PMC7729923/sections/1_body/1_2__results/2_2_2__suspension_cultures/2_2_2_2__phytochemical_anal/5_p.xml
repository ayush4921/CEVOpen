<p>The size of inoculum that should be considered as providing the best conditions for biomass growth and the accumulation of both groups of metabolites—phenylpropanoid glycosides and phenolic acids—is 1.5 g. With this inoculum size, the total concentration of verbascoside and isoverbascoside is high (7109.61 mg/100 g DW), and biomass increases are the highest—5.02-fold (dry biomass). However, the concentration of phenolic acids under these conditions is low (28.09 mg/100 g DW) (
