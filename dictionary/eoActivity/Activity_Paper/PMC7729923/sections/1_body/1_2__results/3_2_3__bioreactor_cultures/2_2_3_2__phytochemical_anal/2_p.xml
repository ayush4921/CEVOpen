<p>High concentrations of verbascoside were found in biomass extractsâ€”7685.00 mg/100 g DW (BB) and 9176.87 mg/100 g DW (STB) (

The amounts of isoverbascoside obtained in BB and STB cultures were equal to 306.40 and 339.91 mg/100 g DW, respectively, and were markedly lower than those obtained in the agar callus cultures (max. 609.26 mg/100 g DW), and also lower than the maximum amounts found in the suspension cultures (477.25 mg/100 g DW) (
