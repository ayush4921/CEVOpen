<p>Macroscopic and microscopic observations revealed that biomass grown in BB was more viable than cells cultured in STB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05609-f001">Figure 1</xref>C,D). In the case of STB, during active growth, a faster browning of the growth medium and the presence of a suspension of broken cells accumulating in the vicinity of the bubbler was found. In the case of biomass incubated in BB, the medium did not turn brown during a 2-weeks growth cycle only showing slightly pearly opalescence (
