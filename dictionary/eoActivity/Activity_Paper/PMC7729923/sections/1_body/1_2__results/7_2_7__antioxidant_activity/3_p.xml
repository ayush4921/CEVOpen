 <xref rid="molecules-25-05609-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> show the results of the reducing power assay. All the extracts displayed good reducing power, that increased with raising concentrations; in this test, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB also exhibited the strongest activity, as confirmed by the calculated ASE/mL values (ASE/mL = 1.762 and 1.779, respectively). At the concentration of 1 and 2 mg/mL, the reducing power of both the extracts was found to be slightly higher than that of BHT. Comparing the ASE/mL values, the reducing power of extracts and standard decreased in the following order: BHT &gt; 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S = 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB &gt; 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C = 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo. Finally, a strong positive correlation was found between total phenolic content and reducing power (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9629).
