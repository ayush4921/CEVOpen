<p>Considering the results in detail, both 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB significantly reduced cell viability by more than 70% at 500 µg/mL after 24 h of treatment, whereas the latter was the only one among the other tested extracts to reach an inhibition of more than 90% at 500 µg/mL after 72 h. 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C showed the weakest anti-proliferative activity among the others, reducing cell growth by more than 70% at 500 µg/mL and by 90% at 750 µg/mL after 72 h of treatment. 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S followed the same trend as 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C, reaching the 90% inhibition at the highest concentration after the longest exposure time; however, unlike 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C, it lowered growth rate by more than 70% at 500 µg/mL after 48 h of treatment.
