<p>Macroscopic analysis of the appearance of callus cultures (embryogenic callus) showed the presence of globular embryos. During the experiment, they were observed to divide and form larger aggregates. The central part of the embryos had intensive green colour whereas the outer cells were parenchymatic and connected to neighbouring embryos through the central plaques. However, single embryos were not found. The tissue did not form cell clusters, which would favour further cytodifferentiation. In the outer parts, the biomass was dyingâ€”was characterized by a dark brown colour (
