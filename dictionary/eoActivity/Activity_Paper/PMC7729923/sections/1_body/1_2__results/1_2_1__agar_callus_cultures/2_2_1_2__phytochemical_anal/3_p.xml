<p>In biomass extracts, the amounts of verbascoside varied moderately from 7154.93 (with 0.3 g of inoculum) to 7248.66 mg/100 g DW (with 0.9 g of inoculum). With 0.6 g of inoculum, the verbascoside content was almost identical to that obtained with 0.3 g of inoculum (7176.14 mg/100 g DW). The amounts of isoverbascoside were more varied, ranging from 442.81 (with 0.3 g of inoculum) through 528.17 (0.6 g of inoculum) to the maximum amount of 609.26 mg/100 g DW (0.9 g of inoculum) (

With this amount of inocular biomass, the total amount of the two compounds was the highest (7857.92 mg/100 g DW).
