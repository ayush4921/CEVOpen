<p>The total amount of the estimated phenolic acids also varied depending on the amount of inoculum, from 19.42 mg/100 g DW (with the smallest inoculum of 0.3 g) through 26.90 mg/100 g DW (0.6 g) to 25.00 mg/100 g DW (0.9 g) (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05609-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The main phenolic acids were protocatechuic acid and ferulic acid. The amounts of these two compounds ranged from 6.91 to 9.58 mg/100 g DW, and from 4.91 to 7.35 mg/100 g DW, respectively. The maximum amounts of the other four phenolic acids, i.e., chlorogenic, vanillic, caffeic and rosmarinic acids, did not exceed 1.8, 1.3, 3.6 and 3.8 mg/100 g DW, respectively.
