<p>The objective of the current research was to further optimize the conditions for growing agar callus cultures of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic>, maintained on the MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/L BAP and 1 mg/L IBA, for improved production of verbascoside and isoverbascoside. This included the evaluation of the inoculum size on biomass growth and secondary metabolite production. Another objective of the work was to establish for the first-time suspension cultures of vervain which were optimized for inoculum size and production of bioactive metabolites. The next step of this research was the establishment, also for the first time, of vervain cultures grown in two different bioreactor constructionsâ€”stirred-tank bioreactor (STB) and balloon bioreactor (BB). The main aim was to scale up the biomass cultivation and production of biologically active metabolites. For comparative purpose, the concentrations of secondary metabolites in the herb extracts of parent plants were also determined.
