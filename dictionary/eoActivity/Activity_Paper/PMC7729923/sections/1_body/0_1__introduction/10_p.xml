<p>The basic factors that affect the accumulation of secondary metabolites in cell cultures are the composition of culture medium, including plant growth regulators (PGRs) composition, and lighting conditions. Our previous studies demonstrated a very clear effect of PGRs and lighting conditions on metabolite production in 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> callus. The experiments proved that callus cells selectively accumulated large amounts of verbascoside (max. 2.4 g/100 g DW—light, 2.1 g/100 g DW—darkness) and selected phenolic acids (max. 46.02 mg/100 g DW, light—free compounds, max. 141.05 mg/100 g DW, light—bound compounds). The research enabled to select the best “production” medium which also provided good biomass growth: the MS medium variant containing 1 mg/L BAP (6-benzylaminopurine) and 1 mg/L IBA (indole-3-butyric acid). Using this medium, further research was conducted to investigate the effect of LED lights on metabolite accumulation [
