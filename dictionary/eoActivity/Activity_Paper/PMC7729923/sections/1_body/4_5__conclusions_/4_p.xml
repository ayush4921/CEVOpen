<p>The obtained results have the applicable character. We propose 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> bioreactor culture maintained in the STB as an efficient, rich potential source of verbascoside and isoverbascoside independent of environmental conditions. The obtained maximal quantities of verbascoside (9.18%) and additionally the high amount of isoverbascoside (0.34%) in STB are interesting from a practical point of view.
