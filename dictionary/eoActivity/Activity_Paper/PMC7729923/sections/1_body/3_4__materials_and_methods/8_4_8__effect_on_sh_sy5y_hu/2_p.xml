<p>The effect of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts (
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB, and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo) on the growth rate of SHSY5Y was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, as stated by Celano et al. [
 <xref rid="B68-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cell/well in 96-well plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Then, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh one containing extracts dilutions ranging from 125 to 750 µg/mL, along with a control (untreated cells) and solvent control (DMSO). After incubation for 24, 48 and 72 h at 37 °C, the medium was replaced with a fresh one containing MTT at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and incubated for further 4 h. Afterwards, MTT solution was removed and the formazan crystals derived from the metabolic activity of viable cells were solubilized in 100 µL of HCl/isopropanol 0.1 N and regularly shaken. The optical density was spectrophotometrically measured at 570 nm with a reference filter at 690 nm using a microplate reader (iMark™, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy). All experiments were performed in eight replicates for three times. Results are calculated as a percentage of viable cells compared to untreated cells and expressed as mean ± SEM.
