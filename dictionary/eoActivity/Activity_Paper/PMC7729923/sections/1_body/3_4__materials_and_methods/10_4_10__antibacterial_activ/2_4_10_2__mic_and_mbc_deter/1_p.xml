<p>MIC and MBC of extracts against the test strains were carried out by the method of serial micro dilutions [

 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Two series of dilutions of the extracts were prepared in Mueller-Hinton Broth (MHB) medium in the concentration range from 36.0 to 0.3 mg/mL. An inoculum was added to each well of the polystyrene 96-well plates, each of a volume of 250 µL so that the final number of cells was 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/mL. A well without extract was chosen as a positive control. Negative control was the medium (without the addition of extracts) together with the tested bacteria. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. Afterwards, 25 µL of resazurin at 0.02% (
