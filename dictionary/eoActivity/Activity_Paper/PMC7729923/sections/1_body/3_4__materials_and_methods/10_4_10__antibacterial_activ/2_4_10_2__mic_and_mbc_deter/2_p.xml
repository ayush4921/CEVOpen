<p>To determine MBC, 100 μL bacterial culture from each well showing no bacterial growth were re-inoculated onto Mueller–Hinton agar (MHA) medium, which were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. The plates were checked for growth of colonies. MBC was defined as the lowest concentration of extract, which resulted in complete inhibition of bacterial growth and expressed in mg/mL.</p>
