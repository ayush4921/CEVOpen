<p>The total phenolic content of 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts (
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB, and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo) was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, using a calibration curve of gallic acid as a reference [
 <xref rid="B69-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Briefly, 100 µL of each sample solution were mixed with 0.2 mL Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, 2 mL of H
 <sub>2</sub>O, and 1 mL of 15% Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>, and the absorbance was measured at 765 nm, after 2 h incubation at room temperature, with a model UV-1601 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Milan, Italy). The total phenolics were estimated as gallic acid equivalent (GAE) and expressed in mg GAE/g extract ± standard deviation (SD). The data were obtained from the average of three determinations.
