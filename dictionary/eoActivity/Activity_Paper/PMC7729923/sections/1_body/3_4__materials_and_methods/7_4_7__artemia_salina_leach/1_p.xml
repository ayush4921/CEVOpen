<p>Determination of median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) was carried out according to the method previously reported [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Ten brine shrimp larvae, taken 48 h after initiation of hatching in artificial seawater, were transferred to Petri dishes, and artificial seawater was added to obtain a final volume of 5 mL. Subsequently, the 
 <italic>V. officinalis</italic> extracts (
 <italic>Vo</italic>-C, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-S, 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-STB, and 
 <italic>Vo</italic>-in vivo), diluted in artificial seawater, were added at the final concentrations of 10, 100, 500 and 1000 μg/mL. After 24 h of incubation at 25–28 °C, the surviving larvae were counted. The assay was carried out in triplicate, and LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined by the Litchfield and Wilcoxon’s method. The extract was considered active if the LC
 <sub>50</sub> was lower than 1000 μg/mL.
