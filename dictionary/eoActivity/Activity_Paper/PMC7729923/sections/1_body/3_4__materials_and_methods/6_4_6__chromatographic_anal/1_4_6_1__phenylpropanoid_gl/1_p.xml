<p>Chromatographic analysis of phenylpropanoid glycosides (verbascoside and isoverbascoside) and iridoids (verbenaline and hastatoside) was carried out using the previously developed HPLC-DAD method according to Schönbichler, et al. [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-05609" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The used analytical column was Kinetex C-18 analytical column (150× 4.6 mm, 2.7 μm; Phenomenex, Torrance, California, USA). The mobile phase consisted of two solvents: 0,1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile (gradient program). Compounds were estimated using a DAD detector. The detection wavelength was set at 330 nm for phenylpropanoid glycosides and at 235 nm for iridoids. The detected compounds were identified by the method of addition and comparison with UV-DAD spectra and retention times (Rt) of commercial standards. The quantification was carried out based on calibration curves.
