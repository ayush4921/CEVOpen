<p>In the experiment, all agar callus cultures inocular biomasses of 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 g were used. The biomasses were placed into in vitro culture jars (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 30 mL MS medium with 1 mg/L BAP and 1 mg/L IBA solidified with agar (7.2 g/L) and supplemented with 30 g/L sucrose. Callus growth and morphology were observed over 14-day growth cycles (3 series, 10 samples each).</p>
