<p>In conclusion, this review was presented in the hope to discover a medicinal herb which has the potential to function in multiple systems of the body and which possess a range of different biological activities. It is of great importance to understand whether 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> stimulates or inhibits a common biochemical pathway in all the body systems, to trigger those activities. Hence, it would be interesting to investigate the mechanism of action of TI in depth to clearly understand its broader therapeutic indications. Since most of the activities are preclinical trials, it would be necessary to carry out randomized controlled human trials to determine whether TI can be developed into a phytomedicine to be used as both as a preventive and a therapeutic agent.
