<p>Extracts from roots, leaves, and whole plant of TI have been tested to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect. In vivo tests had been carried out on healthy Wistar rats using carrageenan-induced paw oedema and cotton pellet granuloma methods. Different solvent extracts had been used such as aqueous, methanolic, petroleum ether, and chloroform. All the extracts at the tested doses showed positive results both orally as well as intraperitoneal [
