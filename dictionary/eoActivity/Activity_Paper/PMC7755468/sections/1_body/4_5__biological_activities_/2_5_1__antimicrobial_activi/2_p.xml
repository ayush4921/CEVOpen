<p>The most widely studied part of the plant is the leaf. Few studies have also been investigated for the antimicrobial activity in the stem and the root. The antibacterial activity appears to have depended on the solvent which was used to extract TI rather than the plant part. With respect to the solvents used for the extraction of TI for above antimicrobial studies, it appears that extracts of more polar solvents such as ethyl acetate, acetone, and methanol produced potent antimicrobial activity while that of less polar solvents such as petroleum ether was less active. Aqueous extracts of TI, on the other hand, showed very low antibacterial activity.</p>
