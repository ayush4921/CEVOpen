<p>The TI plant showed antifungal activity as well. A study carried out by Panda et al. [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] investigated the ethyl acetate extract of TI root against 
 <italic>Malassezia furfur</italic> fungus. This study showed that the zone of inhibition of EAE of TI root was comparable to that of ketoconazole, which was used as the control. In another study, the ethanol and methanol extract of TI stem was used against 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhizopus arrhizus</italic>, which also gave positive results. In the same study performed by Panda et al. [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], 10, 13-dimethoxy-17-(6-methylheptan-2-yl)-2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17-tetradecahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene and 3-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-2,3- dihydrochro-men-4-one identified from TI root have shown both antibacterial and antifungal effects. A latest study performed by Gupta et al. [
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] showed that the leaf extract of TI possessed antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic> and few other pathogenic fungi.
