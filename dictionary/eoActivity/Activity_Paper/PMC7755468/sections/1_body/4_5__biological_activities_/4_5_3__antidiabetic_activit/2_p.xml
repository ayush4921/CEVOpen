<p>In vivo studies have been carried out using diabetes-induced rats. The rats had been induced with alloxan [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>] which mimic type I diabetes mellitus and streptozotocin-nicotinamide [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and high-fat diet and low doses of streptozotocin [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] were also used to mimic type II diabetes mellitus. TI extracts showed potent antidiabetic activity in both types. The hypolipidaemic activity was also investigated during the same antidiabetic study because of the effect of insulin on triglyceride metabolism secondarily causing hyperlipidaemia. TI extracts normalized the values of the lipid profile, which showed that TI possesses insulin mimicking action.
