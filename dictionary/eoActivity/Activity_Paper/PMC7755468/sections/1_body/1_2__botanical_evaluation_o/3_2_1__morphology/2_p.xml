<p>Moreover, there are two morphologically different plants which are known by the vernacular name “Wel Kahambiliya” in Sri Lanka (unpublished data). One plant being a vine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the other being a shrub (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Both plants have been identified by the National Herbarium, Department of National Botanic Gardens, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, as 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> L. According to Dassanayake and Clayton [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the morphological characters which have been used for the “key to the species” in Tragia species under family Euphorbiaceae are the shape of the leaf (whether palmately lobed or simple), base of the leaf (whether cuneate or cordate), and fruiting calyx (whether lobes are linear, variously toothed and stellately spreading, and exposing fruit or broadly ovate, enclosing fruit). The nature of the stem is not considered as a key. Therefore, both the abovementioned two morphological forms fall into the same species. In Dassanayake and Clayton [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the common stem type for Tragia species has been mentioned as climbing or twining. Hence, it would be worth conducting further investigations into the genetic composition of these two morphologically distinct forms, in order to understand their taxonomical stand in comparison to each other.
