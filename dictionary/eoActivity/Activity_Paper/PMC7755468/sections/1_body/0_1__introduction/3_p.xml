<p>TI is a weed and therefore propagates easily and survives in harsh weather conditions. Although this plant has been in use for thousands of years, at present, the public is not aware of the medicinal value of this plant, and since it causes a severe stinging effect when touched, the plant is being extensively destroyed especially in Sri Lanka. Due to the destruction of the plant, it is restricted to certain districts of the country. Therefore, the aim of this study was to collect data on the medicinal value of this plant by correlating its biological activities with its ethnopharmacological uses in order to interpret the importance of the plant so that it may be conserved. This review also provides an insight to the capability of 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> to be used as a monoherbal formulation for noncommunicable diseases due to its many scientifically validated biological activities and its many ethnopharmacological uses which date backs to thousands of years.
