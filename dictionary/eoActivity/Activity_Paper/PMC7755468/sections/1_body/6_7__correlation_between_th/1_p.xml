<p>Ethnomedicinal use of a medicinal plant correlates with the underlining biological activity possessed by the plant. As discussed earlier, 
 <italic>Tragia involucrata</italic> possesses an abundance of ethnomedicinal uses pertaining to different systems of the body, and many of these uses can be correlated to a range of biological activities of the plant that have been scientifically validated by using systematically controlled in vitro and in vivo experiments. In certain instances, the proven biological activity does not correlate directly to the mentioned disease itself but relates to the underlying pathological condition which causes the disease. Furthermore, the medicinal outcome may be due not to the presence of one biological activity but due to a combination of activities.
