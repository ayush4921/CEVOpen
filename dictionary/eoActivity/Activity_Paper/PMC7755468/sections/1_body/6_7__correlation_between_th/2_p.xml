<p>One such example is TI's ability to act as a febrifuge. This therapeutic indication is found in most of the Ayurveda authentic texts and in Sri Lankan traditional medical texts. According to the traditional medical text Thalapathepiliyam, the whole plant of TI along with 4 other herbs, each comprising 12 g, are added to 1920 ml water to make the decoction of 240 ml, which is consumed daily. Fever can be a symptom of an infection. Therefore, the febrifuge action by TI could be mediated through its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities. Furthermore, one of the psychopharmacological studies performed by Choudhuri Nag et al. [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] using TI methanol fraction of the root extract showed significant central nervous system depressant action, which also includes the decrease of body temperature. As shown by Samy et al. [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], the aqueous leaf extract of TI showed positive results for acute and subacute anti-inflammatory effects at doses of 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 mg/kg on albino rats. Moreover, in a study carried out by Panda et al. [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], the ethyl acetate extract of TI root at a dose of 250 mg/kg showed a potent antimicrobial effect against many strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and 3 types of fungi. However, the information on the extractable amounts of ingredients in those traditional decoctions are not indicated. Therefore, in terms of the dose administered, the ethnopharmacological data cannot be compared with the effective doses of various biological activities. Moreover, since the method of extractions between these preparations is also different, the compositions and doses of active ingredients can be varied.
