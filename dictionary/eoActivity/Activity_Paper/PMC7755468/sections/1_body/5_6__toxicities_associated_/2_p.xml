<p>A number of in vivo investigations have been performed to assess possible toxic effects of various decoctions/extractions prepared of TI, which generally indicated that there is no toxicity associated with TI. These studies had been carried out with the whole plant, aerial parts, and leaf, extracted with various solvents such as water, methanol, petroleum ether, chloroform, and ethyl acetate. Most of the toxicity studies had been assessed up to the 14
 <sup>th</sup> day of daily administration of the TI extract using different doses.
