Its uses are mentioned to as early as in Egyptian papyri, the Dioscorides&#x02019; Materia Medica (~ 60 CE) or the Garcia de Orta&#x02019;s Colloquies (1563 CE in Goa) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Presently, Aloe species account among the most economically important medicinal plants and are commonly used for several ailments, namely anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, and immunomodulatory to antimicrobial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several studies have revealed the effectiveness of <italic>Aloe</italic> plants towards various types of cancer, like colon, duodenal, intestinal, lung, kidney pancreatic, liver, and skin, and these works have been confirmed through numerous in vitro and in vivo experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Nonetheless, antagonist results arise frequently: whilst many papers described its anticancer properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], others surprisingly claim <italic>A. vera</italic> is indeed carcinogenic over a specific dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or alert that specific compounds present in <italic>Aloe</italic> may be highly toxic if not taken under caution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. One reason for this could be the overall misidentification of the <italic>Aloe</italic> genus species, since current research supports that there are <italic>Aloe</italic> species that have more potent bioactivities than <italic>Aloe vera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Today, <italic>A. barbadensis</italic> Mill. (<italic>A. vera</italic>) is incontestably the most common species of <italic>Aloe</italic> used worldwide, often incorrectly mentioned to as the one with the highest bioactivities in anecdotal reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Yet, there are about 500 <italic>Aloe</italic> species documented, from which just a small fraction has reported ethnomedicinal uses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, the phenotype similarities among species are enormously high, inducing people to use frequently the wrong species. Hence, because of its huge medicinal, cosmetic and other demands there is a high possibility that some species may often be mistakenly identified for different medicinal usages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, the use of single specific phytochemical derived from <italic>Aloe</italic> instead of the crude and/or standardized extracts could affect the overall bioactivities since it has been shown that many components in <italic>Aloe</italic> act synergistically with the remaining constituents in the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this sense, it also noteworthy to state that there is an overall lack of consistency regarding the type of extractions to use. Several works report the use of aqueous extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] whilst others mention to use alcoholic or organic solvents like acetone or methanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Taking into account that <italic>Aloe</italic>&#x02019;s main phytochemical groups vary from phenols to proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and organic and inorganic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it is relevant to explore different types of extractions.</p><p id="Par15">Another important factor to consider is the method of functioning of this genus&#x02019; bioactivities. Currently, a particular group of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) named gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) is greatly associated to cancer invasion through degradation of the cellular matrix, and the consequent release of cancer cells via proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since MMP-9 activities have also been closely associated to inflammation and delay in wound closure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] it is very likely that <italic>Aloe</italic> compounds could target these gelatinases. Indeed, concerning inflammation, <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extracts are recognized to down regulate metalloproteinase expression, precisely MMP-9, which contributes to the extracellular matrix degradation when recruited by cytokines to inflammation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Hence, it is quite probable that <italic>Aloe</italic> species might inhibit enzymatic activity of MMP-2 (72 kDa) and MMP-9 (92 kDa) in cancer-related situations. However, to our knowledge there has been no link established between gelatinase activity inhibition induced by <italic>Aloe</italic> plants and cancer.</p><p id="Par16">These studies can be valuable to confirm the real effect of <italic>Aloe</italic> species on cancer and eventually provide the identification of innovative anticancer approaches. Furthermore, the analysis of gelatinase activity inhibition by <italic>A. vera</italic> extracts may also constitute a novel perspective, which can help to comprehend the mechanisms of action of the plants from this genus. With that in mind, we set out to evaluate the content of several classes of potentially bioactive compounds, using different extraction procedures and their impact on the growth and migration of colon adenocarcinoma cells, as well as their effect on MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Species selected and collection of plant samples</title><p id="Par17">Leaves of <italic>A. vera</italic> and <italic>A. arborescens</italic> were collected from the existing Collection of <italic>Aloe</italic> genus specimen of Parque Bot&#x000e2;nico da Tapada da Ajuda (member of the Botanic Gardens Conservation International &#x02013; BGCI), Instituto Superior de Agronomia, University of Lisbon (ISA/UL), Portugal.

In the gelatin zymography, white bands are indicative of non-inhibited MMP gelatinolytic activity, including that of the pro-enzyme and its active form. Concerning the MMPs, they are generally synthesized as zymogens (pro-MMPs), with their catalytic activity blocked by a cysteine switch and are only activated by its removal, through limited proteolysis. In the zymography assay, the pro-gelatinases similarly become active because they are denaturated by the SDS, therefore exposing the catalytic site (hence the slightly higher mass of the pro-enzymes in the zymography, which still maintain the short amino acid sequence of the cysteine switch). Consequently, there are two white bands for each MMP, as observed in the controls in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (a): gelatinase A or MMP-2 has a 72&#x02009;kDa molecular mass, whereas gelatinase B or MMP-9 has 92&#x02009;kDa.

Among the hundreds of identified <italic>Aloe</italic> species, there are two which stand out as the most common in European countries, <italic>A. vera,</italic> because of its huge popularity, and <italic>A. arborescens</italic>, because it is well adapted to the European climates and is widely spread across the public gardens as an ornamental plant. Although there are many differences between both species, such as morphological features, flower color, sap color, smell and other histological features, both species are often mistaken, as many media and anecdotal reports show. Although there are several articles highlighting the phytochemical composition of A. <italic>vera</italic>, much less is known about other species, like <italic>A. arborescens</italic>. In this work, we aimed to compare the potential anti-cancer and MMP-9 inhibitory activities between these two well-known <italic>Aloe</italic> species, <italic>A. vera</italic> and <italic>A. arborescens</italic>.</p><p id="Par43">The literature describes several compounds in <italic>A. vera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] which can be responsible for the various pharmacological activities previously described. The main phytochemical groups present in <italic>A. vera</italic> have been described as phenolic compounds (anthraquinones, anthrones), carbohydrates and proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These different metabolites or phytochemicals may act individually, additively or in synergy to improve the plant&#x02019;s health and its chances of survival in a given environment. Furthermore, it has been suggested that these combined actions of the phytochemicals usually tend to increase the bioactivity of the main medicinal constituents by influencing its assimilation in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Because of that, in this work, we not only aimed to compare the amounts of the potentially bioactive compounds in the two selected species, but we also wanted to select the best extraction procedure, that would allow the highest yield in these compounds. Therefore, we set out to quantify the major classes of bioactive compounds: proteins, total phenolic compounds and specifically anthraquinones, and total polysaccharides. When considering the whole leaf as an organ for phytochemical extraction, the possibility to combine several components has been suggested to potentiate its therapeutic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the choice of the extraction method by which the compounds are obtained was shown to be essential. Results here presented show that the extraction method not only influences the amount of bioactive component extracted but it also differs among species. Whilst for <italic>A. vera</italic>, for all compound&#x02019;s classes except the proteins, the majority of the compounds were better extracted with 50% (v/v) methanol (phenolics and polysaccharides, with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for <italic>A. arborescens</italic> the highest yields were obtained in the 100% (v/v) methanol extraction. This suggests the presence of different compounds but more importantly, it arises the question of whether most literature using non-aqueous polar and non-polar solvents such as ethanol, acetone etc. are using the correct extractions to yield the better bioactivities with <italic>A. vera</italic>. This could be of significant importance since it is well-known that polysaccharides like acemannan were found responsible for the stimulation of the immune response in cancer scenarios, contributing to tumor weight reduction and the improvement of chemotherapy drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">MMP-9 inhibitors (MMPIs) are considered metastasis deterrents and anti-angiogenic agents for colorectal cancer, and have also been proved to inhibit pre-cancerous states like colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although many synthetic MMP inhibitors have been developed as potential anticancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], because of MMP&#x02019;s ubiquity, most trials were hampered by dose-limiting toxicity, insufficient clinical benefits and lack of specificity. Natural, plant and food-based MMP9 inhibitors are currently more preferable to these inhibitors because of their lack of side effects and potentially higher specificity. In the last few years, a different perspective has emerged suggesting that using crude and/or standardized extracts as opposed to single compounds might be an advantage since each component has its major effect when acting synergistically with other components in the plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In this context, it also important to refer that there is an overall lack of consistency concerning the type of extractions to use. Some reports refer to aqueous extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] whilst others use alcoholic or organic solvents such as methanol or acetone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since the main phytochemical groups range from phenolic compounds to carbohydrates, proteins, organic and inorganic compounds as well as vitamins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], it becomes important to test different types of extractions to identify, which provide the highest amount of bioactive compounds, and allows the better synergy among them. After comparing the anticancer and MMP-9 inhibitory potential of two extracts from <italic>A. vera</italic> and A<italic>. arborescens</italic>, we selected the 50% (v/v) methanolic extractions for the remaining cancer cell assays. Interestingly, we also found that both Aloe extracts similarly reduce HT29 colon cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. According to Lissoni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], this result was not surprising, as aloenin and other analogous molecules may be classified within the group of anthraquinonic and anthracenic substances, whose antiproliferative cytotoxic effects are widely known. Whilst the cell proliferation assay allows the assessment of growth inhibition, cell metabolism and overall cytotoxicity, the wound healing assay helps to assess the reaction of confluent cells in response to a disruption of cell-cell contacts. What generally occurs is a growth factors concentration increase at the wound margins stimulating proliferation and migration in order to close the opened gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], thus mimicking the metastatic process of cell migration. These two processes are particularly important when considering cancer development and have been associated to MMP activity, mainly MMP-9. Our results demonstrated significant differences between Aloe species when colon cancer cell migration was analysed. In fact, <italic>A. vera</italic> was less effective in inhibiting cell invasiveness than <italic>A. arborescens</italic>. Other reports using different plant extracts with known MMP-9 inhibitory activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] showed similar results and a known MMP-9 inhibitor, doxycycline in the same conditions induced similar reductions in cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These results suggest that although <italic>A. vera</italic> is the most used species and has been attributed numerous therapeutic benefits, regarding anti-cancer potential, it may not be as efficient as it has been described in reducing cancer cell migration. Indeed, even though there are several works highlighting the pytochemical composition of <italic>A. vera</italic>, much less is known about other species, like <italic>A. arborescens</italic>. Nonetheless <italic>A. arborescens</italic> has been the target of several studies in the last years, some of which associated to its anti-cancer properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

This might be due to its capacity to inhibit tumor invasion and cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">Despite being effective in reducing cell migration, previous studies have already shown that some plant extracts, such as persimmon for example, can reduce cell migration but not through MMP-9 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. We therefore proceeded to evaluate if there was indeed MMP enzymatic inhibition.</p><p id="Par46">MMP-2 was the first endopeptidase recognized to degrade collagens and to be related to the invasive and metastatic potential of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

On the other hand, MMP-9 is linked to the promotion of metastization, angiogenesis and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Since <italic>A. vera</italic> has been shown to concomitantly exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, it appears reasonable to infer that targeting MMP-9 (a known key player in both conditions) could be one of Aloe&#x02019;s biocomponents mode of action.</p><p id="Par47">However, though there are many reports on the anticancer activities of <italic>A. vera</italic>, to our knowledge, there are no studies which correlate its anticancer activities with MMP-9 and MMP-2 enzymatic activity inhibition in cancer cells.

A higher MMP-9 enzymatic inhibition can be of noteworthy importance because it has been considered that most MMPIs are non-specific, and this is, in turn, responsible for their generalized adverse side effects observed in most MMP studies. A more specific activity inhibition targeted exclusively to MMP-9, particularly in colon cancer, where this MMPI might act in situ, may be of significant potential to anticancer and anti-inflammatory approaches in the gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, our results show that the detected inhibitory activities were due to direct binding of <italic>Aloe</italic> extract components to MMP-9, being this inhibition higher for <italic>A. arborescens</italic> than for <italic>A. vera</italic>. These results suggest that the higher MMP inhibitory activities in <italic>A. arborescens</italic> can be related to the higher inhibition of cell migration found for this species. Nevertheless, the percentage of activity reduction was not as high as the one observed in the zymographic analysis, where MMP-9&#x02019;s activity was reduced more than 50%., suggesting that the <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts do not only inhibit directly this enzyme, but may also use alternative mechanisms. This is in agreement with the results obtained by Vijayalakshmi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] that showed <italic>A. vera</italic> extracts down regulating metalloproteinase expression, specifically MMP-9.</p><p id="Par49">Regardless of having similar concentrations of various bioactive classes of compounds, <italic>A. arborescens</italic> seems to be a more effective cancer cell migration inhibitor than <italic>A. vera</italic>. This might be due to a larger concentration and/or greater number of bioactive compounds like anthraquinones present in <italic>A. arborescens</italic>, or to the presence of specific compounds not yet identified in this species. Even so, results show that in studies related to cancer prevention or therapy using <italic>Aloe</italic> species, <italic>A. arborescens</italic> should be considered as an effective alternative to <italic>A. vera</italic>. Additionally, our results also highlight the importance of the extraction procedure to obtain higher amounts of bioactive extracts, such as anthraquinones, phenolics and polysaccharides, particularly in <italic>A. vera</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par50">Our general results suggest specific important issues: 1) the genus <italic>Aloe</italic> is capable of inhibiting MMP-9 and MMP-2, although more efficiently MMP-9, 2) there are indeed differences among <italic>Aloe</italic> species, and 3) <italic>A. vera</italic> is possibly not the most efficient <italic>Aloe</italic> species. These facts allow us to ask important questions: is all the debate and misconception about <italic>A. vera</italic> being caused by erroneous uses of different species (more or less efficient, or more toxic than <italic>A. vera</italic>)? And are we missing out on not testing other <italic>Aloe</italic> species, in search for important bioactivities, which can efficiently be used in medical treatments? Either way, results here show that when considering the potential of <italic>Aloe</italic>, it is extremely important to take into consideration the type of extraction used, the species of <italic>Aloe</italic> and also their effects on individual MMPs.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DQ</term><def><p id="Par5">Dye-quenched</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIC</term><def><p id="Par6">Minimal inhibitory concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMP</term><def><p id="Par7">Matrix metalloproteinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMPI</term><def><p id="Par8">Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MTT</term><def><p id="Par9">3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PBS</term><def><p id="Par10">Phosphate buffered saline</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PVPP</term><def><p id="Par11">Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, AL and RBF; Formal analysis, AL, EV and PR; Supervision, AL and RBF; Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, AL, PBS and RBF.
