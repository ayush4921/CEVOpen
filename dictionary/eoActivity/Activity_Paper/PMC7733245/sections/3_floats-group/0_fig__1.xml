  <p>Quantitative characterization of 
   <italic>A. vera</italic> and 
   <italic>A. arborescens</italic> considering the main phytochemical groups defined by Hamman [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Each extraction was performed with 20 g of fresh 
   <italic>Aloe</italic> leaves for each of the three solvents: 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, 50% (v/v) methanol and 100% (v/v) methanol. 
   <bold>a</bold> Protein quantification using the Bradford method described by Bradford (1976). All samples were treated with Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) to eliminate the phenolic compounds that could interfere with the extraction of soluble proteins. 
   <bold>b</bold> Phenolic compounds quantification with the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent and using gallic acid as standard. 
   <bold>c</bold> Total carbohydrates quantification using phenol/sulfuric acid method and mannose as the standard. 
   <bold>d</bold> Specific anthraquinone quantification (phenol component) using benzene, ammonia solution and Aloe blue curacao aloin. *
