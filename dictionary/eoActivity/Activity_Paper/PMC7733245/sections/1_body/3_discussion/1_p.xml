<p id="Par42">Evidence has shown that certain bioactive phytochemicals are often present in more than one 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], an observation that inevitably supports the species-substitution hypothesis in traditional medicine. Among the hundreds of identified 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species, there are two which stand out as the most common in European countries, 
 <italic>A. vera,</italic> because of its huge popularity, and 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>, because it is well adapted to the European climates and is widely spread across the public gardens as an ornamental plant. Although there are many differences between both species, such as morphological features, flower color, sap color, smell and other histological features, both species are often mistaken, as many media and anecdotal reports show. Although there are several articles highlighting the phytochemical composition of A. 
 <italic>vera</italic>, much less is known about other species, like 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>. In this work, we aimed to compare the potential anti-cancer and MMP-9 inhibitory activities between these two well-known 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species, 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> and 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>.
