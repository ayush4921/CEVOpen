<p id="Par43">The literature describes several compounds in 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] which can be responsible for the various pharmacological activities previously described. The main phytochemical groups present in 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> have been described as phenolic compounds (anthraquinones, anthrones), carbohydrates and proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These different metabolites or phytochemicals may act individually, additively or in synergy to improve the plant’s health and its chances of survival in a given environment. Furthermore, it has been suggested that these combined actions of the phytochemicals usually tend to increase the bioactivity of the main medicinal constituents by influencing its assimilation in the body [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Because of that, in this work, we not only aimed to compare the amounts of the potentially bioactive compounds in the two selected species, but we also wanted to select the best extraction procedure, that would allow the highest yield in these compounds. Therefore, we set out to quantify the major classes of bioactive compounds: proteins, total phenolic compounds and specifically anthraquinones, and total polysaccharides. When considering the whole leaf as an organ for phytochemical extraction, the possibility to combine several components has been suggested to potentiate its therapeutic activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, the choice of the extraction method by which the compounds are obtained was shown to be essential. Results here presented show that the extraction method not only influences the amount of bioactive component extracted but it also differs among species. Whilst for 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>, for all compound’s classes except the proteins, the majority of the compounds were better extracted with 50% (v/v) methanol (phenolics and polysaccharides, with 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> the highest yields were obtained in the 100% (v/v) methanol extraction. This suggests the presence of different compounds but more importantly, it arises the question of whether most literature using non-aqueous polar and non-polar solvents such as ethanol, acetone etc. are using the correct extractions to yield the better bioactivities with 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>. This could be of significant importance since it is well-known that polysaccharides like acemannan were found responsible for the stimulation of the immune response in cancer scenarios, contributing to tumor weight reduction and the improvement of chemotherapy drugs [
