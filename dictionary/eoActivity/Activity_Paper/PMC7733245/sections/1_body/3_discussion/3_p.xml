<p id="Par44">MMP-9 inhibitors (MMPIs) are considered metastasis deterrents and anti-angiogenic agents for colorectal cancer, and have also been proved to inhibit pre-cancerous states like colitis and other inflammatory bowel diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although many synthetic MMP inhibitors have been developed as potential anticancer drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], because of MMP’s ubiquity, most trials were hampered by dose-limiting toxicity, insufficient clinical benefits and lack of specificity. Natural, plant and food-based MMP9 inhibitors are currently more preferable to these inhibitors because of their lack of side effects and potentially higher specificity. In the last few years, a different perspective has emerged suggesting that using crude and/or standardized extracts as opposed to single compounds might be an advantage since each component has its major effect when acting synergistically with other components in the plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In this context, it also important to refer that there is an overall lack of consistency concerning the type of extractions to use. Some reports refer to aqueous extracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] whilst others use alcoholic or organic solvents such as methanol or acetone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Since the main phytochemical groups range from phenolic compounds to carbohydrates, proteins, organic and inorganic compounds as well as vitamins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], it becomes important to test different types of extractions to identify, which provide the highest amount of bioactive compounds, and allows the better synergy among them. After comparing the anticancer and MMP-9 inhibitory potential of two extracts from 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> and A
 <italic>. arborescens</italic>, we selected the 50% (v/v) methanolic extractions for the remaining cancer cell assays. Interestingly, we also found that both Aloe extracts similarly reduce HT29 colon cancer cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. According to Lissoni et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], this result was not surprising, as aloenin and other analogous molecules may be classified within the group of anthraquinonic and anthracenic substances, whose antiproliferative cytotoxic effects are widely known. Whilst the cell proliferation assay allows the assessment of growth inhibition, cell metabolism and overall cytotoxicity, the wound healing assay helps to assess the reaction of confluent cells in response to a disruption of cell-cell contacts. What generally occurs is a growth factors concentration increase at the wound margins stimulating proliferation and migration in order to close the opened gap [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], thus mimicking the metastatic process of cell migration. These two processes are particularly important when considering cancer development and have been associated to MMP activity, mainly MMP-9. Our results demonstrated significant differences between Aloe species when colon cancer cell migration was analysed. In fact, 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> was less effective in inhibiting cell invasiveness than 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>. Other reports using different plant extracts with known MMP-9 inhibitory activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] showed similar results and a known MMP-9 inhibitor, doxycycline in the same conditions induced similar reductions in cell migration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These results suggest that although 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> is the most used species and has been attributed numerous therapeutic benefits, regarding anti-cancer potential, it may not be as efficient as it has been described in reducing cancer cell migration. Indeed, even though there are several works highlighting the pytochemical composition of 
 <italic>A. vera</italic>, much less is known about other species, like 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>. Nonetheless 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> has been the target of several studies in the last years, some of which associated to its anti-cancer properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> was already proven to be effective in aiding chemotherapy when given orally at a dose of 10 mL thrice daily of a mixture consisting of 300 g of fresh leaves in 500 g of honey plus 40 mL of 40% (v/v) alcohol, either during or after chemotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This might be due to its capacity to inhibit tumor invasion and cell migration [
