<p id="Par20">The phenolic compounds were quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteau reagent using gallic acid as standard. The lyophilized powder (corresponding to 20 g of fresh leaves) was treated with 10 μL of 70% (v/v) acetone, 10 μL of 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid and 80 μL of 7% (w/v) sodium carbonate. Subsequently, a volume of 100 μL of Folin-Ciocalteau was added to the solution and the mixture was vortexed. The solution of 200 μL was incubated for 8 min at room temperature and the absorbance was read in a Syenery HT Bio-TEK spectrophotometer at 765 nm [
