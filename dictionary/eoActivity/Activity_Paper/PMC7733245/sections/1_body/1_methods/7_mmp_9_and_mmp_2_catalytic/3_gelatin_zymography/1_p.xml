<p id="Par28">To determine metalloproteinase activities in HT29 cancer cell culture supernatants, a gelatin-zymography was performed according to standard methods adapted by Lima et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Cell culture supernatants were treated with 62.6 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% w/v SDS, 10% v/v glycerol and 0.01% w/v bromophenol blue and separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (12.5% w/v acrylamide) with 1% (w/v) gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed three times in 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 90 min each and incubated at 37 Â°C with developing buffer for 24 h. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, the white bands visible marked the gelatinase activity of each proteinase. Protein band intensities were determined by densitometry as described earlier [
