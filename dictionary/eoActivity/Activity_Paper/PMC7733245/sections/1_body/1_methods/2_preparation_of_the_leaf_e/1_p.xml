<p id="Par18">Fresh leaves were washed with distilled water and chopped into small fragments of approximately 20 g each. Three different extraction methods were performed using different solvents at a ratio of 1:5 (w/v): 1) 100% (v/v) methanol, 2) 50% (v/v) methanol, and 3) 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0. All extractions were performed by grinding a sample of 20 g with the respective solvent using an ULTRA-TURRAX T25 (IKA®Labortechnik) grinder, followed by agitation for 4 h at 4 °C. Both extracts containing methanol were evaporated in a bath at 60 °C (Kottermann) whereas the aqueous extracts were desalted through filtration using 3 kDa membrane centricons and centrifuged at 2000
