<p id="Par39">Results indicated that all treatments induce high significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) when compared to control. Contrasting to the cell proliferation assays, significant differences were observed between 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> and 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). While 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> exhibited a wound closure of 19%, 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> was less effective in inhibiting cell invasiveness, with 37% of wound closure, which was significantly higher than deoxycycline. Under these conditions, 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> yielded a cell viability of 45% and 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> of 35% (data not shown).
