<p id="Par36">To investigate whether the effect of the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts inhibited colon cancer cell growth, we tested different concentrations of the selected 50% (v/v) methanolic 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the proportion of HT29 living cells after growth in the presence of 10, 25 and 50 μg dry weight/mL 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts, obtained after staining with MTT (which can only be metabolized by living cells). The results indicate that a 2-day exposure to the 50% (v/v) methanolic extract from both studied 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species did induce a significant reduction (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.001) in cancer cell growth when compared to controls. Additionally, this reduction was highly dose-dependent, with higher concentrations leading a significantly higher inhibition than the previous (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Remarkably, even though it has been suggested that 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> is the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species with the lowest toxicity, our results indicate that there were no significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) between 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> and 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> extracts for all the tested concentrations. Being dose-dependent, the results point to an EC50 around 25 μg dry weight/mL for the 50% (v/v) methanolic extracts (
 <italic>A. vera</italic>: 24.27 μg and 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>: 26.8 μg).
