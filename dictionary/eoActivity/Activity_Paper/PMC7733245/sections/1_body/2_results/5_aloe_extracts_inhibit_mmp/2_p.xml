<p id="Par41">When analyzing the lanes of the extracellular media exposed to the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts, we can perceive that, after exposure to the 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts, MMP-9 and MMP-2 enzymatic activities were inhibited, in both forms, pro-enzyme and active form, with a more pronounced inhibitory specificity of both 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species towards MMP-9. In order to comprehend if the observed inhibitory activities were due to direct binding of 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extract components to MMP-9, we further tested their inhibitory activity concerning this enzyme. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (c) illustrates the commercial MMP-9 (Sigma) activities in the presence of 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> or 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> extracts, expressed in percentage of controls. As observed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (c), both 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> extracts reduced MMP-9 activity directly, but this inhibition was higher for 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than for 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
