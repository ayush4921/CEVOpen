<p id="Par32">Phenolic compounds were already described as the second major class of compounds found in 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], second only to polysaccharides (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (b)). Regarding the results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (b), corresponding to total phenols present per extraction, it is clear that the extraction with 50% (v/v) methanol yields higher amounts of total phenolic in 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> extraction (26.19 μg/g), whereas for 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> the extraction with 100% (v/v) methanol yielded the highest amounts (16.48 μg/g), in a significant manner (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Albeit in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (b) 
 <italic>A. vera</italic> presented more phenolic compounds (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) when compared to 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic>, when evaluating the specific group of anthraquinones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (d)), 
 <italic>A. arborescens</italic> had a significant higher content in the methanolic extractions.
