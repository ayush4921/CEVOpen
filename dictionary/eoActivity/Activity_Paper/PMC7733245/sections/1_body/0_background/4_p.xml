<p id="Par15">Another important factor to consider is the method of functioning of this genus’ bioactivities. Currently, a particular group of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) named gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) is greatly associated to cancer invasion through degradation of the cellular matrix, and the consequent release of cancer cells via proteolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Since MMP-9 activities have also been closely associated to inflammation and delay in wound closure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] it is very likely that 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> compounds could target these gelatinases. Indeed, concerning inflammation, 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> extracts are recognized to down regulate metalloproteinase expression, precisely MMP-9, which contributes to the extracellular matrix degradation when recruited by cytokines to inflammation sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Hence, it is quite probable that 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species might inhibit enzymatic activity of MMP-2 (72 kDa) and MMP-9 (92 kDa) in cancer-related situations. However, to our knowledge there has been no link established between gelatinase activity inhibition induced by 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> plants and cancer.
