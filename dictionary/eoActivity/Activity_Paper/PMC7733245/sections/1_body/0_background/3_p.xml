<p id="Par14">Today, 
 <italic>A. barbadensis</italic> Mill. (
 <italic>A. vera</italic>) is incontestably the most common species of 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> used worldwide, often incorrectly mentioned to as the one with the highest bioactivities in anecdotal reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Yet, there are about 500 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> species documented, from which just a small fraction has reported ethnomedicinal uses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Additionally, the phenotype similarities among species are enormously high, inducing people to use frequently the wrong species. Hence, because of its huge medicinal, cosmetic and other demands there is a high possibility that some species may often be mistakenly identified for different medicinal usages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On the other hand, the use of single specific phytochemical derived from 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> instead of the crude and/or standardized extracts could affect the overall bioactivities since it has been shown that many components in 
 <italic>Aloe</italic> act synergistically with the remaining constituents in the plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this sense, it also noteworthy to state that there is an overall lack of consistency regarding the type of extractions to use. Several works report the use of aqueous extracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] whilst others mention to use alcoholic or organic solvents like acetone or methanol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Taking into account that 
 <italic>Aloe</italic>â€™s main phytochemical groups vary from phenols to proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins and organic and inorganic compounds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it is relevant to explore different types of extractions.
