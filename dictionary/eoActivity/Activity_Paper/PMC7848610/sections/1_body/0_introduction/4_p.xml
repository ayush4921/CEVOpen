 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Oxidative stress as a result of hypoxia causes mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by reduction in mitochondrial mass, change in membrane potential and change in oxidative proteins activities [
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Cerebral hypoxia leads to various physiological dysfunctions such as oxidative stress and excitotoxicity, which culminate in the death of neuronal and non-neuronal cells [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In cerebral ischemia, excitotoxicity which is characterized by an increase in glutamate level accompanied by a decrease in glutamine level is observed. The decrement in the amount of glutamine has been explained to be due to the inhibition of glutamine synthetase [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Excitotoxicity induced marked expression of several pro-oxidant enzymes or mediators and therefore, alter brain synaptic plasticity and causes neurological dysfunction [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Glutamine synthetase catalyzes the condensation of glutamate and ammonia to form glutamine in an ATP-dependent mechanism [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in other to mop up excess glutamate. Glutamine synthetase is highly expressed in astrocytes compared to other cells in the central nervous system [
