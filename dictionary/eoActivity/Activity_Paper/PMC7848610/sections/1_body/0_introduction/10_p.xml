<p id="par0070">Anoxic condition (chronic hypoxia) was employed in this study to mimic the oxygen deprivation in the situation of cerebral ischemia. In cerebral ischemia, the infarct zone has an ischemic core where the death of neurons is detected but the penumbra region (surrounding the ischemic core) does not immediately experience cell death and can be salvageable. In this study, we evaluate the antioxidative potential of TT to mitigate anoxia-induced bioenergetic disturbance in primary astrocytes, as well as examine the role of its phytoconstitutents to optimize human glutamate synthetase (hGS) in abating excitotoxicity through molecular docking.</p>
