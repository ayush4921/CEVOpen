<p id="par0265">There was a significant reduction (p &lt; 0.05) in viable astrocytes after 3 h of anoxia treatment compared to control (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>b). This showed that anoxia may result in a reduction of metabolic activity which could be a contributory mechanism in causing the death of cells. When cells were treated with TT before subjecting them to 3 h anoxic condition, the total number of viable cells was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than untreated cells. This implied that TT protected cells against anoxic injury and death.
