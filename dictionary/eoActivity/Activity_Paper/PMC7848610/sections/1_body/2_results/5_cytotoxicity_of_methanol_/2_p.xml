 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>a. Compared with the control (0.01 % DMSO), the three concentrations of TT (0.5 μg/mL, 1.0 μg/mL and 10.0 μg/mL) showed no cytotoxicity (p &lt; 0.05). This implied that the extract did not have deleterious effects on the viability of astrocytes up to10 μg/mL.
