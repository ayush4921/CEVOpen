<p id="par0250">The survival rate of astrocytes following anoxic conditions (severe hypoxia) is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. When astrocytes were subjected to anoxia for 3 h (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>a), the cell death was 15 % compared to normoxia (p &lt; 0.01), and when the severe hypoxic exposure was for 6 h, 55 % of astrocytic cell death occurred (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>b) compared to that in the normoxia condition (p &lt; 0.01). With 3 h anoxia exposure, a larger number of astrocytes with altered star shape were observed suggesting that they were morphologically impaired live cells. Therefore for further experiments, the 3 h anoxia where cells were morphologically impaired with less cell death was used because it was important to have morphologically impaired viable cells to test the neuroprotective property of TT.
