<p id="par0320">The improved activity of the protein by ligands could further be confirmed by the formation of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction [

 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with hGS was confirmed through the formation of hydrogen bonds with the formation of hydrophobic interaction and salt bridge in the neighborhood of the hydrogen bond. In this case, the side chain of the polar amino acid (SER257) participated in the hydrogen bond formation which corroborated the findings of Stojanovic and Zaric [
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Using the following criteria; “H-A distance &lt;2.7 Å, D-A distance &lt;3.3 Å, D-H-A angle &gt;90° and carbon atoms separated by &lt;3.9 Å” SER257 is the only amino acid that is truly interacting with the ligand through hydrogen bonding, whereas, GLY132 is only interacting through hydrophobic contact [

 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Also, the shorter distance of the side chains to the ligand promote the formation of hydrogen bond and this may be due to the closeness of the rings of the ligand to the side chain residue (SER257) of the protein [
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Therefore, the interaction of aridanin with hGS may improve its activity by positioning it to effectively condense ammonia and glutamate to form glutamine.
