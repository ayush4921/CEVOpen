<p id="par0295">TT demonstrated appreciable radical scavenging and antioxidant activity notably against the highly damaging hydroxyl radical and against lipid peroxidation which is a major culprit in the etiology of many brain pathologies. The effectiveness of TT could be due to the presence of both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. The performance of TT in the various antioxidant tests with different underlying antioxidative mechanisms highlights its efficacy. Antioxidants play a vital role in reducing oxidative processes. The brain is susceptible to damage by oxidative injury and is also a target of lipid peroxidation owing to its high metabolic rate and high levels of polyunsaturated lipids [

As observed in this study, the lipid peroxidation inhibitory and protein anti-denaturation activities of TT shows the ability of TT to prevent oxidative damage to biomolecules. The significant antioxidant activity of TT could be related to its reduction of anoxia-induced bioenergetic disturbance in astrocytes observed in this study.
