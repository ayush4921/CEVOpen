<p id="par0315">Needless accumulation of glutamate in the extracellular space (outside neuron, astrocytes and glia cells) is toxic to both neuronal and non-neuronal cell (excitotoxicity) and it may cause various neurological disorders if left unabated [
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Park et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] demonstrated that excitatory amino acid transporter 1, EAAC1, (not glutamate transporter 1) is the glutamate transporter responsible for transportation of glutamate in C6 cell and extracellular accumulation of β-amyloid may lead to decrease in EAAC1 expression which may result to excessive glutamate accumulation seen in Alzheimer’s disease. GS regulates excitotoxicity by converting neurotoxic glutamate (cause of excitotoxicity) to harmless glutamine with concomitant hydrolysis of ATP [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Molecular docking was carried out to examine the role of some of the phytochemical constituents (aridanin, ferulic acid, naringenin, and scopoletin) of TT to improve the activity of human glutamine synthetase (hGS). The binding energy of the ligands to the protein is an indicator of the stability of the ligand-protein complex [
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The results indicate the ability of the ligands to improve the activity of hGS. The effectiveness of the ligands is shown by the minimum binding energy in the following order; aridanin &gt; naringenin &gt; scopolectin &gt; ferulic acid.
