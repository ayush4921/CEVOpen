<p id="par0300">In the present study, anoxia was employed to mimic the events that leads to changes in biochemical and morphological properties of cells in the penumbra region of ischemic brain and to determine what happens to cell metabolism and viability after chronic oxygen deprivation. The astrocytes were also cultured and placed in an anoxic chamber without removing dissolved glucose. Glucose and other nutrients of cell culture were retained in the cultured media and there was no flow of new media after anoxia. In the penumbra region of the ischemic zone, cross-talk between the neurons and astrocytes is vital for the survival of neurons, so maintaining astrocyte viability is critical. Viability of astrocytes support synaptic modification and neurite outgrowth to compensate for neuron loss during ischemic insult [
