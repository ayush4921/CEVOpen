<p id="par0110">Benzie and Strain [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] method was followed for determining FRAP value of TT. This assay is based on the diminution of ferric iron-TPTZ complex (Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-TPTZ) by antioxidants to its ferrous form [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This reduction is monitored spectrohotometrically by measuring the change in absorbance at 593 nm. FRAP reagent solution containing 300 mM acetate buffer, 10 mM TPTZ in 40 mMHCl, 20 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>.6H
 <sub>2</sub>O (10:1:1, respectively) was prepared. FRAP reagent (3 mL) was mixed with 100 μL TT (1 mg/mL) and incubated for 30 min incubation at 37
 <sup>º</sup>C. The absorbance was then taken at 593 nm and FRAP value was extrapolated from a linear graph of FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> and expressed as mmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> equivalents per g dry weight.
