<p id="par0215">Docking study was carried out in order to examine the activity of some phytcompounds in TT against excitotoxicity. Pathophysiological mechanisms observed in cerebral ischemic stroke are multifactorial and involve both neuronal and non-neuronal cell dysfunction [

 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Glutamine synthetase (GS) catalyzes the biosynthesis of glutamine from glutamate and ammonia. In the human brain, GS regulates excitotoxicity by converting neurotoxic glutamate (cause of excitotoxicity) to harmless glutamine with simultaneous hydrolysis of ATP [
