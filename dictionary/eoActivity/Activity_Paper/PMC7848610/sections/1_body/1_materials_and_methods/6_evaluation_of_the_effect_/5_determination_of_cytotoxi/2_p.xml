<p id="par0175">Astrocytes were seeded onto a 24 well-plate (Corning Flat Bottom Transparent Polystyrol well plate) at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well and were allowed to stay for 14 h at 37
 <sup>º</sup>C in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. The cells (n = 3) were treated for 24 h with 0.5, 1 and 10 μg/mL of TT dissolved in 0.01 % DMSO in the culture medium. Treatment with DMSO (0.01 % v/v culture medium) alone serves as the control. Thereafter, MTT assay was carried out.
