<p id="par0165">The live/dead assay is used for assessing cell viability/death and was carried out using a live/dead viability/cytotoxicity assay kit for mammalian cells (Invitrogen Detection Technologies, Thermofisher, UK) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. This method is used for assessing cell viability/death in live cell culture of cells. It uses two components, namely; Calcein AM (CaAM), which is component A and Ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1), which is component B. Dead cells are characterized by intense fluorescence at over 600 nm and little fluorescence around 530 nm.</p>
