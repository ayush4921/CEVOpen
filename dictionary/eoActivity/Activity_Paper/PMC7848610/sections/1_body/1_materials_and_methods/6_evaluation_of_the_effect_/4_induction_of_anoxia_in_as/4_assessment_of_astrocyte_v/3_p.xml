<p id="par0170">Astrocytes seeded in an 8-well chamber slide were allowed to adhere and grow to confluence for 14 h at 37 °C in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Thereafter, cells were placed in a normoxic or severe hypoxic condition for 3 and 6 h. After 3 and 6 h, 100 μL of EthD-1 (1 μL/mL) and CaAM (0.2 μL/mL) were separately prepared in cell media (MEM), added to the cells, and then, incubated at 37
 <sup>º</sup>C for 10 min. Fluorescent images of the cells were taken at excitation/emission(ex/em) wavelength of 495 nm/515 nm for the green filter (live cells) and ex/em wavelength of 495 nm/635 nm for the red filter (dead cells) using an Invitrogen Floid microscope (Fisher Scientific, Sweden). Percentage cell death was calculated to get the number of dead cells.
