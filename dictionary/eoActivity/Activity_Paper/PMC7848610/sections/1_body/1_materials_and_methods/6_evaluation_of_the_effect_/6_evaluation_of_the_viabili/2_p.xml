<p id="par0190">Cells (astrocytes) were seeded in a 24 well-plate at a density of 5 * 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well (n = 3) and allowed to stay for 14 h at 37
 <sup>º</sup>C in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. Treatment with TT was performed 4 h before exposure to either 3 h normoxic (normoxia) or anoxic (anoxia) conditions. Two concentrations of TT (1 μg/mL and 10 μg/mL) were used and the treatments were as follows: cells treated with 1 μg/mL TT prior to anoxia (anoxia + TT 1 μg/mL); cells treated with 10 μg/mL TT prior to anoxia (anoxia + TT 10 μg/mL); cells treated with 10 μg/mL TT prior to normoxia (normoxia + TT 10 μg/mL). DMSO was used as a vehicle for TT.
