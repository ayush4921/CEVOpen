  <p>Effect of methanol fruit extract of 
   <italic>Tetrapleura tetraptera</italic> (TT) on cell viability using the MTT method. 
   <bold>(a)</bold> Effect of TT on cell viability of astrocytes. Astrocytes were treated for 24 h with varying concentrations of TT to assess its cytotoxicity using MTT method. There was no cell death observed at all doses. Bars with the same letters are not significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) compared to control. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> Effect of TT pretreatment on the viability of astrocytes after 3 h normoxia and anoxia. A significant increase in viable cells indicated that astrocytes were protected during an anoxic condition when pretreated with TT. Each bar in (a) and (b) is expressed as mean Â± SD (n = 3).
