   <bold>(a)</bold> 3D structure of interaction between protein (hGS) and ligand (aridanin); 
   <bold>(b)</bold> 3D structure of interaction between hGS and aridanin showing the participating amino acid residue in the protein binding pocket. In (a) and (b): structure in gold colour represent the ligand (aridanin); blue (light and deep) represent amino acid residues from the binding pocket of the protein (hGS); blue line and blue number 1 and 2 represent hydrogen bond; dash and full yellow line represents salt bridge; dash grey lines in (a) and full grey lines which are numbered 1 to 10 in (b) represents hydrophobic interactions.
