    "Oleoresins are a mixture of volatile and nonvolatile components of concentrated forms of wholesome products. Even though there are several reports on the effect of spice or spice components on Alzheimer's disease, there are no studies on the effect of spice oleoresins. Hence, this study investigates the effect of pepper, chili, and turmeric oleoresins in Alzheimer's type of cognitive impairment in the rat model. The animals were grouped into six groups with six animals in each. They were (i) normal, (ii) scopolamine, (iii) scopolamine + pepper oleoresin, (iv) scopolamine + turmeric oleoresin, (v) scopolamine + chili oleoresin and (vi) scopolamine + donepezil for 13 days. Learning memory and acquisition memory were evaluated by a Morris water maze, and the locomotor activity was assessed by an actophotometer. Biochemical parameters such as AChE, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were studied. The brain histology was also studied. The scopolamine treatment significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.05) elevated the locomotor activity and escape latency time and reduced the time spent in the target quadrant, which was reversed in the case of the oleoresin treatment. Scopolamine-mediated changes in AChE, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were improved after the treatment with oleoresins. Among the three oleoresins, chili oleoresin were the most effective in behavioral activity, brain biomarkers, and recovery of antioxidant capacities when compared to the drug treatment. Chili and pepper oleoresins improved the protection against hippocampal damage. These oleoresins can be potent preventive/therapeutic agents against Alzheimer's disease. This study confirms the effect of spice oleoresins in Alzheimer's disease condition."
