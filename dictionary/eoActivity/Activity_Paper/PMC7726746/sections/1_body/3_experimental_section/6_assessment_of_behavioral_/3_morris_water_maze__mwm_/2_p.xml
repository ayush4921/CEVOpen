<p>The MWM evaluates spatial learning and memory. Animals were trained in a circular pool (180 cm diameter and 60 cm depth) with a platform. The pool was divided into four equal quadrants (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). One of the quadrants was used as the starting point (same for all of the trials). The pool was kept in the darkroom and filled with water to a 40 cm depth. A movable platform was placed in the pool below the 2 cm water level to analyze the escape latency time (ELT). Animals were trained on 8thâ€“11th days, and ELT (time taken to locate the hidden platform by the animals) was recorded, which gave the index of learning. The rats were allowed to swim for 2 min to find the platform; if they failed, they were navigated onto the platform and allowed to remain on the platform for 20 s. On the 12th day, the platform was removed and rats were allowed to explore the platform for 90 s. The time spent in the target quadrant (TSTQ) was recorded, which gave the index of retrieval.
