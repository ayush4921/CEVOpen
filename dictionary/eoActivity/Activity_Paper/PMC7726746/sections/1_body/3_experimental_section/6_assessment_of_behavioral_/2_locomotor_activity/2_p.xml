<p>The locomotor activity was analyzed by a digital actophotometer (INCO Photo-Actometer, Instruments and Chemicals Pvt. Ltd., Ambala, India). The actophotometer consisted of a closed arena with infrared light-sensitive photocells. Animals were kept inside the closed arena and observed for 5 min. The light beam in the actophotometer cut or crossed by the animals was recorded and expressed as counts per 5 min. The apparatus was kept in a dark, sound-attenuated, and ventilated room to avoid external disturbance, which affects the animal movement.
