<p>All of the animals were euthanized in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> chamber with a flowmeter and a regulator (AIMS, New York) at the end of the experimental period, and the blood was collected and allowed to clot to obtain the serum. The serum was obtained after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min and stored at −80 °C for further biochemical analysis. The brain was also harvested and fixed in 10% (v/v) formalin to study histology.
