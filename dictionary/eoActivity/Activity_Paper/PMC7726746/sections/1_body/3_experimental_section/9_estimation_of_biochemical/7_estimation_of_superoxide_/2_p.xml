 </sup> Pyrogallol solution (0.1 mL of 2.6 mM) in 10 mM HCL was added to 2.8 mL of 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mL of the homogenate or serum. The rate of increase in the absorbance was recorded at 325 nm for 3 min. One unit of SOD is the amount of the enzyme required to inhibit 50% of pyrogallol in a 3 mL mixture. The SOD activity was expressed in U/mg of the protein.
