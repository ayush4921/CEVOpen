<p>The end product of the lipid peroxidation is MDA. The MDA level in the brain homogenate was determined quantitatively by the method described earlier.

 </sup> The tissue homogenate (0.2 mL) was mixed with 0.2 mL of 8.1% (w/v) SDS, 1.5 mL of 20% (v/v) acetic acid (pH adjusted to 3.5), and 1.5 mL of 0.8% (w/v) TBA (aqueous solution). The final volume was adjusted to 4.0 mL with distilled water and incubated for 60 min at 95 Â°C in a water bath. Further, 1 mL of distilled water and 5 mL of a mixture of n-butanol and pyridine (15:1 v/v) were added after cooling. Then the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm, and the organic layer was measured at 532 nm. The MDA concentration was expressed as nmol/mg of the protein.
