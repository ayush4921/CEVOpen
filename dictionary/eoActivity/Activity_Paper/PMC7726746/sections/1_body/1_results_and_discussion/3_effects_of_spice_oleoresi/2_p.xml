<p>On the 6th and 13th days of the assessment of locomotor activity, the interference in locomotion by the treatment oleoresins and of a drug was ruled out. Scopolamine-administered rats showed higher locomotor activity compared to normal control and oleoresin- and drug-administered rats. Chili-oleoresin- and drug-administered rats showed reduced locomotor activity than pepper- and turmeric-oleoresin administered groups. Pepper- and turmeric-oleoresin-administered groups did not show any notable significant changes in locomotor activity (
