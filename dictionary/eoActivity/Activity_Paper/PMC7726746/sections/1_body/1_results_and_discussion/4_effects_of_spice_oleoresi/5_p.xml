<p>In this study, both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities were significantly reduced in the brain homogenate as well as in the serum. In the brain homogenate, SOD was increased slightly after the administration of chili and pepper oleoresins (

 </xref>c,d). SOD and catalase are the most important antioxidant enzymes. The SOD detoxifies the superoxide anions, which cause damage to the cell membrane. On the other hand, catalase detoxifies H

 <sub>2</sub> radicals, which contribute to the oxidative stress in AD.

 </sup> In the present study, the increase in SOD and catalase activities in turmeric and pepper oleoresin groups may be due to the strong antioxidant potential of turmeric and pepper against protein oxidation, glycoxidation, glycation, etc. It was reported that Scopolamine also reduced the catalase level in mice, which was also improved after the treatment with meloxicam and selegiline.
