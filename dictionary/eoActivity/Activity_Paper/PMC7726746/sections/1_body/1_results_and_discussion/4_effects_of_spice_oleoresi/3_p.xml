 </xref>b. The scopolamine-administered rats showed increased MDA levels compared to normal, oleoresin-administered, and standard-drug-administered rats. It was found that there was no significant difference between pepper-, turmeric-, chili-oleoresin-, and drug-administered rats, but they showed slightly higher levels than the normal rats. One of the major and important indicators of neurodegeneration of the brain is lipid peroxidation. Membranes of a neuron contain a large amount of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which help in the transfer of signals by constructing complex structures. Lipids and proteins are the primary target components, which undergo lipid modification by free radicals in neurodegenerative disease.

 </sup> There are many reports on protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation, which lead to damage of the membrane integrity, an essential factor in age-related neurodegenerative disease. They are also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD in humans.

 </sup> In the present study, scopolamine significantly induced peroxidation of lipids and proteins and reduced activities of antioxidants, which indicates an increase in oxidative stress. MDA is a final product of lipid peroxidation, and it is also a measure of free radical generation. The elevation of MDA levels in scopolamine-treated rats indicates the extent of lipid peroxidation in the brain. To evaluate the effect of spice oleoresins on lipid peroxidation in the brain, the MDA level was determined. The MDA level significantly reversed in the case of oleoresin-treated rats, indicating the reduced lipid peroxidation.
