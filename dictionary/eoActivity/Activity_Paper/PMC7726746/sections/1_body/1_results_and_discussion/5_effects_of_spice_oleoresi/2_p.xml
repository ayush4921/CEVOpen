<p>In this study, brain tissue samples were collected and subjected to tissue H&amp;E staining for the illustration of the neuroprotective effect of oleoresins. After 13 consecutive days of scopolamine treatment, neuronal loss, hypoperfusion, and hippocampal atrophy were observed in the hippocampal area. Treatment with spice oleoresins showed an improvement in the hippocampal damage as well as neuroprotection. Among all spice oleoresins, pepper and chili showed a significant effect compared to the turmeric-treated group on neuronal damage. Aggregation of amyloid-beta, the formation of tau protein plaques, apoptosis of neuronal cells, etc., are the essential features in the pathology of the brain during neuronal damage.
