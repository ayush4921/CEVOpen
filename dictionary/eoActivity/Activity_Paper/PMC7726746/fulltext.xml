of concentrated forms of wholesome products. Even though there are
several reports on the effect of spice or spice components on Alzheimer&#x02019;s
disease, there are no studies on the effect of spice oleoresins. Hence,
this study investigates the effect of pepper, chili, and turmeric
oleoresins in Alzheimer&#x02019;s type of cognitive impairment in the
rat model. The animals were grouped into six groups with six animals
in each. They were (i) normal, (ii) scopolamine, (iii) scopolamine
+ pepper oleoresin, (iv) scopolamine + turmeric oleoresin, (v) scopolamine
+ chili oleoresin and (vi) scopolamine + donepezil for 13 days. Learning
memory and acquisition memory were evaluated by a Morris water maze,
and the locomotor activity was assessed by an actophotometer. Biochemical
parameters such as AChE, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione
peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were studied. The brain
histology was also studied. The scopolamine treatment significantly
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) elevated the locomotor activity and
escape latency time and reduced the time spent in the target quadrant,
which was reversed in the case of the oleoresin treatment. Scopolamine-mediated
changes in AChE, malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, glutathione
peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were improved after
the treatment with oleoresins. Among the three oleoresins, chili oleoresin
were the most effective in behavioral activity, brain biomarkers,
and recovery of antioxidant capacities when compared to the drug treatment.
Chili and pepper oleoresins improved the protection against hippocampal
damage. These oleoresins can be potent preventive/therapeutic agents
against Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. This study confirms the effect
of spice oleoresins in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease condition.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c03689</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>ao0c03689</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is the most prevailing neurodegenerative
disease associated with old age, which leads to progressive memory
loss and cognitive impairement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> AD is
characterized by an intracellular and extracellular plaque of &#x003b2;-amyloid
peptide (A&#x003b2;) and intracellular tangles of hyperphosphorylated
tau protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Another hallmark of AD is
the fall off of forebrain cholinergic neurons, and a reduction in
the Ach level leads to cognitive/memory impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> The
mechanism involved in AD includes induction of amyloid plaque deposition,
expression of inflammatory mediators, increase in oxidation stress,
reduction in steroid hormones, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Although
many studies have been done on AD treatment, a promising intervention
for curing the disease remains a challenge. Thus, this present research
focuses on the potential of spice oleoresins as a potent neuroprotective
agent against AD.</p><p>Oleoresin is a mixture of volatile and nonvolatile components.
It is a concentrated form of wholesome products and marketed as spice
drops due to its total pungency and flavor constituents. The oleoresins
can be extracted by solvent extraction of ground spice material with
organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, ethyl acetate,
etc., followed by complete removal of solutions to obtain the oleoresins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Pepper (<italic>Piper nigrum</italic> L) belongs
to the Piperaceae family and is one of the well-known spices globally.
It is commonly used as a household spice as a food additive and condiment.
In addition, it is also used in traditional medicine for various medicinal
purposes in many countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Piperine is
a major alkaloid and a pungent nitrogenous substance present in the
pepper fruit. Pharmacological studies on the activity of piperine
have reported that it has anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> cognitive-enhancing effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> cytoprotective

effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> antiulcer effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> etc. It is also reported that piperine has a
protective effect on neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup></p><p>Turmeric (<italic>Curcuma longa</italic>) is a rhizomatous
perennial plant and belongs to the family Zingiberaceae. It is used
as a spice and coloring agent and in traditional medicine, particularly
in South Asia. Traditionally, it is used for wound healing, inflammation,
asthma, high cholesterol, etc. The main active component of turmeric
is turmerone oil and water-soluble curcuminoids, including curcumin.
The medicinal properties of curcumin have been studied, particularly
on anticancer activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup> It is also reported
that curcumin exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities
and has potential in a transgenic mouse model in AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Curcumin has shown the potential to inhibit the formation of A&#x003b2;
fibril, and destabilizing the preformed fibril can provide protection
in AD and inhibit lipid peroxidation in the rat brain homogenate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> In addition to this, it also inhibits in vitro A&#x003b2; fibril formation
and protects the cells from A&#x003b2; insults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup> This supports that turmeric has potential in AD treatment.</p><p>Chili (<italic>Capsicum annuum</italic><italic>L</italic>) belongs to the family Solanaceae. It is one of the major spices
cultivated worldwide. It has bioactive components with antioxidant
activities such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, polyphenols,
and alkaloids and provides health benefits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Capsaicin is a major active component of chili, which has the potential
for promoting vascular and metabolic health. It was reported that
capsaicin has properties like analgesic, antiarthritic, anticancer,
and antioxidant properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup> The study
has shown that capsicum oleoresin increases the availability of Ach
and suggests that it can be used in the treatment of AD, Parkinson&#x02019;s
disease, myasthenia gravis, ataxia, and senile dementia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup></p><p>Although many anti-AD drugs have been approved by the FDA, they
have adverse effects such as dizziness, tiredness, nausea, vomiting,
heart attack, and stroke. These drugs include AChE inhibitors, anti-inflammatory
drugs, receptor antagonists, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> Thus, the prevention of AD with natural products
has been gaining interest recently. Considering the above points,
this study was aimed to evaluate the effect of spice oleoresins in
Alzheimer&#x02019;s type of cognitive impairment using rat models.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>AD is clinically characterized by a degradation of neurons, decline
in memory, and disturbance in neurobehavior. Although many drugs and
treatments are available, the severity of the disease has not been
under control yet. Therefore, alternative treatments with natural
and herbal supplements are rising to manage the AD. Thus, this study
was designed to examine cognitive and behavioral functions with the
administration of spice oleoresins. A pharmacologically scopolamine-induced
AD model has been used widely for the screening of potential cognition-enhancing
agents. The improvement in cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine
was investigated after the administration of spice oleoresins using
behavior and biochemical parameters.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Effects of Spice Oleoresins on Behavioral Parameters</title><p>On the 6th and 13th days of the assessment of locomotor activity,
the interference in locomotion by the treatment oleoresins and of
a drug was ruled out. Scopolamine-administered rats showed higher
locomotor activity compared to normal control and oleoresin- and drug-administered
rats. Chili-oleoresin- and drug-administered rats showed reduced locomotor
activity than pepper- and turmeric-oleoresin administered groups.
Pepper- and turmeric-oleoresin-administered groups did not show any
notable significant changes in locomotor activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Locomotor and behavioral parameters. (a) Effects of different oleoresins

of the protocol schedule. On the 8th day, there were no significant
changes (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) found in scopolamine-treated
and oleoresin-treated rats, whereas ELT was reduced in donepezil-treated
rats and normal rats among the groups. On the 11th day, ELT was decreased
in all of the groups. There were no significant changes observed between
normal, pepper-treated, and chili-oleoresin-treated groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). On the 12th day of the protocol schedule,
time spent in the target quadrant (TSTQ) was performed, which provided
an index of retrieval. Scopolamine-treated rats showed comparatively
less TSTQ when compared to normal, oleoresin-treated, and donepezil-treated
rats. Although the chili-oleoresin-treated group showed slightly lower
TSTQ, there were no remarkable changes between normal, pepper, turmeric
oleoresin, and donepezil groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b,c). Behavioral
activities such as ELT and TSTQ were studied during the acquisition
(learning ability) and retrieval trials (memory). It is essential
to observe that the Morris water maze (MWM) test investigating spatial
learning and memory was used in detecting changes of the central cholinergic
system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> In the MWM test, rats showed
a significant decrease in day 4 ELT when compared to day 1 ELT. They
showed normal learning ability. In addition, day five assessments
resulted in a significant increase in TSTQ when compared to the time
spent in other quadrants. They showed normal retrieval capacity. This
reveals that scopolamine produced the abnormal learning and memory
process in rats. Therefore, in this study, the design administration
of pepper and chili oleoresins for 13 consecutive days showed significant
attenuation against scopolamine-induced changes in learning and memory
dysfunction. However, the turmeric-oleoresin-treated group produce
showed less significant improvements compared to other oleoresin-treated
groups.</p><p>The result of locomotor activity suggests there was no inference
or sedative effect in MWM. Thus, ELT and TSTQ in MWM purely resulted
in enhanced memory. Therefore, spice oleoresins can improve the long-term
memory induced by scopolamine.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Effects of Spice Oleoresins on Biochemical Parameters</title><p>The AChE activity was found to be prolonged in scopolamine-administered
rats compared to that in normal animals. The activity was reduced
5&#x02013;15% in pepper-, turmeric-oleoresin- and drug-administered
rats. However, 50% of AChE was reduced in rats administered with chili
oleoresin. There was no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) found among the other groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>a). AChE is a major brain biomarker associated
with AD. This enzyme is responsible for the degradation of acethylcholine.
AChE hydrolyzes ACh to choline and acetate and terminates its effect
at cholinergic synapses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> AChE activity
was measured to explore the effect of spice oleoresins on the cholinergic
function, which governs vital aspects of memory and other cognitive
functions. In this study, scopolamine elevates AChE activity, an enzyme
responsible for the deterioration of Ach. The previous research on
the inhibitory effect of pepper oil showed that 93% of AChE activity
was inhibited, with an IC50 value of 5.97 &#x003bc;g/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> Curcuminoids showed the AChE inhibitory effect,
and reported curcuminoids and bisdemethoxycurcumin were able to reduce
60 and 80% of AChE activity, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> An in vitro study on chili oleoresin has reported that the maximum
inhibition (78.3%) of AChE was found at 140 &#x003bc;g/mL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effects of spice oleoresin on biochemical parameters such as AChE

brain, which is represented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>b. The scopolamine-administered rats showed increased
MDA levels compared to normal, oleoresin-administered, and standard-drug-administered
rats. It was found that there was no significant difference between
pepper-, turmeric-, chili-oleoresin-, and drug-administered rats,
but they showed slightly higher levels than the normal rats. One of
the major and important indicators of neurodegeneration of the brain
is lipid peroxidation. Membranes of a neuron contain a large amount
of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which help in the transfer
of signals by constructing complex structures. Lipids and proteins
are the primary target components, which undergo lipid modification
by free radicals in neurodegenerative disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> There are many reports on protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation,
which lead to damage of the membrane integrity, an essential factor
in age-related neurodegenerative disease. They are also implicated
in the pathogenesis of AD in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> In the present
study, scopolamine significantly induced peroxidation of lipids and
proteins and reduced activities of antioxidants, which indicates an
increase in oxidative stress. MDA is a final product of lipid peroxidation,
and it is also a measure of free radical generation. The elevation
of MDA levels in scopolamine-treated rats indicates the extent of
lipid peroxidation in the brain. To evaluate the effect of spice oleoresins
on lipid peroxidation in the brain, the MDA level was determined.
The MDA level significantly reversed in the case of oleoresin-treated
rats, indicating the reduced lipid peroxidation.</p><p>In this study, GSH is decreased significantly in scopolamine-treated
rats compared to that in normal animals. It was increased in the chili
oleoresin group compared to pepper-turmeric-oleoresin-administered
rats, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>c. Similarly, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) is also found to
be slightly less in scopolamine-treated rats compared to that in the
normal group. There is no significant difference in other groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>d). GSH is a cellular
antioxidant and provides protection from oxidation stress. It is a
tripeptide of glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> GPx catalyzes the reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by GSH, which can protect the cells from damage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> The depletion of GSH and GPx in scopolamine-treated rats may be
due to the elevation of the MDA level in the brain. GSH is considered
as the first-defense endogenous antioxidant against oxidative stress
produced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> The present
study is consistent with previous studies; the GSH and GPx levels
decreased with scopolamine administration; further, they were slightly
increased with co-administration of spice oleoresins.</p><p>In this study, both superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities
were significantly reduced in the brain homogenate as well as in the
serum. In the brain homogenate, SOD was increased slightly after the
administration of chili and pepper oleoresins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>a). There was no significant difference found
in SOD activity in the serum in all of the groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>b). In both the brain homogenate
and the serum, the catalase activity was slightly higher in the turmeric
and pepper oleoresin groups compared to that in chili-oleoresin- and
drug-administered groups. However, there was no significant difference
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) found between the group of oleoresins
(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c,d). SOD
and catalase are the most important antioxidant enzymes. The SOD detoxifies
the superoxide anions, which cause damage to the cell membrane. On
the other hand, catalase detoxifies H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> radicals,
which contribute to the oxidative stress in AD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> In the present study, the increase in SOD and catalase
activities in turmeric and pepper oleoresin groups may be due to the
strong antioxidant potential of turmeric and pepper against protein
oxidation, glycoxidation, glycation, etc. It was reported that Scopolamine
also reduced the catalase level in mice, which was also improved after
the treatment with meloxicam and selegiline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Effect of spice oleoresins on the brain histology at the CA1 region:

also suggests that spice oleoresins possess neuroprotective effects

induced by scopolamine. The antioxidant activity and AChE inhibition
reveal the contributory effect of spice oleoresins against dementia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>Scopolamine induction caused Alzheimer&#x02019;s-type dementia by

associated with cognitive and memory impairments. Based on this study,
the major biomarkers like beta-amyloid and inflammatory cytokines
can be further evaluated to affirm and uphold the strong evidence
of spice oleoresins in the long-term injected-scopolamine-mediated
changes. Spice oleoresins improve the antioxidant level and reduce
the lipid peroxidation induced by scopolamine compared to drug donepezil
and reversed scopolamine-mediated changes. Thus, spice oleoresins
could be potential candidates for the treatment of cognitive impairment
in AD.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Spice Oleoresins</title><p>Black pepper (Panniyur), turmeric
