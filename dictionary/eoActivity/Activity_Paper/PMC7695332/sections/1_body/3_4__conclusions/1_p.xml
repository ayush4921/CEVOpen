<p>The recent study assessed the detergency properties along with chemical confirmation of the most cited detergent plant in northern Thailand and its alternative propagation for active ingredient production using plant tissue culture. The results from detergent abilities, physiochemical properties, and phytochemical analysis showed the positive detection of saponins present in 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> plant extracts. Using IAA at 2.0 mg/L concentration in MS media could produce callus that yielded metabolites of different forms. Further study can investigate in-depth on derivatives of saponin, identification, and structure elucidation.
