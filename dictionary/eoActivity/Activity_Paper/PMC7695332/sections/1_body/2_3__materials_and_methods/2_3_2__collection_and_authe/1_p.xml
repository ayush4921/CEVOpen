<p>All plant materials used in this study were collected from the forest reserve restored by the Huai Hong Khrai Royal Development Study Centre (HHKC) during the fields study reported elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Plant species confirmation was done by comparison the specimen with those deposited at plant collection library of the ethnobotanical laboratory, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University (CMU). The specimens were deposited at Plant Bioactive Compound Laboratory Herbarium (BACH), Faculty of Agriculture with the voucher number JW009-011. The utilized parts, including: pericarp of 
 <italic>Sapindus rarak</italic> (family Sapindaceae), fruit of 
 <italic>Acacia concinna</italic> (family Fabaceae) and Leaves of 
 <italic>Litsea glutinosa</italic> (family Lauraceae) were used in this study. The plant parts were separated, cleaned and dried at 40 Â°C for 72 h in hot-air oven (WGLL-125BE, Huanghua faithful, Hebei, China). Thereafter, they were grounded into powder using a hand-held grinder (Philips, The Netherlands) at speed level 1 prior to solvent extraction and stored in an air-tight container for further studies. To screen saponin content in plant materials, dry sample powder 0.05 g was suspended in 80% methanol (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and extracted using ultrasonication. Unless otherwise stated, the supernatant was used to in colorimetric method for saponin determination later described.
