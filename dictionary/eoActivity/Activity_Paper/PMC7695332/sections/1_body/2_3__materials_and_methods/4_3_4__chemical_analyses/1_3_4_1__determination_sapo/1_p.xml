<p>The method of Makkar [
 <xref rid="B75-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] with slight modification was used to determine the total saponin content in plant materials. Briefly, 50 µL of plant extract was mixed with 2.5 mL sulfuric acid 72% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>) and 0.1 mL, 8% vanillin solution in ethanol. The mixtures were incubated in a water bath at 60 °C for 10 min and then cooled in cold water. The absorbance of sample was measured at 544 nm using SPECTROstar Nano Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany). Diosgenin was used as the reference standard with saponin content expressed as mg Diosgenin Equivalents (DE) per gram extract (mg DE/g extract). The final quantification of the phytochemicals is the value of mean ± SD of three measurements.
