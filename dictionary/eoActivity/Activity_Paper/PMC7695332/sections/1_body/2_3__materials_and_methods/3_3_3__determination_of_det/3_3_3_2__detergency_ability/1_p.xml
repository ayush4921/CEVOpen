<p>The detergent abilities of the crude extract were evaluated following the method of Pradhan and Bhattacharyya [
 <xref rid="B74-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>] with some modifications. The test was conducted using 5 × 5 cm cotton cloth pieces were cleaned with a 5% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) solution, then dried. The samples were suspended in artificial sebum (consisting of 1 g coconut oil and 1 g paraffin wax in 100 mL hexane solution) and the mixture was shaken for 15 min. Then samples were removed and left to dryness at room temperature. In the next step, oil-coated materials were divided into two equal portions, the first part was washed with 10 mL of the 5 and 10% crude extracts (both methanol and water fractions) and the second group was cleaned with deionized water (control). After drying, the resided sebum on samples was extracted with 20 mL hexane for 15 min and the materials were removed. After evaporated off to dryness, the sebum content was weighed. Finally, the percentage of detergency ability in both cases was calculated using the following equation; 
 <disp-formula>Detergency Ability = 100 − (T/C × 100)
