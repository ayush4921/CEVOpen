<p>HPTLC finger printing study was carried out according to the methods of Avula et al. [

 <xref rid="B68-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The HPTLC system comprising of Linomat 5 automatic applicator, a twin trough plate development chamber, Camag TLC scanner 3 and winCATS 4 software version 2.5.18262.1 (CAMAG, Muttenz, Switzerland) were used. The methanolic extract of the callus, detergent plants (10 μL) and 3 μL of standards (Diosgenin and 
 <italic>Quillaja</italic> saponins) were spotted separately in form of bands having band width of 5 mm on glass plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) with silica gel 60 F
 <sub>254</sub> (20 × 10 cm), using a Hamilton syringe with Linomat 5 applicator attached to CAMAG HPTLC system. The plate was accommodated with 7 tracks and all samples were applied according to the following settings: 8 mm from the bottom of the plate, band width 8 mm; application volume 3–10 µL. All remaining measurement parameters were left at default settings. Chamber saturation was done using 20 × 10 cm Whatman filter paper for 20 min. Development solvent was the lower layer of chloroform: glacial acetic acid: methanol: H
 <sub>2</sub>O (6.4:3.2:1.2:0.8) till 80 mm from the lower edge of the plate. Then chromatogram was developed in the twin trough glass chamber (20 × 10 cm) presaturated with the mobile phase. Developed plates were immersed in Anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent, and dried on heat plate for 5 min at 100 °C. The dried plates were kept in a photo documentation chamber and captured the images in visible light, UV 366 nm and UV 254 nm.
