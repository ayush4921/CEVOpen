<p>In general, saponins from the same plant species can be found in the different forms of molecular structures [
 <xref rid="B42-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, the variation of the structures could lead to the variety of physicochemical properties and biological activity [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The study of Senguttuvan and Subramaniam [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] reported the HPTLC fingerprints of various metabolites in 
 <italic>Hypochaeris radicata</italic> L. and saponins can detected by using the mobile phase consisting of chloroform: glacial acetic acid: methanol: water. The methanolic plant extracts displayed different Rf pattern and the root extract attained the greater number of saponins than the leaf extracts. Further, study of Das et al. [
 <xref rid="B69-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] showed the variable in the Rf peaks of HPTLC chromatograms of 
 <italic>Diplazium esculentum</italic> Retz. and suggested that the ethanolic extract could yield variety of phenolics, flavonoids, and saponins than those found in the aqueous extract. The type of saponin in the extract was then confirmed by mass spectrometry.
