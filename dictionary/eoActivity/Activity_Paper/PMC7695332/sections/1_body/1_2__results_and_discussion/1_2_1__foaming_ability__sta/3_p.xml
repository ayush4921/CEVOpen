<p>Cleansing as described by the removal of dirt, soil, and grease, is the key important property of the common surfactants and detergency ability. This property is influenced by the content of surfactant ingredients in the extracted samples. From the result in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01521-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, it was observed that methanol extracts gave much higher cleansing ability than that of the aqueous extract in all cases. Among the detergent plants tested, the cleansing ability of 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> was higher at either 5 or 10% than any others detergent plants. Here again, we noticed that such the ability increased with the increasing in the concentrations of all extracts except that of the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> that gave the moderate detergent ability (48.21 Â± 1.71% detergent ability in 5% 
 <italic>v/v</italic> water extract). Saponins have been proven to be the surfactive molecules that reduce surface tension and enhance cleansing ability [

 <italic>A. concinna</italic> pod has been traditionally used in India for bathing due to the formation of lather or foam in water. It also gave excellent cleansing actions on dirt similar to the commercial detergents or soaps [
 <xref rid="B46-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Patel and Talathi [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] found that in herbal shampoo comprising of various aqueous plant extracts, the formulation with 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> extract had higher detergency ability (95.94%) than the extracts of 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic>, 
 <italic>S. mukorossi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic> because of the higher saponin content. There, nonetheless, is no report on the detergent ability of 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> elsewhere.
