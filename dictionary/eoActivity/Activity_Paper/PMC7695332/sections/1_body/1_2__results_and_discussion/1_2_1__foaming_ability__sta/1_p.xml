<p>Foaming ability, stability, and detergency ability of crude plant extracts are illustrated in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01521-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Foam produced by mechanical agitation is typically an unsteady thermodynamic system. Although foam generation has little to do with the cleansing ability of the detergent, it is an important criterion to evaluate detergent. Detergent can increase the ability to displace air from a liquid or solid surface [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. By dissolving the crude detergent plant extracts, both of methanol or water extracts, in DI water at the concentration of 5 and 10% (
 <italic>v/v</italic>), the foaming regeneration of detergent plant extracts showed variable in the results after shaken. The highest foam was found in both types extracts from 
 <italic>S. rarak</italic> (7.1 ± 0.10 cm) and the lowest was found in 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> (1.1 ± 0.06 cm). After 5 min, foam height decreased in all extracts. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] explained that increase in foam height of detergent was due to the increasing in the concentrations and types of the detergents in aqueous solution. In the same study, foam produced by crude saponin extract of 
 <italic>Camellia oleifera</italic> was less than that from the chemical synthesized products (SLS and Tween80) at 0.5% solution concentration. In the same way with the results from Yang et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] who found that the crude saponin extract from 
 <italic>Sapindus mukorossi</italic> showed lower ability of foaming than 0.5% SLS solution but similar to 0.5% Tween80 solution.
