<p>Mass spectroscopy (MS) is the systematics study of mass spectrum with or without fragmentation which is characterized by a relationship between the mass of a given ion and the number of elementary charges that it carries or mass-to-charge ratios (
 <italic>m/z</italic>) and relative abundances [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Mass spectra of any given substances are different in fragmentation patterns. These fragmentation patterns are useful to determine the molar weight and structural information of the unknown molecule [
 <xref rid="B71-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The mass spectra of the methanolic detergent plant extracts and callus of 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> gave the identical peak with the 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 415.6 in positive ion mode with the standard diosgenin (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01521-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Among the vast array of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> data of the samples, many peaks were also found in common (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01521-f004">Figure 4</xref>). In the report of Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] elucidated that the 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> value of 415.3217 was according to the presence protonated aglycone which was the fragmentation of steroidal saponins, 26-
 <italic>O-β</italic>-D-glucopyranosyl-3
 <italic>β</italic>,20
 <italic>α</italic>,26-triol-25(R)-Δ-dienofurostan-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>α</italic>-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→2)-[
 <italic>α</italic>-L-rhamnopyranosyl(1→4)]-
 <italic>β</italic>-D-glucopyranoside (DFE) (
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="plants-09-01521-sch001">Scheme 1</xref>). In another study, fragment of aglycone with the 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> value of 415 was detected in the terrestrinin S (or pseudosapogenins of Type IV) which confirmed diagnostic ions of steroidal saponin [
 <xref rid="B73-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Thus, the CMS 
 <italic>m/z</italic> results of crude saponin extracts from all detergent plants along with the callus produced by 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> tissue in our study could be structurally characterized as the steroidal diagnostic type.
