<p>Identification of the functional groups can provide useful information on their mechanical and chemical properties [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Infrared spectroscopy is used to characterize the specific kind of bounds and the functional groups. The FTIR spectrum of crude plant extracts (prepared in methanol and water) are given in

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-09-01521">Supplementary Materials</xref>. FTIR spectrum of crude methanol or water extracts of the three detergent plants (
 <italic>A. concinna</italic>, 
 <italic>S. rarak</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic>) absorbed light at the wavenumber ranges of 1025–1620 and 2923–3338 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. All detergent plant extracts showed characteristic infrared absorbance of the hydroxyl group (OH) at ~3338.65 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and ~3330.55 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in methanol extracts of 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> and 
 <italic>S. rarak</italic> and the aqueous extracts gave the peaks at wave numbers at ~3335.52 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and ~3261.94 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>A. concinna</italic> and 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic>, respectively. Carbon–hydrogen (C-H) absorption was found at 2923.23 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> only in methanol extract of 
 <italic>L. glutinosa.</italic> The C=C absorbance was observed at 1620.33 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <italic>A. concinna</italic>) and 1606.13 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic>) in the water extracts but was not found in the both extracts of 
 <italic>S. rarak.</italic> Whereas C-O-C absorbance varied from 1035.12 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <italic>S. rarak</italic>) to 1026.26 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <italic>A. concinna</italic>) in the methanol extracts and in the crude aqueous of 
 <italic>S. rarak</italic> ~1034.78 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1033.22 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> in 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic>.
