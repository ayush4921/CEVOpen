<p>Surfactants are surface-active compounds with significant potentials for food-beverage, medicinal, and pharmaceutical industries. In surfactant manufacturing, they can be either chemically synthesized or found naturally in bio-based forms [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The first one is non-biodegradable, can be accumulated in the environment, and therefore is known to be toxic to living organisms [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Consequently, trends are moving towards finding the biological sources of the surfactants [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Biosurfactants can be derived directly from various natural sources including those of microbials, flora, and fauna [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Plant-based surfactants, such as saponins, have gained increasing attention as they are environmentally safe, less toxic, biodegradable, and renewable [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Structurally, saponins are amphipathic molecules consisted of triterpenoids, steroids, and glycosides [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Their aglycone parts are known as genin and sapogenin, which covalently bound to one or more polar molecules of sugar moieties [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Steroidal saponins such as diosgenin had been characterized and found in many plant samples [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Natural surfactants from plant resources are used mainly as detergents for fabric washing, hair, and body detergents with excellent cleansing properties [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; for example, 
 <italic>Quillaja Saponaria</italic> bark is used as a detergent for washing hair and clothes [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 
 <italic>Saponaria officinalis</italic> is known as soap plant [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and 
 <italic>Sapindus saponaria</italic> is manufactured as soap and clothing washing detergent [
 <xref rid="B24-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Some natural saponins have been traditionally used in folk medicines [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The drawback is that the high value phyto-intermediate raw materials are available naturally with limited abundance. Additionally, destructive harvesting may result in resource exhaustion and even nearly extinction from the nature [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. More importantly, the degree functionality of active ingredient also varies upon environmental situations [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Due to these constraints, the sustainable production of raw material should be considered [
 <xref rid="B27-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Plant tissue culture (PTC) is a potential alternative method to traditional plant propagation for retrieving natural products in the ways that multiplying and maintaining higher consistency and greater true-to-type raw material [
 <xref rid="B29-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, this in vitro plant regeneration is also simple and time saving [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The underlaying advantage is that it can also help reducing the invasion of the natural resources and the destruction of biodiversity [
