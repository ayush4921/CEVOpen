<p>In the context of Northern Thai culture, three plant species namely 
 <italic>Sapindus rarak</italic>, 
 <italic>Acacia concinna</italic>, and 
 <italic>Litsea glutinosa</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] are frequently mentioned as plants used in cleansing purposes. Among those, 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> was the most potential as the model plant for further conservation studies [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Belonging to the family Lauraceae, it also contains different kinds of secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, tannins, sterols, and flavonoids, with good capability for medicinal purposes [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Leaf tissue of 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic> comprises of numerous secondary metabolites such as megastigmane diglycoside, roseoside, pinoresinol 3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 2â€²-oxygenated flavone glycoside [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and also natural saponin-surfactant with lists of proven active biofunctionalities [
 <xref rid="B37-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It was also reported to be an endangered species or very rare in Asia, including in the Philippines, Bangladesh, and India [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-01521" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, the assessment of its detergency properties along with chemical characterization have not been reported in the literature. Thus, besides the ultimate aim to evaluate the cleaning properties of 
 <italic>L. glutinosa</italic>, we also assessed the PTC as the alternative raw material propagation for extractable ingredients. The outcome of this study is therefore beneficial for ex situ conservation which inhibits the overexploitation of natural resource and the destruction of local forest to obtain natural material.
