<p id="par0120">An oral acute toxicity study was carried out to evaluate the lethal dose (
 <italic>LD</italic>
 <sub>50</sub>) and perhaps, the immediate side effects, as well as sub-chronic toxicity of AESG. A substance, if poisonous, would likely exhibit its effect within minutes; with the more poisonous substance eliciting toxic effect at relatively low doses [

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], the aqueous leaf extracts of 
 <italic>S. glauca</italic> were tested. Several studies on the acute toxicity of a number of related and unrelated plants have been reported [

 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] also reported that the stem-bark ethanol extract of 
 <italic>S. versicolor</italic> (which belongs to the same family 
 <italic>Simaroubaceae</italic>), administered to 
 <italic>Wistar</italic> rats for 30 days did not result to any observable signs of toxicity or mortality. In the present study, oral acute administration of AESG to rats at doses up to 5000 mg/kg did not result to fatality; as such, AESG is relatively safe with little or no noticeable immediate toxic effect.
