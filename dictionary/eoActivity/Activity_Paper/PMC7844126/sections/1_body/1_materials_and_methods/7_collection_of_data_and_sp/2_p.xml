<p id="par0075">At the end of the study, the rats were fasted overnight; then anesthetized, using a chloroform saturated chamber and sacrificed. The thoracic and abdominal regions were opened up and blood was withdrawn from the hepatic portal vein or thoracic aorta, using a 5 mL syringe; emptied into a 5 mL heparinized specimen bottle. The blood was then centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 15 min to obtain a clear supernatant (Plasma) that was stored at -18Â°c until required for biochemical analyses; conducted out within a few days. One-gramme portion of relevant organs was excised, cleared off connective tissues, and homogenized in a 5 mL normal saline. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3500 rpm/10 min to obtain a clear supernatant; relevant biochemical analyses were conducted. The liver, kidney, and heart organs were harvested and stored in formal saline solution (0.9 g of NaCl in 90 mL of distilled water and mixed with 10 mL of 40 % formalin to obtain a final volume of 100 mL) for histopathology evaluation.</p>
