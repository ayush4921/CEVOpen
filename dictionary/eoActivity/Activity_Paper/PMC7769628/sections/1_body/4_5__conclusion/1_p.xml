<p>The PJ methanolic fraction has high contents of procyanidin and has a potential 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-amylase and lipase inhibitory activity compared to Acarbose and Orlistat drugs. However, the PJ acetone, hexane, and methanol fractions have broad-spectrum antibacterial agents while the acetone fraction revealed potent antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. At low concentrations, hexane and acetone fractions had potent cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity against HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Moreover, PJ acetone, hexane, and methanol fractions can serve as an effective source of natural products to develop new antiobesity, anticancer, antimicrobial, and hypoglycemic agents.
