<p>Antimicrobial activity evaluation of PJ solvent fractions showed that the methanolic fraction exhibited the growth only of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> with MIC values of 25 and 12.5 mg/ml, respectively, while the acetone fraction inhibited the growth of all the tested bacterial strains including 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>E. faecium</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and MRSA. The highest inhibition was against the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with a MIC dose of 1.56 mg/ml. Moreover, the hexane fraction inhibited the growth of all the screened bacterial strains. Unfortunately, the aqueous fraction of PJ did not inhibit the growth of the evaluated strains. Regarding antifungal activity, the PJ acetone and hexane fractions showed powerful anticandidal activity with MIC values of 0.195 and 0.78 mg/ml. These numbers suggest that the PJ has powerful antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic>.
