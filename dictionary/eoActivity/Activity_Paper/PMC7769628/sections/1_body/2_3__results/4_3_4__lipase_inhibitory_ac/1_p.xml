<p>The hydrolysis of 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl butyrate to 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol was used to measure the influence of the four PJ fractions on the porcine pancreatic lipase enzyme. The results of the lipase enzyme inhibitory activity and the lipase inhibition IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the four fractions and Orlistat are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The following equations were used to calculate the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values: for Orlistat, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 38.639
 <italic>x</italic> + 7.6676; for methanol fraction, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 33.614
 <italic>x</italic> − 3.5112; for acetone fraction, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 18.255
 <italic>x</italic> − 5.8919; for hexane fraction, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 20.581
 <italic>x</italic> − 6.9327; and for the aqueous fraction, 
 <italic>y</italic> = 30.588
 <italic>x</italic> − 2.0254, where 
 <italic>y</italic> is the enzyme % inhibition and 
 <italic>x</italic> is the logarithm concentrations. The obtained results indicate that the methanol fraction has the highest antilipase activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 38.9 ± 0.29 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, followed by the aqueous and hexane fractions with IC
 <sub>50</sub> doses of 50.11 ± 0.57 and 588 ± 0.66 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, while the acetone fraction was inactive. However, Orlistat the reference antiobesity drug has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 12.3 ± 0.35 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml.
