 <italic>y</italic> = 0.0009
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0078, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 0.982 was used to estimate the total procyanidin content in the PJ plant methanolic fractions, where 
 <italic>y</italic> is the absorbance at 500 nm and 
 <italic>x</italic> is the total tannin content in the plant fraction. The results showed that the total procyanidin content in PJ methanolic fraction was 18.55 ± 0.55 mg of CAE/g.
