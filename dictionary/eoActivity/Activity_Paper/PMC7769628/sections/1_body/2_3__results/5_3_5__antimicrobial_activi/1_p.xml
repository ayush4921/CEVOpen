<p>In the current investigation, the broth microdilution method was utilized to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of PJ four fractions. In fact, this method is the most popular worldwide, because of its accuracy and clear results. In this method, wells were filled with a broth containing different concentrations of the PJ plant different fractions to assess their antimicrobial effects. 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table"> Table 3</xref> illustrates that the PJ methanol, hexane, and acetone fractions have various degrees of antibacterial and antifungal activities against the tested strains while the aqueous fraction did not show antibacterial and antifungal effects.
