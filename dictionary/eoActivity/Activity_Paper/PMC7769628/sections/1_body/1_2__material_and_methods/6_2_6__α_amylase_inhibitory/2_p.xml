<p>For working solutions, a volume of 0.2 ml of enzyme solution was mixed with 0.2 ml of each (PJ) fraction and was incubated for 10 min at 30°C. After the incubation period, 0.2 ml of a freshly prepared 1% starch aqueous solution was added to each working solution, followed by an incubation period of at least 3 min. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 0.2 ml dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) yellow color reagent. Each working solution was then diluted with 5 ml of distilled water and then boiled for 10 min in a water bath at 90°C. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the absorbance was taken at 540 nm. The blank was prepared following the same steps above, but the plant fraction was replaced with 0.2 ml of the previously described buffer. Acarbose was used as the standard reference following the same steps used for plant fractions.</p>
