<p>The porcine pancreatic lipase inhibitory method was followed in this study according to the protocol of Bustanji et al., with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Briefly, a stock solution of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml from each plant fraction was dissolved in 10% DMSO which was used to prepare five different solutions with the following concentrations: 50, 100, 200, 300, and 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. One mg/ml stock solution of pancreatic lipase enzyme was obtained which is an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. It is present in pancreatic secretions and is responsible for fat digestion and plays a crucial role in lipid transport. This enzyme was freshly prepared in the tris-HCl buffer before use. The substrate used for this study, 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNPB), was prepared by dissolving 20.9 mg in 2 ml of acetonitrile. For each working test tube, 0.1 ml of porcine pancreatic lipase (1 mg/ml) was mixed with 0.2 ml of each diluted solution series for each plant fraction. The resulting mixture was then brought to a total volume of 1 ml, by adding a Tris-HCl solution and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Following the incubation period, 0.1 ml of PNPB solution was added to each test tube. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Antilipase activity of PJ plant four solvent fractions was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of the PNPB compound into 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenolate ions at 410 nm using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The same procedure was repeated for Orlistat, which was used as a standard reference compound. The equation used in this analytical study is shown below:
