<p>For the determination of total procyanidin content, the Sun et al. protocol was followed with minor modification [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Catechin (Sigma, USA) was used as the reference compound to construct the calibration curve for the required calculations in which a 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml stock methanolic solution was prepared; then, serial dilutions were obtained (10, 30, 50, 70, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Then, a 4% methanolic vanillin (Alfa۔Aesar, UK) solution was freshly prepared, and a 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL stock solution was made from the methanolic plant fraction using methanol as the solvent. For the working solution, each test tube contained 0.5 ml of the PJ plant methanolic fraction mixed with 3 ml of vanillin solution and 1.5 ml of concentrated HCl (SDFCL, India). The obtained mixture was allowed to stand for 15 min, and then, the absorption was measured at 500 nm against methanolic vanillin as a blank. All the working samples were analyzed in triplicate. The total procyanidin content in the plant fraction is expressed as Catechin equivalents (mg of CAE/g of the dry plant fraction).
