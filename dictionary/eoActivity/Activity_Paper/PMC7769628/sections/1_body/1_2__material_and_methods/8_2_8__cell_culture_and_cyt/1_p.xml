<p>HeLa cervical adenocarcinoma cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media, which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin antibiotics, and 1% l-glutamine. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37°C. Cells were seeded at 2.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in a 96-well plate. After 48 h, cells were incubated with various concentrations of the tested compounds for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by CellTilter 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation (MTS) Assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI). Briefly, at the end of the treatment, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of MTS solution per 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of media was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm.
