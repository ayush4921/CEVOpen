<p>The dried leaves were exhaustively extracted by the fractionation method utilizing four solvents with various degrees of polarities including methanol (Loba/Chemie, India), water, acetone (Riedel/dehaen, Germany), and hexane (Alfa۔Aesar, UK). Briefly, 100 g of the dried plant leaves was taken and placed in a bottle and then extracted with 1 L of each solvent separately. Each bottle containing the plant leaves and the solvents was soaked for 72 h in a shaker device (Daihan Labtech, S. Korea) at 100 rotations per minute at 25°C. Each solvent was filtered utilizing a suction filtration. Then, all the organic fractions were dried using an incubator device (Esco, 2012-74317, Singapore) at 25°C until completely dried. A freeze dryer (Mell rock, China) was used in the drying of water fraction. Each obtained dried fraction was stored in the refrigerator at a temperature of 2-8°C for later use (5).</p>
