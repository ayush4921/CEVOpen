<p>Each PJ fraction was dissolved in 100% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) (Riedeldehan, Germany) at a concentration of 100 mg/ml for hexane, methanol, and water fractions and 50 mg/ml for acetone fraction. The produced solution was filter-sterilized and then was serially microdiluted (2 folds) 11 times in sterile nutrient broth (Himedia, India). The dilution processes were performed under aseptic conditions in 96-well plates (Greiner bio-one, North America). In the microwells that were assigned to evaluate the antibacterial activities of the PJ leaf fractions, microwell number 11 contained plant free nutrient broth, which was used as a positive control for microbial growth. On the other hand, microwell number 12 contained plant-free nutrient broth that was left uninoculated with any of the test microbes. This well was used as a negative control for microbial growth. Microwell numbers 1–11 were inoculated aseptically with the test microbes. Each plant fraction was made in duplicate. All the inoculated plates were incubated at 35°C. The incubation period lasted for about 18 h for those plates inoculated with the test bacterial strains and for about 48 h for those plates inoculated with 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. The lowest concentration of PJ at which no visible microbial growth in that microwell was observed and considered the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined PJ plant four fractions (8).
