 <p>Here we report the comprehensive characterization of the secondary metabolites from the leaves of 
  <italic>Colebrookea oppositifolia</italic> Smith, a species used as medicinal plant in the traditional medicine of Nepal. Phytochemical screening of bioactives was performed using an integrated LC-MS
  <sup>n</sup> and high resolution MS (Mass Spectrometry) approach. Forty-three compounds were tentatively identified, mainly aglyconic and glycosilated flavonoids and phenolic acids, as well as other bioactives such as coumarins and terpenes were detected. Furthermore, the NF-κB and AP-1 inhibitory activity of 
  <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> extract were evaluated, as well as its cytotoxicity against THP-1 cells, in order to assess the potential use of this herb as a source of anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic compounds. The results so far obtained indicate that 
  <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> leaves extract could significantly reduce the viability of THP-1 cells (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 6.2 ± 1.2 µg/mL), as well as the activation of both NF-κB and AP-1 at the concentration of 2 μg/mL. Our results indicate that Nepalese 
  <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> is a valuable source of anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic compounds. The phytochemical composition reported here can partially justify the traditional uses of 
  <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> in Nepal, especially in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, although further research will be needed to assess the full potential of this species.
