 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> is a shrub largely used as medicinal species in Nepal and other Asiatic countries, nevertheless, exhaustive chemical characterizations of the utilized parts are still lacking. Furthermore, despite one of the traditional uses of the leaves of this plant in Nepal and China is for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, no reports on their anti-inflammatory activity has been published up until now, nor in vitro, nor in vivo. In this article, we report for the first time the comprehensive characterization of the secondary metabolites obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> of Nepalese origin, and the assessment of its anti-NF-ÎºB, anti-AP-1 and cytotoxic activities in human cell lines. Overall, the preliminary data presented here could contribute to rationalize the medicinal use of this plant by the local communities of Nepal, and could be a starting point for the isolation of potential novel anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agents.
