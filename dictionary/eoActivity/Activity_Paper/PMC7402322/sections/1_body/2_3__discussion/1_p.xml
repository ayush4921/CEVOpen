 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> is widely used in the traditional medicine of South-Eastern Asiatic countries, comprising China, India, and Nepal, to treat a wide spectrum of disorders, ranging from inflammatory diseases to epilepsy [

 <xref rid="B12-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In particular, in Nepal the leaves are traditionally used to treat ailments of the ocular region such as cataract, corneal opacity and keratoconjunctivitis, and as anthelmintic [
 <xref rid="B3-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the leaves of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> have been investigated for their cardio-protective [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], anti-fertility [
 <xref rid="B9-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and antibacterial [
 <xref rid="B10-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] properties. However, despite wide traditional uses of this shrub, only limited studies concerning the assessment of its biological activities in vitro and in vivo, as well as the comprehensive characterization of its secondary metabolites, have been published up until now. Comprehensive phytochemical screening of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> could lead not only to the identification and further isolation of potential novel active compounds, but could also allow to explore the molecular pathways that are responsible for the bioactivities. One of the most recent studies regarding the phytochemical characterization of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> was published in 2016 by Chinchansure et al. [
 <xref rid="B11-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], who reported the new diterpene (+)-14,15-dinor-9α-hydroxy-cis-labd-11(E)-en-13-one in the acetone extract of the aerial parts, together with nine known flavonoids and flavone-derivatives such as alnustin, mosloflavone, apigenin, anisofolin A, and apigetrin, and the phenolic acids caffeic acid and forsythoside A. Older studies have reported the characterization of the flavonoids quercetin [
 <xref rid="B43-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], 5,6,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone [
 <xref rid="B44-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], chrysin and landenein [
 <xref rid="B1-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] from the leaves of 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic>, while 5,6,7-trimethoxyflavone and 5,6,7,4′-tetramethoxyflavone have been characterized from the roots [
 <xref rid="B45-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Moreover, 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> has been regarded as a rich source of acteoside [
 <xref rid="B5-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], a phenylethanoid glycoside (verbascoside) with a role in the prevention and treatment of various human diseases and disorders [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, limited information about 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic> from Nepal is available. Our comprehensive phytochemical analysis revealed acteoside and its isomer isoacteoside as the most abundant compounds among the ones identified and quantified in COME, with 24.71 mg/g DW extracted from the leaves. Other three acteoside derivatives were identified and quantified in leaf extract, namely β-oxoacteoside (0.81 mg/g DW), martynoside (0.54 mg/g DW), and β-methoxylverbascoside (0.99 mg/g DW), and are here reported for the first time in 
 <italic>C. oppositifolia</italic>. In the last decade, interests on verbascoside derivatives has been growing because of the increasing evidence showing their role in the prevention and treatment of various human diseases and disorders [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and due to their apparent low toxicity in mammals, as observed in non-human primate kidney (Vero E6) cells and human erythrocytes [
 <xref rid="B47-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Plants with high concentrations of phenylethanol glycosides have been used in the traditional medicine to treat inflammation and microbial infections [
 <xref rid="B46-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Hence, the high amount of verbascoside derivatives in COME could explain, at least in part, the anti-inflammatory activity observed in vitro. In particular, acteoside has been reported to significantly reduce the expression and activity of both COX and NOS by interfering with the activation of AP-1 [
 <xref rid="B48-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and to inhibit the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum and cartilage tissues of osteoarthritic rats by decreasing the activation of NF-κB [
 <xref rid="B49-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. AP-1 is a transcriptional regulator of cytokine expression in immune cells and it is involved in the modulation of inflammatory processes, but it has also a role in regulating cell proliferation, neoplastic transformation, and apoptosis. For this reason, AP-1 is considered an interesting target for novel therapeutic applications against inflammation and cancer [
 <xref rid="B50-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. On the other hand, NF-κB is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor that plays a determinant role in promoting cellular stress. When activated in the cytosol, NF-κB can activate pro-inflammatory genes by binding to their promoter region, thereby upregulating the production of pro-inflammatory mediators like TNF-α and IL-6 [
 <xref rid="B51-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Also this transcriptional factor is implicated in the regulation of pre-carcinogenic cell transformation, and is considered another interesting target for both anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor agents [
 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Inflammatory response is regulated at several different levels: the gene level (mediated by transcriptional regulation of particular genes), the signal-transduction level (encompassing regulation of intracellular signaling pathways), and, finally, the cellular level (including cell differentiation, activation, and regulation of cell-cell signaling). The main control point has been proposed to lie at the level of transcriptional control [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], hence targeting transcriptional factors such as NF-κB and AP-1 represents a promising therapeutic approach. In our study, we observed that COME, at the concentration of 2 µg/mL, was able to significantly decrease the activity of both NF-κB and AP-1 by the factor of 4.8 after LPS stimulation. This activity factor was four-time higher than that of the commercially available anti-inflammatory drug prednisone used as control, which reduced the activity of both the mediators only by the factor of 1.2, at a concentration of 1 µM. Among the compounds characterized in COME, flavonoids have been largely studied for their anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity, and specific members of this family detected in the same extract, namely chrysin, quercetin-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, and diosmetin, have been reported as NF-κB and AP-1 blockers [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,

 <xref rid="B58-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Also phenolic acids have been already studied for their anti-inflammatory activity, and compounds such as chlorogenic acids, ferulic acid and quinic acid, characterized in COME, have been reported to attenuate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in murine cells by down regulating the NF-κB pathway [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Among the other compounds identified in COME, the two coumarins umbelliferone and methoxsalen have been reported to suppress the expression of NF-κB in animal models [
 <xref rid="B62-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="B63-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], while peonidin-3-glucoside to reduce the metastasis of lung cancer cells by acting via different mechanisms, among which the blocking of AP-1 activation [
 <xref rid="B64-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Overall, these constituents could also contribute to the observed anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of COME.
