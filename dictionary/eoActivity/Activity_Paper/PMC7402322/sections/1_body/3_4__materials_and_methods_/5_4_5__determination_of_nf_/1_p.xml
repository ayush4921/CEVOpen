<p>THP-1-XBlue™-MD2-CD14 cell line was used as a model for determination of the effect of COME on the activation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 (key pro-inflammatory transcription factors). This genetically modified cell line has been specially designed for testing the activity of these transcription factors. We analyzed the ability of COME to suppress the activity of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated NF-κB/AP-1 as previously described [
 <xref rid="B15-ijms-21-04897" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, cells were pre-treated with COME at the non-toxic concentration of 2 µg/mL and control drug prednisone 1 µM (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) dissolved in DMSO for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were stimulated by LPS isolated from

Results were compared with a control incubated only with DMSO and stimulated with LPS (100% NF-κB/AP-1 activity).
