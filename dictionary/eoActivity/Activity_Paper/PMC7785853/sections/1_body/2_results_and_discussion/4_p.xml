 <sup>pro</sup> and the total fitness value was found to be −153.06 kcal/mol, which comprises of −93.6 van der Waal interactions and −59.46 kcal/mol hydrogen bonding interactions. The inhibitor closely fits the active site cavity making various close contacts with the residues including hydrogen bonding with the main chain of arginine at position 131 with binding energy value −9.3 kcal/mol (
