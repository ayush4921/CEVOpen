<p>Docking value of Myricetin from 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> exhibits −99.96 kcal/mol and 
 <italic>Gingerenone</italic> from 
 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> exhibits −93.9 kcal/mol which comprises of −63.64 and −69.96 van der Waal interactions and −36.32 and −23.94 kcal/mol hydrogen bonding interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref>). The residues include hydrogen bonding with the main chain of Arginine at position 188 with binding energy value −5.2 kcal/mol in Myricetin and Leucine at position 287 with binding energy value −5.4 kcal/mol in 
 <italic>Gingerenone</italic> respectively. Park et al. (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and Ortega et al. (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) opined that myricetin exhibits antiviral activity against influenza viruses and anti-HIV-1 activity. It is clear from the above study that myricetin exhibits anti-viral properties against COVID-19. Likewise, Gingerenone A, a polyphenol present in ginger, has attracted increasing attention as potential agents for preventing and treating many oxidative stress-related diseases. No anti-viral report has been published on this compound, but 
 <italic>Zingiber officianle</italic> possessed excellent anti-viral properties (Sharma et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kaushik et al.,
