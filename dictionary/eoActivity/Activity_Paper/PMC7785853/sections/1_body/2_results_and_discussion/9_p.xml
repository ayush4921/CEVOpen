<p>Docking value of Syrigaresinol (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>) from 
 <italic>Sausurea lappa</italic> exhibits −120.03 kcal/mol, Violanthin from 
 <italic>Adhatoda vasica</italic> exhibits −114.9 kcal/mol on 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> which comprises of −79.99 and −76.13 van der Waal interactions and −40.04 and −38.81 kcal/mol hydrogen bonding interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). The residues include hydrogen bonding with the main chain of Glucine at position 240 with binding energy value −7.6 kcal/mol in Syrigaresinol and Leucine at position 271 with binding energy value −8.2 kcal/mol in Violanthin respectively. Likewise, Ouyang et al. (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) also studied the Syringaresinol lignan inhibiting the multiplication of the tobacco mosaic virus. No study has been reported on violanthin, but this plant exhibits various pharmacological activities. It is evident from the study both the compounds effectively inhibited the 3CL protease.
