<p>The analysis reports of docking inclusive of the H-bonds that interact with 6LU7 amino acids are tabulated in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. It was observed that every H-bond interacted with the amino acids in the COVID-19 Mpro active site. The presence of H-bonds formed further influences the binding energy. The active site is usually pivotal in analyzing whether the binding site of the ligands has interacted with the amino acids of the target or attached to any other site inside the target. In the present research, the molecular docking analysis affirmed that all the ligands from the natural compounds interacted with the active site of the target protease. The nature and amount of bonding with the active site of the protein decides the higher affinity of drug compounds. Based on the binding energy score, we suggest that Acetoside, Luteolin 7 -rutinoside, rutin, Chebulagic acid, Syrigaresinol, Acanthoside, Violanthin, Andrographidine C, and myricetin exhibit excellent anti-viral properties when compared to synthetic drugs.
