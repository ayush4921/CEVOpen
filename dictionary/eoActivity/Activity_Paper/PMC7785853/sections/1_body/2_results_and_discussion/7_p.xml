 <sup>pro</sup> exhibits the energy value of −124.3 kcal/mol, which comprises of −103.02 van der Waal interaction and −21.28 kcal/mol hydrogen bonding interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>). The inhibitor closely fits the active site cavity making various close contacts with the residues including hydrogen bonding with the main chain of Thyronine at position 239 with binding energy value −17.9 kcal/mol. Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) observed chebulagic acid as Novel Influenza Viral Neuraminidase Inhibitor. Similarly, Lin et al. (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) also observed the chebulagic acid blocked herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).
