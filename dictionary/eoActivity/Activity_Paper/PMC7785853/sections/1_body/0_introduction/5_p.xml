<p>Traditional methods of drug discovery could take years, whereas 
 <italic>in silico</italic>-docking analysis enables large-scale screening fast, reliable, and cheaper than conventional drug development (Green and Segall, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). 
 <italic>In silico</italic> analysis, we assess the binding ability of a ligand to protein at an active site as well as to compare the binding modes of different ligands to the active site-pocket (Leach, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In this study, we used 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> as a possible targeting site to treat HCoV. Previously the main protease (Mpro)/chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) has been isolated through crystallization by Liu and Wang (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>) (PDB ID: 6LU7). The mechanism of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is deciphered computationally as the stearic interaction with glycine in the polyproteins and forms a strong hydrogen bonding to stabilize the complex. A conserved GSCGS motif has been observed to form three consecutive turns which were consequently temporarily stabilized by PNCC. This stabilizing PNCC is located on the surface opposite to the active site and hence can be the potential drug targeting site for 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>).
