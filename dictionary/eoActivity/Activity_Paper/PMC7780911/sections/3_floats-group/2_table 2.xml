   <tr>
    <td align="left">Amniotic membrane</td>
    <td align="left">It forms the amniotic sac, filled with amniotic fluid that surrounds and protects the foetus; transfers oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the foetus</td>
    <td align="left">Used in burns and wound healing (to reduce surface inflammation, scarring, and pain in surgical applications), in certain types of ulcers, and in oral, maxillofacial, and ocular surface surgery</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Bone and cartilage</td>
    <td align="left">Supports the body and protects vital organs</td>
    <td align="left">It is used to repair or stabilize the spine and other bones and cartilage damaged by degeneration, trauma, cancer, or birth defects. It is also used in oral surgery and in the filling of bone cavities or other areas where bone mass has been lost</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Corneas</td>
    <td align="left">The cornea and sclera form the outer layer of the eye: the cornea is transparent and allows light pass into the eye; the white sclera is opaque</td>
    <td align="left">Indicated for visual problems caused by damage or deterioration of the front part of the eyeball. If whole eyes are donated, the corneas can be used in transplants for corneal blindness and the sclera can be used for reconstructive and glaucoma surgery</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Cardiac valves</td>
    <td align="left">Directs blood flow in the heart</td>
    <td align="left">Used for patients with valve defects, especially in children</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Pericardium</td>
    <td align="left">Forms a protective lining around the heart</td>
    <td align="left">It is used to replace the dura in the brain and for eye and dental/maxillofacial surgeries (e.g. alveolar ridge augmentation)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Skin</td>
    <td align="left">Protects the body against injury, infection and dehydration</td>
    <td align="left">Used for the treatment of patients with burns, certain types of ulcers, abdominal wall repairs, and reconstructive and plastic surgery</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Tendons</td>
    <td align="left">Attach the muscle to the bone</td>
    <td align="left">For use in joint injuries and tendon ruptures</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td align="left">Vein and arteries</td>
    <td align="left">Provide a structure for blood flow through the body</td>
    <td align="left">It replaces blood vessels that are damaged by illness, trauma, or prolonged dialysis treatment. It is also used in bypass surgery to redirect blood flow</td>
