<p id="Par26">Chile has been employed to present a case study from an exemplar developing country. The Chilean law “Ley N° 19.451” is relatively new compared to the European Union (EU) and was established in the year 1996 alongside with the “National Transplant Coordination (i.e. Coordinación Nacional de Procuramiento y Trasplantes de Órganos y Tejidos) (CNPT) of the “Ministry of Health (MINSAL)”, which aims to implement a National policy on the transplantation rules, objectives and principles, applicable to the entire network-public and private—of the Chilean “National Health Services System (SNSS)”. Although, this law deals mainly with aspects related to organ donation and it was later complemented with additional regulations (Ley N° 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1996</xref>; Decreto N° 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>), it does not actually address tissue transplantation. Some later legislative progress was made with the publication of technical standards N° 163 for the procurement, preservation and implantation of corneas, in the year 2014 (Decreto Exento 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) and with the technical standard N° 200, for Procurement, Preservation and Implant of Tissues, in the year 2018 (Ministerio de Salud 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>). The case study of establishing these regulations was a clear drive-forward for promoting the development of clinical management in tissue science nationwide (Cuarto Informe y final FIC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>; Hospital Las Higueras implementó el primer Banco de Hueso de la Región del Biobío 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>) and was key to achieve a standardized supervision that allows traceability and quality assurance of transplanted tissues during the procurement, selection and sterility process (Ministerio de Salud 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>). As these regulations are fairly recent when compared to developed countries, it will be necessary to promote further public health strategic measures in order to reach the product quality that well-known global graft tissue banks have.
