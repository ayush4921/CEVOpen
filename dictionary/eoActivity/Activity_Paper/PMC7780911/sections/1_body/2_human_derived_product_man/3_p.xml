<p id="Par31">It should be mentioned that despite the exactness of the serological tests, there will be a period in which the pathogen present in the donor population will be undetectable; (Suessner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2014</xref>) for example, during the incubation period of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus. To improve tissue transplant safety, the procurement continues with processing and sterilization, in order to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission, both known and unknown. Processing refers to all operations involved in the preparation, handling, preservation, packaging and microorganism’s inactivation in tissue or cell donations intended for human application in order to optimize their clinical use, and preservation of original physicochemical and biological properties, for the reduction of disease transmission and adverse effects, such as the auto-immune reactions (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). This processing must be carried out according to standards of good manufacturing practices (GMP) in authorized, validated “clean-rooms”, in closed spaces, where air particles and pollutants are kept within strict limits under continuous monitoring (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). These rooms must demonstrate a sterile process and be equivalent to Grade A with a recommended environment of B, but at least Grade D in the case of transplant tissue (Directive 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>; EudraLex 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>). The main processing procedures (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>) include cleaning, cutting, washing, milling, centrifuging, bathing in antibiotic solution, filtration, lyophilization, freezing, glycerolization, demineralization, decellularization (Crapo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>) and sterilization (Taylor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">1999</xref>; Anderson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1992</xref>; Pelker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1983</xref>), all of which need to be implemented under stringent clean room rules and validated methods.
