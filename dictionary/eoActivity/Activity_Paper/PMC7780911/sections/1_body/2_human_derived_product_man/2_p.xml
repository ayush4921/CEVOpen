<p id="Par30">During the screening stage, the anamnesis process, performed by the members of the procurement team, is essential to gather the clinical history and behaviour of the potential donor and detailed clinical data revision should be performed for any LD, CD or DBD (Ministerio de Salud 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>). This selection phase is very effective in preventing disease transmission; it is estimated that after the pre-selection of the clinical and behavioural history, the risk of a donor being positive for pathogens detection during the second phase (haematological tests), is less than 1 in 1500 (Lomas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>). If any potential donor meets the criteria, they will proceed with the microbiological and serological laboratory tests (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The “quarantine” (i.e. a period in which the extracted tissues are stored and isolated) is the time when the results of the exams are pending, and, therefore, no decision has been made whether the tissue will be processed and used as grafts or will be discarded. These exams are widely known and standardized, but the local epidemiological scenario for each developing country could vary, especially considering some local diseases present. For example, “Chagas disease” is a specific infectious disease caused by the 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> parasite and it is found in Mexico, Central and South America (Maya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2010</xref>). In Chile, the quarantine is carried out in the “Transitory Storage Units (UATs)” that have all the infrastructure requirements and technical conditions for adequate tissue preservation; (Ministerio de Salud 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>) such as cryopreservation at − 80 °C for bone, skin and amniotic membrane (Ministerio de Salud 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>) and at − 140 °C for cardiovascular tissue by special equipment qualified for containing liquid nitrogen (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). It is a feasible option to initially start with − 80 °C cryopreservation in transfusion medicine units or blood banks while waiting for the infrastructure development of controlled environments at tissue banks. For example, this process has already been implemented by the CNPT as a strategic development plan and there are several UATs in addition to the SNSS that can be used as a step towards further sustainable transplantation service buildout.
