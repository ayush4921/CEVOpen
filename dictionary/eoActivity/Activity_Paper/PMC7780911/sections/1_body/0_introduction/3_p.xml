<p id="Par23">For developing countries, it is critical to improve National production of tissue-derived products for essential healthcare activities. Importing grafts from elsewhere is associated with high costs (Benninger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). Several surgical therapies solely depend on the use of the grafts as most effective, and thus self-sustained tissue transplant services are necessary. Furthermore, many situations such as pandemics lead to a rapid health system saturation and collapse (e.g. due the SARS-CoV-2), therefore indicating the necessity of sustainable measures in less richer economies. This is not only needed for the local health system improvements, but also to achieve global sustainability during a sanitary crisis. Hence, in the following review of the literature, we aim to update the current concepts of tissue transplantation. In particular, we put special emphasis on the Chilean public healthcare system point-of-view, as an example of a developing country. We highlight the following: (i) regulatory issues and bioethics, (ii) tissue procurement and manufacturing, (iii) bioprocessing with specific regulatory requirements, and finally (iv) quality management system, validation and risk assessment.
