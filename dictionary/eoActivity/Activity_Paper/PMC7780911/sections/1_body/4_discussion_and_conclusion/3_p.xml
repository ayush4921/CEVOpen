<p id="Par41">The long-term sustainability of a tissue banking activity presents associated economic challenges, such as with the concept of human tissues that must remain without aims of financial gain (Council of Europe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>) The Nuffield Council on Bioethics (Report from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>) distinguished two types of interventions to improve donations, the abovementioned altruistic that should be the only ethical basis for donation and non-altruistic which they may be incentivised with payments options, but this has been suggested not to be encouraged (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &amp; Healthcare (EDQM) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). We exposed the case study from Chile, like any other state its health authority (i.e. MINSAL) is in charge of exercising the direction of the healthcare sector establishing the policies, plans and norms related to the tissue transplantation. Today, great normative efforts have been implemented with the technical standard N° 200 (Ministerio de Salud 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>) that specifies its rationale and how the donations should be conducted; therefore any health authority from developing countries, such as MINSAL, could define priorities for the allocation of budgets supported by cost studies with strong clinical outcome data (e.g. from the “Fondo Nacional de Salud” (FONASA) database) for the resolution of problems with graft requirements. These clinical data and studies would justify the generation of a potential extraordinary budget allocation added to the annual base provision for the resolution of priority problems that require specific investments (Becerril-Montekio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). In another example, the implementation of cleanrooms could be justified by the need to generate greater productive capacity of grafts, in terms of volume and types in order to increase access and efficacy, respectively, but as well ensuring safe space for future healthcare endeavours. When the donation and transplantation of tissue is promoted locally as a developmental strategy, the resources will be used in a better way, since the associated costs actually only relate to the processing and storage service. In addition, if the healthcare system encourages this area, the costs of input suppliers will decrease and the associated complications and costs of auto-grafting will be reduced (e.g. donor site morbidity, hospital length-stays and out-of-pocket expenses). These last strategy in developing countries with public–private dual healthcare systems would contribute to health justice (Erk 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>) and universal access by avoiding health inequities based on these inputs, since it will limit the out-of-pocket expenses of patients outside the health explicit guaranties coverage (e.g. in Chile most known as GES-AUGE pathologies) or outside of insurance institutions, either public or private, and reducing the financial risk of healthcare users (Gallegos and Muñoz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2018</xref>).
