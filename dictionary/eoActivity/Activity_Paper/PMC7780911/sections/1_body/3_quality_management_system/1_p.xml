<p id="Par34">To guarantee the bioethics principle “non-maleficence” or any harm for the recipient, the risk of tissue transplantation should be minimized to the greatest extent and be addressed with planned quality standards in order to deliver a product according to expectations and affordable costs (i.e. with established quality, safety and effectiveness). Quality management consists in a series of acts of supervising all the necessary activities under rigorous control and monitoring system, so that the product has the capacity to meet the specific clinical needs (Pharmaceutical Quality System 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020</xref>). This is performed through “knowledge management”, a systematic approach to acquire, analyse, store and deliver information on the products, manufacturing processes and components of the tissue bank. It must be applied to all critical points of the process, such as human resources, facilities, equipment, suppliers and/or consumables. One of its major components is “risk management”, or a proactive approach to identify, scientifically assess and control potential risks to quality and processes. This can be accomplished by analysing the graft during manufacturing operations with emphasis on its critical stages to allow state control that facilitates continuous process improvement. Also, this management should enable the implementation of corrections and changes. In the case of possible adverse reactions investigated in the bio-surveillance (Ministerio de Salud 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>), post-graft quality monitoring or other detailed post-audit/inspections are used. The documentation must assure that all tissue-related data can be verified and tracked, both by the donor and the recipient. Since the 1990s several developing countries from Asia, the Pacific and Latin America have joined professional associations for the promotion of tissue banking activities (e.g. ALABAT) (Morales Pedraza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>). In Chile, this is evidenced by efforts in the traceability made through the National Transplant Coordination (CNPT) that provides local procurement units with the Integrated Donation and Transplant System (SIDOT). This data management system was implemented in the 2014 and was created based on the original Spanish system, one of the pioneers in procurement and transplantation worldwide. After some time of use, the system was completely modified and adapted to the local needs and currently presents considerable improvements compared to its initial version. The current model complies with international standards and operates in real time alongside with the waiting lists administered by the local health authority the “Institute of Public Health” (ISP), which allows the monitoring of organ and tissue transplants. Another important pillar of this quality system consist of the scheduled internal (e.g. quality personnel) and external audits (e.g. accreditation entities) by independent bodies for certification (i.e. authorizations in Chile). This ensures accreditation is kept up to date and continuous improvements are made.
