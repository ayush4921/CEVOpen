<p id="Par35">Validation is the part of the quality management system, which demonstrates that all critical aspects of operations are controlled to deliver a safe graft, in a continuous and adequate manner for its purpose (EudraLex – Volume

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Validation must be planned and can only be carried out and documented by trained personnel through a “master validation plan”. Initially a “qualification” is made to each part of the process and to individual elements that include clean room facilities, equipment, computer systems, materials (i.e. consumables) and operations. Then, when the critical stages are identified after a risk analysis, the validation of the graft production process is executed with the aim of establishing that all the quality attributes and process parameters can be consistently fulfilled. The validation is then carried out after the qualification of all the elements used (e.g. analytical instruments or cleaning procedures), before starting a new process [e.g. decellularized bone scaffold (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>)] and before any tissue product is released (prospective validation).
