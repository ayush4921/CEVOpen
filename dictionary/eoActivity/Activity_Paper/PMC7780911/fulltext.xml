This has led to establishment of tissue transplantation as a successful practice worldwide; however, a great variability between countries remains in terms of donation levels, safety, quality of grafts and their efficacy. Tissue transplantation requires coordination of different agencies involved in the implementation of procurement, processing, storage and distribution of tissues and cells from different hospital units that perform surgical procedures with graft-type input requirements. This biomaterial-like requirement has led to the constant development of the area and today these graft products of human origin can be the starting point for new and more advanced biotechnological products. For long-term sustainability and successful transplantation units, a process management comparable to the pharmaceutical industry in terms of quality management systems must be established to produce safe and high-quality human-derived products. This review aims to update the current concepts of tissue transplant services for its application for developing countries using the current Chilean scenario as a case study. We summarize our findings proposing a set of guidelines/actions that should be followed to ensure smooth tissue transplant services implementations with high efficiency and safe use.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Tissue transplant</kwd><kwd>Human-derived tissue products</kwd><kwd>Quality management system</kwd><kwd>Healthcare innovation</kwd><kwd>Health sustainable development</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CORFO</institution></funding-source><award-id>18IIP-BB-99543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verdugo-Avello</surname><given-names>Francisco J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Royal Society of Chemistry</institution></funding-source><award-id>M19-6613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wychowaniec</surname><given-names>Jacek K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par21">The current development of cell and tissue transplantation is contributing to a new era of healthcare services (Ashammakhi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>). They represent a specific class of products fundamental to a human health, and can be the raw material for the development of more advanced biotechnological products (Fratzl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>). Currently, these biological medicinal products have no synthetic equivalents in cost-effectiveness for tissue repair and reconstruction (Zorzi and Miranda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2012</xref>). The cell and tissue donation should always be based on a clinical evaluation, considering the risks versus the benefits and taking into account all available therapies for treatment selection (World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2006</xref>). Health service professionals involved in transplantation must take all the necessary measures during the evaluation of the donor in order to procure, store, process and distribute cells and tissues within levels of safety according to local regulations (World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2010</xref>). In addition, any institution involved in this process must implement a comprehensive quality management system, which must be carried out, monitored and constantly improved to ensure best safe practice methods and availability of donations for most needed therapies and research development (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">Using legislations and benchmarks similar to pharmaceutical industry standards, biotechnological platforms producing more complex and effective grafts can be achieved. Various human tissue-derived products are required on a daily basis, as in the case of dermal allografts (e.g. human grafts from different persons), in various forms according to the surgical requirements (Calota et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>). Likewise, bone allograft processing has resulted in multiple products for orthopaedic (Campana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2014</xref>; Pierannunzi and Zagra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2016</xref>), dental (Lobb et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2019</xref>; Kao and Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>), maxillofacial (Allegrini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>; Nkenke and Stelzle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2009</xref>), and neurosurgery (Chau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>; Canzi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>) reconstruction fields. The allografts can be free of cellular components and even free of calcium (Drosos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>) to improve its host&#x02019;s acceptance and tissue repair. They can be dispensed in blocks, sheets and even in the form of an injectable paste (Acarturk and Hollinger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2006</xref>). Advances in processing techniques and the development of advanced therapies have led to a new generation of processing techniques, such as the &#x0201c;decellularization&#x0201d;, a process that can prevent immune reactions in the recipient (Badylak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>; Crapo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>), acting as a &#x0201c;scaffold&#x0201d;, which can be combined with various other cells by the principles of tissue engineering. However, to achieve successful translation of these materials, good manufacturing practices with concepts of quality management, validation and risk management are required in parallel to the clinical transplantation process (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">For developing countries, it is critical to improve National production of tissue-derived products for essential healthcare activities. Importing grafts from elsewhere is associated with high costs (Benninger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2014</xref>). Several surgical therapies solely depend on the use of the grafts as most effective, and thus self-sustained tissue transplant services are necessary. Furthermore, many situations such as pandemics lead to a rapid health system saturation and collapse (e.g. due the SARS-CoV-2), therefore indicating the necessity of sustainable measures in less richer economies. This is not only needed for the local health system improvements, but also to achieve global sustainability during a sanitary crisis. Hence, in the following review of the literature, we aim to update the current concepts of tissue transplantation. In particular, we put special emphasis on the Chilean public healthcare system point-of-view, as an example of a developing country. We highlight the following: (i) regulatory issues and bioethics, (ii) tissue procurement and manufacturing, (iii) bioprocessing with specific regulatory requirements, and finally (iv) quality management system, validation and risk assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Regulatory issues</title><p id="Par24">The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the local health authorities are responsible for guaranteeing the promotion of donation, storage and human application of tissues and cells, monitoring patients&#x02019; safety and remaining publically transparent with respect to the health-related statistics and treatments (Competent Authorities on Substances of Human Origin Expert Group (CASoHO E0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1718</xref>; World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2020</xref>). Local authorities can be guided by tissue banking-scientific associations for the co-development of the different regulations according to the country of origin, such as the &#x0201c;Directive 2004/23/EC&#x0201d;, 2006/17/EC and 2006/86/EC of the European Union,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> the guide &#x0201c;Human Tissue Act&#x0201d; of the United Kingdom (Human Tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>; Human Tissue Authority <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>), and &#x0201c;Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-based Products&#x0201d; (Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>) of the United States Federal Drug Administration. In Chile, this area is under law normative, Ley N&#x000b0; 19,451 about &#x0201c;Organ Donation and Transplantation (updating Decree No. 240 of the ninth book of the health code, year 1983)&#x0201d; (Ley N&#x000b0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1996</xref>) which was published in 1996.</p><p id="Par26">Chile has been employed to present a case study from an exemplar developing country. The Chilean law &#x0201c;Ley N&#x000b0; 19.451&#x0201d; is relatively new compared to the European Union (EU) and was established in the year 1996 alongside with the &#x0201c;National Transplant Coordination (i.e. Coordinaci&#x000f3;n Nacional de Procuramiento y Trasplantes de &#x000d3;rganos y Tejidos) (CNPT) of the &#x0201c;Ministry of Health (MINSAL)&#x0201d;, which aims to implement a National policy on the transplantation rules, objectives and principles, applicable to the entire network-public and private&#x02014;of the Chilean &#x0201c;National Health Services System (SNSS)&#x0201d;. Although, this law deals mainly with aspects related to organ donation and it was later complemented with additional regulations (Ley N&#x000b0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1996</xref>; Decreto N&#x000b0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>), it does not actually address tissue transplantation. Some later legislative progress was made with the publication of technical standards N&#x000b0; 163 for the procurement, preservation and implantation of corneas, in the year 2014 (Decreto Exento <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) and with the technical standard N&#x000b0; 200, for Procurement, Preservation and Implant of Tissues, in the year 2018 (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>). The case study of establishing these regulations was a clear drive-forward for promoting the development of clinical management in tissue science nationwide (Cuarto Informe y final FIC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>; Hospital Las Higueras implement&#x000f3; el primer Banco de Hueso de la Regi&#x000f3;n del Biob&#x000ed;o <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2018</xref>) and was key to achieve a standardized supervision that allows traceability and quality assurance of transplanted tissues during the procurement, selection and sterility process (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>). As these regulations are fairly recent when compared to developed countries, it will be necessary to promote further public health strategic measures in order to reach the product quality that well-known global graft tissue banks have.</p><p id="Par27">Several bioethics challenges can rise with the establishment of transplantation laws and norms in order to respect the bioethics principles (Beauchamp and Childress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2001</xref>), such as gratuity (Council of Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>) as matter of justice, informed consent as part of autonomy, confidentiality has repercussions in the principles of autonomy and no maleficence and finally the quality of tissue that has direct implications in no malificency (Erk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>; Report from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> We summarised the main four sub-categories in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, stating the considerations that need to be taken into account for tissue transplant services before any human-derived manufacturing can occur.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Main bioethics challenges to be addressed and their implications for developing countries</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Bioethics challenges</th><th align="left">Tissue transplant considerations</th><th align="left">References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Gratuity</td><td align="left">The &#x0201c;Oviedo Convention&#x0201d; refers to the fact that the human body and its parts should not generate any financial gains.

Firstly, four relevant bioethics principles must always be considered (Beauchamp and Childress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2001</xref>; Council of Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>; Erk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>; Report from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>; see Footnote 2) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Then, there are critical steps needed for high quality graft manufacturing (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) including: the recruiting, consenting, evaluating and examining the donor in order to continue with the processing, storage and distribution of the tissue (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). There are two types of donors: (I.) the cadaveric donor (CD) with consent for the use of their body for the treatment of others. This type allows tissues such as bones, heart valves, skin, corneas, ligaments, cartilages and nerves to be used for therapeutic purposes (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>; Saegeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2009</xref>). (II.) The living donors (LD) can donate several tissues too. In this case different consideration of decreasing donor morbidity must be taken into account, such as perinatal tissue (Witkowska-Zimny and Wrobel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2011</xref>; Koizumi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2000</xref>) (e.g. amniotic membrane, placenta and umbilical cord-derived hematopoietic stem cells), hematopoietic stem cells (Weissman and Shizuru <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2008</xref>) and bones from femoral heads that are removed during a hip replacement (Lomas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>), among others (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To enhance donation, it is recommended that any potential organ donor be referred to the local procurement unit and that all deaths (usually hospital deaths) should be processed with a procurement coordinator, regardless of the patient&#x02019;s age, the cause of death, or known diseases (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). After the identification, the informed consent of the donor must be obtained in a documented way through their family declaration in the case of the CD, and with the deceased donor with brain death (DBD), a process known in Chile as &#x0201c;Last will testimony request&#x0201d;, which is carried out by trained personnel of the procurement unit (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Tissue manufacturing process. To obtain safe tissue grafts, the procurement team is responsible for several tasks depending on local hospital logistics; usually they conduct the donor&#x02019;s recruitment, informed consent, clinical history evaluation and donor testing. Harvested tissues remain under quarantine until all test results come back negative and the tissue can proceed with the processing. For this, general laboratory, microbiological and serological tests are performed according to Chilean Technical Standard No. 200 (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>).

This selection phase is very effective in preventing disease transmission; it is estimated that after the pre-selection of the clinical and behavioural history, the risk of a donor being positive for pathogens detection during the second phase (haematological tests), is less than 1 in 1500 (Lomas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>). If any potential donor meets the criteria, they will proceed with the microbiological and serological laboratory tests (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The &#x0201c;quarantine&#x0201d; (i.e. a period in which the extracted tissues are stored and isolated) is the time when the results of the exams are pending, and, therefore, no decision has been made whether the tissue will be processed and used as grafts or will be discarded. These exams are widely known and standardized, but the local epidemiological scenario for each developing country could vary, especially considering some local diseases present. For example, &#x0201c;Chagas disease&#x0201d; is a specific infectious disease caused by the <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> parasite and it is found in Mexico, Central and South America (Maya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2010</xref>). In Chile, the quarantine is carried out in the &#x0201c;Transitory Storage Units (UATs)&#x0201d; that have all the infrastructure requirements and technical conditions for adequate tissue preservation; (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>) such as cryopreservation at &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for bone, skin and amniotic membrane (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>) and at &#x02212;&#x02009;140&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for cardiovascular tissue by special equipment qualified for containing liquid nitrogen (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). It is a feasible option to initially start with &#x02212;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C cryopreservation in transfusion medicine units or blood banks while waiting for the infrastructure development of controlled environments at tissue banks. For example, this process has already been implemented by the CNPT as a strategic development plan and there are several UATs in addition to the SNSS that can be used as a step towards further sustainable transplantation service buildout.</p><p id="Par31">It should be mentioned that despite the exactness of the serological tests, there will be a period in which the pathogen present in the donor population will be undetectable; (Suessner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2014</xref>) for example, during the incubation period of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus. To improve tissue transplant safety, the procurement continues with processing and sterilization, in order to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission, both known and unknown. Processing refers to all operations involved in the preparation, handling, preservation, packaging and microorganism&#x02019;s inactivation in tissue or cell donations intended for human application in order to optimize their clinical use, and preservation of original physicochemical and biological properties, for the reduction of disease transmission and adverse effects, such as the auto-immune reactions (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). This processing must be carried out according to standards of good manufacturing practices (GMP) in authorized, validated &#x0201c;clean-rooms&#x0201d;, in closed spaces, where air particles and pollutants are kept within strict limits under continuous monitoring (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).

The main processing procedures (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>) include cleaning, cutting, washing, milling, centrifuging, bathing in antibiotic solution, filtration, lyophilization, freezing, glycerolization, demineralization, decellularization (Crapo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011</xref>) and sterilization (Taylor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">1999</xref>; Anderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1992</xref>; Pelker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1983</xref>), all of which need to be implemented under stringent clean room rules and validated methods.</p><p id="Par32">Sterilization procedure refers to any process that eliminates or deactivates transmissible infectious agents that contain nucleic acids (Calvo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>), either vegetative forms or spores of bacteria and fungi, parasites and viruses. The level of sterility assurance (SAL) is the likelihood of viable microorganisms in a unit of product after sterilization and is described by SAL 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> that would ensure that less than one in every million contaminants would survive in the sterilized graft.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> The most common methodology for terminal allograft sterilization is gamma irradiation (Hamer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1999</xref>; Akkus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>; Dziedzic-Goclawska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2005</xref>) using 25 kilograys (kGy) and can be applied after any processing, allowing sealing in its final packaging. In Chile, as well as many other developing countries, under the technical assistance program of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (Morales-Pedraza and Phillips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2009</xref>), this service can be requested from any local procurement unit through the national centralized coordination managed by the CNPT with the &#x0201c;National Tissue Bank&#x0201d;. Here the tissue is processed for later irradiation in an agreement with the &#x0201c;Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission&#x0201d; (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>; Tallentire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1990</xref>), which has been a successful partnership after Chile joined the Latin American Association of Tissue Banks (ALABAT) around the year 2002 (Morales Pedraza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>). However, this sterilization technique cannot be applied to all tissues, e.g. cardiovascular tissue, due to direct damage to the biological structure (Yusof <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2001</xref>), it is not recommended for bone grafts (Fawzi-Grancher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>; Kluger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2003</xref>; Moreau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2000</xref>; Nguyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2007</xref>; Ijiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1994</xref>) due to collagen degradation at 25&#x000a0;kGy that may cause lower remodelling and angiogenesis capacity, among others, and gamma-irradiation it is not capable of removing prions, which can be the cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (Lomas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>). To solve the ultrastructure disruption drawback, tissue banks have implemented several other techniques, such as electron beam irradiation (Keshlaf and Schmidt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>), and peracetic acid treatment for bone sterilization that has demonstrated to be a reliable method for sterilization of tissues grafts (Mahirogullari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2007</xref>; Pruss et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Quality management system</title><p id="Par34">To guarantee the bioethics principle &#x0201c;non-maleficence&#x0201d; or any harm for the recipient, the risk of tissue transplantation should be minimized to the greatest extent and be addressed with planned quality standards in order to deliver a product according to expectations and affordable costs (i.e. with established quality, safety and effectiveness). Quality management consists in a series of acts of supervising all the necessary activities under rigorous control and monitoring system, so that the product has the capacity to meet the specific clinical needs (Pharmaceutical Quality System <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020</xref>). This is performed through &#x0201c;knowledge management&#x0201d;, a systematic approach to acquire, analyse, store and deliver information on the products, manufacturing processes and components of the tissue bank. It must be applied to all critical points of the process, such as human resources, facilities, equipment, suppliers and/or consumables. One of its major components is &#x0201c;risk management&#x0201d;, or a proactive approach to identify, scientifically assess and control potential risks to quality and processes. This can be accomplished by analysing the graft during manufacturing operations with emphasis on its critical stages to allow state control that facilitates continuous process improvement. Also, this management should enable the implementation of corrections and changes. In the case of possible adverse reactions investigated in the bio-surveillance (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>), post-graft quality monitoring or other detailed post-audit/inspections are used. The documentation must assure that all tissue-related data can be verified and tracked, both by the donor and the recipient. Since the 1990s several developing countries from Asia, the Pacific and Latin America have joined professional associations for the promotion of tissue banking activities (e.g. ALABAT) (Morales Pedraza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>). In Chile, this is evidenced by efforts in the traceability made through the National Transplant Coordination (CNPT) that provides local procurement units with the Integrated Donation and Transplant System (SIDOT). This data management system was implemented in the 2014 and was created based on the original Spanish system, one of the pioneers in procurement and transplantation worldwide. After some time of use, the system was completely modified and adapted to the local needs and currently presents considerable improvements compared to its initial version. The current model complies with international standards and operates in real time alongside with the waiting lists administered by the local health authority the &#x0201c;Institute of Public Health&#x0201d; (ISP), which allows the monitoring of organ and tissue transplants. Another important pillar of this quality system consist of the scheduled internal (e.g. quality personnel) and external audits (e.g. accreditation entities) by independent bodies for certification (i.e. authorizations in Chile). This ensures accreditation is kept up to date and continuous improvements are made.</p><p id="Par35">Validation is the part of the quality management system, which demonstrates that all critical aspects of operations are controlled to deliver a safe graft, in a continuous and adequate manner for its purpose (EudraLex &#x02013; Volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>; Guideline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1995</xref>) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Validation must be planned and can only be carried out and documented by trained personnel through a &#x0201c;master validation plan&#x0201d;. Initially a &#x0201c;qualification&#x0201d; is made to each part of the process and to individual elements that include clean room facilities, equipment, computer systems, materials (i.e. consumables) and operations. Then, when the critical stages are identified after a risk analysis, the validation of the graft production process is executed with the aim of establishing that all the quality attributes and process parameters can be consistently fulfilled. The validation is then carried out after the qualification of all the elements used (e.g. analytical instruments or cleaning procedures), before starting a new process [e.g. decellularized bone scaffold (Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>)] and before any tissue product is released (prospective validation).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Diagram of a quality risk management model.

A &#x0201c;process flow&#x0201d; diagram that lists all the steps, processes, consumables, tests and equipment related to the specific graft can form the basis for the evaluation exercise. This allows identifying risks, their probability of occurrence and their severity. All of which is key information for the decision making of preventive activities for risk reduction or acceptance. An acceptance of risk could vary on case by case by analysis of the balance between risks and benefits. For example, there is an established high public demand for bone graft in Chile, which could favour the use of fresh-frozen graft from femoral heads after hip replacement surgeries to increase hospital supply, an accepted risk that has proven to be safe over time in several scientific publications (Slooff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1984</xref>; Schreurs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2009</xref>; Dennis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2003</xref>). Effective risk management must guarantee the quality of the graft, as it provides a proactive means to identify and control possible problems during manufacturing chain and the chance for continuing improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p id="Par37">Worldwide, tissue transplantation employs various technologies that allowed a great improvement in the last 50&#x000a0;years, such as the application of cryopreservation to ensure the continuous supply of grafts (Polge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1949</xref>; Pegg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1976</xref>; Bozic and Marjoua <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>), which was later complemented by the quality management systems that induced a positive impact on developed countries healthcare systems (Bozic and Marjoua <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>). In the case of developing countries that had initiated tissue transplant developmental measures (e.g. participation through the IAEA), regulatory improvements along with quality management systems, comparable to pharmaceutical regulations, must be established to lead to a funding of specialized infrastructure, industrial processes and human resources with high standard training (e.g. the use of cleanrooms for the control of air particles requires the support of quality systems, validation and risk management by trained and continuous training of personnel) (Warwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2009</xref>). To facilitate this development, the association with institutions that are experts in the field, such as the European Association of Tissue and Cell Banks (EATCB) must be made. Developing countries are in a position where lessons learned from such abovementioned associations can be drawn for the introduction of novel processes and new clinical applications. This has been estimated in the EU to be clinically-driven with the involvement and cooperation of three main groups: tissue establishments, clinicians and risk analysis made by local health authorities, creating a constant interaction between all parties involved (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). Developing countries can benefit from lessons learned from these associations from the EU, as they can facilitate the supply of the production-training ecosystem and participate in several events, where the state-of-the-art is exposed to an efficient life-cycle management, as they have experienced several years in process validation, risk prevention and continuous improvement systems. In particular, the training programs of &#x0201c;The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH)&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> in relation to quality management concepts are required.</p><p id="Par39">Accordingly to the United Nations, sustainable development goal N.17 &#x0201c;strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development&#x0201d;, association of health services with academia generates multidisciplinary clusters for the generation of innovation that deliver value and can deliver new, more advanced biotechnological products, spin-offs and start-ups, leading to more translational research and development projects (Casanellas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>; Couto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>; Cazzell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2017</xref>; Bor&#x000e1;&#x00148; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). To highlight these, clearly academia has been the major stakeholder for the technological development from cell transplantation. This led to the appearance of the advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) industry, a core industry developing human-derived tissue products disruptive innovations, originating from academic environments (Advanced Therapies Investment Report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). This has been achieved due the increased inter-sectorial alliances, such as industry-academia, research collaborations and partnerships. Example of such recent great novel development case is &#x0201c;chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-Ts) (Seimetz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2019</xref>). In the EU, in 2012, there were 18 ATMPs authorised for manufacture and supply under hospital exceptions, the majority developed through academic institutions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> The global innovation eco-system is now needed more than ever, in light of the possible pandemics, ensuring the steady global knowledge-flow, but at the same time national sustainability in the case of an emergency.</p><p id="Par41">The long-term sustainability of a tissue banking activity presents associated economic challenges, such as with the concept of human tissues that must remain without aims of financial gain (Council of Europe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>) The Nuffield Council on Bioethics (Report from the Nuffield Council on Bioethics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>) distinguished two types of interventions to improve donations, the abovementioned altruistic that should be the only ethical basis for donation and non-altruistic which they may be incentivised with payments options, but this has been suggested not to be encouraged (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>). We exposed the case study from Chile, like any other state its health authority (i.e. MINSAL) is in charge of exercising the direction of the healthcare sector establishing the policies, plans and norms related to the tissue transplantation. Today, great normative efforts have been implemented with the technical standard N&#x000b0; 200 (Ministerio de Salud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>) that specifies its rationale and how the donations should be conducted; therefore any health authority from developing countries, such as MINSAL, could define priorities for the allocation of budgets supported by cost studies with strong clinical outcome data (e.g. from the &#x0201c;Fondo Nacional de Salud&#x0201d; (FONASA) database) for the resolution of problems with graft requirements. These clinical data and studies would justify the generation of a potential extraordinary budget allocation added to the annual base provision for the resolution of priority problems that require specific investments (Becerril-Montekio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). In another example, the implementation of cleanrooms could be justified by the need to generate greater productive capacity of grafts, in terms of volume and types in order to increase access and efficacy, respectively, but as well ensuring safe space for future healthcare endeavours. When the donation and transplantation of tissue is promoted locally as a developmental strategy, the resources will be used in a better way, since the associated costs actually only relate to the processing and storage service. In addition, if the healthcare system encourages this area, the costs of input suppliers will decrease and the associated complications and costs of auto-grafting will be reduced (e.g. donor site morbidity, hospital length-stays and out-of-pocket expenses). These last strategy in developing countries with public&#x02013;private dual healthcare systems would contribute to health justice (Erk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>) and universal access by avoiding health inequities based on these inputs, since it will limit the out-of-pocket expenses of patients outside the health explicit guaranties coverage (e.g. in Chile most known as GES-AUGE pathologies) or outside of insurance institutions, either public or private, and reducing the financial risk of healthcare users (Gallegos and Mu&#x000f1;oz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">It is highlighted that for developing countries, the quality management concepts and validation and risk management must be understood, adopted and employed (World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2006</xref>) to be able to implement cleanrooms according to tissue establishments developed-countries health authorities (COMMISSION DIRECTIVE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>/94/EC 2003), which also lead to the challenge of the supervision and control capacity by the authorities from developing countries. In Chile, the ISP is in charge of supervising tissue establishments and banks of the healthcare system and everything related to the authorization, quality control, surveillance and importing of cells and tissues. However, it is the MINSAL who through the ISP service must direct biotechnological/biomedicine development according to health policies based on national reality and epidemiology with data-driven priority setting process. Tissue transplantation could be evaluated through &#x0201c;management commitments&#x0201d; of health services, which would later be evaluated by any division in charge of the healthcare network and be enhanced through financial stimuli associated with performance. For example, the ISP from Chile can enhance this development through activity plans in conjunction with tissue banks. Finally, the governmental, clinical and academic sectors have the responsibility of this development in order to achieve compliance with international quality and excellence standards. In the EU this has been established as a &#x0201c;dialogue structure&#x0201d; between the health authorities, clinicians and the tissue establishments (European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &#x00026; Healthcare (EDQM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2019</xref>).
