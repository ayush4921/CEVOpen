<p>THP-1 cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cell/ml. THP-1 cells were differentiated to macrophages with PMA (100 ng/ml) and vitamin D3 (0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). Twenty-four hours after cell differentiation, cells were treated for 72 h with 0–250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of IH and SO extract in a fresh serum-free medium in both the absence and presence of LPS (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Nitrite determinations were done in 50
