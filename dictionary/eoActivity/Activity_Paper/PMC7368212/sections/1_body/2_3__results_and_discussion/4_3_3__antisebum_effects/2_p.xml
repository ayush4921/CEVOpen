<p>The effects obtained with the positive control isotretinon were in good agreement with published results. Isotretinoin caused a 50% reduction in proliferation and ∼70% reduction in total lipids production at a concentration of 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The EC50 value obtained for this compound (9.4 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> M) is quite close to this number, which should be expected. At the same time, the SO and IH extract achieved the same effect but at a higher concentration, 0.03 ± 0.02 and 0.09 ± 0.01 mg/ml, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The test extracts inhibited the production at relatively high concentrations (EC50 0.43–1.54 mg/ml).
