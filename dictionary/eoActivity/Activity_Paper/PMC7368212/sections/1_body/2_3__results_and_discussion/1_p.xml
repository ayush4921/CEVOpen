<p>The western region of the Mediterranean is covered with at least 2,600 plant species of which 700 are noted in medieval medical books for their use as medicinal herbs. According to recent ethnopharmacological studies, more than 450 of these medicinal plants are currently employed in the treatment and prevention of human diseases within the Mediterranean countries. Some of these plant species have been investigated and their bioactive ingredients extracted to treat various human diseases [

 <italic>C. acnes,</italic> one of the known causative agents of acne vulgaris. In the first phase of this study, MTT and LDH assays were carried out on HaCaT cells in order to evaluate nontoxic concentrations of the test plant extracts to be used in the efficacy tests. In the second phase, we evaluated the antisebum and antimicrobial effects of all test extracts. Based on the results obtained in the second phase, SO and IH extracts were selected and their anti-inflammatory effects were measured on THP-1 cell line. Based on the results obtained, a polyherbal cream “AHC” was prepared from different portions of extracts from SO, IH, and SN as described in
