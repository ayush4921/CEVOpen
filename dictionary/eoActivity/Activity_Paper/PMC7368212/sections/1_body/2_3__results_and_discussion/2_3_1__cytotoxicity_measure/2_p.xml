<p>The cellular metabolic activity can be evaluated with the MTT test which measures the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase. This test is widely used in the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> evaluation of the toxicity of plant extracts [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We applied the MTT test to evaluate the safety of extracts from the nine test plants in cells from the HaCaT. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations (1–500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml of culture medium) of extracts for 24 h. No sign of any negative effects were observed after treatment with concentrations up to 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml (

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml caused a significant reduction in the cell viability.
