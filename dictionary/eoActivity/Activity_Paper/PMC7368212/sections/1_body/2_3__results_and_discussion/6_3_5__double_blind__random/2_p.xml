<p>Based on the initial antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory screening test, a polyherbal cream “AHC” was prepared from different portions of extracts from SO (roots), IH (flowers and leaves), SN (leaves), glycerol, and basic creams (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). SO was shown in various 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies to exhibit antibacterial, antihistamine, and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The efficacy of AHC cream was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, and controlled study with placebo. Results obtained indicate that the AHC has unique synergistic effects that halt sebum production, combined with highly antiseptic and anti-inflammatory activity, in which 54.95% (
 <italic>t</italic> = 19.37 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) of acne inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions almost disappeared after two weeks of application, 85.3%, after five weeks, (
 <italic>t</italic> = 14.19 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), and 91.4%, at the end of the sixth week (
