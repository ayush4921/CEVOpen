<p>Many plants seem to have inhibitory effects on the growth of 
 <italic>C. acnes in vitro</italic>. Also, some plants have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antisebum properties [

 <italic>α</italic>, and NO as well as showing significant antibacterial and antisebum effects. Since these plants have different chemical components, when having them in a mixture, strong beneficial effects may result. In addition, the combination of plants may help the body to manage potentially undesirable effects that each plant might have when used alone and when in combination/formulation they might play a curative role. It is therefore preferable to use plant combination instead of relying on a single plant [
