<p>There are many published studies that investigated the antiacne effects of medicinal plants and their extracts [

 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the potential use of ethanolic extracts of SO, IH, and SN as antimicrobial agents against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>. In addition, it is the first study to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of these extracts on the release of IL-6, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and NO from cells from the THP-1 cell line. Moreover, this study shows a novel antisebum, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effect when a mixture of plant extracts (AHC) was used. The combinations of the medicinal plants showed a synergic antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, while a single constituent may or may not have a pharmacological effect. Topical application of AHC showed in a clinical study antiseptic and anti-inflammatory activities, in which 60% of acne inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions disappeared after five weeks of application and 75%, at the end of sixth week (Figures
