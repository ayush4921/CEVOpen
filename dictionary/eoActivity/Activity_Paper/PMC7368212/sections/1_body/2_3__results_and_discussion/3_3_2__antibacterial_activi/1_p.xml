<p>Plants can be efficient in the treatment of acne vulgaris because of four mechanisms including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiandrogen activities [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The plants with essential oils, flavonoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds are well known for their antibacterial effects including inhibitory action against acne-inducing bacteria [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> has been recognized as pus-forming bacteria triggering an inflammation in acne. The antimicrobial activities of nine medicinal plants against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> were evaluated here using disc diffusion method. Inhibition zone diameters were measured to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of the plant extracts against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>, compared with chloramphenicol and common antiacne plants. The results showed that six extracts could effectively inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic>. SO showed an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>C. acnes</italic> 1.2 times higher than that of the reference antibiotic (chloramphenicol) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic> showed weak activity (5.3 ± 1.5 mm) compared to that of chloramphenicol (14 ± 0.0 mm). The remaining extracts showed either very weak or no activity (0.3 ± 0.7 to 3.7 ± 0.6 mm) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).
