    "The present <i>in vitro</i> and randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aims to determine the efficacy and safety of nine Mediterranean antiacne medicinal plants. The antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts were evaluated in cells from the immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) and human monocytic cell line (THP-1) as well as in a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled trial. Most of the extracts showed no significant cytotoxic effects on HaCaT cells up to 250 <i>μ</i>g/ml. <i>Inula helenium</i> (IH) and <i>Saponaria officinalis</i> (SO) inhibited sebum production at 90 <i>μ</i>g/ml and 30 <i>μ</i>g/ml, respectively. The inhibition effect of SO on the growth of <i>Cutibacterium acnes</i> was 1.2 times higher than that of chloramphenicol. IH and SO extracts significantly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced IL-6 and TNF-<i>α</i> production in THP-1 cells reaching the control levels of untreated cells at a concentration of 250 <i>μ</i>g/ml. SO, IH, and <i>Solanum nigrum</i> (SN) extracts inhibited the nitric oxide (NO) production in a dose-dependent manner. Based on these results, an antiacne herbal cream (AHC) was prepared from different portions of extracts from SO, IH, and SN, and its efficacy was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, and controlled efficacy study with 41 acne patients, ages 18-24, who were asked to apply AHC (<i>n</i> = 27) or a placebo (<i>n</i> = 14) two to three times daily for six weeks. Results obtained indicate that the AHC has unique synergistic effects that halt sebum production, combined with highly antiseptic and anti-inflammatory activity, in which 54.95% (<i>t</i> = 19.37 <i>P</i> < 0.001) of acne inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions disappeared after two weeks, 85.3%, after five weeks (<i>t</i> = 14.19 <i>P</i> < 0.001), and 91.4%, at the end of the sixth week of application (<i>t</i> = 5.7 <i>P</i> < 0.001). In conclusion, SO, IH, and SN as single extracts and in combination as AHC showed significant antimicrobial, antisebum, and anti-inflammatory activities <i>in vitro</i> and in a double-blind, randomized, and controlled antiacne efficacy. Therefore, AHC represents an interesting alternative treatment for acne."
