<p>The cosmopolitan genus 
 <italic>Selaginella</italic> also acknowledged as a “spike moss” possessing around 700–750 species distributed around the globe. The members of the 
 <italic>Selaginella</italic> are well known for their uses in conventional folk medicine, food, handicrafts and as ornaments. The 
 <italic>Selaginella</italic> plants are usually used by the tribal community to cure fever, jaundice, hepatic disorders, cirrhosis, diarrhea, cholecystitis, sore throat, cough of lungs, promote blood circulation, remove blood stasis and stops external bleeding after trauma and after separation of the umbilical cord [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00768" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Few species of 
 <italic>Selaginella</italic> such as, 
 <italic>S. tamariscina</italic>, 
 <italic>S. lepidophylla</italic>, 
 <italic>S. chrysocaulos</italic>, 
 <italic>S. bryopteris</italic>, 
 <italic>S. labordei</italic> and 
 <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic> have been reported for their in vitro antimicrobial, antiviral, antidiabetic, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antispasmodic and anticancer potentials due to the high content of different phytochemicals, such as flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, steroids, pigments, oxygen heterocycle, lignans, coumarins, quinoids, chromones, benzenoids, carbohydrates and alkaloids [

 <italic>S. repanda</italic> phytochemistry is available, though it has been reported as an important ethnomedicinal fern.
