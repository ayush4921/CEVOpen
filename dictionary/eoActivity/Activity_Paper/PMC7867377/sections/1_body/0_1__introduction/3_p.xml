<p>Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the bioactivities (antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activity against human lung, breast and colon cancer cell lines) of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> for the first time. In order to evaluate the potency and bioactive potential, 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract was also analyzed by high resolution-liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HR-LC–MS) in detail to identify the phytochemical constituent’s being the reason for its bioactivity. Obtained results will support the further in vivo studies for the possible therapeutic usage of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> against various diseases/ailments and in the treatment of metastatic cancer.
