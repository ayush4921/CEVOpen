<p>Cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract was performed against human normal colon cells (CRL-1831) and anticancer potential was performed against human lung (A549), breast (MCF-7) and colon (HCT-116) cancer cell lines. Cells were obtained from the NCCS, India. They were propagated in a humidified (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) atmosphere at 37 °C, and were maintained in 25 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. They were grown up to 80% confluence and were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of more than 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well with incubation conditions mentioned above. Cells were then stained with 0.4% Trypan Blue and viable cell numbers were calculated using a hemocytometer. However, assay was performed as triplicate wells for each concentration. Different concentration of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract (100–500 μg/mL) was then used to treat the cells for 24 h. Followed by washing with PBS solution and subjected with 100 μL of MTT solution (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5 diphenyltetrazoliumbromide) (5 mg/mL), followed by incubation for 4 h. Finally, the medium was removed and 100 μL of DMSO was added to solubilize the formazan crystals. ELISA reader was then used to determine the amount of formazan crystal by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm. Fluorouracil (5FU) was used as a positive control. All assays were done in triplicate and 50% cytotoxic concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated [
