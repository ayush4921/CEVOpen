 <xref rid="B83-molecules-26-00768" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The inoculums were prepared from a 6 h Muller–Hinton broth (MHB) culture, and suspensions were adjusted to 0.5 McFarland turbidity standards (10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL). 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract was diluted to twofold ranging from 1000 to 0.48 µg/mL (80 µL as final volume) with a DMSO concentration &gt;1%. Afterward, 20 µL of bacterial suspensions and 100 µL of MHB were loaded onto microtiter plates. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, microtiter plates were read using a spectrophotometer at 620 nm. Chloramphenicol, a standard antibiotic, was used as a positive control. MHB + DMSO was used as a vehicle control, and MHB alone was used as a sterility control. MIC was recorded as the plant extract with the lowest concentration and has shown absolute inhibition of observable growth [
