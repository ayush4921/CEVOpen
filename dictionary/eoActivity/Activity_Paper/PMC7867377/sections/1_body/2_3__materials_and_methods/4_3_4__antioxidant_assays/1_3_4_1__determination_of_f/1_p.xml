 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract antioxidant activity was measured against DPPH free radicals in relation to radical scavenging capability [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-26-00768" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Crude extract of varied concentrations (100–500 μg/mL) were mixed in the tubes containing 2 mL of DPPH solution (6 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> M) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by dark incubation for 1 h. After incubation, a decrease in absorbance was measured at 517 nm. As a standard, ascorbic acid was used; as a blank, DMSO was used; and as a control, DPPH solution without crude extract was used. Calculation of the percentage of scavenging of DPPH free radicals was then estimated as follows:
 <disp-formula>DPPH scavenging activity (%) = (A
  <sub>0</sub> − A
  <sub>1</sub>)/A
  <sub>0</sub> × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> whereas, 
 <disp-formula>A
  <sub>0</sub> = absorbance of the control
  <label>(3a)</label>
 </disp-formula>
 <disp-formula>A
  <sub>1</sub> = absorbance of the sample
  <label>(3b)</label>
 </disp-formula>
