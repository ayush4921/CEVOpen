<p>Phytochemistry of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract was analyzed using UHPLC-PDA-Detector Mass Spectrophotometer (HR-L=CMS 1290 Infinity UHPLC System), Agilent Technologies
 <sup>®</sup>, Santa Clara, CA, USA. The liquid chromatographic system consisted of the HiP sampler, binary gradient solvent pump, column compartment and quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer (MS Q-TOF) with the dual Agilent Jet Stream Electrospray (AJS ES) ion source. Of the sample 10 µL was injected into the system, followed by separation in the SB-C18 column (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.8 µm particle size). Solvent A (1% formic acid in deionized water) and solvent B (acetonitrile) were used as solvents. Flow rate of 0.350 mL/min was used, while, MS detection was performed in MS Q-TOF. Compounds were identified via their mass spectra and their unique mass fragmentation patterns. Compound Discoverer 2.1, ChemSpider and PubChem were used as the main tools for the identification of the phytochemical constituents [
