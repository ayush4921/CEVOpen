 <italic>Selaginella</italic> species have different groups of chemical compounds, which are well known to have a wide-range of biological actions and are a potential source for finding the novel anticancer drugs. As many of the phytochemical compounds obtained from few of these species possess strong cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines. 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract was evaluated for its anticancer potential by MTT assay against three different human cancer cell lines, i.e., breast (MCF-7), colon (HCT-116) and lung (A549). Our results revealed that, proliferation of all the three cell lines were inhibited by 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> in a dose dependent manner, compared to fluorouracil, which was used as the positive control. The crude extract of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> showed the highest growth inhibitory activity against A549 cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 341.1 μg/mL, followed by HCT-116 cells (378.8 μg/mL) and MCF-7 cells (428.3 μg/mL) (

 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract against non-cancerous human normal colon cells (CRL-1831) was also performed and results revealed no cytotoxicity to normal cells (
