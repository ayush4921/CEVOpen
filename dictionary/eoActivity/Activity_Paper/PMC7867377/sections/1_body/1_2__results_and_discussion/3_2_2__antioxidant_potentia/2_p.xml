 <italic>S. repanda</italic> antioxidant potential was analyzed against DPPH and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> molecules in comparison to ascorbic acid. The results of antioxidant activity displayed that 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract exhibited remarkable free radical scavenging activity, both against DPPH and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> molecules in a dose dependent manner. The scavenging capacity against DPPH free radicals was higher than H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> molecules. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of crude extract of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> for DPPH and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> were 231.6 μg/mL and 288.3 μg/mL, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00768-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B). The antioxidant potential of different species of 
 <italic>Selaginella</italic> have been evaluated by different methods; from which, most are based on the determination of free radical scavenging activity. Commonly used methods are, ABTS, DPPH, superoxide anion radical scavenging assays and total phenolic content. Total phenolic content of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> dried powder was found to be 6.51 ± 0.71 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry matter. Indian Sanjeevani (
 <italic>S. bryopteris</italic>) is well known for its protective effect against various stress-induced conditions [

 <italic>S. tamariscina</italic> have strong antioxidant property, as its extract can reduce blood sugar levels and also able to act as a lipid peroxide and increases insulin serum [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00768" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In one study, the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>S. involvens</italic>, 
 <italic>S. delicatula</italic> and 
 <italic>S. wightii</italic> also displayed in vitro lipid peroxidation and varying levels of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. The 50% inhibition (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) for in vitro lipid peroxidation of 
 <italic>S. wightii, S. delicatula</italic> and 
 <italic>S. involvens</italic> was 76.6 ± 4, 38.2 ± 1.2 and 2.1 ± 0.1, respectively. Moreover, flavonoids obtained from the 
 <italic>S. doederleinii</italic> also possess very strong free radical scavenging activity [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-26-00768" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similar results were found in our study. 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> displayed potent antioxidant activity, indicating its protective role against free radicals.
