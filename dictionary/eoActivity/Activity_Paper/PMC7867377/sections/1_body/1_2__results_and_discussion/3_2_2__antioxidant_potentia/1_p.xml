At a higher concentration, free radicals can be dangerous and can damage the important constituents of the cell, which may include cell membrane, proteins, DNA, etc. Damage to DNA, in particular, may lead to cancer or other severe health conditions. However, in order to prevent this type of cellular damage, antioxidants play an essential role. They are generally described by “mopping up” free radicals, which means they are able to neutralize the electrical charge and can prevent the free radical from receiving electrons from other molecules [
