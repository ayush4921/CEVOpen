<p>To achieve more information for better bioavailability and drug-likeness of the identified compounds, we present an example of the top four suitable phytocompounds that can be delivered more as a potent candidate for drug discovery (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00768-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The results of the bioavailability radar have been depicted by the lipophilicity: XLOGP3 between −0.7 and +5.0, size: MW between 150 and 500 g/mol, polarity: TPSA between 20 and 130 Å2, solubility: log S not higher than 6, saturation: fraction of carbons in the sp3 hybridization not less than 0.25 and flexibility: no more than 9 rotatable bonds with the colored zone defined the desired physicochemical space for good oral bioavailability indicating that they possess good drug-likeness properties.
