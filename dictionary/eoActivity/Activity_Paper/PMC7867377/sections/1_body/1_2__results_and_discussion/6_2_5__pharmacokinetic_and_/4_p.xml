<p>Human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms involved in drug metabolism in liver were also generated. Amongst them, CYP3A4 is the major and most clinically relevant drug-metabolizing enzyme in the human body. Its inhibition could lead to drug toxicity, drugâ€“drug interactions and other adverse effects. Some of them were non-inhibitors/substrate of any isoenzymes like sedanolide, however as a good result, more than 92% were found to be non-inhibitors of CYP3A4, isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of about 60% of xenobiotics including drugs, carcinogens, steroids and eicosanoids.</p>
