<p>It is well known that good drug activity may be destroyed due to inadequate ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties. In addition, unwanted pharmacokinetics and toxicity are important reasons for the failure of drug discovery in the clinical phase, which is very costly. In order to decide, the possibility of 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> ethanolic crude extract to become or not become a good candidate for suitable drug, ADMET parameters have been assessed using in silico tools (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00768-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Interestingly, all identified phytoconstituents were found to meet the Lipinski’s rule of five, and some of them such as hordenine, 4-coumaric acid and Diosmetin follows also Ghose, Veber and Egan filters with most of them displaying a good bioavailability score (55–85%). The solubility as an important feature for the absorption of the molecule and its distribution in the body given by the values of aqueous solubility indicates most of the compounds were highly soluble in water and the others are soluble.
