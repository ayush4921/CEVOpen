<p>Medicinal plants have been utilized chiefly as ethnic remedies against various diseases since ancient time. They are extensively contemplated as a source of novel phytochemicals with bioactive potential. In order to treat a variety of diseases, these phytomedicines can also lead in drug discoveries or itself become a potential drug. Hence, it is very essential to determine and estimate the bioactive potential of ethnomedicinal plants by particularizing the phytochemistry and developing them as a potent source for therapeutic agents [
