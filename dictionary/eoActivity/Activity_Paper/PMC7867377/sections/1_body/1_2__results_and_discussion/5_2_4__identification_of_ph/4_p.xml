<p>Therefore, our data suggested that the presence of these diverse biomolecules in 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract is the major reason for its antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer activities. Our results provide an opportunity to explore further this medicinally treasured pteridophyte. Moreover, for the first time we studied that the 
 <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract had a strong dose dependent cytotoxicity against three malignant cancer cell lines (HCT-116, MCF-7 and A549). Further studies are needed in order to demonstrate the efficacy and potency of specific compound in the crude extract, which might be responsible for the particular biological activity.
