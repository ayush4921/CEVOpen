 <p>In this study, we investigated the bioactive potential (antibacterial and antioxidant), anticancer activity and detailed phytochemical analysis of 
  <italic>Selaginella</italic>
  <italic>repanda (S. repanda)</italic> ethanolic crude extract for the very first time using different in vitro approaches. Furthermore, computer-aided prediction of pharmacokinetic properties and safety profile of the identified phytoconstituents were also employed in order to provide some useful insights for drug discovery. 
  <italic>S. repanda</italic>, which is a rich source of potent natural bioactive compounds, showed promising antibacterial activity against the tested pathogenic bacteria (
  <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
  <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
  <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
  <italic>S. flexneri</italic>). The crude extract displayed favorable antioxidant activity against both 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 231.6 μg/mL) and H
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub> (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 288.3 μg/mL) molecules. 
  <italic>S. repanda</italic> also showed favorable and effective anticancer activity against all three malignant cancer cells in a dose/time dependent manner. Higher activity was found against lung (A549) (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 341.1 μg/mL), followed by colon (HCT-116) (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 378.8 μg/mL) and breast (MCF-7) (IC
  <sub>50</sub> = 428.3 μg/mL) cancer cells. High resolution-liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HR-LC–MS) data of 
  <italic>S. repanda</italic> crude extract revealed the presence of diverse bioactive/chemical components, including fatty acids, alcohol, sugar, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, coumarins and phenolics, which can be the basis and major cause for its bioactive potential. Therefore, achieved results from this study confirmed the efficacy of 
  <italic>S. repanda</italic> and a prospective source of naturally active biomolecules with antibacterial, antioxidant and anticancer potential. These phytocompounds alone with their favorable pharmacokinetics profile suggests good lead and efficiency of 
  <italic>S. repanda</italic> with no toxicity risks. Finally, further in vivo experimental investigations can be promoted as probable candidates for various therapeutic functions, drug discovery and development.
