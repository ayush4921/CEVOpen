<p>The total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) of the extracts from 
 <italic>E. fluctuans</italic> were determined, and the results have been shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The highest amount of phenolics was found in the chloroform extract (19.16 ± 1.06 mg GAE/g dried extract) followed by the ethyl acetate extract (14.06 ± 1.01 mg GAE/g dried extract). The petroleum ether extract and aqueous extract contained a lower amount of phenolics. Similarly, the highest content of flavonoids was found in the chloroform extract (41.84 ± 1.76 mg CE/g dried extract) followed by the petroleum ether extract (24.86 ± 1.39 mg CE/g dried extract). The ethyl acetate extract and aqueous extract contained a comparatively less amount of flavonoids. The observed differences in the total phenolic content and total flavonoid content of the solvent extracts may be attributed to the differences in the polarity of the solvents. However, a decent amount of phenolics and flavonoids present in the chloroform extract indicated that they might contribute to the biological activity.
