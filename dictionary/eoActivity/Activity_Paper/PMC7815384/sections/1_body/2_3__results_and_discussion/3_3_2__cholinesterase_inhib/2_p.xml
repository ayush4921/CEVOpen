<p>Like acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase also hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, although less efficiently, and is hence a viable therapeutic target in AD. Inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase has been found to elevate brain acetylcholine in the brain leading to improvement of memory and cognition. The current AD drugs galantamine and rivastigmine act through inhibition of both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase [

 <italic>fluctuans</italic> for inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase by the same Ellman's method [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] as employed for acetylcholinesterase. Due to high selectivity for the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme, galantamine was used as the reference butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The results have been presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. All the tested extracts inhibited the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme. Similar to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, the highest inhibition was found in the chloroform extract followed by the ethyl acetate extract with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 48.14 and 79.68 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. On the other hand, the petroleum ether extract and aqueous extract exhibited moderate inhibition (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt; 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). The lower IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of the chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts against butyrylcholinesterase compared with acetylcholinesterase suggest that these extracts have more specificity for butyrylcholinesterase than acetylcholinesterase.
