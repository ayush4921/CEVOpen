<p>Oxidative stress is extensive in AD and closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. It is increasingly evident that free radicals are involved in neuronal dysfunction in AD through the peroxidation of membrane lipid. A
 <italic>β</italic> protein, which is easily aggregated and forms senile plaques, has been shown to be an inducer of free radical production in neuronal cells leading to increased peroxidation of lipid in the brain with AD [

 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic>, resveratrol, and curcumin, by virtue of their antioxidant activity, can reduce the oxidative damage to neurons [
