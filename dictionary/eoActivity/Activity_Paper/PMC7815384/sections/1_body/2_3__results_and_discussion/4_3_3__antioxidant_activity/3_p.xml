<p>Reducing power assay, which reflects the capacity of an antioxidant to donate an electron, is another commonly used 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> model to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the plant extracts. In this assay, the reducing capacity of the extracts was determined by their ability to reduce the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-ferricyanide complex to the ferrous form. The reaction could be monitored by the spectrophotometer due to the appearance of the blue color of ferrous ions. The reducing activity of all the extracts was evident by the formation of the color of ferrous ions. The absorbance of the different extracts at different concentrations has been shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The absorbance of the extract was found to be related to the concentration of the extract. Similar to radical scavenging, the chloroform extract showed the highest reducing activity. The order of potency as judged from the absorbance values was chloroform extract&gt;ethyl acetate extract&gt;petroleum ether extract&gt;aqueous extract. The results of both assays demonstrated the antioxidant potential of
