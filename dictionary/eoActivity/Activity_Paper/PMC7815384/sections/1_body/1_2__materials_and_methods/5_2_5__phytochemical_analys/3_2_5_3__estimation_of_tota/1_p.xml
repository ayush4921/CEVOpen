<p>The aluminum chloride colorimetric method was employed to measure the total flavonoid content of various extracts of

 <italic>fluctuans</italic> using catechin as a reference standard [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. 1.0 mL of the sample was mixed with 3.0 mL of methanol, 0.2 mL of 1 M potassium acetate, 0.2 mL of 10% aluminum chloride, and 5.6 mL of purified water. The resulting mixture was left at room temperature for 30 minutes, and the absorbance was read at 420 nm. The total flavonoid content was determined from the standard catechin graph and expressed as mg of catechin equivalent (CE)/g of dried extract.
