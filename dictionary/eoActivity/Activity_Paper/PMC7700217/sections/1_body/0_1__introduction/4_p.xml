<p>This work refers to a study that aimed to investigate the chemical profile, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and healing properties of different parts (roots, seeds, leaves, and capitula) of 
 <italic>Anacyclus pyrethrum</italic> (L) endemic to Moroccan soil. Even though Manouze et al. (2017) studied the anti-inflammatory effect of 
 <italic>Anacyclus pyrethrum,</italic> their work was limited to roots only, unlike in the present study, where we made a comparison between areal and root parts and even included samples from a different geographic area.
