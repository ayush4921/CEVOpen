<p>Male adult Wistar rats (weighing 221 ± 22 g) and male Swiss mice (weighing 33 ± 3 g) were used to assess the pharmacological activities of plant samples. Animals were typically housed in cages (five animals/cage) in a temperature-controlled room with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle and relative humidity of 55 ± 5%. The animals were given free access to food and water. The institutional ethical committee of care and use of the laboratory animals at the Faculty of Sciences Dhar El Mehraz, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdallah Fez University, Morocco, reviewed and approved the present study under the ethical clearance number 04/2019/LBEAS. </p>
