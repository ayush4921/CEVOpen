 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05469" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Rats were divided into six groups, with five in each group. The negative control group was treated with physiological water, and the positive control group was treated with 1% diclofenac. One hour before the induction of inflammation by carrageenan (1%; NaCl 0.9%) under the plantar fascia of the right hind leg of rats, the volume of the paw was measured. Afterward, the paw was measured within 1 h, 3 h, and 5 h following the carrageenan injection.
