<p>The wound healing activity was evaluated according to the method described by Imtara et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-05469" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Wounds were created on the skin of the dorsal-omoplate region of each anesthetized rat. The animals were divided into six groups, with five in each group. All groups were treated daily with cream extracts at 5% and 10% by applying them over the wound previously cleaned with alcohol at 96 Â°C. The negative control group was treated with neutral cream (containing no anti-healing molecules), and the positive control group was treated with Madecassol cream. The edges of wounds were traced on polypropylene sheets, and photographs were taken every day up to 21 days. The wound healing was regularly observed on days 1, 3, 7, 12, 15, and 18. Each wound area was calculated using Adobe Illustrator CS5 NA image analysis software (version 5).
