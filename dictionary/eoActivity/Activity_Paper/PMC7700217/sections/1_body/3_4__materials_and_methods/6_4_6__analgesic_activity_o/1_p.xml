<p>In this work, the formaldehyde method was also used to evaluate the analgesic effect, as described in earlier work [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-05469" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Briefly, one hour before the injection of 20 μL of formaldehyde solution (2.5%) under the plantar pad of the right hind leg, groups were orally treated with APPR (300 mg/kg), APPF (300 mg/kg), APPC (500 mg/kg), and APPG (500 mg/kg). Paracetamol (100 mg/kg) was used as a reference product. Immediately after the injection of formaldehyde solution, the licking time (in seconds) of the treated paw was determined in two phases. The first phase was from 0 to 5 min, and the second was from 15 to 30 min, with an intermediate period of 10 min. The pain inhibition percentage was determined according to the following formula:
