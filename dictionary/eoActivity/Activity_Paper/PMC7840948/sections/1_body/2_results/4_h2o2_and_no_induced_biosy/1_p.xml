<p id="Par19">The pigment components in all treatments were analyzed by HPLC, and two substances with the highest absorption peaks were detected: EA and HA. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, H2O2 and SNP treatments significantly increased the production of EA and HA compared with the control group whereas CAT and cPTIO treatment significantly inhibited the yield of EA and HA. In CAT + SNP treatments, CAT could not significantly inhibit the increase of EA and HA production induced by SNP, while in cPTIO + H

 <sub>2</sub> and cPTIO + SNP treatment groups restored the yield of EA and HA on the basis of scavengers. The results are consistent with the results of PQs content above (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Collectively, these results indicated that HA and EA are the main PQs production which were promoted by H
