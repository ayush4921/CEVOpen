<p id="Par20">The transcriptional level of HA biosynthetic genes (the genes encoding FF, Hydroxylase (Hyd), Omef, Major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, OF, PKS, Fasciclin (Fas) and Multicopper oxidase (Mult)) in different treatment groups were analyzed by qRT-PCR (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The results showed that the transcriptional level of SNP and H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment groups was higher than that of the control group, which was consistent with the result of PQs content above (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), whereas the results in treatments of cPTIO, cPTIO + H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and cPTIO + SNP were on the contrary. In SNP treatment, the genes encoding PKS (50.9-fold), OF (13.6-fold) and Hyd (9.1-fold) were significantly upregulated as well as in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment (18.3-fold, 15.3-fold and 8.5-fold). In cPTIO treatment, the genes encoding Mult, PKS and Fas had the strongest transcriptional suppression. In cPTIO + H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment, the transcriptional levels of genes encoding PKS, Mult and Hyd were decreased. In cPTIO + SNP, the transcriptional suppression of genes encoding Mult, OF and PKS was greater than that of other genes. These results showed that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO significantly enhanced the transcriptional level of HA biosynthetic genes. However, the addition of scavengers significantly inhibited the transcriptional level of HA biosynthetic genes, among which cPTIO and cPTIO + H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment groups significantly reduced HA production. These results indicated that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO increase the HA yield mainly by promoting the transcriptional level of HA biosynthetic genes.
