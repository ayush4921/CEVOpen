 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO are often involved in the production of secondary metabolites as signal molecules in plants. The level of cytosolic NO was analyzed in 64 h-old, 68 h-old, 72 h-old, 76 h-old, 80 h-old and 84 h-old strains grown at 28 °C. Higher amount of NO were observed after H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatments than that of control. After adding H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> for 64 h, 68 h, 72 h 80 h and 84 h, the concentration of intracellular NO was 78%, 42%, 22%, 21%, 21% and 17% higher than that of the control, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These results indicate that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment can induce an increase of cytosolic NO content. In order to study the effect of NO on the content of PQs, different concentrations of SNP and cPTIO were added respectively for liquid fermentation. When 0.01 mM SNP was added, the content of PQs reached the maximum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). And the promoting effect of SNP on PQs biosynthesis can be inhibited by its specific scavenger cPTIO. When 0.05 mM cPTIO was added, the yield of PQs could be significantly inhibited. Therefore, the concentrations of 0.01 mM SNP and 0.05 mM cPTIO were selected for the follow-up experiments.
