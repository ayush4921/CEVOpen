 <sub>2</sub> and NO function as signaling molecules in plants. Cellular responses to H

 <sub>2</sub> and NO are complex, with considerable cross-talk between responses to several stimuli

 <sub>2</sub> and salicylic acid, which mediates the fungus-induced effects on the accumulation of volatile oil in
