<p id="Par6">In this study, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment was applied to increase the cytosolic NO content. As the downstream signal molecule of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, NO is able to increase the yield of PQs. In addition, it was found that the increase of PQs production was mainly due to the increase of HA and EA production. Since that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO did not affect PQs production by chemical contact, the transcriptional level of HA biosynthetic genes was evaluated. The results indicated that NO increased HA production mainly by promoting transcriptional level of HA biosynthetic genes. This research found that exogenous addition of NO can increase the PQs production, which provides a theoretical reference for increasing the yield of secondary metabolites of
