 <italic>Shiraia bambusicola</italic>is a rare parasitic fungus belonging to Ascomycota, which is also a traditional medicinal resource in China. This fungus usually parasitizes on the twigs of 
 <italic>Brachystachyum</italic> and other bamboos, and the fruiting body is known as 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic>. 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> is mainly distributed in the south of the Yangtze River in China, as well as in Japan

 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> can be used to treat pertussis, sciatica, tracheitis and other diseases. The mainly bioactive secondary metabolites in 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> are hypocrellins (hypocrellin A, hypocrellin B, hypocrellin C, hypocrellin D) which belongs to perylenequinones (PQs). As a photosensitizer, hypocrellin A (HA) has the ability of antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor and so on, because it can be activated under light irradiation and can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can destroy cells

 </sup>. However, the low yield of HA from fruiting bodies or traditional fermentations limits its application. Many studies have been devoted to increasing the yield of HA by adding different reagents or changing fermentation conditions, such as using Triton X-100
