 </sup>. Acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA were used as substrates to catalyze the formation of intermediate metabolite 
 <italic>nor</italic>-toralactone by polyketide synthase (PKS). After that, HA may be formed by methylation, hydroxylation, dimerization and redox under the action of O-methyltransferase/FAD-dependent monooxygenase (OF), O-methyltransferase (Omef), FAD/FMN-dependent oxidoreductase (FF) and other enzymes. These enzymes play an important role in HA biosynthetic pathways, the transcriptional level of their encoding genes is closely related to the yield of HA.
