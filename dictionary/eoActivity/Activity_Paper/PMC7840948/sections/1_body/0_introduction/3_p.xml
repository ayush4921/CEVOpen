<p id="Par4">ROS are well-known as a normal metabolite of oxygen in aerobically growing cells, providing vital signaling functions for diverse cellular processes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>
 </sup>. As a member of ROS, hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) acts as a major redox metabolite operative in signaling, redox sensing and redox regulation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Meanwhile, current evidences are accumulating that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is also associated with the production of secondary metabolites
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>
 </sup>. For example, the concentrations of both anthocyanin and total flavonoids were significantly induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment in 
 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup>. Toxigenic isolate of 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus</italic> responses to oxidative stress are related to their ability to produce aflatoxin
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>
 </sup>. There is a relationship between ROS and lovastatin biosynthesis in 
 <italic>Aspergillus terreus</italic>
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. Recently, it was reported that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> is involved in the biosynthesis of PQs. When H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> at 30 µM was applied, the HA production of 
 <italic>Shiraia</italic> sp. A8 was most effectively enhanced
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>
 </sup>. And hypocrellin production of 
 <italic>Shiraia</italic> sp. SUPER-H168 was significantly improved when treated with high concentrations of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (10–20 mM)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>
 </sup>. These evidences suggest that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> may be involved in the biosynthesis of PQs, but the signal relationship or regulatory pathway is not clear.
