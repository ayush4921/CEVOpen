<p id="Par26">Although we believe that NO participates in the biosynthesis and accumulation of PQs induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and promotes the production of EA and HA, it still needs to be further confirmed by gene knockout of genes related to NO synthase and to explore the molecular regulation mechanism of signal molecules to enhance the production of secondary metabolites. In this study, exogenous addition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO can effectively improve the ability of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> to produce PQs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). Therefore, we speculate whether the activation of endogenous H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO signals by physical or chemical methods is also conducive to the accumulation of secondary metabolites of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> such as EA and HA in fermentation production. However, there are many uncertain factors in fermentation production, and its effect still needs to be further verified.
