<p id="Par25">In order to explore whether H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO are involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes related to HA biosynthesis, the transcriptional levels of several related genes were detected, such as PKS, OF and Hyd. The results showed that the transcriptional levels of these genes were significantly up-regulated in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO-induced strains, and were significantly higher than other HA biosynthetic genes. On the contrary, the addition of scavengers inhibited the transcriptional level. Deng et al. reported that the gene that encoding PKS is essential in HA biosynthesis

 </sup>. It is suggested that H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO promote HA biosynthesis mainly by regulating the transcription of these three key genes, but the mechanism remains to be further studied. HA and EA have similar structures, and we suspected that their biosynthetic genes are similar. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO also can increase the yield of EA by increasing the transcriptional level of these three genes.
