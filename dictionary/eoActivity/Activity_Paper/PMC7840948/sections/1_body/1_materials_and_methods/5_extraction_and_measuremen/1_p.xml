<p id="Par11">The fermentation liquid of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> S4201 was filtered to obtain mycelium, and liquid nitrogen was used to grind the mycelia into powder. The powdered sample was transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifugal tube, and 400 μL pre-cooled phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was added. The mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was used for the detection of protein concentration, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO. The contents of protein, H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and NO were measured by Modified Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Sangon Biotech, China), Hydrogen Peroxide assay kit and Nitric Oxide (NO) assay kit (Microwell plate method) (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
