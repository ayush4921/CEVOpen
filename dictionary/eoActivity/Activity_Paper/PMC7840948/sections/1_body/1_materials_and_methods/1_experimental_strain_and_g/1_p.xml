 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> S4201 was isolated from the fruiting bodies of 
 <italic>S. bambusicola</italic> in China, a strain which has shown excellent HA production. The strain S4201 was cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA, 200 g/L potato extract, 20 g/L glucose, 20 g/L agar) medium. The spores of S4201 cultured for 120 h were washed with sterile water and prepared into a spore suspension with a final concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> spores/mL. Then, S4201 was incubated in potato dextrose broth (PDB, 200 g/L potato extract, 20 g/L glucose, pH 7.0) medium with Triton X-100 for 120 h at 28 °C on a shaker at 150 rpm.
