 </sup>. The detection of PQs was carried out by microplate reader (SpectraMax M2). 464Â nm was used as the detection wavelength. Based on the linear regression of the optical density and concentration, the linear regression equation of HA was obtained. The yield of PQs was calculated with HA production as the standard.
