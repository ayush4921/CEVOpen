 </sup>. The standard curve was established as follows: glucose solutions with concentration of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1 mg/mL were configured. The detection of glucose concentration was carried out by using microplate reader. 625 nm was used as the detection wavelength. The linear regression equation of soluble sugar was obtained by the optical density and concentration.
