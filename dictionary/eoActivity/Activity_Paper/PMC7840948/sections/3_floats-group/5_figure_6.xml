  <p>The transcriptional activities of HA biosynthetic genes in different treatments. FF: FAD/FMN-dependent oxidoreductase, Hyd: Hydroxylase, Omef: O-methyltransferase, MFS: Major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, OF: O-methyltransferase/FAD-dependent monooxygenase, PKS: Polyketide synthase, FAS: Fasciclin, Mult: Multicopper oxidase. The transcriptional level of control group was given an arbitrary value of 1. A color scale indicates the transcriptional activities of the different genes, from lowest (blue) to highest (red).</p>
