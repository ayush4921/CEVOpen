<p>Kwon et al. (1999) reported that five compounds—Linderin A, (+)-xanthoxyol, Pluviatilol, Actiforin, 5,6-dihydroxymatairesinol, (+)-syringaresinol and (+)-9’-O-trans-feruloyl-5,5’-dimethoxylariciresinol—possessed a cytotoxic effect on a small panel of human tumour cell lines [

(−)-Syringaresinol significantly inhibited the human promyelocytic HL-60 leukaemia cell proliferation via G1 arrest and also induced apoptosis (
 <xref rid="plants-09-01765-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). (−)-syringaresinol treatment increased the expression of Cdki proteins (p21(cip1/waf1) and p27(kip1)) and decreased the cyclin D(1), cyclin D(2), cdk2, cdk4, cdk6 and cyclin E expression, thus arresting the G(1) phase. It also induced apoptosis through fragmenting the DNA, altering the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. in addition, it stimulated cytochrome c release and activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 [
