<p>Recently, LO has been reported to attenuate oxidative stress and airway inflammation in ovalbumin-challenged (OVA) asthma mice and TNF-α-stimulated NCI-H292 cells (

In TNF-α-stimulated NCI-H292 cells, LO leaf extract (LOLE) (~100 μg/mL) increased HO-1 and NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) expression and promoted the translocation of Nrf-2 into the nucleus, thus effectively suppressing ROS, NO and lipid peroxidation [

In another study of ovalbumin (OVA)-challenged mice, treatment with LOLE (~100 mg/kg) effectively inhibited the phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-κB and suppressed activator protein AP-1, Th2 cytokines and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) in the lung tissues of mice. LOLE also reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and NF-κB activation. Further study showed that LOLE effectively suppressed the ROS and NO levels, and thus markedly suppressed the inflammation of airways and mucus production of the OVA-challenged mice [
