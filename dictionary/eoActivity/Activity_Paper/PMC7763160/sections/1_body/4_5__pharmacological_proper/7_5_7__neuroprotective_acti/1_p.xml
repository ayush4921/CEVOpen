<p>Lignans display significant neuroprotective activities against glutamate-induced toxicity in primary cultures of rat cortical cells [

 <sc>o</sc>-di-(
 <sc>e</sc>)-feruloyl-meso-5,5’-dimethoxysecoisolariciresinol (a) and 9,9’-O-di-(
 <sc>e</sc>)-sinapinoyl-meso-5,5’-dimethoxysecoisolariciresinol (b) with a known compound 9,9’-O-di-(
 <sc>e</sc>)-feruloyl-meso-secoisolariciresinol(c) isolated from the methanolic extract of LO stems (LOSE). Among these three compounds, (a) and (c) showed significant neuroprotective activity against glutamate-induced oxidative stress in HT22 hippocampal cells in a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay [
