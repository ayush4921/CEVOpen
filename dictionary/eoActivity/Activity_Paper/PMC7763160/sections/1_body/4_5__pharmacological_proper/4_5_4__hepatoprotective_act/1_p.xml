<p>In an in vitro study, (+)-episesamin isolated from a 70% ethanolic reaction showed antifibrotic activity. (+)-episesamin reduced the expression of profibrotic autocrine TGF-β, and therefore stopped the proliferation of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) without any significant cytotoxicity (

In another in vivo study, a 70% ethanolic extract of LO showed remarkable hepatoprotection against tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced oxidative hepatotoxicity in rats. LO extract also prevented tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced oxidative damage in hepatic HepG2 cells. However, pre-treatment with LO extract significantly lowered the serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases, and glutathione levels were increased in the liver, decreasing the lipid peroxidation in a dose-dependent manner. The LO extract also significantly reduced t-BHP-induced hepatotoxicity [

In another study, LO extract decreased intracellular oxidative stress and lowered the expression of a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 in activated rat and human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). LO extract also disrupted TGF-β autoinduction and increased the expression of MMP-3, MMP-2 and gelatinolytic activity. These findings demonstrated that the antifibrotic effect of LO extract is mediated by antioxidant activity (
