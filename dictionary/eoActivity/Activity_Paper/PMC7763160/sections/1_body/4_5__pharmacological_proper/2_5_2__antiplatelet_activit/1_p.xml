<p>One study demonstrated the effect of LO leaf extract (LOLE) platelet activities, coagulation, and thromboembolism in in vitro and ex vivo experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01765-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In rat platelet, LOLE significantly inhibited collagen-induced thromboxane A2 (TXA2) production. A mixture of collagen and epinephrine induced pulmonary thromboembolism in mice. Oral administration of LOLE significantly altered the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) but not prothrombin time (PT). However, the results demonstrate that LOLE extract possesses antithrombotic effects that might be due to its antiplatelet activities [

In addition to concentration-dependent inhibition collagen- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation, LOLE could directly scavenge DPPH radicals. Oral administration of LOLE also reduced the number of deaths in the intravenous injection of collagen plus epinephrine-induced mouse model of pulmonary thrombosis [
