 <italic>L. glauca</italic> (LG), another species of the 
 <italic>Lindera</italic> genus, has been reported to possess free radical scavenging activity and can inhibit lipid peroxidation activity. The water and EtOH extracts of LG stem increased cell viability and reduced ROS generation in tert-butyl hydroperoxide-induced oxidative stress in Chang cells. In addition, it also increased the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, and expression of the superoxide dismutase gene of zebrafish against oxidative stress [

The polyphenolic content of the LG extract was 70.99 ± 1.88 μg/TAE μg. The LG extract showed high DPPH radical scavenging activity, nitrite scavenging activity and reducing power activities. In addition, stem and root extracts were found to possess high antiproliferative activities in HT-29 and HCT116 cells [

 <sc>l</sc>-rhamnoside, procyanidin A2, cinnamtannin B, cinnamtannin D1, and procyanidin A1—were tested for their inhibition of low-density lipoprotein oxidation; only four of them—procyanidin A2, cinnamtannin B1, cinnamtannin D1, and procyanidin A1—showed strong low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation inhibitory activities [
