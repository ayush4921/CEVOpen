<p>Another species of the genus 
 <italic>Lindera</italic>, i.e., 
 <italic>L. neesiana</italic> (Wall. ex Nees) Kurz (LN) has been reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective activities. Treatment with both water and EtOH extract of LN was found to reduce the production of NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS and COX-2 production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 cells. Furthermore, LN extract increased the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and decreased the activation of microglia cells. The water extract of LN fruit increased the secretion of Nrf-2 in N2a cells and inhibited LDH release in H
