 <italic>L. erythrocarpa</italic> (LE) is a widely distributed shrub in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. Its dried fruits, which are also referred to as red mountain pepper, are used in folk medicine for indigestion and pain [

Lucidone, a cyclopentenedione isolated from the fruits of LE, has demonstrated significant protective abilities against free-radical and inflammation stimulator 2,2’-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH)-induced oxidative stress in human keratinocyte cells (HaCaT) through up-regulating HO-1/Nrf-2 gene expression and down-regulating the NF-κB signalling pathway [

 <italic>,</italic> (−)-epicatechin, avicularin, and quercitrin prevented apoptotic cell death of H9c2 cardiomyocytes treated with buthionine-[S,R]-sulfoximine. These compounds also reduced the propidium iodide uptake by these cells and dose-dependently decreased the release of lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) [
