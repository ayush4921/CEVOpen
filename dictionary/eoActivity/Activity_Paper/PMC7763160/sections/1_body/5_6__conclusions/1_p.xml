<p>Plants are the primary source of bioactive compounds that can be directly used for drugs or further modified into therapeutic agents. Both extracts and isolated bioactive compounds of LO have been reported to be effective in many oxidative stress-associated diseases. Most of these compounds possess remarkable in vitro and in vivo antioxidant and other pharmacological properties through the modulation of different inflammatory pathways (NF-κB, TNF-α, MAPK), cell proliferation (Cyclin D, E; Gi phase), antioxidative (Nrf-2/HO-1), apoptosis (Bax/Bcl-2, Cas-3), antimelanogenic (MITF), etc., but further research is necessary to explore the specific cellular and molecular targets of all of these active constituents. A detailed investigation is also required to study the mechanism of actions of potentially bioactive compounds such as (+)-syringaresinol, quercitrin, afzelin and (+)-episesamin for their diverse role in inflammation, cell proliferation and allergy. For example, several compounds have been discovered that possess neuroprotective potential; however, this claim requires an in-depth investigation. Despite ethanolic, methanolic and water extract of the different parts of LO yielding numerous bioactive constituents, most of these compounds remain uninvestigated for their pharmacological activities. Such investigations may provide new lead compounds for the development of future therapeutic agents. </p>
