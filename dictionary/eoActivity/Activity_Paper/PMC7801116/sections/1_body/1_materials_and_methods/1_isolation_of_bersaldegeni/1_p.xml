<p>The method of isolation and structure elucidation of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate was described by Moniuszko-Szajwaj et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Briefly, the ground roots of 
 <italic>K. daigremontiana</italic> were extracted with water at room temperature, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Next, the extract was purified on a LiChroprep RP-18 preparative column (100 mm × 60 mm, 40–63 µm) with 80% (v/v) aqueous methanol and the bufadienolide-rich fraction was obtained. This fraction was then partitioned between water and butanol to afford 
 <italic>n</italic>-BuOH extract, which was applied on a Sephadex LH-20 column (950 mm × 22 mm, 25–100 μm), eluted with MeOH, and afforded subfractions, which were separated on a Lichroprep RP-18 column (32 mm × 320 mm, 40–63 μm), eluted with a linear gradient of 15%–40% (v/v) aqueous MeOH in a 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH. Individual bufadienolides were purified isocratically by a semi-preparative HPLC on a C18 column (Kromasil 100-5-C18, 250 mm × 10 mm, 5 μm), using different concentrations of aqueous methanol solutions with 0.1% (v/v) HCOOH. The one from the isolated compounds was bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate. The yield of this compound was 0.32 mg (0.032%) in 1 g of dry mass of the root. Its structure elucidation was performed using ESI-MS and NMR spectral data analyses, optical rotation, circular dichroism and IR spectroscopy. The compound was dissolved in sterile DMSO at a concentration 20 mg/mL.
