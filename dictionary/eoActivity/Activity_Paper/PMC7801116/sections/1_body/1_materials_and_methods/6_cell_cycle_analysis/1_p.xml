<p>To determine the HeLa cell cycle arrest after treatment with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate, we seeded the cells (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and incubated with the compound at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 µg/mL for 48 h. DMSO concentration in a control sample was 0.25% (v/v). Next, the cells were harvested and stained with Muse Cell Cycle Assay Kit (Merck Millipore), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The amount of HeLa cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of cell cycle was determined by Muse Cell Analyzer. The experiments were independently repeated three times.
