<p>To show the effect of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate in HeLa cell nuclei, we stained the cells with the blue fluorescent Hoechst 33342 dye (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). HeLa cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After 24 h, the cells were treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate at concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 µg/mL for another 24 h. The concentration of the solvent (DMSO) in a control sample was 0.25% (v/v). Then, the cells were stained with the Hoechst dye (1.0 µg/mL) and observed under a fluorescent microscope (Leica, Heerbrugg, Switzerland).
