<p>The evaluation of DNA damage was analysed with the alkaline comet assay using the Reagent Kit for Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis Assay (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in 12-well plates. Cells were treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate at the concentrations of 1.0 and 5.0 µg/mL for 6 h and 24 h. Next cells were collected and combined with low melting agarose at a ratio of 1:10 and 50 µL of cell suspension was spread onto the CometSlides (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Slides were immersed in the lysis solution for 1 h at 4 °C, after which they were placed in the alkaline unwinding solution for 1 h at 4 °C. Slides were next placed in the electrophoresis slide tray and immersed in the alkaline electrophoresis solution in the CometAssay ES unit (Trevigen). Slides were submitted to electrophoresis at 1 V/cm for 30 min. Following electrophoresis, slides were washed and then stained with Sybr Gold (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 30 min at RT. Slides were analysed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon PCM-2000) and images of at least 50 comets per slide were analysed with the TriTek CometScore 2.0 software. Two regions of the comet were selected, the whole cellular DNA and the region of DNA within the comet head. The densities of the regions were defined and the results are presented as tail moment expressed as the percentage of DNA in the tail multiplied by the tail length. Each treatment was normalized to that of the control.
