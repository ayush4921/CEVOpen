<p>HeLa cells were seeded in a 6-well plate with coverslips (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate at concentrations of 1 and 5 µg/mL. DMSO was added to the cells (control) at a concentration of 0.25% (v/v). A positive control was etoposide added to the cells at concentration of 10 μM. After 6 h and 24 h, the cells on the coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde (v/v) at room temperature for 10 min and then, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min. Blocking step was performed with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA, w/v) for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the anti-phospho-H2A.X (Ser139), clone JBW30, Alexa Fluor 555 Conjugate antibody (1:100, mouse monoclonal, Merck Millipore) in 1% BSA (w/v) for 1 h. After three steps of washes, the cells on the coverslips were incubated with Hoechst 33342 dye (2.0 µg/mL) at room temperature for 20 min and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Images of at least 100 nuclei per slide were analysed.
