<p>We seeded HeLa cells (3 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well) in 6-well plates and treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate at a concentration of 1.0 μg/mL for 24 h. The control sample was treated with DMSO at a concentration 0.05% (v/v). Next, the cells were harvested and the isolation of total RNA was performed with RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) according with the manufacturer’s instruction. The quality and concentration of isolated RNA was measured by Agilent Technologies 4200 TapeStation (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), according with the manufacturer’s protocol. Next, we performed synthesis of cDNA using Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), following with the manufacturer’s protocol. Obtained cDNA was applied on the Applied Biosystems TaqMan Array Human Apoptosis 96-well FAST Plates (Life Technologies, USA) that contain 92 assays for cell death associated genes and 4 assays for endogenous control genes (18S, GAPDH, HPRT1, and GUSB) (

The PCR reactions were performed on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). All the obtained data were analysed by StepOne software v.2.3. The experiments were performed three times, independently.
