<p>The activity of caspase-3/7 was measured according with method described previously (Adamska et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Briefly, the cells were seeded in 12-well plates (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 µg/mL. The concentration of DMSO added to a control sample did not exceed 0.25% (v/v). After 24 h, the cells were harvested and prepared according with the protocol of Muse Caspase-3/7 Assay Kit (Merck Millipore). Then, the cells were analysed by Muse Cell Analyzer. The experiments were performed at least in three independent repeats.
