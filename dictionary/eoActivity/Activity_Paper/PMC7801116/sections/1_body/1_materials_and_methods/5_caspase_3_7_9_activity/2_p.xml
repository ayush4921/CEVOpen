<p>The activity of caspase-9 was measured by a luminometer. The cells were seeded in 96-well plates and exposed to bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 µg/mL. The DMSO concentration in a control sample was 0.25% (v/v). The activity of caspase-9 was measured in the cells after 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, and 24 h of incubation the cells with the compound. We used Caspase-Glo 9 Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and Glomax Multi + Detection System (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The experiments were repeated three times, independently.</p>
