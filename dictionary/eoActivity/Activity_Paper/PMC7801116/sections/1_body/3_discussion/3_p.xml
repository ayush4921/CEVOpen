<p>There are only a few reports on biological activity of bersaldegenin derivatives on normal and cancer cells (Kolodziejczyk-Czepas et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Stefanowicz-Hajduk et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). In our previous study, we showed that bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate caused very significant decrease in viability of HeLa, SKOV-3, MCF-7, and A375 cell lines. We also observed that this compound did not trigger an increase in the population of early apoptotic cells (Stefanowicz-Hajduk et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). To estimate the signalling pathway leading to cell death after treatment with the bersaldegenin compound, we have prepared experiments with HeLa cells in the present study. The microscopic, flow cytometry, luminometric, and RT-qPCR results indicate that the tested compound induced mostly caspase-independent cell death. Microscopic observation of the treated cells revealed that the HeLa cell nuclei had disorganized chromatin with homogenous dispersed DNA fragments. These changes, revealed after Hoechst staining, were not similar to typical morphological features of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, another performed experiments showed that bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate induced reactive oxygen species overproduction and did not cause depolarization of mitochondrial membrane as well as activation of initiating caspase-9 and effector caspases-3/7. What is important, the compound strongly induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. This is often associated with activation of S- and G2/M phase DNA damage checkpoints. This damage can be induced by exogenous (e.g., alkylating compounds, antitumor chemotherapeutics, plant metabolites, UV, radiation) and endogenous agents such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are produced during cellular metabolism (Jackson &amp; Bartek 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In this process, cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA replication occur (Mannuss et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In our study, we observed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) damage in HeLa cells treated with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate during the comet assay. Furthermore, as confirmation of the comet assay results we prepared the immunofluorescence staining and observed accumulation of phosphorylated histone H2A.X (γH2AX) in the cells – an indicator of the level of ds DNA damage in nuclei, what also confirms the role of DNA-damage response in the compound treated cells (Jackson &amp; Bartek
