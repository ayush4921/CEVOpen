<p>Additionally, to confirm induction of DNA damage by bersaldegenin orthoacetate in HeLa cells we performed immunofluorescence staining. The cells were treated with the compound at concentrations of 1.0 and 5.0 μg/mL for 6 h and 24 h. The obtained results showed that the amount of the cells with phospho histone H2A.X (γH2AX) increased after treatment with the compound and γH2AX signal was higher in these nuclei than in DMSO control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009">Figure 9</xref>). Most of the treated cells expressed γH2AX signal that was distributed throughout the nuclei. Therefore, the compound-induced γH2AX could not be quantified by the direct visual counting of ‘foci’ and the activation is presented as the percentage of γH2AX positive nuclei in the HeLa cells populations.
