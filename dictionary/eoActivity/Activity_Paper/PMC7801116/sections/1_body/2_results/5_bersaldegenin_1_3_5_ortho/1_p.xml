<p>The effects of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate on the induction of DNA damage in HeLa cells were evaluated with the alkaline comet assay. The effects of the compound at the concentrations of 1.0 and 5.0 µg/mL were evaluated after 6 h and 24 h of treatment. The degree of DNA damage was determined by defining the extent of DNA migration in the comet and results are presented as tail moment, which is the product of the percentage of total DNA in the tail and tail length. The results of the comet assay revealed increase in DNA damage as determined by the increase in tail moment. After 6 h of treatment, 5-fold and 18-fold increases in DNA damage were observed, as compared to control samples, at the concentrations of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate 1.0 and 5.0 µg/mL, respectively. At longer time treatment, a further increase in DNA damage was observed, and the tail moment increased 20-fold and 42-fold at the concentrations of 1.0 and 5.0 µg/mL, respectively (
