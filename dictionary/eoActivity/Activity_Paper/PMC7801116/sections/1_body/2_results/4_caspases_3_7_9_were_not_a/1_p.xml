<p>The activity of caspase-9 was measured in HeLa cells after treatment with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate for 1, 2, 3, 4, 14 and 24 h. The caspase-9 activity estimated by luminometric method revealed that the tested compound did not increase the activity level of this caspase in the cells in all the measurement points in comparison to the control. Furthermore, we observed significant decrease in the activity of caspase-9 after 24 h of treatment the cells with the compound (
