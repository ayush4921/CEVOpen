<p>Furthermore, the activity of caspase-3/7 is indicated by an increase in population of early apoptotic cells. In the treated cells with the compound after 24 h and 48 h, the activity of caspase-3/7 was slightly higher than in the untreated cells. Also, we observed a significant increase in the population of late apoptotic and dead cells what indicated that the main pathway of the HeLa cell death is caspase-3/7 independent (
