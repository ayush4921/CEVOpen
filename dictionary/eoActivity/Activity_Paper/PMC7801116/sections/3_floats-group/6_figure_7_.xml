  <p>The activity of caspase-3/7 in HeLa cells after treatment with bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate. The cells were treated with the compound at concentrations of 0.1–5.0 µg/mL for 24 h and 48 h. The caspase activity was estimated by flow cytometry and the graph presented live, apoptotic, and dead cell populations in comparison to the control (0.25% DMSO) after 24 h (A) and 48 h (B) of treatment. C–F present the effect of DMSO (C) and the compound (0.5 (D), 2.0 (E), 5.0 µg/mL (F), respectively) on HeLa cells after 48 h of treatment. Each sample was run in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Significant differences relative to the control are marked with an ‘*’ (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
