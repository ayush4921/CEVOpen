  <p>Induction of DNA damage by bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate in HeLa cells. Cells were treated with concentrations of 1.0 and 5.0 μg/mL for 6 and 24 h. The extent of DNA damage was compared to control cells. (A–F) represent images of DNA damage induced in HeLa cells treated with DMSO (A) and the compound 1.0 µg/mL (B), 5.0 µg/mL (C) for 6 h and DMSO (D) and the compound 1.0 µg/mL (E), 5.0 µg/mL (F) for 24 h. DNA damage was analysed with the comet assay and defined as tail moment (G). Results are means of (± SD) of three repetitions. Significant differences between control and treated samples are indicated with an ‘*’ (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
