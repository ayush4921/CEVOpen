  <p>Bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate induced changes in the expression of genes in HeLa cells. The cells were treated with 0.05% DMSO (control) and the compound at a concentration of 1.0 µg/mL for 24 h. The expression of genes was normalized to GUSB endogenous control gene and their levels are presented as a fold-change over (A) or under (B) the value 1.0 (ctrl).</p>
