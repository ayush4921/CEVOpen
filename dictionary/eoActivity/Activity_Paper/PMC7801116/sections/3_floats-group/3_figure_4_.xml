  <p>The effect of bersaldegenin-1,3,5-orthoacetate on ROS generation in HeLa cells. The cells were treated with the compound at concentrations of 0.1–5.0 µg/mL. The ROS negative (ROS−) and ROS positive (ROS+) cells were assessed by flow cytometry and determined in comparison to the control sample (0.25% DMSO). A–E show ROS level in HeLa cells treated with DMSO (A, the control) and the bersaldegenin at concentrations of 0.5 (B), 1.0 (C), 2.0 (D), and 5.0 µg/mL (E). (F) – presents the percentage of each cell population after 24 h of treatment the cells with the compound. Each sample was run in triplicate. Error bars indicate standard deviations. Significant differences relative to the control are marked with an ‘*’ (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
