<p>The data showing the antioxidant enzyme activities in tissues of infected lambs are presented in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01172-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. No effect of Hmix and/or Zn supplementation on the liver total SOD activity was detected, while the Hmix Ã— Zn interaction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.014) affected Cu/Zn SOD activity in the liver, with increased activity in the Hmix group compared to CON (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The activity of both SODs did not change in the kidney tissue, but a tendency towards increased SOD activities (SOD, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.052; Cu/Zn SOD, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.063) in the Hmix treatments was determined.
