<p>The total antioxidant capacity of the liver (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.049) and the duodenal mucosa (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.011) was affected by Hmix intake. Duodenal TAC was also significantly affected by the Hmix Ã— Zn interaction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.020) and was significantly increased in all supplemented groups compared with the CON group. Antioxidant capacity of the ileal mucosa was affected by both the Hmix (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) and Zn (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), with the highest values occuring in lambs fed a combination of Hmix and Zn compared to the CON group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and both experimental treatments (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). No significant effects on the TAC of serum, kidney, and jejunal mucosa were observed due to treatment (
