<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01172-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, there were no effects of Hmix and Zn supplementation or interaction between feed additives on lipid oxidation in the tissues. The kidney tissue of lambs fed the diets supplemented with Zn showed a tendency towards lower MDA values (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.055). There was an interaction between Hmix and Zn supplementation (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01) on lipid oxidation in the serum (
 <xref rid="antioxidants-09-01172-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The MDA values were decreased in serum of lambs fed diets with Hmix (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) or Zn (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) alone or their combination (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) as compared to those receiving the non-supplemented diet.
