<p>In the duodenal mucosa, there was observed a Hmix Ã— Zn interaction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.004) for the concentration of Fe, with increased values in lambs fed the diet with Zn alone compared to those receiving the Hmix and Zn combination (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Other tissue Fe concentrations were not changed by the dietary treatment. The Mn concentration in tissues did not differ among the dietary treatments; however, there was a trend of increased Mn level in the kidneys of lambs fed the Zn diets (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.063).
