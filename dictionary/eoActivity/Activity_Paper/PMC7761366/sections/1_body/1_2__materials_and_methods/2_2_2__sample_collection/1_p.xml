<p>At the end of the experiment, the jugular blood samples were collected from fasting lambs into heparinized tubes in the early morning, just before the sacrifice of each animal. Serum samples were obtained from blood collected into 10-mL serum-separate tubes (Sarstedt AG &amp;Co, Nümbrecht, Germany) and the serum was then separated by centrifugation at 1200× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at room temperature. The blood and sera samples were stored at −80 °C until analysis. All animals were euthanized (abattoir of the Centre of Biosciences of SAS, Institute of Animal Physiology, Košice, Slovakia, No. SK U 06018) using an overdose of pentobarbital (Dolethal, Vetoquinol, Towcester, Northamptonshire UK). The samples of liver, kidneys and small intestine were excised immediately after death. The duodenal, jejunal and ileal sections were thoroughly rinsed in an ice-cold saline solution (0.9% NaCl, pH 7.0), and the mucosa of these intestinal segments was scraped off using a glass slide onto the ice. All tissue samples were collected at the same site of relevant tissue in all the animals, cleaned thoroughly of adhering tissues, quickly frozen and stored individually in plastic bags at −80 °C until they were analyzed.
