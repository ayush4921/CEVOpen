<p>The organic zinc source (Zn-chelate of glycine hydrate, Glycinoplex-Zn 26%; Phytobiotics Futterzusatzstoffe GmbH, Eltville, Germany) was directly mixed with the commercial concentrate to provide an additional 60 mg Zn/kg and the concentration was analytically confirmed in triplicates (86.0 mg Zn/kg DM). Consumption of the experimental diets was visually controlled after each feeding and no dietary refusal was recorded. Throughout the whole experiment, the animals had free access to fresh potable water and a specially-prepared mineral lick without zinc offered to each lamb once a week. The mineral lick consisted of (g/kg) 16.2 Ca, 316 Na, 32 Mg, 0.7 Cu, 2.5 Mn, 0.06 Co, 0.02 I, and 0.01 Se.</p>
