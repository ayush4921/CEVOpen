<p>The activity of catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) was determined according to the method of Aebi [
 <xref rid="B29-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which involves monitoring the rate of disappearance of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in the presence of tissue homogenate at 240 nm. The tissue extract was reacted with freshly prepared 10 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). One unit of CAT activity is defined as the decomposition of 1 Âµmol of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> per minute at room temperature. Results are expressed in units per mg of tissue protein.
