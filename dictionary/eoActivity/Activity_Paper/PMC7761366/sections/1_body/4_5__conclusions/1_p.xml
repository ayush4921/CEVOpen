<p>In conclusion, the inclusion of medicinal herbs into the diets of infected lambs influenced their antioxidant status due to increasing the kidney and ileal catalase activity, while zinc supplementation elevated the duodenal superoxide dismutase activity. Dietary intake of both additives alone or in combination positively affected the total antioxidant capacity of tissues. The present study showed that herbal supplementation did not significantly influence the tissue uptake of trace elements (Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn). Feeding diets enriched with organic zinc improved the serum and liver zinc levels and increased copper concentration in the duodenal mucosa of lambs with nematode infection. Our results indicate that feed supplementation with medicinal herbs containing bioactive compounds and organic zinc may attenuate the adverse effects of parasite infection by stimulating endogenous antioxidant defense systems of small ruminants.</p>
