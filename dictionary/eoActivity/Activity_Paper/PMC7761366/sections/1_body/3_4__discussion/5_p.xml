<p>To further assess the antioxidant potential of both dietary supplements, the total antioxidant capacity of serum and tissues was determined in this experiment. Higher TAC values were observed in the liver, duodenal and ileal mucosa of lambs fed Hmix, and a similar pattern was found in the intestinal mucosa of lambs supplemented with Zn. The antioxidants that react in the FRAP assay include ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, uric acid, bilirubin, and polyphenolic compounds, such as catechins and other flavonoids [

Based on the assay principle as well as the mechanism of polyphenols antioxidant action mentioned above, we assume that increased TAC in the tissues of animals treated with Hmix can likely be associated with the ability of bioactive polyphenolic compounds of herbs to increase non-enzymatic antioxidant levels. Similarly, zinc induces the synthesis of antioxidants, such as metallothioneins (MTs), which can protect cells against oxidative damage, and also influences glutathione formation by affecting the expression of glutamate–cysteine ligase [

Intake of the diet with the inclusion of either Zn or Hmix alone increased GPx activity in the blood, liver and duodenal mucosa when compared with control lambs or those fed the diet containing both Hmix and Zn. The results of the present study indicate that in terms of the antioxidant activity of GPx, the sole intake of Hmix or Zn may offer greater potential for the elimination of reactive oxygen metabolites than a combination of both additives.
