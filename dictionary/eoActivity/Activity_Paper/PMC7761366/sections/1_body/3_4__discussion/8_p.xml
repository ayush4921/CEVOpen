<p>Zinc status has a marked impact on intestinal iron absorption, metabolism and modulation of Fe homeostasis. With adequate Zn dietary intake, intestinal iron absorption and transcellular transport are stimulated via induction of divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) and ferroportin (FPN) expression, respectively [
 <xref rid="B62-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Moreover, regulation of Fe absorption and mobilization by zinc might help to keep the cellular redox status in balance, because iron is known as a pro-oxidant while zinc is seen as an antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B63-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Several dietary factors, such as polyphenols, have been shown to affect iron absorption [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In our study, Fe concentration in the duodenal mucosa was significantly affected by the interaction and was elevated in lambs supplemented with Zn alone compared to those fed the combination of Zn and medicinal herbs. Dietary polyphenols possess antioxidant properties, including chelation of metals, such as iron; for this reason, it is important to study whether the regular intake of bioactive polyphenolic compounds may impair iron absorption and homeostasis. Flavonoids can affect iron status by modulating the expression and activity of proteins involved in the systemic regulation of iron metabolism and uptake [
 <xref rid="B64-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Several studies have established that bioactive dietary polyphenolic compounds significantly reduce iron absorption in the duodenum, but the precise mechanism of action is unknown [

 <xref rid="B66-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Lesjak et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] reported that quercetin treatment can influence intestinal iron uptake by inhibition of iron absorption and by decreasing the expression of duodenal DMT1 and FPN. However, Mazhar et al. [
 <xref rid="B67-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] showed that various polyphenols regulate ferroportin expression and iron homeostasis differently, which might result from differences in their structures. Furthermore, it is required to elucidate the precise mechanism of action of herbal bioactive compounds on mineral absorption in order to improve the efficient utilization of trace elements from various sources (organic/inorganic) in ruminants with a gastrointestinal infection.
