<p>The occurrence of oxidative stress in lambs experimentally infected by 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic> has been documented mainly due to the detection of lipid peroxidation, decreased GPx activity and TAC in plasma or serum [

 <xref rid="B33-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] as well as a decreased level of reduced glutathione and SOD activity in erythrocytes [
 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] or elevated plasma lactate dehydrogenase level [
 <xref rid="B35-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Data on the antioxidant status in tissues such as liver, kidney and intestinal mucosa of nematode-infected lambs treated with herbal nutraceuticals and organic Zn are currently lacking.
