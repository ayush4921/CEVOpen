<p>Feed supplementation with organic Zn increased serum and liver levels of Zn, which play a crucial role in host immune response to a nematode infection [

 <xref rid="B3-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] reported a reduction of Cu and Zn levels in the liver of lambs infected with 
 <italic>H. contortus</italic>; however, no significant decrease was observed in experimentally infected lamb parenterally treated with a combination of Zn and Cu. Gastrointestinal nematodes in sheep interfere with copper metabolism by causing a pH increase in the abomasal and duodenal digesta [
 <xref rid="B56-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, it seems that the mechanism of parasite interference with copper by blocking its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is not the only mechanism by which the parasitism negatively affects Cu metabolism in the sheep [
 <xref rid="B12-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study, Zn supplementation increased Cu content in the duodenal mucosa and also in the kidney tissue. It is important to note the competition between copper and zinc for binding to a common transporter in enterocytes; however, this occurs especially when elevated levels of Zn are present in the diet [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Iskandar et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] reported that improved Cu status in rats supplemented with a moderately high level of Zn correlated with increased duodenal mRNA expression of several Zn- trafficking proteins (i.e., MT-1, ZnT-1, ZnT-2, and ZnT-4). Therefore, it is possible that increased expression of these Zn-trafficking proteins may alter the distribution of Zn within absorptive enterocytes in a manner that alleviates the block in the activity of a Cu transporter. The results of the present study showed that Zn from an organic source (Zn chelate of glycine hydrate) added to the diet at the level up to the maximum authorized Zn content in complete feed (120 mg Zn/kg) [

The use of organic Zn sources rather than inorganic salts may improve the mineral supply due to their higher bioavailability, mainly because of their different route of absorption and lower interaction with other minerals and dietary components in the gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref rid="B57-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Our finding is in line with the results of an experiment carried out on rabbits and chicken, which showed that the antagonism between Zn and Cu was not found when organic Zn was added to the diets [
