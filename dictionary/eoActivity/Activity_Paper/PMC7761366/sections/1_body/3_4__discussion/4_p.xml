<p>Several mechanisms of flavonoids antioxidant activity have been described in vitro, including activation of antioxidant enzymes, direct scavenging of reactive oxygen species, metal chelating activity, inhibition of oxidases, reduction of α-tocopheryl radicals, increase in uric acid levels, and antioxidant properties of low molecular antioxidants [

The bioavailability of dietary phenolic compounds in ruminants is still controversial and their possible antioxidant mechanism in the animal tissues is unclear. Several studies suggest that only some dietary phenolic compounds are bioavailable in ruminants. Moñino et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] observed several of the polyphenols (i.e., rosmarinic acid, carnosol and carnosic acid) in the muscle of lambs suckling from ewes fed with a rosemary-enriched concentrate, whereas, other phenols from rosemary were not detected in the lamb tissues. According to López-Andrés et al. [
 <xref rid="B41-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the improvement of the antioxidant capacity of liver and plasma in lambs fed with grass phenolic compounds was not related to the direct transfer of phenolic compounds from herbage to the animal tissues. Dietary polyphenols undergo extensive biotransformation in the small intestine and in hepatic metabolism; therefore, their antioxidant effects might be expected within the gastrointestinal tract, where polyphenols may come into direct contact with cells before subsequent absorption and metabolism [

Moreover, feed supplementation with Hmix alone resulted in higher Cu/Zn SOD activity in the liver as well as increased GPx activity in the duodenal mucosa and blood when compared to unsupplemented lambs. Although tissue lipid peroxidation was not affected by dietary treatment, lower MDA values than in the control lambs were observed in the serum of all supplemented groups. Polyphenols could indirectly upregulate the antioxidant defense system, probably via activation of various transcription factors, including nuclear factor NrF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor) and NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) [

 <xref rid="B44-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] showed a strong positive correlation between the total polyphenols content and antioxidant capacity of some of the medicinal plants (wormwood, chamomile, fumitory and mallow) and the dietary substrate containing a mix of these herbs possessed strong ruminal antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, strong antioxidant activity has been documented for the biologically active compounds that were the most abundant in the Hmix, such as quercetin, luteolin, carnosic acid, carnosol and rosmarinic acid [

 <xref rid="B47-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and probably contributed significantly to the antioxidant effect of the Hmix. It was reported that quercetin treatment can increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes (GPx, SOD, CAT, and glutathione reductase) and reduce lipid peroxidation in tissues in vivo, suggesting that the flavonoid quercetin enhances the antioxidant defense system [
