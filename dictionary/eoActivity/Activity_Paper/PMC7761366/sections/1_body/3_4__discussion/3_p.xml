<p>Zn is a co-factor for the enzymatic activity of cytosolic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), but in this study dietary Zn supplementation did not affect the activity of this Zn-containing metalloenzyme in tissues, except for the duodenal mucosa. In contrast, Pal et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] reported a positive correlation between plasma and liver Cu/Zn SOD activity and Zn levels in ewes fed an organic mineral source. Approximately 75â€“85% of all plasma zinc is bound to albumin, which acts as a transport protein for essential metal ions to allow their systemic distribution [

Therefore, zinc transport and distribution seem to be disturbed in lambs suffering from nematode infection and may influence Zn delivery to cells of target tissues for the synthesis of cytosolic zinc-containing Cu/Zn SOD. Supplementation of diets with Zn increased the activity of total SOD and Cu/Zn SOD only in the duodenal mucosa of lambs, even though duodenal Zn concentration was not affected by the treatment. On the other hand, Zn intake increased the duodenal Cu concentration; therefore, our results point out the relationship between Cu/Zn SOD activity and Cu level in the intestinal mucosa. Regarding the functioning of this antioxidant enzyme, it is important to consider that Cu and Zn work together, and actually, the ratio of both elements rather than the concentration of either of these trace elements helps the enzyme function properly [
