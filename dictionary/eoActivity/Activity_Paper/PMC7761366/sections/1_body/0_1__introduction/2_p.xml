<p>The presence of the parasite may induce the formation of a large number of reactive molecules derived from oxygen, such as superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and hydrogen peroxide [

The production of reactive species by phagocytes is a defensive mechanism of the host against the parasites but it promotes oxidative stress, which may also cause serious tissue damage to animals when an imbalance between free radicals’ formation and the capacity of the antioxidant defense system occurs [
