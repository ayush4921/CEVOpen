<p>Some researchers have reported that supplementation with organic Zn sources (amino acid complexes) may improve the growth rate of lambs and increase apparent absorption and retention of zinc, indicating higher bioavailability from organic sources also due to higher zinc concentration in serum and tissues as compared to inorganic source [

 <xref rid="B17-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Van Valin et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-antioxidants-09-01172" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] found similar zinc retention in lambs regardless of the supplemental Zn source or dietary Zn concentration and pointed out the importance of elucidating dietary factors affecting zinc bioavailability in ruminants. Several studies concerning the interactions between various bioactive plant compounds and mineral absorption in the intestine or their deposition have been reported, with different results depending on the polyphenols used and the microelement examined [
