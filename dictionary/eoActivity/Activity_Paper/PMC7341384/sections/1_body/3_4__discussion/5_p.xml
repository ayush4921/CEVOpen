<p>The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> exhibited no activity against production inhibition of nitric oxide (IC

 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) and low activity against superoxide anion with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 71.54 ± 3.22 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. However, it was able to increase proliferation to the maximum of 15.47 ± 0.87% and gave the highest wound closure activity with the acceleration rates of 2.65 ± 0.05% of recovery area per hour. Its marker, thymoquinone, showed high activities against nitric oxide and superoxide anion with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.55 ± 0.14 and 9.56 ± 1.11 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml which were not significantly difference from reference compounds (prednisolone and propyl gallate). It also promoted wound closure activity with the acceleration rates of 2.35 ± 0.05% of recovery area per hour without any proliferative promoting activity. The results showed that the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> gave good results with proliferation and wound closure activities while thymoquinone exhibited high activities as antioxidant and anti-inflammation through production inhibition of superoxide anion and nitric oxide activities. Therefore, the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> could be good choice for the wound at the second phase. Our result was in accordance with a previous study that reported nitric oxide inhibition by
