<p>Concerning 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> ethanolic extract, the results showed that IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of antioxidant and anti-inflammation activities were 13.97 ± 0.38 and 23.97 ± 0.91 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Its marker, 
 <italic>α</italic>-mangostin, also showed stronger activities with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.65 ± 0.52 and 15.15 ± 0.14 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Both extract and marker could promote cell proliferation to the maximal values of 52.68 ± 1.99 and 26.72 ± 2.21%, respectively. The acceleration of wound closure was also increased at the rates of 2.02 ± 0.03 and 2.18 ± 0.03% per hour, respectively. Our results were in accordance with previous studies which showed that the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> and its major compound, 
 <italic>α</italic>-mangostin, exerted strong anti-inflammatory activity through the production inhibition of nitric oxide and PGE
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and also showed free radicals (superoxide anion and DPPH) inhibitions [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study also showed wound healing activity of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
