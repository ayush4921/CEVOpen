<p>The ethanolic extract of

 <italic>glabra</italic> inhibited superoxide anion and nitric oxide production with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 28.62 ± 1.91 and 46.35 ± 0.43 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Its marker, glycyrrhizin, exhibited antioxidant activities with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 40.85 ± 2.30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml but has no activity against nitric oxide production inhibition. 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> extract also promoted proliferation to the maximal values of 52.13 ± 3.95 and accelerated wound closure at the rate of 2.12 ± 0.03% per hour. Glycyrrhizin, on the contrary, had no activity on promoting fibroblast proliferation but could increase the acceleration of wound closure at the rate of 2.18 ± 0.02% recovery area per hour. These results indicated that the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> was active for all activities but not entirely due to glycyrrhizin. Our results were in agreement with a recent study on 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> extract against superoxide anion and nitric oxide at IC
