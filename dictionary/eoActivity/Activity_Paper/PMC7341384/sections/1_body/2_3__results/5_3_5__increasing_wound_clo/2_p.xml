 <italic>sativa</italic> promoted significantly greater acceleration of wound recovery than the positive control with the value of 58.80 ± 1.11% and the acceleration rate of 2.42 ± 0.03% of recovery area per hour. However, all aqueous extracts and other plant extracts did not promote wound closure activity. The negative results were not presented (
