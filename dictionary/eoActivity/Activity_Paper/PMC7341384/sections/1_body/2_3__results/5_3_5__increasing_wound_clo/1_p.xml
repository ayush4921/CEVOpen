<p>The wound closure of 3T3-CCL92 cell line can promote wound healing process, the results showed that three extracts could increase the recovery rate (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic>, 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic>, and 
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>sativa</italic> displayed maximum cell recovery area with the values of 48.42 ± 1.26, 50.72 ± 0.78, and 60.60 ± 2.31% at the acceleration rates of 2.02 ± 0.03, 2.12 ± 0.03, and 2.65 ± 0.05% per hour, respectively. Their major compounds, namely, 
 <italic>α</italic>-mangostin, glycyrrhizin, and thymoquinone, showed the promotion of the recovery area with the values of 51.63 ± 1.02, 51.87 ± 1.28, and 57.88 ± 0.34% at the acceleration rates of 2.18 ± 0.03, 2.18 ± 0.02, and 2.35 ± 0.05% per hour, respectively.
