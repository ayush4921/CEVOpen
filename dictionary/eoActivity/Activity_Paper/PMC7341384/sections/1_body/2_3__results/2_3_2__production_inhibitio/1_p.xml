<p> Anti-inflammatory activity was investigated through the production inhibition of NO in RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line, using prednisolone as reference. Among 16 extracts tested, the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>mangostana</italic> exhibited the highest anti-inflammatory activity with the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 23.97 ± 0.91 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The second and third active extracts were the ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>glabra</italic> and 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>elengi</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 46.35 ± 0.43 and 78.48 ± 4.46 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Other ethanolic extracts and all of the aqueous extracts did not show activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values more than 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml). Later, thymoquinone and 
 <italic>α</italic>-mangostin, the major compound of each plant which passed the criteria of selection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), showed high activity against nitric oxide at the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.55 ± 0.14 and 15.15 ± 0.14 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively, while glycyrrhizin had no activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub> values more than 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) (
