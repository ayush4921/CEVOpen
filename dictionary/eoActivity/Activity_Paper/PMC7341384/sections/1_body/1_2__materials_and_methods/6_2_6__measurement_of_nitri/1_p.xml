<p>Murine macrophage leukemia cell line (RAW 264.7), purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA), was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min and then diluted with fresh medium into a suspension at the concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Subsequently, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of cell suspension was seeded into each of 96-well plates and incubated for 24 hrs to form a monolayer. After incubation, the supernatant was replaced with a fresh complete medium containing 10 ng/ml of LPS together with various concentrations of plant extracts and incubated for 24 hrs subsequently, a 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of supernatant liquid was transferred from the original plate (plate 1) to another plate (plate 2). The nitric oxide reduction from RAW 264.7 cell line was determined by measuring the accumulation of nitrite in the supernatant after the addition of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of Griess reagent (0.1% naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, 1% sulfanilamide, and 5% phosphoric acid in distilled water) and the content of developed azo dye was determined at 570 nm. Prednisolone was used as a positive control.
