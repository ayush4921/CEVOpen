<p>This study chose 4 bioactivities that would represent the wound healing potential of 16 plant extracts. These were production inhibition of nitric oxide, superoxide anion radical reduction, cell proliferation, and wound closure assays. The plant extracts that gave positive results with cell proliferation and wound closure assays were reviewed for their major active markers. These compounds were also tested for the above activities.</p>
