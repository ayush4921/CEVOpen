<p>The viability of the cells was determined by the MTT assay in parallel with the above NBT assay. The same procedure was executed without the addition of NBT; after 1 hr incubation, it was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min and replaced the supernatant with HBSS containing MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) and was further incubated for 2 hrs. The tubes were subjected to centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 10 min; the supernatant was discarded before dissolving formazans with DMSO and the absorbance was determined at 570 nm [

 <sub>50</sub> was calculated.
