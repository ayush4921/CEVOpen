<p>Human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60), purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA), was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. HL-60 cells were adjusted at the concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml and induced by 1.3% DMSO in RPMI 1640 for 6 days. In this way, HL-60 cells, differentiated into neutrophils, had smaller cell size with increased expression of the NADPH oxidase on the plasma membrane [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. After differentiation, HL-60 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min, and then the supernatant was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) to form a suspension at the concentration of 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Subsequently, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of cell suspension was added to the tube with 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of medicinal plant extract in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Then 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) solution (2 mg/ml in DMSO) and 250 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) solution (1.25 mg/ml in HBSS) were added and incubated for 1 hr. The produced superoxide anion (O

 <sup>−</sup>) was reduced with NBT solution giving the blue formazans, and then 2 ml of 1 M HCl at 4°C was added to the tube and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the formazans were dissolved with DMSO and the absorbance was measured at 572 nm. Propyl gallate was used as a positive control.
