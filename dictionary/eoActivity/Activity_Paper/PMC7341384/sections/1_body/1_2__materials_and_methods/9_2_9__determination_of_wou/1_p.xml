<p>After the viability assay results were evaluated, the medicinal plant extracts that exhibited equal or higher viability than the control were selected for the study of wound closure and spreading ability of murine embryonic fibroblast cells (3T3-CCL92). The scratch wound closure assay was done to investigate the wound contraction phase. The reduction in wound area was measured by ImageJ software and the percentage of recovery area and the acceleration rate relative to the control, for each dose and time, were calculated. The cells were harvested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min after which the supernatant was replaced with a fresh medium to form a suspension at the concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml. Subsequently, 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of cell suspension was seeded into each of the 24-well plates and incubated for 24 hrs. to allow the cells to adhere into a monolayer. A linear wound was generated on the monolayer with a sterile 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l plastic pipette tip with the wound width controlled at 550 ± 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>m. The cellular debris was removed by washing with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The medicinal plant extract in basic media (DMEM with 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) was added, and then the photographs of wound areas were taken at 0 and 24 hours [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. DMEM medium with 0.2% DMSO was used as a control group with asiaticoside as a positive control. An extract concentration that showed maximum wound closure was chosen for the measurement of the acceleration rate by photographing every 3 hrs up to 24 hrs. The percentage of recovery area was calculated from each photograph and compared with the control group to elucidate wound closure ability of the plant extracts.
