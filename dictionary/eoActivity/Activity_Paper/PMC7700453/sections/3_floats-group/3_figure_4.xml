   <italic>Euphorbia cuneata</italic> (EC) ameliorated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced histopathological damage of the lung. 
   <bold>I.</bold> Lung specimen of different group stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E). (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>C</bold>) 
   <bold>Control group</bold> where lung specimen displayed normal alveolar bronchioles lined by pseudo-stratified ciliated columnar epithelium (arrow), pulmonary blood vessels, interalveolar septae (between arrow heads), alveolar capillaries, and interstitial tissue. (
   <bold>D</bold>–
   <bold>F</bold>) 
   <bold>LPS</bold> group showing hypertrophied lining epithelium of the pulmonary bronchiole (arrow) with extravasation of red blood cells (RBCs) and inflammatory cell infiltration in the interalveolar tissue spaces, thickened intralveolar septae (arrow heads) with RBCs extravasation, and extensive neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the interstitial tissue (tailed arrows). (
   <bold>G</bold>–
   <bold>I</bold>) 
   <bold>EC 25 + LPS group,</bold> where the alveolar bronchioles had near normal epithelial lining with interalveolar mucous accumulation (arrow), and lamellae of collagen bundles (curved arrow) is seen close to the bronchiole, with less marked thickened intralveolar septae (arrow heads) with RBC extravasation and scarce neutrophil infiltration in the interstitial tissue (tailed arrow). (
   <bold>J</bold>–
   <bold>L</bold>) 
   <bold>EC 50 + LPS group,</bold> where the alveolar bronchioles had near normal epithelial lining without interalveolar mucous (arrow), and lamellae of collagen bundles (curved arrows) are still seen close to the bronchiole, with no RBCs extravasation nor inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitial tissue and near normal intralveolar septae (arrow heads) with scarce neutrophil infiltration in the interstitial tissue (tailed arrow). (
   <bold>M</bold>–
   <bold>O</bold>) 
   <bold>DEX + LPS group,</bold> with near normal intralveolar septae (arrow heads) without neutrophil infiltration nor collagen bundle deposition in the interstitial tissue. 
   <bold>II.</bold> Semi-quantitative analysis of LPS-induced lung lesions with regards to the severity and distribution of the lesions. Mice were administered two different doses of EC (25 and 50 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (5 mg/kg) once daily for 5 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of LPS (10 mg/kg). Samples were collected 24 h after LPS injection. Data are the mean ± SD. (
