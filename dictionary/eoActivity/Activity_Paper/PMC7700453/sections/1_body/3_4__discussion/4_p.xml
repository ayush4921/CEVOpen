<p>LPS binds and stimulates toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which causes activation of NF-κB and subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6) [

 <xref rid="B30-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Hence, blockade of NF-κB signaling pathways can inhibit the development of ALI induced by LPS. Our study revealed the activation of NF-κB and increased inflammatory cytokines in LPS-challenged mice, consistent with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Expectedly, pretreatment with EC hindered the activation of this inflammatory pathway, resulting in suppression of inflammatory mediator release. It is worth mentioning that jolkinolides, diterpenoids reported from 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> species, have shown a protective effect of LPS-induced ALI via attenuating histological alterations, inflammatory cell infiltration, and lung edema, as well as inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators, e.g., TNF-α [

 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It has also been reported that 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> factor L2 improved the survival rate of ALI mice and effectively reduced the pathological changes in the lung by suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators regulated by the NF-κB pathway [

Quercetin is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity through inhibition of TNF-α, IL-8, IL-4, cyclooxygenase (COX), and lipoxygenase (LOX) [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Naringenin has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in lung injury in vivo through downregulation of NF-κB, inducing NO synthase, TNF-α, and caspase-3 [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Kaempferol glycoside, which is biosynthesized from naringenin, is known for its antioxidant potential, in addition to its anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of NF-κB, TNF-α, COX, LOX, and expression of IL-1β and IL-8 [
 <xref rid="B36-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Thus, the protective activity of EC against LPS-induced ALI in mice may be attributed to its antioxidant activity due to the presences of the different phenolic constituents.
