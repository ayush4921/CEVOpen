<p>ALI is a serious respiratory condition that is characterized by neutrophilia and acute lung inflammation. LPS is an endotoxin derived from Gram-negative bacteria that has been extensively used to establish a model of ALI in rodents. It induces marked pulmonary inflammation after 2–4 h and maximizes at 24–48 h [

Results of the current study demonstrated the protective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of EC against LPS-induced ALI in mice, which could be related to its ability to modulate the ROS/NF-ĸB/inflammatory cytokine pathway. The anti-inflammatory efficacy of EC, specifically at the higher dose, was nearly equivalent to that of dexamethasone.
