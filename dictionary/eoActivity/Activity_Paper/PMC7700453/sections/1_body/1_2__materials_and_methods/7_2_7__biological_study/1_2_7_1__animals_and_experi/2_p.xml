<p>Twenty-four hours after LPS injection, mice were humanely killed under anesthesia using ketamine (50 mg/kg). Right lung was lavaged using 0.9% saline while the left lung was clamped. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained and centrifuged. Cell pellet was used for the estimation of the cell counts. The supernatants of BALF were stored at −80 °C until further analysis. A small piece of the left lung was weighed, homogenized in phosphate buffer, and centrifuged. The supernatants were stored at −80 °C for further analysis. Another part of the left lung was washed with ice-cold saline and then immersed for 24 h in buffered formalin 10%.</p>
