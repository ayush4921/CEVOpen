<p>Briefly, MDA was quantified by the reaction with thiobarbituric acid in acidic medium at a temperature of 95 Â°C for 30 min to form thiobarbituric acid-reactive product whose absorption was measured spectrophotometrically at 534 nm. Catalase was determined by its reaction with a known quantity of hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>). Catalase inhibitor stopped the reaction after 1 min, and then the remaining H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> reacted with 3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid (DHBS) and 4-aminophenazone (AAP) to form a chromophore that was measured at 510 nm. The color intensity was inversely proportional to the amount of catalase in the original sample. Assay of SOD depends on the ability of SOD to inhibit the phenazine methosulphate-mediated reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium dye. The increase in absorbance at 560 nm for 5 min was measured. GSH determination relies on the reaction of GSH with 5,5-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. The product was measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. The measurement of TAC was performed by the reaction of antioxidants in the sample with a defined amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The antioxidants in the supernatant interacted with a specific amount of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The residual H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> was determined colorimetrically by the conversion of 3,5,dichloro-2-hydroxy benzensulphonate to a colored product that was measured at 510 nm.
