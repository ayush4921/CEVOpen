<p>Lung tissue of the control group showed normal histology. There was no sign of lesions in the pulmonary tissue. LPS induced deleterious lung damage in the form of hypertrophied lining epithelium of the pulmonary bronchiole with extravasation of red blood cells (RBCs) and inflammatory cell infiltration in the interalveolar tissue spaces. The thickened inter-alveolar septae were observed with RBC extravasation and excess inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitial tissue. On the other hand, animals pretreated with EC or dexamethasone exhibited remarkable improvement of the pulmonary lesions compared to the LPS-treated group. Semi-quantitative analysis of LPS-induced lung lesions with regards to the severity and distribution of the lesions indicated significant amelioration of LPS-induced lesions (
