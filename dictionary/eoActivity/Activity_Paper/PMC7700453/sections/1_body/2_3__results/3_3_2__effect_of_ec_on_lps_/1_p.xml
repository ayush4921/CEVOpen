<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01620-f003">Figure 3</xref>, LPS significantly increased the total and differential cell counts, mainly neutrophils, in the BALF compared to the control group. EC or dexamethasone pretreatment significantly suppressed LPS-induced rise in the total and differential cell counts. The effect of EC at a high dose was not significant compared to that of dexamethasone.
