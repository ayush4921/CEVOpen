<p>LPS injection induced increase in the lipid peroxidative markers, MDA and 4-HNE, in lung in comparison with normal animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01620-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). Simultaneously, LPS hindered the antioxidant capacity of the lung due to significant decrease in the endogenous antioxidants such as catalase, SOD, and GSH levels as well as TAC in comparison with the control group (

On the other hand, EC or dexamethasone pretreatment significantly augmented the antioxidant activities and diminished the lipid peroxidative parameters in the lung. EC significantly enhanced catalase, SOD, and GSH and significantly decreased MDA and 4-HNE compared to the LPS-treated group. EC at a higher dose exerted a remarkable antioxidant activity compared to dexamethasone.
