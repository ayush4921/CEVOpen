<p>LPS challenge significantly increased the immuno-expression and the level of NF-κB in the lung in comparison with the control group (

However, EC or dexamethasone reduced immuno-expression and the level of NF-κB simultaneously, with significant reduction in the levels of inflammatory parameters TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in comparison with the LPS group. Notably, the effect of high dose of EC was not significant from the effect of dexamethasone.
