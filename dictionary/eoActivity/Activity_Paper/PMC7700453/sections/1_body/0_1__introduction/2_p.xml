<p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is bio-active component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and has been used to establish a mouse model of ALI [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. LPS activates reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the release of proteases. Furthermore, LPS induces the activation of NF-ÎºB signaling pathway and cytokine release [

 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-01620" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Inflammatory mediators activate overproduction of ROS, leading to more oxidative damage. Therefore, suppression of oxidative stress and/or inflammation is a potential strategy to improve ALI.
