<p>Another research study aims was the investigation of global pharmaco-toxicological profile as well as the biological activity of both hydro-alcoholic extracts. To this end, the hydro-alcoholic extracts were investigated by liquid chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and total phenolic content (TP), total flavonoid and flavonols content (TF and TFv) and condensed tannins (TT) respectively were evaluated spectrophotometrically. The radical scavenging effect as well as the cytotoxic potential on four human and murine normal cell lines was also assessed. The results obtained were compared with the antitumor in vitro activity against the A375 cell line. In addition, the antiangiogenic potential in ovo, induced by the hydro-alcoholic basil extracts, was also investigated.</p>
