<p>The plant extracts proved to be very useful also in skin protection against solar radiation (UVA and UVB) preventing the structural degradation of elastic and collagen fibers in the skin. The UVA exposure of skin, for a long time, leads to the appearance of sags and wrinkles, so called skin aging process, termed photo aging [

 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] insinuated that the possible anti-aging effect which 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> extract possess, is due to the antioxidant compounds like kaempferol, quercetin, isoquercetin, caffeic acid, rutin, catechin, rutinoside, apigenin, rosmarinic acid and ferulic acid. As a confirmation, Yoshikawa and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have evaluated the potential of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> extract and his major componentâ€”rosmarinic acid, as anti-photoaging materials. The authors found that both compounds lead to an improvement and even prevent photoaged skin by restoring collagen fibers which are formed by chronic exposure to UVA irradiated fibroblasts. Moreover, Rasul and Akhtar [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] have prepared water in oil emulsion containing ethanol extract of basil seeds, and evaluated its effects on different parameters related to skin aging. The results obtained demonstrate that when human facial skin was treated with the as prepared emulsion based on basil ethanolic extract, the biochemical and mechanical parameters were improved.
