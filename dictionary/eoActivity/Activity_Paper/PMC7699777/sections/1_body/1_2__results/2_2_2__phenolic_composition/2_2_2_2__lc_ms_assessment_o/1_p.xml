<p>The hydro-alcoholic extracts were subjected to LC-MS analysis by injecting a volume of 20 μL of sample and monitoring between 280 and 320 nm, the detector being set at an acquisition range from 200 to 700 nm. Identification of the chemical compounds from polyphenols class was conducted by comparing the retention times with those of the analytical standards. LC-MS analysis revealed a number of nine phenolic compounds in both hydro-alcoholic extracts of

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05442-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, expressed in μg/g. Obtained results indicated that kaempferol was the most abundant polyphenolic quantified compound in the hydro-alcoholic extract obtained from both aerial part and leaves basil as well. Quercetin, epicathechin, rutin and resveratrol were also detected but in smaller concentrations, accompanied by traces of protocatechuic, caffeic, coumaric and gallic acid.
