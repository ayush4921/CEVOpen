 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f001">Figure 1</xref> revealed the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) scavenging effect of both hydro-alcoholic basil extracts obtained from aerial part and leaves, which denoted to possess a significant activity compared to the one of ascorbic acid (AA), used as positive control. For the assessments were analyzed different concentrations of the hydro-alcoholic extracts, as follows: OBAE—100 μg/mL; 50 μg/mL and 25 μg/mL and OBHE 100 μg/mL; 50 μg/mL and 25 μg/mL respectively. From the panel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), it can be observed that both hydro-alcoholic extracts show high antioxidant activity. The kinetic of the reaction in the case of OBAE hydro-alcoholic extract does not reach the equilibrium even after 1200 s (20 min), instead the OBHE hydro-alcoholic extract reacts slowly with DPPH radical, scavenging the substrate in 800 s, and reaches the equilibrium after that.
