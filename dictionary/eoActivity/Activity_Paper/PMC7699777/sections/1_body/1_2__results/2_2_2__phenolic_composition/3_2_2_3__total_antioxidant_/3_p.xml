<p>In the case of OBHE hydro-alcoholic extract of 50 μg/mL concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f001">Figure 1</xref>C), these extracts consumed the DPPH radical very quickly, in the first 10 s, and then the equilibrium of the reaction was set. The hydro-alcoholic extract obtained from basil leaves of 25 μg/mL reacts with the DPPH radical throughout the recording time of the analysis (20 min) and the equilibrium of the reaction was not set.
