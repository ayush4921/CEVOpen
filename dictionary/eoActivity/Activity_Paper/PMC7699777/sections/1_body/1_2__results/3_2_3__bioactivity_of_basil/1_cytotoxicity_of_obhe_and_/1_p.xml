<p>The cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. hydro-alcoholic extracts, OBHE and OBAE, was evaluated on a skin cell panel containing three human healthy cell lines: immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT), skin human fibroblasts (1BR3), and primary melanocytes (HEMa) and one murine healthy cell line: newborn mice epidermis (JB6 Cl 41-5a), as well as on one tumorigenic cell line—A375 skin primary achromic human melanoma cells. The method employed in this study was the consecrated MTT colorimetric test. The assessment was performed with different concentrations, 25, 50, 75, and 150 µg/mL, of OBHE and OBAE after a stimulation time of 24 h.
