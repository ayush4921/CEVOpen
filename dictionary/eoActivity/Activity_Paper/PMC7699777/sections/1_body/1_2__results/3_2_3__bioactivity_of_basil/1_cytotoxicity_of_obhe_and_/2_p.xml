<p>The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f002">Figure 2</xref>) indicated that test extracts, OBHE and OBAE, did not induce the important cell viability reduction of any healthy cell line in the skin cell panel. The lowest cell viability rates were recorded after exposure of HaCaT cells at 150 µg/mL of OBHE (~89% viable cells) and JB6 Cl 41-5a cells at the highest concentrations tested 75 and 150 µg/mL of OBHE (~88% and ~84%, respectively), followed by treatment of 1BR3 cell with OBHE at concentration of 150 µg/mL (~86%). A slight proliferative effect could be noticed after stimulation of HaCaT cells with OBHE at concentrations of 25 and 50 µg/mL (~115% and ~112%, respectively). While HEMa cells presented cell viability percentages above 89%, after stimulation with both test extracts, corresponding to a non-cytotoxic effect.
