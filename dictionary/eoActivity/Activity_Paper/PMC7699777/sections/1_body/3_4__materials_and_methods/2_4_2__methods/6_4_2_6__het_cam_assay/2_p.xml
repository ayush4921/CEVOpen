<p>Test samples (OBAE and OBHE dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 0.5% in distillate water), next to positive control (sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) 0.5% in distillate water), negative control (distillate water) and solvent control (DMSO 0.5%) were inoculated onto the developing CAM in volumes of 300 µL. The application was performed on the 9 embryonic day of development, under stereomicroscopic (Discovery 8 Stereomicroscope, Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) observation, capturing significant images initially, before application (t
 <sub>0</sub>) and 5 min after application (300 s, t
 <sub>5</sub>) of the CAM surface using the attached camera (Axio CAM 105 color, Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) All captures were then processed using Zeiss ZEN software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Göttingen, Germany;
