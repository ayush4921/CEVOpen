<p>Both hydro-alcoholic basil extracts, prepared for LC-MS analysis, were homogenized with a WisdVM-10 vortex mixer (Witeg Labortechnik, Wertheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) and centrifuged for 2 min at 10.000 rpm in a ThermoMicro CL17 micro-centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). The supernatant was collected and submitted to LC-MS analysis on a Shimadzu (2010 EV, Kyoto, Japan) chromatograph, which comprises an LC unit with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer detector (SPD-10A, Shimadzu Europe, Duisburg,), connected in-line with a MS-2010 mass spectrometer. Specific quantitative analysis of individual phenolic phytocompounds was performed on an EC 150/2 NUCLEODUR C18 Gravity SB 150 mm × 2.0 mm column, particle size 5 μm (Macherey-Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Düren, Germany) operating at room temperature. The compounds were separated with gradient elution of two mobile phases A (aqueous formic acid) and B (acetonitrile and formic acid). The gradient program was: 5% B (0–20 min); 40% B (20–50 min) and 95% B (50–60 min).</p>
