<p>The cells were cultured in specific growth media, as follows: HaCaT and A375 cells in DMEM, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1BR3 cells in EMEM supplemented with 15% FBS, JB6 Cl 41-5a in EMEM supplemented with 0.1% non-essential amino acids and 5% FCS and HEMa cells in dermal cell basal medium supplemented with adult melanocyte growth kit. An antibiotic mixture of 100 UI/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin was added to all cell cultures. All in vitro experiments were performed in sterile atmosphere using a biosafety cabinet class II (MSC Advantage 12 model (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The cells were kept in standard conditions—humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> at 37 °C by using a Forma™ Steri-Cycle™ i160 CO
 <sub>2</sub> Incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Cell counting was performed by the means of the Countess II FL Automated Cell Counter device (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) in the presence of Trypan blue.
