<p>The antioxidant activity (AOA) of both hydro-alcoholic basil extracts was determined by DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free-radical scavenging assay, according to the method of Miliauska et al. [
 <xref rid="B71-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], modified by our research group. Thereby, it was prepared a fresh solution of DPPH in ethanol (1 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> M) and an amount equal with 1 mL of this solution was added to 3 mL of hydro-alcoholic basil extracts, at different concentrations (100 μg/mL; 50 μg/mL and 25 μg/mL). For 20 min, the absorbance of each concentration of basil extracts was measured in a continuously mode at 517 nm, using a UviLine 9400 Spectrophotometer from SI Analytics. The decrease of absorbance in the reaction mixture (
