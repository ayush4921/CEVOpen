<p>In good agreement with our results, other studies also reported the anti-inflammatory activity of

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This effect could be explained by the suppressive activity exerted by 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> species on arachidonate metabolism, correlated with the inhibition of two enzymes involved in the process of inflammation, namely: lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase [

Regarding the anti-inflammatory effect manifested by basil alcoholic extract, Selvakkumar et al. demonstrated the inhibitory activity of crude basil alcoholic extract on human peripheral blood mononuclear—PBMC cells, along with a decrease of specific pro-inflammatory markers, such as: tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-2 [

 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>, showing that the product with 5% 
 <italic>Ocimum</italic> essential oils induced irritation of human skin. However, the 3% product did not cause an inflammatory reaction and was considered safe for human use [
