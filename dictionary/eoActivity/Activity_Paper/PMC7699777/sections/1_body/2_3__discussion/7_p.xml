<p>In this study, for the antioxidant activity assessment of the two types of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. hydro-alcoholic extracts, the DPPH method was employed. Our results revealed the fact that in the case of hydro-alcoholic extract obtained from 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. leaves, the inhibition percent obtained for scavenging the DPPH radical was almost comparable with the standard reference, meaning vitamin C (

Vitamin C was chosen as standard reference, due to the fact that ascorbic acid is a very potent reducing agent and a well-known scavenger of free reactive radicals. In a mixture, vitamin C reacts with free reactive radicals (or donate electron), thus totally reducing their reactivity. Both hydro-alcoholic extracts have shown high antioxidant activity (68% in the case of OBAE extract at 100 Âµg/mL and 89% in the case of OBHE extract at the same concentration). Following the evaluation of several concentrations of both hydro-alcoholic extracts, the results showed that both hydro-alcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. demonstrated a significant antioxidant activity in a concentration-dose dependent manner (
