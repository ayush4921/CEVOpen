<p>Generally, the biological activity of a plant extract is directly proportional to the concentration of phytocompounds. A complex chemical composition ensures successful use of different type of plant extracts, essential oils, in the prevention or even cure of an increased number of infections, inflammatory and various conditions associated with oxidative stress, being very well correlated in the literature the reduction of ROS production with the biological profile of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L. In a recent study, Yoshikawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] demonstrated that UVA irradiated human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs cells) developed a low intracellular production of ROS and carbonylated proteins following treatment with a 50% hydro-ethanolic 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> extract, while Nazir et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] reported a high inhibition of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) level of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> by employing a plant in vitro biological system; the antioxidant potential being attributed mainly to two metabolites, rosmarinic acid and chicoric acid.
