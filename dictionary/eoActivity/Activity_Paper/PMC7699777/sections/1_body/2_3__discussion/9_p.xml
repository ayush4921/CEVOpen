<p>In brief, natural antioxidants act as defensive agents and protect human cells and the entire organism from pathogenic attack caused by ROS. The ROS causes oxidative damage on lipids, proteins, nucleic acids and other molecules, which can lead to various chronic health problems, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, cardiovascular diseases, aging, cancer and inflammatory diseases [

 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] evaluated the production of ROS and nitrogen species (RNS), as well as the formation of lipid peroxidation, using two 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> callus extracts and DHR-123 as an indicator of ROS/RNS production. The results confirmed that both callus extracts based on basil have protective effect against oxidative stress, results confirmed also by the measurements of lipid membrane peroxidation. In another study [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], the same group of authors demonstrates that melatonin and UV-C are effective elicitors due to the perfect correlation between the induced production of phenolic compounds, and in vivo cellular antioxidant effect of 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> callus extracts. Thus, the phenolic compounds of basil with distinguished biological activities (antioxidant, larvicidal, antimicrobial, antileishmanial, antifungal and anticancer), exert beneficial effects on cells by protecting against oxidative damage, acting as protective shields against carcinogenesis.
