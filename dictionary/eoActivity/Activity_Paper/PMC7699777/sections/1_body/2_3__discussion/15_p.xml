<p>Tewameter, mexameter and corneometer are professional equipment, often used to assess changes of the skin biophysical aspects induced by topical phytochemical treatments that provide reliable data on transepidermal water loss, erythema index and skin hydration level [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05442-f005">Figure 5</xref>), show no important increase of the TEWL parameter after treating the skin with both types of extracts. Nevertheless, since the decrease of the TEWL parameter is correlated with the improvement of the skin hydration level [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05442" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], it can be concluded that among test extracts, OBHE provides a better skin moisturizing effect compared to OBAE. The slight increased values of stratum corneum moisture recorded after 48 and 72 h represent a confirmation of the beneficial potential of these hydro-alcoholic extracts, as moisturized skin prevents premature aging [
