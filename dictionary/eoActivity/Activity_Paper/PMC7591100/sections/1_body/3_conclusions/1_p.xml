<p>This study provided the preliminary evidence that the 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane extracts of 
 <italic>Grewia mollis</italic> leaf extracts contained bioactive molecules with potent action on COX-2 and 15-LOX. Plant-sourced remedies are not ingenious and have continued to remain relevant in drug development programs. Recent technological advances such as targeted high-resolution HPLC have streamlined and enhanced the bioactive compound isolation and purification processes. Newer methods could assist in the separation of undesirable compounds that could cause metabolic cytotoxicity in the extract mixtures. This information could be exploited to develop an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat diseases where the use of NSAID is problematic.
