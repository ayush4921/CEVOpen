<p>The cell growth inhibition for each extract was expressed in terms of lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) values, which was defined as the concentration that caused 50% of inhibition of cell viability. Also, the selectivity index (SI) values were calculated by dividing cytotoxicity LD
 <sub>50</sub> values by the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of relevant bioactivity (SI=LD
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>). The higher the value of SI, the greater the probability that the observed bioactivity (anti-inflammatory) was not as a result of metabolic toxicity of the test extracts.
