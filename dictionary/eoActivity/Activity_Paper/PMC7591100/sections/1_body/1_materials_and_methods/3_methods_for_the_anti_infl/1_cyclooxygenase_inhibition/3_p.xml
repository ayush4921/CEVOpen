<p>The average absorbance readings from the NSB and the B
 <sub>0</sub> wells were determined. The NSB values were subtracted from the B
 <sub>0</sub> to obtain the corrected B
 <sub>0.</sub> The ratio of the absorbance of each sample or standard wells compared to that of the maximum binding (%B/B
 <sub>0</sub>) well was calculated by using the equation;
