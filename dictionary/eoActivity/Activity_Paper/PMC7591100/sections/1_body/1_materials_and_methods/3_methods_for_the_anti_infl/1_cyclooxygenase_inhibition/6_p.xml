<p>A standard curve using the logit (B/B
 <sub>0</sub>) versus the log of the concentrations of the known standards and then linearized with a regression fit. The %B/B
 <sub>0</sub> for the tested extracts or fraction was read off the standard curve and multiplied by the appropriate dilution factor to calculate the concentrations of the sample.
