<p>A variation of a previous method
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> was used to segregate the constituents of the leaf extracts based on polarity. One kilogram (1 kg) of grounded leaf was macerated three times in 70% acetone in water (l L), filtered and dried in vacuum to obtain the acetone extract (AcetE, 75 g). Seventy grams (70 g) of the dried AcetE was added in a mixture of chloroform and water (1:1, v/v) to yield the water and chloroform fractions. Then, n-butanol was added to the water fraction to yield dried 25.1 g of n-butanol (nButF) and 5 g of water (Wat1) fractions, respectively. The chloroform fraction was dried and dissolved in 10% water in methanol. This mixture yielded 23.9 g of dried n-hexane fraction (HexF). The proportion of water in methanol was increased to 35% water in methanol component that finally yielded 7.05 g of dried chloroform (ChlF) and 2.8 g of 35% water (Wat2) fractions. Based on the preliminary results of comparative Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) experiments, the water (Wat1) and 35% water in methanol (Wat2) fractions were combined and dried to yield 7.8 g of combined water fraction (WatF). The stock solution of the extracts and fractions were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and the final concentration used for the assay was 10 mg/mL.
