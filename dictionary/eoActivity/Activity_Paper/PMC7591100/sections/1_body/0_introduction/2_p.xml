<p>Among the many mediators of chronic inflammation, the prostaglandins (PGs) are of great importance.

 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> They are released as a response to most types of pathological, chemical or mechanical stimuli. Prostaglandins act to protect the stomach mucosa and prevent platelets aggregation

 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, the use of COX-2 inhibitors (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and specific COX-2 inhibitors) may result in unintended adverse consequences such as renal and cardiac problems.
 <xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, innovative and sustained efforts are needed to identify alternative approaches with better efficacy, lower toxicity and reduced adverse effects.
 <xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Naturally occurring secondary metabolites are a huge source of biologically active molecules that remained largely untapped for therapeutic advantage.
