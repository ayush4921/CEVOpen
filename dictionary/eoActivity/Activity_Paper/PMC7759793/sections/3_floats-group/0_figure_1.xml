  <p>The relationship between twelve leafy vegetable species and the elements of CFSI in two Karen and two Lawa villages in northern Thailand. (AI = availability index; FUI = frequency of utilization index; PUI = plant parts used index; MFFI = multi-functional food use index; TSAI = taste score appreciation index; and FMRI = food-medicinal role index). The thicker the band, the more informants mentioned the relationship.</p>
