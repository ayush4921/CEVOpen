<p>Analyses of moisture content, ash, macrominerals, and trace minerals were carried out using standard methods of analysis of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC) [
 <xref rid="B56-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and reference methods for plant analysis [
 <xref rid="B57-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moisture content was measured following method 930.15 [
 <xref rid="B56-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The plant samples were dried in a hot air oven at 135 °C for 2 h. The weights of the dried samples were measured and expressed as percentages of the moisture content. Ash content was determined following method 942.05 [
 <xref rid="B56-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The samples were put into a crucible and placed in a temperature control furnace at 600 °C for two hours. The ash content was obtained by measuring the weight. Total protein was determined via nitrogen content by the combustion technique (LECO model FP-828) with a conversion factor of 6.25, following method 968.06 [
