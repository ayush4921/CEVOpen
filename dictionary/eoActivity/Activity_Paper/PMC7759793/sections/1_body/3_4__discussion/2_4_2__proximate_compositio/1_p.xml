<p>The moisture content of the 12 species studied fluctuated from 60 to 90%, which is usual in leafy vegetables [
 <xref rid="B65-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,

 <xref rid="B68-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The high moisture content reveals that leafy vegetables need appropriate preservation because they are likely to degrade by microbial activity [
 <xref rid="B69-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The range of the ash contents was similar to that of wild vegetables in the western Himalayas [
 <xref rid="B70-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and India [
 <xref rid="B71-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Besides, ash content indicates an excellent source of the mineral element in vegetables [
 <xref rid="B13-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], because ash contains inorganic materials, including anions, cations, oxides, and salts [
 <xref rid="B72-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The range of fiber contents was similar to wild food plants in India [
 <xref rid="B71-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] but lower than wild food plants in Bangladesh [
 <xref rid="B11-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The fiber contents of 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, 
 <italic>Clerodendrum glandulosum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Oenanthe javanica</italic> (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01748-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were similar to fiber contents of domesticated leafy vegetables, i.e., Chinese cabbage (2.2 g/100 g FW), celery (1.6 g/100 g FW), and coriander (2.8 g/100 g FW) [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. High fiber content has significant benefits for the digestive system, including regulation of intestinal function, glucose tolerance, and prevention of chronic diseases, such as colon cancer [
 <xref rid="B74-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. However, an excess of fiber causes a negative effect on mineral absorption of, for instance, iron [
 <xref rid="B76-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The protein contents were comparable to other indigenous vegetables in India [
 <xref rid="B68-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and Thailand [

 <xref rid="B67-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The protein contents of 
 <italic>C. gladulosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Senegalia rugata</italic> (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01748-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) were higher than that of kale (
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic>), whose protein content was 4.28 g/100 g for the edible portion [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. However, the protein contents were low when compared with the Dietary Reference Intake for Thai adults (0.9‒8.6% recommended per day) [
 <xref rid="B60-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. The content of fat in leafy vegetables were commonly reported to be from &lt;1‒3 g/100 g [
 <xref rid="B7-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,

 <xref rid="B14-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The fat contents in the wild food plants in this study were all lower than 1%, similar to the edible flowers of Zingiberaceae in Thailand [
 <xref rid="B67-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and domesticated leafy vegetables, i.e., asparagus (0.1 g/100 g FW), lettuce (0.2 g/100 g FW), and spinach (0.4 g/100 g FW) [
 <xref rid="B73-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Fats are involved in many vital processes in the body, such as the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins [
 <xref rid="B77-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], which may be correlated with deficiency of fat, vitamin A, and vitamin E among children of the ethnic minorities in northern Thailand [
 <xref rid="B42-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The average carbohydrate content was similar to values obtained for indigenous vegetables in southern Thailand [
 <xref rid="B12-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Some wild vegetables, i.e., 
 <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic>, 
 <italic>Clerodendum glandulosum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, have carbohydrate values that are higher than cultivated vegetables, such as cabbage (3.2 g/100 g FW) or carrot (4.9 g/100 g FW) [
 <xref rid="B78-foods-09-01748" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>], which contributed to the nutrition, food security, and health by substitute for resource-poor farmers in developing regions [
