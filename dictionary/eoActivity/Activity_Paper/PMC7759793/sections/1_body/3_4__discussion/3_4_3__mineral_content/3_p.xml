<p>Interestingly, the manganese content was relatively high, surpassing the daily requirement for adults [

Although manganese is essential to bone structure, metabolism, and function as a powerful antioxidant, a high level of manganese can cause harm to the nervous system, which, in turn, may cause insomnia, depression, or illusions and, eventually, progressive alterations in gait and balance and tremor and Parkinson-like symptoms [

 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, 
 <italic>Monochoria vaginalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lygodium flexuosum</italic>, while the manganese contents of domesticated leafy vegetables, i.e., asparagus, Chinese cabbage, celery, lettuce, spinach, and kale, show less than one milligram per 100 g fresh weight [
