<p>The proximate compositions of the twelve wild leafy vegetable species on a wet basis vary considerably (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01748-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Their moisture contents were in the range of 62.9â€“95.3 g/100 g fresh weight (FW). The lowest value was found in 
 <italic>Lygodium flexuosum</italic> and the highest was for 
 <italic>Musa acuminata,</italic> from which we sampled the fleshy inner pseudostem. The ash contents ranged from 0.79 to 4.28 g/100 g FW. The lowest ash content was obtained from 
 <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>Senegalia rugata</italic> and the highest was in 
 <italic>Spondias pinnata</italic>. The protein contents ranged from 0.48 to 5.33 g/100 g FW. The highest protein content was observed in 
 <italic>Clerodendum glandulosum</italic>, whereas the lowest protein content was observed in 
 <italic>Musa acuminata</italic>. The fat contents ranged from 0.10 to 0.78 g/100 g FW, with the lowest in 
 <italic>M. acuminata</italic> and the highest in 
 <italic>L. flexuosum.</italic> The highest fiber content was found in the leaves of 
 <italic>Lygodium flexuosum</italic> (11.82 g/100 g FW), while the lowest fiber content was observed in 
 <italic>Monochoria vaginalis</italic> (0.79 g/100 g FW). The carbohydrate contents ranged from 1.54 to 17.94 g/100 g FW. The lowest carbohydrate content was found in 
 <italic>M. acuminata</italic> and the highest was in 
 <italic>L. flexuosum</italic>.
