<p>The contents of macrominerals (P, K, Mg, Ca, and Na) and trace minerals (Fe, Cu, Zn, and Mn) in the selected wild leafy vegetable species vary widely among the species (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01748-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The potassium content was the highest in all the studied species and ranged from 221.7 to 1291.3 mg/100 g FW in 
 <italic>Senegalia rugata</italic> and 
 <italic>Oenanthe javanica,</italic> respectively. The calcium content was the second highest in leafy vegetables and ranged from 2.6 to 982.9 mg/100 g FW. The phosphorus content of the wild vegetables ranged from 9.3 to 77.7 mg/100 g FW. The highest phosphorus content was found in 
 <italic>Senegalia rugata</italic>, while the lowest was observed in 
 <italic>Musa acuminata</italic>. The magnesium content ranged from 6.0 to 104.4 mg/100 g FW. The highest magnesium content was obtained from 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, while the lowest magnesium content was found in 
 <italic>Spondias pinnata</italic>. The sodium content ranged from 0.4 to 21.2 mg/100 g FW, with the highest content obtained from 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> and the lowest content from 
 <italic>Musa acuminata</italic>. The iron contents ranged from 0.3 to 11.1 mg/100 g. The highest iron content was found in 
 <italic>Acmella paniculata</italic>, whereas the lowest content was observed in 
 <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic>. The manganese contents varied from 0.2 to 15.7 mg/100 g. Moreover, the copper content was the lowest in all the plant species. 
 <italic>Monochoria vaginalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Musa acuminata</italic> had copper contents below 0.01 mg/100 g fresh weight, while the highest copper content was found in 
 <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic> (0.41 mg/100 g FW).
