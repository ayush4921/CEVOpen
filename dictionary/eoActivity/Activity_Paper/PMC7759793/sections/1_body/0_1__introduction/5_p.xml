<p>In this study, based on the food knowledge of the Karen and the Lawa, we determined the cultural food significance of wild leafy vegetable species for nutritional analysis. Nutrient compositions, which included proximate analyses (moisture, ash, protein, fat, fiber, and carbohydrate), and minerals composition (P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, Mn, Zn, and Cu), were evaluated. Nutrient composition data from our study should help in expanding nutrient databases and are beneficial for future research on food and human health.</p>
