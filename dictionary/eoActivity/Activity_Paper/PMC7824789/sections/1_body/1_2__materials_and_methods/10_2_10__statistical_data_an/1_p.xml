<p>The experimental data were processed by MS Excel 2003 (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and Origin 8.0 (Northampton, MA, USA) software. All the assays were performed in triplicate (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) and the results were calculated as mean value ± standard deviation. The Shapiro-Wilk and the Leven tests were used to check the normality of the data distribution and the homogeneity of variance. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) was chosen for the correlation signal strength description. Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-Test and F-Test were used to compare means of results during all vegetation phases versus V1 intensive growth phase. Rutin standard solutions were used to build up the calibration graphs.
