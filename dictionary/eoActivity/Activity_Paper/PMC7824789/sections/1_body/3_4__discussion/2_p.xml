<p>UVB radiation used in this study was chosen as an example of a pro-oxidative environmental factor characterized by repetitive, strong and direct action. Additionally, this factor affecting every person regardless of age, work, place of residence, as well as it is also often used in phototherapy, in contrast to the UVA that requires the additional use of a psoralen sensitization. Also, it is not possible to select a universal radiation dose that would transpose the average exposure of human skin to the dose having the same effect in in vitro cultured skin cells. That was the reason for choosing only the UVB radiation in dose, causing significant changes in cell metabolism, especially in the field of redox homeostasis.</p>
