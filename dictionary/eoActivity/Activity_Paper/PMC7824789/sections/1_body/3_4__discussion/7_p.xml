<p>Physical properties and functionality of cell membranes are directly affected by formation of lipid peroxidation products. The lipid asymmetry is interrupted reducing the hydrophobicity of the inner layer of lipid membrane causing depolarization [

 <xref rid="B51-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Regardless of the above, lipid peroxidation products are chemically reactive molecules due to their carbon-carbon double bond structure and electrophilic characteristics, which reacts with the cellâ€™s nucleophilic components, including DNA, lipids, peptides, and proteins, leading to disturbances in cell metabolism. During these reactions, free reactive lipid peroxidation products decrease, and at the same time adducts with proteins increase that promote disruption of cell signaling and affect metabolic modifications resulting in cell dysfunction and apoptosis [
