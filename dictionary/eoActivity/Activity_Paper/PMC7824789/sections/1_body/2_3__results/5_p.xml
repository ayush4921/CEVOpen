<p>HPLC analysis revealed that the highest amounts of identified compounds and their anti-radical activity are determined in the methanolic extracts of collected raw material at the F2 phase. Presented HPLC chromatogram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00053-f004">Figure 4</xref>) shows that rutin (peak number 4) and rosmarinic acid (peak number 5) are the predominant compounds. Although the quantities of identified compounds are similar, post-column DPPH radical scavenging profile shows that radical scavenging activity of rosmarinic acid is three times higher than that of rutin. Post-column DPPH assay revealed that radical scavenging activity of 
 <italic>trans</italic>-synapic acid, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-p-coumaric acid and hesperetin is significantly lower.
