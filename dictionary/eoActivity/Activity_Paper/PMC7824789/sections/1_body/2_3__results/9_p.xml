 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00053-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Only at a concentration of 100 μg/mL extracts of phases F2 and F3 increased peroxidation in melanocytes and extracts of F1–F3 in melanoma cells. Whereas UVB radiation increased lipid peroxidation in both melanocytes and melanoma cells, additionally causing greater vulnerability of cells to extracts, which was especially manifested in the case of melanoma cells. While, in the case of UV irradiated melanocytes, statistically significant increase of MDA was observed only at the high concentration of some extracts (50 μg/mL of extracts F1-2 and 100 μg/mL of extracts V2 and F1–F3), for UV irradiated melanoma cells this increase was observed for extracts F1 and F3 already at a concentration of 25 μg/mL.
