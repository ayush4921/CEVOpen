<p>HPLC analysis revealed 5 phenolic compounds dominating in 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. extracts. Following phenolic acids were identified in the extracts: 
 <italic>trans</italic>-synapic acid, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-p-coumaric acid, rosmarinic acid as well as flavonoidsâ€”rutin and hesperetin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00053-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Rutin and rosmarinic acid are the most abundant nonvolatile compounds in 
 <italic>Satureja hortensis</italic> L. herbal raw material. The results of present research show that the amount of rosmarinic acid varies from 3.79 RE mg/g to 7.79 RE mg/g. The amounts of rutin is ranging from 3.83 RE mg/g to 8.16 RE mg/g in the air-dried raw material. In addition, a steady increase of rutin is observed from early V1 to late F2 vegetation phase. 
 <italic>Trans</italic>-synapic acid, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-p-coumaric acid, and hesperetin were determined at significantly lower quantities.
