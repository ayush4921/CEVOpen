<p>The results of the spectrophotometric analysis are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="antioxidants-10-00053-f002">Figure 2</xref>. Total phenolic content did not change significantly during F1â€“F3 vegetation phases. The ratio between total phenolic content and total flavonoid content remained constant, ca. 1:4. The highest amounts of phenolic compounds (46.01 RE mg/g) and flavonoids (12.81 RE mg/g) were observed in 
 <italic>S. hortensis</italic> L. raw material extracts at the V2 phase. The highest radical scavenging activity was determined in the samples of V2 phase (47.49 RE mg/g). The obtained results between total phenolic content and radical scavenging activity were statistically dependent on each other. The results from the present study indicate a strong correlation between the radical scavenging activity and the content of total phenolics (
