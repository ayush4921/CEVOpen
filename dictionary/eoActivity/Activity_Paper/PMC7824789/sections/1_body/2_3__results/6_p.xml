<p>The strong correlation (
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9759) between content of rosmarinic acid and total radical scavenging activity of the extract was determined earlier [
 <xref rid="B34-antioxidants-10-00053" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Rosmarinic acid is the strongest antioxidant in a mixture, and its contribution to the total radical scavenging activity is the highest. Correlation coefficients calculated for other compounds were lower, but they are also considered to be strong, as for example 
 <italic>trans</italic>-synapic acidâ€”
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.772, 
 <italic>trans</italic>-p-coumaric acid 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.832, hesperetin

 <sup>2</sup> = 0.787.
