<p id="p0085">The chemical composition of the LCP was analysed with UPLC-PDA-HRMS/MS both, in negative and positive modes to maximize the obtained information (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Based on the UV and MS data, the detected thirty two compounds were tentatively classified as phenolic compounds and terpenoids. Phenolic compounds had the best ionisation at the negative mode, and terpenoids – at the positive mode. Retention times, UV absorption maxima, the main m/z values of mass-spectra, parent ion MS/MS fragmentation, monoisotopic masses and compound characterizations presented in
