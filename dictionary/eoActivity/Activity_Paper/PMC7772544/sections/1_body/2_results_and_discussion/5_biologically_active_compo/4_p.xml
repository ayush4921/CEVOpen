<p id="p0200">The major compounds of the LCP are macrocarpals A and B, dehydroursolic acid lactone and its derivatives (acetyl-dehydroursolic acid lactone, two isomers of 
 <italic>p</italic>-coumaroyl-dehydroursolic acid lactone, and two isomers of feruloyl-dehydroursolic acid lactone or tereticornate A). Pharmacological activities of these compounds are well known. For example, dehydroursolic acid lactone and ursocholanic acid were selected among 2000 tested compounds as the most promising neuroprotective compounds for trials in Parkinson's disease (

In addition, tereticornate A also showed statistically significant anti-inflammatory activity, higher than that of prednisone, a routinely used drug (
