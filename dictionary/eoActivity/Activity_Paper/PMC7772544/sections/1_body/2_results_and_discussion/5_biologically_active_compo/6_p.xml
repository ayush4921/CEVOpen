<p id="p0210">The phloroglucinol derivatives identified in the LCP are lipophilic phenolic compounds. There is growing evidence that the consumption of the phenolic compounds with plant foods or dietary supplements can reduce the risk of health problems due to their antioxidant activity (

A comparative study of the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds isolated from Eucalyptus extract showed that this property is largely due to hydrolysable tannins. The antioxidant activities of isolated macrocarpals A, B, C, D, E and eucalypton were much lower than that of tannins (
