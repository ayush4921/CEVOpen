<p id="p0180">Triterpenoids (21, 22) and (23, 24) had monoisotopic masses respectively 600.3810 and 630.3916 Da, and molecular formulas - C39H52O5 and C40H54O6 (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The study of parent ions fragmentation showed that major m/z fragment 437.34 of MS/MS spectra belong to ion [M-p-coumaroyl+H]
 <sup>+</sup> compounds (21) and (22), and ion [M-feruloyl+H]
 <sup>+</sup> compounds (23) and (24) (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>,
