<p id="p0150">Total content of phenolic compounds in gallic acid equivalent was 59 ± 3 (Mean value ± STD) mg per 100 mg of the LCP. It was shown earlier that the total phenolic content in the Eucalyptus extract obtained by the same method roughly corresponds to the sum of content of individual phloroglucinol derivatives (
