<p id="p0050">Sample of the dry leaves (100 g) was ground with ball mill MM 301 (Retsch GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany), suspended in 700 ml of ethanol and allowed to stand for 3 h at room temperature with continuous stirring. The extract was separated by decantation and the pellet was re-extracted twice. The combined ethanol extract was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue (10–12 ml) was dissolved in 50 ml of water. Then, the water solution was extracted with 50 ml of dichloromethane in separatory funnel. The dichloromethane fraction was separated and the water phase was re-extracted twice with 25 and 12 ml. The combined dichloromethane solution was extracted three times with 2% solution of NaOH in water (38, 38 and 18 ml). The combined alkaline extract was acidified with 15% HCl to pH 1, and the forming precipitate was filtered off, washed with distilled water to neutral pH and dried at 80 °C. The dry product was dissolved in 150 ml of ethanol and purified on an aluminium oxide column (21 g). The column was washed with ethanol and the combined solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to a small volume (about 20 ml). Then a 9-fold volume of 0.1% HCl added and the forming LCP precipitate was filtered off, washed with distilled water until neutral pH and dried at 60 °C. Dry LCP preparation was a light-grey powder, insoluble in water, and soluble in organic solvents. Quality control of the LCP was carried out in accordance with requirements that were published (
