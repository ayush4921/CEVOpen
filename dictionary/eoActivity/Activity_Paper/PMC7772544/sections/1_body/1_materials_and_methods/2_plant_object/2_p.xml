The Eucalyptus trees were grown in a greenhouse of the Botanical Garden of the All-Russian Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants, Moscow (55°33′52″N, 37°35′30″E), to where they were introduced from the North Caucasus, Russia. Shoots (about 1 m long and a base diameter of up to 0.5 cm) with leaves were harvested in June 2016. For the rational use of plant raw material, a two-stage process of LCP isolation was applied. First, the leaves with shoots were used for isolation of the essential oils by hydrodistillation method. On the second step, the remaining raw material was dried, the leaves detached from shoots, ground and used for LCP isolation and purification in according to preparative methods described in
