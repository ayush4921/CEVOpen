<p id="p0025">Phloroglucinol derivatives, such as macrocarpals, euglobals, eucalyptone, sideroxylonals, etc., is a group of secondary metabolites typical to the genus Eucalyptus (Myrtaceae) (

For example, macrocarpal A, which is the main phloroglucinol derivative in some Eucalyptus species, consist of sesquiterpene alcohol globulol linked to an isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol (

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2019</xref>). The macrocarpals class includes many individual compounds and isomers, all of which are adducts of the same isopentyl diformyl phloroglucinol with different mono- and sesquiterpene moieties (
