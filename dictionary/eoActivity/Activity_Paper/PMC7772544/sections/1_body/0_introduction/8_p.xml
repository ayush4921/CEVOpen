<p id="p0040">Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector and electrospray ionization high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-HRMS/MS) is the most suited method for the analysis of complex mixtures of secondary compounds in the medicinal and food plants and their products (

Therefore, to the comprehensive study composition of secondary compounds in the LCP, which determine its pharmacological activities, we applied the UPLC-PDA system combined with high-resolution Thermo Scientific Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. This technique is generated very accurate and reliable MS and MS/MS information that extremely valuable for identification of the plant metabolites. As a result, we detected and identified in the LCP thirty-two secondary compounds that belong to biologically active phloroglucinol derivatives and triterpenoids.
