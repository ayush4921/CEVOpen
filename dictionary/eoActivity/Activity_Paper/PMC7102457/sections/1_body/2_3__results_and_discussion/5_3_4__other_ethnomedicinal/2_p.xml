<p>On the other hand, some of the anticancer plants cited exhibit marked toxicity. A striking example is 
 <italic>Catharanthus roseus</italic> (L.) G. Don. The alkaloids in it are neurotoxic, especially vincristine [
 <xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>]. Vincristine and vinblastine are highly toxic antimitotics, blocking mitosis in metaphase after binding to the microtubules [
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>]. Evidently, side effects such as myelosuppression, alopecia, abdominal cramps, constipation, nausea, paralytic ileus, ulcerations of the mouth, hepatocellular damage, kidney impairment, pulmonary fibrosis, urinary retention, amenorrhoea, azoospermia, orthostatic hypotension, and hypertension [
 <xref rid="B254" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B256" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>] have been reported for the commercial drugs vincristine and vinblastine derived from this plant. In essence, the administration of these drugs must be carefully controlled to reduce the side effects [
 <xref rid="B257" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>]. This observation explains, in part, why some anticancer preparations in Uganda are applied topically or ingested in small amounts. Fortuitously, topical application is a better approach for reducing the local action of cancer cells at externally affected parts.
