<p>Only articles in English and local languages were considered. After the multidisciplinary database and Google search engine result assessments, sixteen reports of interest specifically on the subject of anticancer plants in Uganda were retrieved (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The botanical names of the plants listed were vetted in botanical databases: The Plant List [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], International Plant Names Index (IPNI) [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], NCBI taxonomy browser [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and Tropicos [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Where a given species was considered as distinct species in different reports, the nomenclature as per the botanical databases above took precedence in the review. The botanical families used, the plant local names (Lango, Ateso, Luganda, Rukiga, Rutoro, Lusoga, Lugisu, Ngakarimojong, and Lugbara), the life forms, part(s) used, conservation status, preparation and administration mode, and the districts where the plants were reported are captured (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On anticancer potential, species studied as per global reports, the active phytochemicals reported and tested with positive results in the plant species identified by this review are reported (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A brief review of other ethnomedical uses of the reported species as per Ugandan and global studies is also presented (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
