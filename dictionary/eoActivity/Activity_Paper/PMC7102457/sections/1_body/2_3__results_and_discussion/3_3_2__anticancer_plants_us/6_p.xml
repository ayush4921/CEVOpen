<p>Phytochemicals from plants are reported to be effective against cancer cells because they have many molecular targets [
 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic>Î²</italic>-sitosterol present in 
 <italic>P. africana</italic> has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, and immunomodulating activities [
 <xref rid="B248" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that antioxidant activities and antitumor or anticancer properties of plant extracts are always reported concomitantly in several plants [
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>], and some studies demonstrated that there is a positive linear relationship between antioxidant activity and anticancer effect of plant extracts [
 <xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>]. Plant phytochemicals such as artemisinin from the 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> genus are reported to have an endoperoxide moiety which is strategic for their bioactivity. The cleavage of this is reported to produce reactive oxygen species, inducing oxidative stress. Furthermore, in the presence of ferrous iron or reduced heme, artemisinin can convert itself into cytotoxic carbon-centred radical, a highly potent alkylating agent, to induce direct oxidative damage to cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. Thus, they are reported to induce apoptosis and ferroptosis, reduce cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, and inhibit angiogenesis and tissue invasion of the tumor as well as cancer metastasis [
