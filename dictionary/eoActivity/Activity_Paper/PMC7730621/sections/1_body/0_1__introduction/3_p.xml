<p>Terpenoids or isoprenoids are a widespread class of plant-derived phytochemicals, secondary metabolites with a large variety of chemical structures, all derived from isoprene, and most of them with polycyclic structure [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. They are classified based on the number of isoprene units identified in their structures in hemiterpenes, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, triterpenes and tetraterpenes; triterpenes possess pentacyclic or tetracyclic structure [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Pentacyclic triterpenes are subdivided based on their core structure in lupane, oleanane and ursane derivatives, many of them with proved anti-cancer, chemopreventive, antiinflamatory, antioxidant, cardio and hepato-protective or anti-viral activities [

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while among tetracyclic triterpenes, dammarane-, lanostane- or cycloartane-type are the most studied for their cytotoxic and anti-cancer biological properties [

Recently, systematic studies were conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of triterpenes in the process of wound healing; results indicated that these classes of phytocompounds are able to speed up the healing process by accelerating epithelialization and collagen production and deposition, irrespective of the wound type; moreover, their incorporation in various medicinal formulations is a valuable option in the management of wounds due to their long-term delivery of active phytocompounds. Therefore, the literature reports triterpenic phytocompounds as being considered an emerging class of therapies in the treatment and management of wounds [
