<p>A step forward in the development of hydrogels was the preparation of nanohydrogels which combine the advantages of hydrogels and nanosystems and avoid the flaws of macroscopic hydrogels such as the fast drug elution from the swollen matrix; nanohydrogels are prepared through intramolecular cross-linking reactions [
 <xref rid="B162-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">162</xref>]. A nanohydrogel platform was built by using gelatin and glycosaminoglycans to incorporate asiatic acid and metallic nanoparticles, followed by its in vivo assessment in second degree burn wounds in Wistar rats [

Results showed a significant wound healing activity through re-epithelization, collagen fibers arrangement and angiogenesis with no apparent toxicity. Nanofibers are fibers displaying diameters within the nanosize range which were developed for multiple purposes including wound healing; in particular, nanofibers obtained by electrospinning show unique properties, such as an ultrathin diameter and high volume ratio while its 3D structure strongly resembles the extracellular matrix [

Their very large porosity and gas permeability recommend them as wound dressings; in addition, by functionalization, nanofibers can modulate cells attachment, proliferation and differentiation thus facilitating the skin healing process [

 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], was loaded on electro spun poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanofibers coated with chitosan through pressure-driven permeation technology; their in vivo assessment was conducted on animal models of experimental wounds and revealed the complete re-epithelization much earlier compared to controls. In addition, scar elevation index measurements and hystological analysis indicated that the application of ginsenoside-loaded nanofibers inhibited scar formation thus showing they also act in the late phases of wound healing [
 <xref rid="B165-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. Gelatin nanofibers prepared by electrospinning were loaded with 
 <italic>C. asiatica</italic> extract and then applied on wound models induced in Sprague-Dawley rats; the nanofibers led to the highest skin recovery rate while the presence of the vegetal extracts containing triterpenoids did not influence the hydrophilicity and biodegradability of the fibrous carrier [
