<p>Metallic nanoparticles, in particular gold, silver and zinc, are nowadays increasingly used in wound healing due to their uniques properties such as the intrinsic antibacterial properties, low skin penetration, easy application, less frequent dressing changes as well as a constantly moist wound environment; in addition, their efficacy and toxicity can be modulated by properly designing their size, architecture, surface functionalization, zeta potential and polydispersity index, by adequately selecting the fabrication method [

Silver nanoparticles and the triterpenoid asiaticoside were included in a polyurethane foam synthesized by the reaction between polyols and diisocyanate; hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, chitosan and sodium alginate, respectively, were added to the foam sheets composition [

All formulations exhibited antibacterial properties but the foam sheets with alginate revealed the highest release rate of both silver nanoparticles and asiaticoside; in vivo studies on pigs indicated that the alginate-foam dressing improved wound healing both in terms of wound closure as well as histological parameters of the dermal wound without causing any dermatologic reactions [

Plant extracts containing triterpenes can also be used as reducing and capping agents for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles with antibacterial properties; the advantages of the bioreduction methods consist in the use of ecofriendly and biocompatible materials which diminish the risks for biomedical applications [

 <italic>Ocimum sanctum</italic> (Tulsi) leaves containing ursolic acid among other constituents for the purpose of silver nanoparticles synthesis; the metallic nanoparticles coated with phytochemicals acted as effective Gram positive and Gram negative antibacterial and antifungal agents thus showing potential to reduce infections in burn wounds treatment [

 <italic>Chaenomeles sinensis</italic> fruit containing pentacyclic triterpene acids as reducing and stabilizing agents in the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles, respectively [
 <xref rid="B169-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]; the silver nanoparticles thus obtained acted as effective antibacterial agents against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria.
