<p>A more recent study set to evaluate all eight astragalosides isolated from 
 <italic>Astragali radix</italic> both in vitro, on human HaCaT keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts, and in vivo on murine models of wound healing [
 <xref rid="B123-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]; all astragalosides increased the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in HaCaT cells, but astragaloside VI showed the strongest effect in this regard. In addition, both astragaloside VI and cycloastragenol-6-O-beta-D-glucoside, which is considered the main astragalosidesâ€™ intestinal metabolite, were found to stimulate the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) depending on concentration; overall, the EGFR-dependent cell proliferation and migration was reported in both skin cell lines. The in vivo assessment revealed an accelerated healing of the sterile and infected wounds, presumably due to enhanced angiogenesis.
