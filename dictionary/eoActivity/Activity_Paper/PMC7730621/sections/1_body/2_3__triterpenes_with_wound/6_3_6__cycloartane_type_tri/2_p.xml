<p>Their structure is based on the 9b,19-cyclo-5a-lanostane (cycloartane) (I) skeleton and the first structurally characterized representative was cycloartenol, obtained by the reduction of the corresponding ketone, cycloartenone. The majority of these compounds occur in plant sources as esters of organic acids as well as glycosides; biogenetically, they are precursors of phytosterols, occurring only in photosynthetic eukaryotes and contributing to the synthesis of cell membranes [

 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species were found to have wound healing effects: cycloastragenol, astragaloside IV, cyclocephaloside I and cyclocanthoside E; their activity was assessed through MTT assay on human keratinocytes as well as proliferation and migration scratch assay [

The in vitro studies were supplemented with in vivo incision wound studies on Spragueâ€“Dawley male rats; all compounds showed increased fibroblast proliferation and migration, with clearly superior effects for cycloastragenol at 1 ng/mL. Overall, the study proved that cycloartane-type saponins are the main active compounds isolated from the roots of 
 <italic>Astragalus</italic> species directly responsible for their well-known wound healing activity.
