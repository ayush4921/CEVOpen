<p>Cycloartane triterpenoids (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05557-f010">Figure 10</xref>) are widely distributed in various plants but can be found in particular in Astragalus (Fabaceae), Cimicifugea and Thalictrum (Ranunculaceae) genera; the first two mentioned genera contain some of the most popular species used in traditional Chinese medicine [
 <xref rid="B126-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Cycloartane triterpenoids, with unique complex structures, have aroused increased interest in the last decade due to their diverse bioactivities; a quick search in the PubMed database has revealed 251 articles published in the last ten years which indicate their potential as new lead compounds in the medical field. A comprehensive review of the structures and activities of cycloartane triterpenoids and glycosides was published in 2013 indicating their hypolipidemic, hypotensive, diuretic, anti-inflammatory, sedative, analgesic, immune stimulating, and cardiotonic activity [

In particular, the antibacterial properties, manifested against Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, as well as the anti-inflammatory and immune-enhancement effects of cycloartane-based triterpenes are significantly contributory factors in their wound healing activity [
