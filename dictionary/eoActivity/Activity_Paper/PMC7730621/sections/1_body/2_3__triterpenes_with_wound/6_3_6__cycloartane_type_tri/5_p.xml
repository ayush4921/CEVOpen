<p>Conclusively, cycloartane-type triterpenes are the active molecules of some Fabaceae and Ranunculaceae plants. Among them, cycloartanes from the roots of Astragalus membranaceus were tested in various in vitro and rodent in vivo models. They displayed effects like the stimulation of skin cell proliferation and migration, increased angiogenesis improvement of collagen synthesis and skin tensile strength. Although preliminary results appear to be encouraging, other experimental settings (porcine cutaneous wound healing model, studies involving human volunteers) should be approached in order to evaluate their wound-healing potential. Even so, cycloartane-type triterpenes could improve wound healing in human patients by intervening in several stages of healing. These phytocompounds might influence proliferation by enhancing fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis and angiogenesis. Moreover they could prevent scarring by inducing a regular organization of collagen. Also, they could influence the remodeling phase by accelerating skin tensile strength recovery. In adition, these phytocompunds might promote an overall faster wound closure partialy due to their antibacterial properties. The most representative substances with triterpenoid structure with in vitro and in vivo wound healing activities as well as their specific mechanism of action are included in
