<p>In a study regarding the viability of skin flaps on mice, betulinic acid increased de number of micro vessels, diminished the tissue edema and sustained the survivability of the skin flap [

Western blotting demonstrated an increase in the proteins related to angiogenesis (cadherin 5, VEGF and MMP9) after betulinic acid treatment while the CASP3 level, for the vessels and stromal cells, decreased compared to the control group. In terms of oxidative stress evaluation, an important upregulation for HO-1, eNOS and SOD1 proteins was observed; hence, betulinic acid was able to promote angiogenesis, lower the oxidative stress, and reduce apoptosis, through autophagy [
