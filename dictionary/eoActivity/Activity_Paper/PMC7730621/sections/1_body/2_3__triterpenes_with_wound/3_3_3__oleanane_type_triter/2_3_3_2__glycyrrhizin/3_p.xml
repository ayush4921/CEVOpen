Its modulating effect of macrophages via the inhibition of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) makes it an interesting research target in chronic wounds. Oleanane triterpenes from marigold, a reputed plant with wound healing effects, deserve additional interest for a better undersanding and use of its constituents.
