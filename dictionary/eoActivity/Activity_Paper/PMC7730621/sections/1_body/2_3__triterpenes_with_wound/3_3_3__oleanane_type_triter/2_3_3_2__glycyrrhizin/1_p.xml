<p>This is an oleanane-type triterpene saponin from the underground parts of licorice, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> L. This compound has some remarkable properties in the context of wound healing. Glycyrrhizin inhibits high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), secreted by immune cells including macrophages; this property explains its anti-inflammatory effects on thermal injuries models [

 <xref rid="B91-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In fact, the inhibition of HMGB1 by glycyrrhizin has been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype, in parallel with anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype activation in microglia/macrophages [
