<p>Collectively, dammarane-type triterpenoids such as ginsenosides and bacosides were shown to improve wound healing by type I collagen synthesis, increasing neovascularization and cytoprotective effects. Hence, dammarane-type triterpenes might contribute to human skin healing process especially in the proliferation stage, by increasing collagen synthesis and neoagiogenesis or by preventing infection developpement of the wounded area and speeding up the healing process by exerting astringent and antibacterial effects. Nevertheless, further experiments on humans are necessary to explore their potential in re-epithelization</p>
