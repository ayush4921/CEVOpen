 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> is acknowledged for reducing keloid formation and is currently being used in scar management [
 <xref rid="B77-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. The development of keloid during cicatrization is due to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix during wound healing, with the formation of unaesthetic scars; it is believed that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β/Smad pathway is a key element in keloid genesis. In order to evaluate the effects of asiatic acid on keloid, both normal and keloid fibroblasts were exposed to TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of asiatic acid. In keloid fibroblasts, the investigated compound could inhibit TGF-β1 stimulated expression of collagen and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; the observed inhibition implied PPAR-γ activation [

In an assay evaluating the analgesic effect of asiatic acid in mice on a hind paw edema model using the acetic-acid writhing response and the formalin-induced licking experimental settings, the analgesic effect was similar to that of indomethacin used at the same dose (10 mg/kg). The anti-inflammatory effect was correlated to a reduction of the seric levels of malondialdehyde, inducible nitric oxyde synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1β. These findings were in agreement with the inhibition of iNOS, cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear factor NF-κB proteins expression. Moreover, the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in hepatic tissue were significantly reduced, demonstrating a protective activity against reactive oxygen species [
