<p>Asiatic acid, the aglycone of asiaticoside, has been less researched than its glycoside in the context of wound healing. In standardized extracts of 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, its content is generally 30%, while asiaticoside represents 40% and madecassic acid 30% [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Asiatic acid has been identified in over 40 other plant species, among them common plants like chicory (
 <italic>Cichorium intybus</italic>, whole plant), basil (
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic>, whole plant) and pomegranate (
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic>, seeds) [

In vivo, asiaticoside is converted to asiatic acid; pharmacokinetic investigations showed that after the separate administration of equimolar doses of the glycoside and its aglycone, similar plasmatic concentrations of asiatic acid are obtained, albeit these levels are attained later in case of asiaticoside [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The absolute bioavailability of asiatic acid after oral administration may be considered low, of only 16.25%, and is related to its poor solubility and rapid metabolism [
