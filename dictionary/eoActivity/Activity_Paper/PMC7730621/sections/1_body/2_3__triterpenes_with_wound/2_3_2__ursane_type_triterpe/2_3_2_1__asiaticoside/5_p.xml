<p>The wound healing activity of asiaticoside is linked as well to its antioxidative effect; it has been shown to increase the expression levels of superoxide dismutase [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], to enhance the antioxidant activity of wound catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and to raise the concentration of ascorbic acid, vitamin E and reduced glutathione [
 <xref rid="B70-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The increase in antioxidants is significant in the initial stages of wound healing; it has been proposed that the augmentation of vitamin C levels in the wound tissue is a contributing factor to the raised collagen synthesis [

A beneficial effect of asiaticoside in the treatment of wounds is its anti-nociceptive activity; this effect has been determined after oral administration in mice and is mediated through the vanilloid and glutamatergic systems, but does not involve the opioidergic system [
