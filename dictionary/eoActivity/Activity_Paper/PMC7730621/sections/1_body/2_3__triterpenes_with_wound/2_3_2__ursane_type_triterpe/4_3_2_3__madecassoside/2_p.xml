<p>In conclusion, ursane-type triterpenes are perhaps the most intensely investigated triterpenes in the context of wound healing, mostly due to the ethnomedical background of 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, the main source of these compounds. Asiaticoside, the main constituent the plant, has the advantage of not only promoting wound healing, but also normalizing cicatrization as it reduces keloid formation. Anti-inflammatory effects, enhanced collagen synthesis in normal fibroblasts and stimmulation of angiogenesis are the main contributors to the wound healing effect of these compounds.
