<p>This compound is a structural analogue of asiaticoside, differing by the presence of a hydroxyl group. Unlike asiaticoside, it may be absorbed intestinally; madecassoside and madecassic acid could both be detected in rat plasma after oral administration of the glycoside, with inflammatory status significantly affecting their seric levels [

 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, and its wound healing effects have been pointed out both in vitro and in vivo; it is able to intensify the proliferation of normal fibroblast, to boost collagen synthesis by activating the TGF-Î²/Smad pathway, and to reduce collagen degradation [

When administered orally on a burn wound model, madecassoside helps to achieve faster wound closure, reduces infiltration of inflammatory cells and enhances epithelization. These effects are linked to antioxidant properties decreasing malondialdehyde and nitric oxide while increasing glutathione and hydroxyproline concentrations and promoting angiogenesis [
