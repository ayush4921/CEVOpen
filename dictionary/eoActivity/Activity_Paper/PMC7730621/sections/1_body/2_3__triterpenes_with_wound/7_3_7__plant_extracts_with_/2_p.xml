<p>Birch bark has been long known to exert wound healing effects; its composition consists in a mixture of pentacyclic triterpenes, mainly betulin and betulinic acid. Total triterpene extract was tested in vitro and in vivo on an excision wound healing model and revealed the transient up-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and cyclooxygenase-2, and an enhanced migration of keratinocytes thus addressing both the inflammatory and the second phase of wound healing [

 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> extracts exhibit a complex composition which includes polyphenols, flavonoids, carotenoids and triterpene alcohols, both as free and esterified forms [

 <xref rid="B136-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]; the percentage of wound closure almost doubled in the presence of the vegetal extract compared to control and the time interval needed for re-epithelization was reduced significantly. Buzzi et al. assessed in 2016 the therapeutic effects of 
 <italic>Plenus dermax</italic>, a bioactive extract of 
 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic>, in venous leg ulcer healing; the extract contains a mixture of flavonoids, terpene alcohol and triterpenoid monoesters, which are known to act against skin oedema and inflammation and to promote wound healing [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. The study monitored the wound area in terms of planimetry, infection and clinical status, and revealed a double percentage of complete re-epithelization in treated patients compared to control as well as a 4-fold increase in healing velocity percentage per week.
