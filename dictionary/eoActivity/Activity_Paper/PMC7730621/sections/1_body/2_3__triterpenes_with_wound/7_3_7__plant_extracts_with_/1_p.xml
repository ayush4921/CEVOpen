<p>Currently, there are numerous studies on isolated phytochemicals and their biological activities including wound healing; however, the first step in employing vegetal compounds for therapeutic purposes was the use of total herbal extracts with complex composition. Several such herbal extracts were found to promote faster wound healing then control groups during in vivo studies; their complex composition included triterpenes in combination with other active agents like alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and antraquinones [

Despite the fact that pure compounds isolated from plants may have high activity against various pathologies, they may also be less effective compared to crude extracts containing the same concentration in active agents; there are three reasons identified for this phenomenon: (1) in the unrefined extracts their complex composition leads to multiple interactions between components, including synergistic or cumulative biological effects, including enhanced bioavailability, that overall enhance the therapeutic outcome or reduce side effects; (2) a complex composition allows a multi-targeted approach, particularly useful in diseases with multifactorial etiologies; and (3) the raw extracts may contain compounds which inhibit the multi-drug resistance phenomenon. In addition, the low cost of vegetal extracts compared to pure drugs makes them more affordable to the large population, including the poorest countries of the world [
