<p>Among the oleanane-type triterpenes, glycyrrhizin, under the form of licorice extract, an ancient remedy for gastro-duodenal ulcers, was investigated for its wound healing potential in recurrent aphthous stomatitis; a controlled randomized double blind clinical trial evaluated the effect of licorice mouthwash containing diphenhydramine, results indicating a significant reduction in the severity of pain and healing time [

Licorice extract and glycyrrhizin in combination with gentian root and willow bark extract were also studied for their implication in atopic dermatitis in a clinical trial that enrolled 10 patients; the general observation was a strong reduction of the inflammatory process in the affected area, comparable with 1% hydrocortisone acetate treatment [

 <italic>Urtica dioica</italic> under the trade name Ankaferd blood stopper was reported to improve wound healing and promote hemostasis in gastro-intestinal bleedings [

 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic>, a well-known remedy for wound healing and burns, rich in terpenoids such as oleanane and lupane derivatives, was found to be an effective option in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and acute skin damage after cancer radiation therapy by several clinical trials. Lately, the aqueous alcoholic and lipophilic extract of
