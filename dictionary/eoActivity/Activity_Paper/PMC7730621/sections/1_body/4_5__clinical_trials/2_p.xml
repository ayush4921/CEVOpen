<p>Ursane-type triterpenes, asiaticoside, asiatic acid, madecassoside, madecassic acid, phytocompounds identified in 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic> extracts (CAE), were included in several clinical studies that showed their involvement in improving microcirculation and vascular permeability after oral treatment with either 30 or 60 mg extract in patients with post phlebitic syndrome; they are also able to reduce capillary filtration and edema in patients suffering from venous hypertensive microangiopathy [

Also, CAE were demonstrated to reduce stretch marks development in a randomized clinical trial on 80 pregnant women, designed to assess the efficacy of a daily applied topical cream (Trofolastin â€“ novartis, Barcelona, Spain) comparing to placebo; one further observation was that the greatest benefit occurred in women who developed stretch marks in puberty while no benefit was reported in women who acquired them in a previous pregnancy [

Moreover, the daily topical application of another cream containing CAE (Alpha Centella, Alphaplast International, Gallo Manor, South Africa) seems to be efficient in reducing scarring during wound healing; the results of a clinical trial on 106 patients for several months highlighted a mechanism of reducing inflammation and increasing type I collagen [

A combined treatment with two currently used pharmaceutical formulations containing CAE, Madecassol ointment and capsules, was documented in a clinical trial that enrolled 12 patients suffering from systemic sclerosis and localized scleroderma for 6 months; the study revealed the effectiveness of these products in improving digital ulcerations, and the appearance and coloration of the skin [

The same products, as ointment and powder formulation, combined with asiaticoside in i.m administration showed rapid healing outcomes in 12 patients receiving skin grafts and monitored for one week. Meanwhile, their capacity to promote wound healing in ulcerative lesions was demonstrated in a clinical trial that enrolled 98 patients that also underwent a combined topical and i.m treatment, respectively; a cleansing effect on superficially necrotic ulcerations and good perfusion on the wounded area were reported [

A randomized clinical trial that included 200 diabetic patients assessed asiaticoside in terms of effectiveness in diabetic wound healing; after daily treatment with 300 mg asiaticoside, the authors concluded that wound contraction was improved and hypertrophic scars and keloids formation was efficiently prevented compared to placebo [

Dermatocosmetological studies conducted on CAE demonstrated an antiaging effect mainly due to their content in madecosside, through enhancing type I collagen; in a double blind clinical trial that monitored 20 women with photoaged skin for 6 months the general outcome was an important improvement in the firmness, elasticity and hydration of the skin [

Liposclerosis, or cellulite, is another condition that benefits from CAE treatments; a randomized clinical trial that enrolled 35 women orally treated with 60 mg CAE for a period of 90 days, showed reduction in the diameter of adipocytes and inner adipocyte fibrosis [
