<p>Lupane-type triterpenes, betulin, betulinic acid, lupeol, lupeolic acid, are the main phytocompounds identified in birch bark extracts (BBE), betulin being the major constituent. A topical oleogel with betulin reached a randomized phase III clinical trial that investigated the re-epithelialization of split-thickness skin graft wounds on 219 patients; results showed the ability of this product to accelerate skin healing and re-epithelialization, thus contributing to burn care practice [

Furthermore, a betulin emulsion showed excellent wound healing features for treating severe necrotizing herpes zoster in a case report presenting a 64-year-old male patient with chronic lymphatic leukaemia and type II diabetes; betulin application provided continuous improving in wound depth, inflammation, pruritus, pain and induced a complete healing without scarring within 8 weeks [

 <xref rid="B183-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]; the active principles are formed from approximatively 80% betulin and 20% other triterpenes (betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, lupeol, erythrodiol). After three months the wounds treated with this oleogel formed a discreet scar in about 30% of patients compared to 10% in the case of standard care. Further monitoring of the scar concluded that the use of the semisolid oleogel improves the chances of a smooth scar formation and thus can be considered for a well-balanced healing.
