<p>Acute wound healing, also known as the cascade of healing, is a complex process of four overlapping stages: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and remodeling [

The first step, hemostasis, consists in the formation of a blood clot in order to stop the bleeding, which eventually dries and forms a solid layer, a scab, that prevents the infection of the underlying tissue. This phase is achieved by rapid vasoconstriction, through (1) the activation of the coagulation cascade during which prothrombin is converted to thrombin which consequently promotes the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, and (2) by platelet activation and the consequently formation of a platelet plug [

The second stage, the inflammatory phase, is generated by the immune system as a defensive mechanism, resulting in vasodilation that increases the transport of oxygen and nutrients in the wound area and is characterized by the four cardinal signs of inflammation: rubor (erythema), tumor (oedema), dolor (pain), calor (heat) [

The inflammatory phase is divided in: (1) the early inflammatory phase, which starts shortly after coagulation and during which the complement cascade is activated, resulting in a neutrophil infiltrate and phagocytosis at the wound site in order to prevent infection, and (2) the late inflammatory phase, 48â€“72 h after the injury, during which macrofages, attracted by a plethora of chemoattractive agents, take over the fagocytosis; after 72 h lymphocytes arrive at the wound site [

During the third stage, proliferation, several major events take place: fibroblast migration, extracellular matrix formation, granulation, contraction and shrinking of the wound followed by reepithelization. Fibroblasts are attracted at the wound site and consequently start to secrete fibronectin, collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid and proteoglycans, in order to promote extracellular matrix formation, followed by the formation of granulation tissue, a pink and soft tissue that fills the wound; lastly, neoangiogenesis occurs, promoted by vascular endothelial growth factor or platelet derived growth factor [
 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Reepithelization resulting in a red, shiny and tender tissue, is achieved by the migration of basal cells, present at the wound edge, across the wound area, initially as a monolayer which subsequently starts to proliferate [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-05557" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The fourth stage, the maturation or remodeling stage can last up to 2 years, during which the newly formed tissue gains strength and flexibility by reorganization, degradation, and re-synthesis of the extracellular matrix [
