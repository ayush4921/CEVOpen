<p>Wounds and wound healing represents a wide spread health issue, especially if the deeper layers of the skin are affected and/or a chronic lesion is involved. Among the therapeutical strategies and protocols applied in wound healing, plant based remedies play an important role since they were used empirically since ancient times, hence they have stood the test of time. Recently, a high amount of scientific studies were conducted to discover the underlying molecular mechanism of various phytochemicals and plant extracts in order to provide an evidence based validation of their efficacy in wound healing.</p>
