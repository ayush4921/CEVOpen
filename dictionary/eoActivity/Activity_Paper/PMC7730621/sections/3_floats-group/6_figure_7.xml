  <p>Key structural features present in all pentacyclic triterpene structures with wound healing properties (
   <bold>A</bold>); superimposed 3D structures of wound healing pentacyclic triterpene structures (
   <bold>B</bold>); areas where key functional groups appear are highlighted in yellow; structures that have glycosylated OH or COOH groups, are depicted only as triterpene scaffolds for better image clarity.
