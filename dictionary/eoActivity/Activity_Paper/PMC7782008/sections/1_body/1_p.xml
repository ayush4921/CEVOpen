 <italic>R. potaninii</italic> were collected from Danfeng County, Shaanxi Province (33°36′33.52″N, 110°14′04.89″E). The specimen was saved in Herbarium of Institute of Medicinal Plant Development (voucher: Pan0101). Its total genomic DNA was extracted using QIAGEN DNeasy Plant Mini Kit and the whole genome was sequenced on Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. Using SOAPdenovo 2 (Luo et al.
