<p>The total length of chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>R. potaninii</italic> was 159,620 bp (Genbank accession number: MT230556) with 37.9% GC content. The genome consists of four distinct parts, including a large single copy region of 87,722 bp, a small single copy region of 18,948 bp, and a pair of inverted repeats of 26,475 bp. In the genome, 86 protein-coding genes, 8 rRNA genes, and 2 pseudogenes were identified by CPGAVAS (Liu et al.
