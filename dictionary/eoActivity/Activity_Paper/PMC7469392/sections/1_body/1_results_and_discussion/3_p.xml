<p>Three quercetin glycosides with varying degrees of glycosylation were examined in this assay along with their aglycone, quercetin (
 <bold>6</bold>). They showed 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values in the range of 1.70 (±0.11) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> to 36.6 (±3.2) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s. All of the quercetin glycosides showed higher 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values than that of quercetin (1.70 (±0.11) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s). Compound 
 <bold>7</bold>, a glycoside with one sugar unit exhibiting moderate permeability (2.05 (±0.22) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s) while compound 
 <bold>8</bold> with two sugars and compound 
 <bold>9</bold> with three sugars exhibited 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values of 24.5 (±1.21) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> and 36.6 (±3.2) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s, respectively. These values corresponded to a 12-fold and 18-fold increase in permeability compared to that of 
 <bold>7</bold>. These results indicated that the permeability of the quercetin glycosides increased significantly as the degree of glycosylation increased, suggesting that glycosylation facilitates the permeability across Caco-2 monolayers. A similar trend was observed in the case of kaempferol glycosides. The 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> value for kaempferol (
 <bold>1</bold>) was 1.17 (±0.13) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s, whereas compounds 
 <bold>2</bold> and 
 <bold>3</bold>, both having two sugar units, exhibited slightly higher 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values of 1.83 (±0.34) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> and 2.09 (±0.28) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s, respectively. The mixture of two isorhamnetin glycosides (
 <bold>4</bold> and 
 <bold>5</bold>) also showed moderate permeability across Caco-2 monolayers with a 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> value of 6.60 (±0.75) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s, indicating potential human oral bioavailability.
