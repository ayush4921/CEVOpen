<p>The E1 products of gypenosides LVI and XLVI, the damulins A (
 <bold>15</bold>) and B (
 <bold>16</bold>) (C-2-OH) and the C-3-OH isomers, damulins E (
 <bold>17</bold>) and F (
 <bold>18</bold>), exhibited low to moderate monolayer permeability with 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values ranging from 1.33 (±0.073) to 6.2 (±0.248) × 10
 <sup>–6</sup> cm/s. Damulins A and B (
 <bold>15</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold>) differ only in the position of the double bond at C-20 of the side chain, with 
 <bold>15</bold> being the Δ
 <sup>20,22</sup> isomer and 
 <bold>16</bold> the less stable terminal double-bond isomer (Δ
 <sup>20,21</sup>). Damulins E and F (
 <bold>17</bold> and 
 <bold>18</bold>) share the same structural relationship (

 </xref>). A comparison of the Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability of these compounds reveals a slight increase in apparent permeability in those compounds with the terminal double bound 
 <bold>16</bold> and 
 <bold>18</bold>. The previous comparison of the permeability of gypenoside L (
 <bold>12</bold>) and yixinoside B (
 <bold>14</bold>) suggested that hydroxylation at C-1 favored permeability over hydroxylation at C-2 and a similar trend was observed for the damulins. Damulins E and F (
 <bold>17</bold> and 
 <bold>18</bold>), both having hydroxyl group at C-1, exhibited higher 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values than that of the C2-OH isomers, damulins A and B (
 <bold>15</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold>). This confirms that the monolayer permeability is facilitated by the presence of a hydroxyl group at C-1 more than at C-2. The analysis of the 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>app</sub> values confirmed that compounds 
 <bold>15</bold>–
 <bold>18</bold> showed low to moderate permeability across Caco-2 monolayers, whereas the compounds 
 <bold>10</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, and 
 <bold>14</bold> exhibited high Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability, making them strong candidates with the potential for high oral absorption
