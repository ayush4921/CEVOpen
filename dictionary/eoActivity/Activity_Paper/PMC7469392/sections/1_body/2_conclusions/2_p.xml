<p>A similar trend was observed for the highly glycosylated dammarane saponins, 
 <bold>10</bold> and 
 <bold>11</bold>, where the permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers was favored by a higher degree of glycosylation. Analysis of the structure–permeability correlations revealed that saponins with a hydroxyl group at C-1 and 
 <italic>S</italic>-configuration at C-20 were more permeable across Caco-2 cell monolayers than the structural or configurational isomers. It was also observed that the compounds that result from the elimination of the C-20-OH group, compounds 
 <bold>15</bold>–
 <bold>18</bold>, showed low to moderate permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers, whereas the precursor compounds, 
 <bold>10</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, and 
 <bold>14</bold>, exhibited high Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability, making them strong candidates for possible complete human oral bioavailability.

 </xref> depicts these permeability-enhancing structural features highlighted in red. Based on the literature reports on the bioavailability of other classes of saponins and comparison with our results, we propose that the flavonoids and saponins with moderate to high permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers are transported via active transport, possibly by sugar transporters. This study does not implicate the involvement of specific uptake transporters or efflux pumps. In the future, transport studies can be utilized to determine the specific transporters involved in the active transport of these compounds. This was the first bioavailability study of dammarane saponins and also of a number of flavonoids from 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic>, and the results have definite significance in allowing future bioavailability assays to identify potential drugs for oral administration or structures for lead optimization.
