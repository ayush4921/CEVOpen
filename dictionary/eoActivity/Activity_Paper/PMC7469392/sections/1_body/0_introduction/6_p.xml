<p>Even though the chemistry of 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> has been extensively investigated, surprisingly, there is an extremely low number of reports on the bioavailability of the flavonoids present in the plant. Here, for the first time, we report the Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability profiles of five flavonoids (
 <bold>2</bold>, 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>5</bold>, and 
 <bold>9</bold>;

 <bold>1</bold>), quercetin (
 <bold>6</bold>), isoquercitrin (
 <bold>7</bold>), and rutin (
 <bold>8</bold>). The Caco-2 cell monolayer permeability of dammarane saponins has never previously been investigated and thus we report the relative 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> monolayer permeability profiles of nine damarane saponins (
 <bold>10</bold>â€“
 <bold>18</bold>;
