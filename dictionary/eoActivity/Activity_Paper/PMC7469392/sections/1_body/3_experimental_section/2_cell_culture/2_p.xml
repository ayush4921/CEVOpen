<p>Caco-2 cells (passage 34) were removed from the −80 °C freezer, thawed in a water bath at 37 °C for 1–2 min, resuspended in flask media (5 mL), and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min). After discarding the supernatant, the cells were resuspended in flask media (1–2 mL). Gentle mixing using a 5 mL serological pipette gave a homogeneous mixture. The cells were then seeded into 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flasks (Thermo Scientific) by transferring cell suspension (0.5–1 mL) and flask media (10 mL) to each flask. The flasks were stored in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 95% relative humidity). The media in the flask was changed every two days until the cells reached 80–85% confluency at which time the cells were passaged or plated.
