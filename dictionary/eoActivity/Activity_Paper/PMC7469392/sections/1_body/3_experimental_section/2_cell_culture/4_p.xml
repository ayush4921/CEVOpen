<p>To seed the cells into transwell plates, the plates were preincubated with plate media (100 μL apical and 600 μL basal) for at least 30 min. The protocol for passaging cells was followed until the removal of supernatant from centrifuged cells. Cells were then resuspended in plate media (4–5 mL) and counted on a hemocytometer (BlauBrand), and the cell resuspension dilution was adjusted to a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL. The media were then removed from the plates, the basal side was refreshed (600 μL), and cells (passage 38) were seeded onto the apical side (100 μL). Plates were cultured in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 95% relative humidity) for 21 days. Plate media were refreshed every 48 h until day 8. From day 8 and later, apical plate media were refreshed every 24 h, while the 48 h feeding pattern was maintained for the basal side. On day 21, all plate media were refreshed and TEER values were measured (Millicell Electrical Resistance System (ERS-2) volt ohmmeter). Values in the acceptable range of 400–600 Ω·cm
 <sup>2</sup> were recorded. Wells were arranged in descending order of TEER value to minimize variation between compound replicates.
