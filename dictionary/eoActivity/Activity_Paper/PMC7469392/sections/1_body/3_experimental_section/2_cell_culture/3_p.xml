<p>To passage the cells, flask media was removed and the cells were washed with PBS (2 × 1–2 mL). Trypsin–0.25% EDTA (3 mL) was added and the flasks were incubated for 5 min, agitated 2–3 times to encourage cell detachment. Following successful detachment, flask media (3 mL per 1 mL trypsin) were added and the cells were centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min). The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended homogeneously in the flask media (1–2 mL). The cells were seeded into fresh flasks and maintained as previously described.</p>
