<p>Dried leaves of 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> (10 g) were extracted with 50% aqueous methanol (100 mL), followed by sonication (3 × 10 min). After filtration and removal of the solvent, the crude extract (1 g) was partially purified by solid-phase extraction (Phenomenex Strata C-18E cartridge, 55 μm, 70 Å), eluted with water, followed by 10, 20, 30, and 40% aqueous methanol and 100% methanol taking three aliquots (3 × 100 mL) of each solvent composition. The 30% aqueous methanol fraction (103 mg) was dried, dissolved in 20% aqueous acetonitrile (6 mL), filtered (0.22 μm Millex syringe filter), and further purified by column chromatography using preparative reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RPHPLC) (gradient elution, 2–20% aqueous acetonitrile over 25 min, 25.0 mL/min) to give compounds 
 <bold>1–9</bold> that were identified by literature values from nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry analyses.
