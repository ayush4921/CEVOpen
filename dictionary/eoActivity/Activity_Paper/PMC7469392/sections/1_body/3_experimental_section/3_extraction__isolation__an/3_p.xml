<p>ActivAMP powder form of 
 <italic>G. pentaphyllum</italic> (10 g) was extracted with 60% aqueous ethanol (100 mL), followed by sonication (3 × 10 min). After filtration and removal of the solvent, the crude extract (1 g) was partially purified by solid-phase extraction (Phenomenex Strata C-18E cartridge, 55 μm, 70 Å), eluted with water, followed by 60, 70, 80, and 90% aqueous methanol and 100% aqueous methanol taking three aliquots (3 × 100 mL) of each solvent composition. The 70% aqueous methanol fraction (116.2 mg) was dried, dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile (6 mL), filtered (0.22 μm Millex syringe filter), and further purified by column chromatography using semipreparative RPHPLC (40% aqueous acetonitrile isocratic over 30 min, 2.0 mL/min) to give compounds 
 <bold>10</bold>–
 <bold>18</bold> that were identified by literature values from nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry analyses.
