<p>Motivated by the aforementioned findings, and upon continuation of our research programme in the field of discovery of pyrazole bearing antimicrobial agents
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>32–34</sup>
 </xref>, some novel pyrazole prototypes were designed and synthesised after exploring molecular fusion with pyridazine, triazine and triazole moieties. The synthesised compounds comprising pyrazole motif were evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for their antimicrobial activities against human pathogenic microbes and their inhibitory activities against DHFR enzyme. Finally, molecular docking and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies were used to explain the obtained biological data.
