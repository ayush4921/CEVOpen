<p>The molecular docking a powerful tool to understanding and rationalise the obtained biological results. The interactions of the newly synthesised compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> having the highest DHFR inhibitory activity were investigated with the active site of the target kinase to study their mode of binding and orientations. All the molecular modelling studies were carried out using MOE, 10.2008 software

 </xref>. The enzyme structure was prepared for molecular docking using Protonate 3D protocol in MOE with the default options. The co-crystallised inhibitor was used to define the active site for molecular docking. Triangle Matcher placement method and London dG scoring function were used in the docking protocol. Docking setup was first validated by self-docking of the co-crystallised inhibitor in the enzyme active site giving a docking pose with an energy score (S) = −11.68 kcal/mol and an RMSD of 0.88 Å from the co-crystalised ligand pose (

 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> in the DHFR active site to predict their binding pattern and to investigate their ability to satisfy the required structural features for binding interactions (
