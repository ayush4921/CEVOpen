<p>A mixture of 
 <bold>3a</bold> (2.81 g, 10 mmol) with each of either malononitrile (
 <bold>4a</bold>) (0.66 g, 10 mmol) or ethyl cyanoacetate (
 <bold>4b</bold>) (1.13 g, 10 mmol) was fused in the presence of ammonium acetate (1.54 g, 20 mmol) at 150 °C for 30 min, then left to stand at room temperature and triturated with absolute ethanol. The solid products so formed were collected by filtration and recrystallised from ethanol/DMF to give 
 <bold>6a</bold> and 
 <bold>6b</bold>, respectively.
