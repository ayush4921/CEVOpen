<p>In summary, a series of pyrazole derivatives 
 <bold>3</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> bearing different heterocyclic systems was designed and synthesised. All synthesised analogues were examined for their 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antimicrobial, DHFR inhibition activity and 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies. The antimicrobial data revealed the ability of the compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> to inhibit the growth of the screened panel of six strains with excellent MIC values in comparison with the reference drugs. In addition, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory activity against DHFR enzyme illustrated that compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> were the most potent ones in comparison with methotrexate. Based on the previously obtained data from DHFR inhibition assay, the pyrazoles 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> containing sulphonamide substitution illustrated good fitting and favourable binding modes with DHFR enzyme in the docking study through formation of a critical hydrogen bond with the essential amino acid 
 <bold>Ser59</bold>.
