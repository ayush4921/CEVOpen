<p>The bulky pyrazolo[4,3-
 <italic>c</italic>]pyridazine scaffold in the compound 
 <bold>6a</bold> enforced a bound conformation via two arene–arene interactions with 
 <bold>Phe31</bold>. It could be assumed that chain elongation with 
 <bold>–NH–N=</bold> hydrazinyl fragment between pyrazole and benzenesulfonamide in 
 <bold>3a</bold>, deprived pyrazole ring from binding with the essential amino acid 
 <bold>Phe31</bold>, although the insertion of 
 <bold>N–N</bold> chain in cyclised ring fused to pyrazole in 
 <bold>6a</bold> gave the chance to be near with 
 <bold>Phe31.</bold> Furthermore, the cyano substitution on the pyazolopyridazine moiety in 
 <bold>6a</bold> allowed two hydrogen bond acceptors with the side chain of 
 <bold>Arg28</bold>. (distance: 2.71 and 2.92 Å, respectively) (
