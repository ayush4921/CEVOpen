<p>The docked compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> explored higher negative energy score of −12.17 and −13.48 kcal/mol indicating higher predicted binding affinity than the co-crystallised ligand. They were fit in the active site of the enzyme in a similar way via binding of the sulphonamide moiety with the side chain of 
 <bold>Ser59</bold> through two hydrogen bonds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figures 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007">7</xref>). The two nitrogen of the hydrazinyl moiety in 
 <bold>3a</bold> displayed two H-bonds, acceptor with the backbone of 
 <bold>Ser118</bold> and donor with side chain of 
 <bold>Thr146</bold> (distance: 2.72 and 1.62 Å, respectively). The oxygen of pyrazolone scaffold shared fixation through two H-bond acceptors with the side chain of 
 <bold>Ser119</bold> (distance: 2.85 and 3.05 Å) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>).
