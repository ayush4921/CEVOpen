<p>The IR spectrum of 
 <bold>9a</bold>, taken as a typical example, was characterised by the disappearance of absorption band due to the CO group. Its 
 <sup>1</sup>HNMR showed two singlet at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.89, 6.31 ppm which were assigned for CH
 <sub>3</sub> and NH
 <sub>2</sub> protons, respectively and a singlet at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 12.62 ppm attributable to the pyrazole-NH proton, in addition to the presence of aromatic protons (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0002">Scheme 2</xref> and Experimental Section). The carbonyl group of pyrazole moiety was also absent in 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra.
