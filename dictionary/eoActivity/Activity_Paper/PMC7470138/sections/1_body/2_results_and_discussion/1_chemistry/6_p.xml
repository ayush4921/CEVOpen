<p>The infra-red spectra of 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>8b</bold> indicated the absence of the 2NH and carbonyl absorption bands and revealed the characteristic absorption band for the thiocarbonyl group. For example, the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum of 
 <bold>8a</bold> in DMSO-d
 <sub>6</sub> revealed two singlets at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.28, 6.25 ppm which were assigned for methyl and NH
 <sub>2</sub> protons, respectively, and disappearance of any signal attributable to the NH proton, in addition to the presence of aromatic protons. Also, 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectrum showed confirmatory signal of the CS group around 
 <italic>δ</italic> 176.1 ppm. Formation of 
 <bold>8</bold> was proceeded via the nucleophilic addition of 
 <bold>3</bold> to phenyl isothiocyanate to give the non-isolable adduct 
 <bold>7</bold> followed by cyclisation through the nucleophilic attack of N atom to the carbon of the C = O group giving structure 
 <bold>iii</bold> which upon elimination of H
 <sub>2</sub>O molecule afforded the end reaction products 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>8b</bold>.
