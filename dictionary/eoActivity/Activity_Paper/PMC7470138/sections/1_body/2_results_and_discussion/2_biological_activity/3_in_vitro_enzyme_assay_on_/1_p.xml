 <bold>3b</bold>, 
 <bold>6a</bold>,

 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> using methotrexate as a positive control. As expressed in 
 <xref rid="t0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, compounds 
 <bold>3a</bold> and 
 <bold>6a</bold> proved to be the highest active inhibitors with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 0.11 ± 1.05 and 0.09 ± 0.91 µM, in comparison with Methotrexate (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.14 ± 1.25 µM). However, the rest derivatives revealed moderate inhibitory activities via 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>9a</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.36 ± 0.12 and 1.45 ± 0.23 µM, respectively) and weak ones through 
 <bold>3b</bold> and 
 <bold>6b</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 18.30 ± 0.81 and 5.24 ± 0.37 µM, respectively).
