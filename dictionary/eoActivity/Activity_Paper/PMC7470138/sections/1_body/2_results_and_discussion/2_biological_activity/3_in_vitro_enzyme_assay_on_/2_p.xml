<p>Correlation between the chemical structure and the inhibitory activity of the screened derivatives over DHFR enzyme revealed that the existence of benzene sulphonamide moiety in 
 <bold>3a</bold>, 
 <bold>6a, 8a and 9a</bold> led to enhanced activity, and the potency order was 
 <bold>6a</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>3a</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>8a</bold> &gt; 
 <bold>9a</bold>. Moreover, the attachment of pyrazoline ring with hydrazinyl group in 
 <bold>3a</bold> or hybridisation with pyridazine in 
 <bold>6a</bold> possessed better inhibitory activity than with triazine or triazole in 
 <bold>8a</bold> and 
 <bold>9a.</bold>
