<p>The cp genome of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cirrhifolium</italic> presented a circular double-stranded DNA structure of 155,583 bp, which consisted of two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26,372 bp each, a large single-copy (LSC) of 84,412 bp, and a small single-copy (SSC) of 18,427 bp. The 
 <italic>P. cirrhifolium</italic> cp genome was predicated to contain 133 genes, including 85 protein-coding genes, 40 tRNA genes, and 8 rRNA genes. For the annotated genes, seven protein-coding genes, eight tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes were duplicated in the IR regions. A total of 15 different intron-containing genes were detected, with 13 contained one intron and two contained two introns. The overall GC content of 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>cirrhifolium</italic> cp genome was 37.66% and the corresponding values in LSC, SSC and IR regions were 35.71%, 31.55%, 42.92%, respectively.
