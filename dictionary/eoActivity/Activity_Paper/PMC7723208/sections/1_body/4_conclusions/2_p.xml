<p>The increased interest in whole cereal foods has coincided with an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases such as T2DM. α‐Amylase and α‐glucosidase inhibitors are significant for the control of postprandial blood glucose in diabetic patients. Cereal‐derived phenolic compounds, peptides, nonstarch polysaccharides, and lipids inhibit α‐amylase and α‐glucosidase activity. These inhibitors may be associated with the prevention of hypoglycemia by whole cereal food intake (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To increase the utilization of whole cereals and their bioactive ingredients in diabetes management foods, it is mandatory to understand the inhibitory mechanisms and further investigate the structure–activity relationships between the compounds and enzymes. For example, the number and location of hydroxyl groups of phenolic acids, the molecular weight of polysaccharides, acetylation, and methylation all affect the enzyme inhibition activities. Of note, processing technologies will be able to affect the distribution, compounds, chemical structures, amount, and thus health benefits of the end whole cereal food subject to cereal types. The cereal‐derived α‐amylase and/or α‐glucosidase inhibitor could be targeted for developing valuable whole cereal foods in T2DM dietary managements. Noteworthy, most data about the impact of whole cereal flour or whole cereal food on enzyme activities are from in vitro studies, and further in vivo investigations are needed.
