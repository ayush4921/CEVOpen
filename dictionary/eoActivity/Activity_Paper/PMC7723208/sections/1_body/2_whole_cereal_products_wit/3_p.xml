<p>A series of experiments demonstrated that postprandial glucose response was improved when whole cereal products were consumed versus when refined cereals were consumed. For example, the consumption of breakfast meals with whole rye or whole wheat in healthy volunteers had lower early glucose responses (0–60 min) and incremental glucose peaks in comparison with white wheat bread. The whole rye and wheat products displayed a lower rate of starch hydrolysis (Rosén &amp; Björck,

 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) reported that the glycemic index of refined wheat noodles incorporated with 30% finger millet was significantly lower (45.1) than refined wheat noodles (62.6) in ten normal female subjects aged 24–26 years. Several other studies also indicated the lowering effects of whole cereals and whole cereal products on plasma glucose (Berglund et al.,
