<p>Whole cereals are generally recommended for diabetic patients to control their blood glucose level. There have been many clinical and animal studies focused on the use of cereals and its components for the prevention of diabetes, especially based on glycemic Index values and hypoglycemic effects (Berglund et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">1982</xref>; Brand‐Miller et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Hallfrisch et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). Although these beneficial effects are thought to be associated with dietary fiber intake, the actual underlying mechanism remains unclear. Besides dietary fiber, cereals are abundant in nutrients and bioactive ingredients for prevention and treatment of diabetes, such as polyphenol, anthocyanins, triterpenoids, saponins, polysaccharides, and peptides. It has been found that polysaccharides (Kim et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>) present in plants have an inhibitory effect on carbohydrate digestion enzymes. This paper presents a modern perspective on the inhibition of digestive enzymes by cereal constituent to encourage the design and development of whole cereal products for preventing T2DM.
