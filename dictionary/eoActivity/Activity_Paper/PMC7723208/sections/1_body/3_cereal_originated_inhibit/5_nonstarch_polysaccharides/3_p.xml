<p>In case of α‐amylase, cellulose (either purified or as a component of wheat bran) was demonstrated to bind α‐amylase and inhibit the activity of the enzyme through a mixed‐type inhibition mechanism (Sushil et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Cereal arabinoxylan and β‐glucan can impair diffusion of the polymer probes similar in size to α‐amylase, which slowed starch hydrolysis in the small intestine (Shelat et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0056" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>). The carboxymethylated polysaccharide, which exhibited the highest inhibitory activity among the four polysaccharides samples, had a high solubility, a narrow molecular weight distribution, and a hyperbranched conformation. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of acarbose, carboxymethylated, sulfated, raw, and acetylated derivatives was 2.51, 5.33, 8.54, 10.07, and 10.31 mg/ml. However, limited work has been conducted on the structure–function relationship of nonstarch polysaccharides against α‐glucosidase or α‐amylase.
