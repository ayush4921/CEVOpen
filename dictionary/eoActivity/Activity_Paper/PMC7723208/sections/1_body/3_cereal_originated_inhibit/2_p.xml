<p>Cereals are rich in polysaccharides, protein, and phenolic compounds, and are valuable resources for inhibitors of amylase and glucosidase (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31987-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). AIs have been found in cereals such as wheat, barley, sorghum, rye, and rice (Elbein,

 <xref rid="fsn31987-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">1985</xref>) is the most studied inhibitors in cereals. It has been reported that taking a wheat amylase inhibitor for 9 weeks after meals can reduce postprandial amylase levels, delay carbohydrate digestion and absorption, and lower blood glucose levels without altering pancreas growth (Bernfeld,
