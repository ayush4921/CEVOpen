<p>Lichens are naturally arising from an alliance between fungus and algae [

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are about 18,500 species of lichens worldwide that can survive in various extreme environmental conditions due to their exceptional resistance capacity that makes them pioneer species. The intrinsic resistance of lichen is mainly due to the production of a wide range of compounds derived typically from secondary metabolites of fungal components which build up in the cortex or the medullary layer [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Approximately 1050 chemical substances are identified in lichens including depsides, depsidones, and dibenzofurans [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Lichens are known for their several medicinal virtues, and their metabolites have been described for their multiple biological properties [
