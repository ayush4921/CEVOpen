<p>The cytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>R. farinacea, E. prunastri</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> extracts against different cell lines was assessed using the WST1. The results revealed that the extracts demonstrated a relatively low cytotoxic effect against all cells in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Loss of cell viability was revealed by the morphological and aggregation changes depending on the concentration of extracts as shown, for example, by the extracts of 
 <italic>R. farinacea, E. prunastri,</italic> and 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> against HT-29 cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the number of dead cells positively correlates with the concentration of the extracts. At high concentrations of the extracts, cells started to get a more enlarged shape and a formation of blebs in the cell's membranes. We also noticed the appearance of apoptotic bodies, large vacuoles in the cell cytoplasm, and rounded shape of the cells that start to detach from the surface and float in the medium indicating cell death. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of organic extracts from lichens ranged from 42.30 to 140.24 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with no significant difference between the sensitivity of cancer cells treated by 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic> and by 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), and for 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic>, we found a significant difference between 22RV1 cells and the other cell lines (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, a significant difference was observed between 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> and 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> in the inhibition of all tested cell lines and between 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> and 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic> for HT-29 and 22RV1 cells (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Among extracts studied, 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> extract was found to induce the largest effect towards all cancer cell lines tested, especially against 22RV1 (human prostate cancer) cells. As can be seen in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the cytotoxic effect of extracts studied was lower compared to that of mitomycin (positive control).
