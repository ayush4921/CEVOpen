<p>The ferric reducing power of the studied crude extracts was reported in a dose-dependent manner. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the highest activity was obtained for 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> extract with absorbance increased from 0.01 to 0.22. However, no significant difference between the extract of 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> and 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> was observed. This activity remains lower compared to the positive controls (ascorbic acid and Trolox) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).
