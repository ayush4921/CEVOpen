<p>The ferric-reducing powers of lichen extracts were evaluated according to the method described in the early literature [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In brief, 1 mL of extract (50–1000 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) was mixed with 2.5 mL of phosphate buffer and then added to 2.5 ml of the solution of potassium ferricyanide (1%). Afterward, the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 50°C and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm. 2.5 mL of the supernatants were added to 2.5 mL of distilled water and mixed with 0.1% FeCl
 <sub>3</sub>. Finally, the absorbance of the resulting solutions was recorded at 700 nm. In this assay, trolox and ascorbic acid were used as standards. Increasing the absorption of the sample is an indication of increasing reducing power. All experiments were executed in triplicate.
