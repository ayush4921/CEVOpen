<p>Total flavonoid content (TFC) in extracts was evaluated using protocols as previously described [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An aliquot of 500 microliters of each lichen extract (1 mg/mL) was added to 75 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of sodium nitrite solution (5%) mixed with 150 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of aluminum chloride (10%), after 5 min at ambient temperature, 500 
 <italic>µ</italic>L of NaOH reagent (1 M) was added, and then, the absorbance was recorded at 510 nm. TFC was presented as catechin equivalent (CE) (
 <italic>µ</italic>g CE/mg of dry extract).
