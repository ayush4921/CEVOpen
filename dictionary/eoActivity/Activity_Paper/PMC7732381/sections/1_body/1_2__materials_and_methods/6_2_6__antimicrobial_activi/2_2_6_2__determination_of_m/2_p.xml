<p>Regarding the MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration), 10 
 <italic>µ</italic>L from purple wells of the MICs test were subcultured on nutrient agar in Petri plates. MBC was considered as the lowest effective concentration with no bacterial growth after reincubation. Moreover, for each extract, the ratio CMB/MIC was calculated to assess its antibacterial ability, the extract has a bactericidal effect when CMB/MIC = 1–2 and a bacteriostatic effect when CMB/CMI = 4–16 [
