<p>The MICs (Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations) were determined according to data by Satyajit et al. with some modifications [

 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL was added followed by resazurin solution (0.015%) as a marker of microbial growth. The plates were incubated again for 24 h at 37°C. The lowest effective concentration was considered as a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) [
