<p>The current study sheds light on the biological properties of extracts from 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic>, 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> growing in Morocco. The results reported here pointed out that the three lichen extracts possess significant antioxidant and antibacterial activities. 
 <italic>Pseudevernia furfuracea</italic> extract exhibited the best antioxidant power, as well as the highest total phenolic content. The results also demonstrated that all studied extracts have antibacterial effects against only Gram-positive bacteria, especially against MRSA strains, with the highest activity was presented by the extract of 
 <italic>Pseudevernia furfuracea</italic>. Therefore, the Moroccan lichens could be a promising source of bioactive natural products with a pharmaceutical interest. However, complementary studies should be conducted to identify the major metabolites that are responsible for this biological activity and their mechanism of action.
