<p>Lichens have been involved in several studies looking for new natural antioxidants and their potential protective effects vs. chronic diseases [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the present work, our findings showed that the tested extracts had a potent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant effect which correlated to content in total phenols. This result was in accordance with another published work which showed a positive correlation between the phenolic content and the antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, no significant correlation between the flavonoid content in the lichen extract and the antioxidant effect was reported therein. This means that lichen components (depsides, depsidones, and dibenzofurans) are the principal agents responsible for the antioxidant activities. Among the tested extracts, 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> extract showed the best antioxidant power with the greatest concentration of polyphenolic compounds, which is in accordance with other studies carried out in acetone extract of 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> and 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic> harvested in Serbia and Turkey showing in the same way that 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> extract had a largest antioxidant activity and the highest quantity of phenols than 
 <italic>E.prunastri</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Our results indicated higher antioxidant capacity and phenolic content than those reported by Kosanić and Bìlgìn Sokmen in their studies. Moreover, our results showed that 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> extract had the highest ferric reducing power, but the lowest phenols content, which suggests that this activity of this tested extract can be due to the presence of nonphenolic compounds.
