<p>Finally, our research findings provided that the lichen extract tested demonstrated high antibacterial activity against MRSA clinical isolates from burn wounds. The acetone extracts of 
 <italic>P. furfuracea</italic> and 
 <italic>E. prunastri</italic> exhibited high activity with MICs ranged from 0.039 to 0.15 mg/mL and a bacteriostatic effect. Furthermore, 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> extract exhibited a bactericidal effect against one MRSA with MIC values ranging from 0.078 to 0.625 mg/mL for all MRSA strains. This activity could be induced by usnic acid which was the major antibacterial agent in 
 <italic>R. farinacea</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Pompilio et al. demonstrated that usnic acid showed significantly higher activity against MRSA strains than atranorin and fumarprotocetraric acid [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Other data indicated that usnic acid presented high antibacterial activity against clinical isolates of MRSA with MIC values ranging between 25 and 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL by disruption of the bacterial membrane [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Various lichenic compounds such as lobar acid, physodic acid, rhizocarpic acid, 3-hydroxyphysodic acid, hybocarpone, and (R)-(+)-usnic acid isolated, respectively, from 
 <italic>Sterocaulon dactylophyllum, Hypogymnia physodes, Psilolechia lucida, Hypogymnia physodes, Lecanora conizaeoides,</italic> and 
 <italic>Lecanora albescens</italic> lichen species were found to be effective vs. methicillin- and multidrug-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Despite, the antibacterial activity of lichens, either as raw extracts or purified compounds, was widely investigated, and the mechanism of action of these substances has not been sufficiently assessed [
