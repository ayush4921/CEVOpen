    "<i>Premna serratifolia</i>, commonly known as Arogo in Tentena-Sulawesi, is a popular vegetable. As a promising herbal tea and food ingredient, further investigation is required to find the best knowledge for medicinal use of <i>P. serratifolia</i> leaves. This research investigated the antioxidant activity of the ethanol (EEPS) and water (WEPS) extracts of <i>P. serratifolia</i> leaves, based on their scavenging activities on DPPH radicals and their reducing capacities (CuPRAC, total antioxidant/phosphomolybdenum, and ferric thiocyanate reducing power assays). The DNA-protecting effect by EEPS was tested using pBR322 plasmid DNA against •OH radical-induced damage. The inhibition potentials of both extracts against several enzymes related to metabolic diseases (<i>α</i>-glucosidase, <i>α</i>-amylase, xanthine oxidase, and protease) were evaluated. The phytochemical analysis was conducted by an LC-QTOF-MS/MS technique. EEPS proved to be a better antioxidant and had higher phenolic content compared to WEPS. EEPS demonstrated a protective effect on DNA with recovery percentage linearly correlated with EEPS concentrations. Strong inhibition on <i>α</i>-glucosidase and <i>α</i>-amylase was observed for EEPS; however, EEPS and WEPS showed weak inhibitions on xanthine oxidase and protease. LC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis identified seven main components in EEPS, namely scroside E, forsythoside A and forsythoside B, lavandulifolioside, diosmin, nobilin D, campneoside I, and isoacteoside. These components may be responsible for the observed enzymes inhibitions and antioxidant properties. <i>Premna serratifolia</i> leaves can be an appropriate choice for the development of nutraceutical and drug preparations."
