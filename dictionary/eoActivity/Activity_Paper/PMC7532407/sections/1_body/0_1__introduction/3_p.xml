<p>The species 
 <italic>Premna serratifolia</italic> belongs to the family Lamiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions, including Indonesia, Australia, and India. The shrub plants can grow up to one and half meters. The leaves of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> are commonly consumed as food ingredient in Tentena, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, where it is known as Arogo. Different parts of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> including fruit, roots, barks, and leaves have been used in folk medicine for the treatment of a number of illnesses, such as stomach disorders, diabetes, cough, rheumatism, inflammatory, and cardiovascular disorder [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Pharmacological studies conducted so far confirm on the ethnomedicinal uses of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> including antioxidant, antiarthritis, antiparasitic, and cardio- and gastroprotective activities [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To date, studies conducted on 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> mainly involve roots, barks, woods, and stems from the plant. Only few papers have been published regarding the pharmacological properties of the leaves of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic>, such as tumor cell suppression activity [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], cytotoxic activities on neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities using animal model [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Recently, we reported antidiabetic and antioxidant properties of the water extract of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> leaves [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The present study aimed at extending this investigation on the antioxidant (reducing power and DNA protective) activities and enzyme (
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, xanthine oxidase, and protease) inhibitory properties, of the water and ethanol extracts. Furthermore, the phytochemical profiles of the ethanol extract were also reported.
