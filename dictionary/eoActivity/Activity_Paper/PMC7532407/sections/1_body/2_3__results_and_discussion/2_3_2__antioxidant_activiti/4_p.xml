<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that antioxidant activity of the plant extracts was strongly related to their phenolic content [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This present work proved the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> leaves, which derives from radical scavenging and reducing activities. It is worth noting that EEPS showed higher content in phenolics compared to WEPS. The difference in activity registered to EEPS and WEPS may be associated to the content of the phenolics in the extracts as observed previously (part 3.1). Furthermore, PhGs as identified in the ethanol extract by the LC-QTOF-MS/MS were rich in phenolic structures such as isoactoside, forsythoside A and B, lavandulifolioside, scroside E, and campneoside I. Phenolic compounds contain one or more hydroxyl moieties on the benzene ring. The acidic properties of the hydroxyl group and the nucleophilic property of the benzene rings are responsible for the antioxidant activity of the phenolics, possibly by donating a proton or an electron to scavenge free radicals or involving in reducing metal ions of higher oxidation number to lower number.
