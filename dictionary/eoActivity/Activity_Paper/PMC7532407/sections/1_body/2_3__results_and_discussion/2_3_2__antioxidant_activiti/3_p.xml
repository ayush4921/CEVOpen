<p>CUPRAC, phosphomolybdenum and reducing power assays were employed to evaluate the reducing potential of the extracts. The methods are based on the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) in acidic condition, Mo(VI) to Mo(V), and Fe(III) to Fe(II), respectively. Higher values indicate higher reducing capacity. By all methods, both EEPS and WEPS showed reducing ability as can be seen in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. However, EEPS consistently exhibited higher reducing activities compared to WEPS (

 <italic>Premna mucronata</italic> previously showed to have reducing power capacity [
