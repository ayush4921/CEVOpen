<p>Oxidative stress is considered central in triggering pathological conditions in hyperglycemia and hyperuricemia. It has been reported that persistent hyperglycemia perpetuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation through various pathways, including advanced glycation end-product (AGE), polyol, and protein kinase C pathways [
