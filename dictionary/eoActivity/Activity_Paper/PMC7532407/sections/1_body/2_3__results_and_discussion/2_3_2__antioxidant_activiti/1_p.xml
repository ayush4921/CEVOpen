<p>Antioxidant activity of the extracts was evaluated using different methods which differ in terms of mechanisms and reaction conditions. EEPS and WEPS were determined for their radical scavenging activity based on DPPH assay and their reducing capacity (CUPRAC, phosphomolybdenum, and reducing power assays). DNA damage protection capacity was also evaluated as part of antioxidant activities of EEPS. Results are presented in
