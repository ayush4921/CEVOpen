<p>The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of EEPS and WEPS are presented in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. A significant difference in TPC (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was observed between EEPS and WEPS, with EEPS showing a more concentrated phenolics, approximately 7â€“8 folds, than WEPS. However, WEPS was observed to have higher content in flavonoids compared to EEPS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Plant-based phenolics and flavonoids have been associated with medicinal properties. Extraction of these metabolites from plant preparations is known to be influenced by solvent polarity, as also observed in the present study. Results indicate that ethanol, a less polar solvent than water, was a more effective extractant for phenolic compounds recovery from the 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> leaves. Some earlier reports indicated similar pattern, in which ethanol extracts contained higher phenolics and lower flavonoids when compared with water extracts [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This could be due to the solubility difference of various heterogeneous structures of phenolic and flavonoid compounds in each extract. More specifically, several phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs), which were identified by the LC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis (part 3.4, 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), were abundant in polyphenolic structures, such as isoacteoside, forsythoside A and B, lavandulifolioside, scroside E, and campneoside I. PhGs were known to be soluble in polar solvents (water) due to their glycoside substituents. Furthermore, the LC-QTOF-MS/MS also identified diosmin, a flavon glycoside. It is also worth pointing that a significant amount of phenolics and flavonoids present in the water extract suggests its application in domestic context.
