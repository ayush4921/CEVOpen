<p>This study demonstrated that 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> leaves are inhibitors of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase. This observation is in agreement with our previous study, in which it was shown that water extract inhibited 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase in a competitive mode [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On a previous report, the leaves of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> have been reported to have hypoglycemic activity using animal model [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The present study indicates that the antidiabetic effect is probably mediated by its inhibition effect on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase. Previous study on 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> using water extract has demonstrated close association between 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitory effect and total phenolic contents in the water extract [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. PhGs, such as isoacteoside which was identified in our extract by mass spectrophotometry analysis, were previously reported to have hypoglycemic activity through its action on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, isoacteoside was also shown to be able to inhibit the formation of AGE, which is a substance that can induce insulin resistance in adipocytes, hepatocytes, and muscle cells in mouse [
