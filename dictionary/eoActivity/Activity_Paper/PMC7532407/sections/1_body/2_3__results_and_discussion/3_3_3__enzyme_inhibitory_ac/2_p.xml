<p>Both extracts were actively inhibited 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, with inhibition percentages linearly correlated with concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>). However, significant difference in inhibition activity was observed between EEPS and WEPS (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of EEPS and WEPS was 151.91 ± 4.80 and 558.15 ± 13.04 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, indicating that EEPS had a stronger inhibition effect on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase than WEPS. In the present study, acarbose was used as a reference, yielding IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 100.38 ± 2.19 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. These results suggest that acarbose had more potent inhibition activity than EEPS and WEPS. Acarbose, a prescribed antidiabetic agent, is known to act through inhibition on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase in a competitive mode, similar to that of WEPS, as previously reported [
