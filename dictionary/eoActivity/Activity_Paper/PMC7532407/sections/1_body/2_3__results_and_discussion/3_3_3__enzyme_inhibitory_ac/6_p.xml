<p>Xanthine oxidase (XO) plays an important role in catalyzing the hydroxylation reaction of hypoxanthine to xanthine and ultimately to uric acid. An elevated level of blood uric acid (hyperuricemia) is pathological since it leads to the formation and deposition of monosodium urate crystal in the joints that causes gouty arthritis. In addition, the catalytic reaction also generates superoxide radicals, which contributes to oxidative stress condition. Lowering serum urate is an important approach in the management of hyperuricemia. Thus, inhibition on XO has become a therapeutic target in the treatment of hyperuricemia. The present study revealed that 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> leaf extracts demonstrated appreciable inhibition activities on XO. Previously, ethanolic wood extract of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> was proven to have antiarthritis activity using animal model [

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, to the extent of our knowledge, this is the first time XO activity of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> leaves was reported. Finding in this study suggests that the leaf extracts of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> are able to decelerate uric acid formation through inhibition on XO, thus can be beneficial in mitigating hyperuricemia and ROS generation. XO activity observed in EEPS and WEPS may be attributed to the phenolic compounds in the extracts, as have been shown by previous studies [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Several PhG compounds have been shown to have hypouricemia activity using hyperuricemic mice induced by potassium oxonate [
