<p>Isoacteoside was the most dominant compound found in EEPS. Isoacteoside is a dihydroxypheynylethyl glycoside, which was also reported to exhibit multiple biological activities. Isoacteoside isolated from 
 <italic>Abeliophyllum distichum</italic> was evidenced to have anti-inflammatory activity, by suppressing the production and expression of proinflammatory cytokines [

 <italic>β</italic> deposition and cytotoxicity by preventing amyloid-
 <italic>β</italic> aggregation, suggesting its therapeutic potential for Alzheimer's diseases [
