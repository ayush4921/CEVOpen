<p>Similar to the other members that belong to the family Lamiaceae, 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> is characterized by its phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs). In fact, the main components identified in EEPS by LS-QTOF-MS/MS (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) are of PhGs derivatives, i.e., isoactoside, forsythoside A and B, lavandulifolioside, scroside E, and campneoside I. Nobilin D is one of the major compounds in EEPS which is not of PhGs. Chromatogram of the LC-QTOF-MS/MS is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The PhGs have been studied for their multiple therapeutic potentials. It could be that PhGs identified in the leaf extract of 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> justify its therapeutic use in folk medicine.
