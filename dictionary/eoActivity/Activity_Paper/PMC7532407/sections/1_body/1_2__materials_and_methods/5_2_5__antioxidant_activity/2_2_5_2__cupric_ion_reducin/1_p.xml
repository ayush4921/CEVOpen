<p>The cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity was determined according to a method described previously [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with some modifications. Extract solution (0.5 mL) was added into a reaction mixture containing CuCl
 <sub>2</sub> (10 mM, 1 mL), neocuproine in ethanol (7.5 mM, 1 mL), and NH
 <sub>4</sub>OAc buffer (1 M, 1 mL, pH 7.00). Water was added to make a final volume of 4.1 mL. After incubating for 30 mins, the absorbance was read at 450 nm. The absorbance was read against blank solution which contained all the solution except for the extract. Trolox (10–320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was used to generate a standard curve. Extract activities were expressed as mg trolox equivalent (mgTE)/gram dried material.
