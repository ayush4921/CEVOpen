<p>The total antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined by a phosphomolybdenum method described previously [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Phosphomolybdenum reagent consisted of ammonium molybdate (4 mM), sulfuric acid (0.6 M), and trisodium phosphate (28 mM). In a capped tube, 3 mL of this reagent was added with a sample solution (0.3 mL). The reaction mixture was incubated in water bath at 95°C for 90 mins. After cooling the samples at room temperature, the absorbance was read at 695 nm. The absorbance of blank solution was read by replacing the sample with water. Trolox (40–1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was used to generate a standard curve. The total antioxidant activity was expressed as mg trolox equivalent (mgTE)/gram dried material.
