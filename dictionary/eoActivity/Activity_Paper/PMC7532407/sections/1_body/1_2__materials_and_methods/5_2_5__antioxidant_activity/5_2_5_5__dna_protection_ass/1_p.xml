<p>Protection against DNA damage by extracts was evaluated using agarose gel electrophoresis as described previously [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] with some modifications. This method was based on the ability of EEPS to protect the supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA from •OH radicals induced by Fenton reaction. The reaction system contained 1 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of plasmid DNA (0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g), 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of FeSO4 (1 mM), 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (1 mM), followed by the addition of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of extract of different concentrations. The final volume was brought to 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>L by the addition of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 10 mM, pH 7.4). The reaction mixture was let to incubate at 37°C for 30 min. Thereafter, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of a loading buffer consisted of glycerol (50%, 
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), EDTA (40 mM), and bromophenol blue (0.05%). The mixture was then loaded on 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL ethidium bromide in Tris/acetate/EDTA gel buffer and electrophoresis was run for 90 min (80 V) on an electrophoresis instrument (the Gel Doc Azure). The plasmid DNA was visualised and photographed under ultraviolet light. Densitometric analysis was carried out for the quantification of recovery percentage using the ImageJ software (version 52, java 8).
