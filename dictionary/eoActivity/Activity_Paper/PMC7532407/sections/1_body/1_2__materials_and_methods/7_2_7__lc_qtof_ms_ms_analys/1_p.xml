<p>EEPS was subjected to an LC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA), coupled with an MS/MS detector of XEVO G2-S QTOF model. The chromatographic separation was carried out using a C18 column. The eluent gradient was consisted of mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic acid in water). The solvent flow rate was maintained at 0.6 mL/min at 40°C. A QTOF mass spectrophotometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used to perform the MS analysis, using positive and negative modes. The MS conditions were as follows. The acquisition range was 50 to 1200 Da, and the source temperature was 120°C. The capillary voltage was at 2.0 kV, and cone voltage at 40 V. The collision energy varied between 15 and 40 V. The desolvation gas flow was maintained at 1000 L/h, and the desolvation temperature at 550°C.</p>
