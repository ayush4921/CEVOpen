<p>Inhibition activity of the extracts on protease was determined using a modified method described previously [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], using azocasein as a substrate and protease. The reaction mixture consisted of azocasein (5 mg/mL, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L), protease (0.08 U/mL, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L), and extracts of various concentrations (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L), and the mixture was incubated for 90 mins at 37°C. Thereafter, TCA (5% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, 400 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added, and the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 mins. The supernatant was added with NaOH (0.56 M, 700 
 <italic>μ</italic>L). The absorbance was read at 442 nm. Sodium diclofenac was used as a positive control, and buffer solution was used as a negative control. The percentage of inhibitions was calculated by the following formula:
