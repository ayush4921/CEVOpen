<p>The inhibition activity of the extracts on 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase was determined according to the method described previously [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with some modifications. Extract of different concentrations (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was mixed 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of phosphate buffer pH 6.9 (200 mM, with 6 mM NaCl) and pancreatic porcine 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase (0.5 mg/mL, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L). The reaction mixture was preincubated at 37°C for 5 mins. To start the reaction, 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of starch solution (1%, 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic> in phosphate buffer) was added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated for 10 mins. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of dinitrosalicylic acid color reagent. The test tubes were then incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 mins and diluted with water (14 mL). The absorbance was read at 540 nm. The absorbance of blank solution was read by replacing the enzyme with phosphate buffer. The percentage of inhibitions was calculated using the following equation:
