<p>Inhibition activities on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase by the extracts and acarbose (a positive control) were determined according to a reported method [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], using 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase from 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (EC 3.2.2.20) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenyl-
 <italic>α</italic>-D-glucopyranoside (
 <italic>p</italic>NPG) as a substrate. In brief, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sample solution of different concentrations was mixed with phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (50 mM, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L). A solution of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase solution (0.5 U/mL, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added, and the reaction mixture was preincubated at 37°C for 5 mins. To start the reaction, 
 <italic>p</italic>NPG (1 mM, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) was added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated at 37°C for 20 mins. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (100 mM, 750 
 <italic>μ</italic>L), and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. Acarbose was used as a positive control. The percentage of inhibitions were calculated by the following formula:
