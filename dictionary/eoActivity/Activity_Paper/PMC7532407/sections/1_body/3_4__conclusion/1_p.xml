<p>Taking all the above findings into consideration, we can come to the conclusion that EEPS and WEPS exhibited appreciable range of activities on antioxidant and inhibition on 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. Both were not strong inhibitor for xanthine oxidase and protease. Therefore, EEPS and WEPS can be explored as a potential source of bioactive compounds for preventing metabolic syndromes. Phenylethanoid and flavone glycoside derivatives, which have various beneficial functions in health care, are the most detected compounds in ethanol extract from 
 <italic>P. serratifolia</italic> leaves.
