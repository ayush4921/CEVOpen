<p>López-Cobo et al. and Jakovljević et al. showed that water, ethanol in different concentrations 30%, 50%, 70%, and methanol extracted phenolic acids and flavonoids in the form of aglycons and glycosides. Moreover, the extent of the extraction depends on a solvent, its concentration, temperature, nature of a phenolic compound [
