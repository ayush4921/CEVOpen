<p>Literature data showed the discrepancies in the chemical composition of essential oils of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic>. According to the different published data, essential oil of 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> consists mainly of carvacrol (up to 0.1–83.40%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (0.66–41.4%), thymol (0.15–46%), linalool (0.1–50.42%), and other monoterpenoids, as well as sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes [

 <italic>S. montana</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>variegata</italic> and subsp. 
 <italic>montana</italic> analyzed by GC-MS spectrometry showed the domination of carvacrol (22.5%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (17.6%), and thymol (17,4%) in the first subspecies, and carvacrol (61.9%), 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (9,9%) and γ-terpinene (8.2%) in the second subspecies [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For example, Mihajilov-Krstev et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] stated that the content of the major aromatic phenol compounds (thymol and carvacrol) significantly decreased with the increase in the altitude of growing. It was 24.69% and 2.46% for an altitude of 100 m, 2.46% and 24.46% for an altitude of 500 m and 0% for an altitude of 800 m, respectively, for thymol and carvacrol. The aerial parts of wild growing 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> ssp 
 <italic>montana</italic> were collected during the flowering stage from the three localities in Montenegro differed in the altitude of their growing [
