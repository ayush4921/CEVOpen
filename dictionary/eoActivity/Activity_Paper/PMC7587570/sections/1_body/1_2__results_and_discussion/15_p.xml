<p>Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and HPLC chromatograms could be considered as marker fingerprints that can identify a species and distinguish related species of plants [

Moreover, according to the Guideline on specifications: test procedures and acceptance criteria for herbal substances, herbal preparations and herbal medicinal products/traditional herbal medicinal products, if the use of a non-specific assay is justified, other supporting analytical procedures should be used to achieve overall specificity, namely if a UV/VIS spectrophotometric assay is used, a combination of this assay and a suitable test for identification (e.g., fingerprint chromatography) can be used [

TLC has some privileges and among them are a presentation of results as a picture-like image; a lot of samples can be compared side by side; all samples are analyzed under the same conditions on the same plate, which is impossible to perform in case of a sequential mode of HPLC. Fast results are obtained as a lot of samples are analyzed at the same time that leads to solvent savings. However, one of the greatest drawbacks of TLC-based effect-directed analysis is its rather low separation capacity compared to HPLC. The observed bands can be a mixture of different compounds [

 <sub>3</sub> and distinguish related species.
