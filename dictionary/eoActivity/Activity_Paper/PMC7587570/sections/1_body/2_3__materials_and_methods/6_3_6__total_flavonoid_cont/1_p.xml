<p>TFC was determined using the slightly modified analytical procedures of differential spectrometry provided by A. Meda et al. for the estimation of the TFC in honey [

 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-04763" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Rutin trihydrate was used to build the calibration curve in the concentration range of 20 to 100 mg/L. Rutin trihydrate dissolution in 50% ethanol was carried out with the aid of ultrasound. The results were expressed as rutin equivalents: mg eq-rutin/L of a tincture and mg eq-rutin/g of the
