<p>The volatile compounds of the 
 <italic>S. montana</italic> L. herb were identified by comparing the mass spectra data with spectrometer database of the NIST 11 Library and by comparison of their retention index calculated against 
 <italic>n</italic>-alkanes (C
 <sub>9</sub>–C
 <sub>20</sub>). Each chromatographic analysis was repeated three times. The average value of the relative composition of the essential oil percentage was calculated from the peak areas. The Hewlett Packard HP 6890 series GC system chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, WALDBRONN, Germany) was used for the study, which was coupled with the Hewlett Packard 5973 mass selective detector (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany). The chromatograph was equipped with the non-polar, high-temperature ZB-5HT (5% diphenyl- and 95% dimethylpolysiloxane) capillary column of length of 30 m, inner diameter of 0.32 mm, film thickness of 0.25 μm (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). The gas chromatograph was equipped with a split injector; the split ratio was 20:1 and 1 μm of a sample was introduced. Helium served as the carrier gas, and its flow rate was 2 mL/min. Analyses were performed at the temperature range of 40–280 °C and the heating rate was 10 °C/min. Injector temperature was 250 °C.
