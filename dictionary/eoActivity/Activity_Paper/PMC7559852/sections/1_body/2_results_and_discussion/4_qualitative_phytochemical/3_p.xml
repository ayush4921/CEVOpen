 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> presents the qualitative phytochemical screening of olive leaves, guava leaves, fig leaves pomegranate leaves and peels crude juices. It is of concern to notice that the pomegranate peels crude juice included high quantities of phenols, flavonoids, anthocyanins, alkaloids, coumarins and triterpenoids than that of pomegranate leaves, fig leaves, guava leaves and olive leaves crude juices. On the other hand, the leaves of pomegranate, fig, guava and olive contained nearly similar quantities of phenolic compounds, flavonoids and alkaloids. In addition, glycosides quantity of pomegranate leaves was higher than that of pomegranate peels, fig leaves, guava leaves and olive leaves whilst, coumarins quantity of pomegranate peels and olive leaves was nearly equal.
