 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the current study, the interior plant sap was acquired by mechanical pressing in absence of solvents. One has to mention that the plant parts are secure naturalistic organs and gained from yearly pruning of the plants under study. It is quite renowned that several solvents may lead to mischievous impacts on the mankind health [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Accordingly, the main aim of the present study was to get the inner sap of the plant in its native form. Further step is concentrated on the components of pomegranate leaves and peels, fig leaves, guava leaves and olive leaves crude juices accountable for the free-radical scavenging ability. Therefore, HPLC was used to study the phenolic constituents qualitatively and quantitatively.
