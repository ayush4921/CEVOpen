<p id="par0305">Bustamante et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reported that pomegranate peels extract of Wonderful cultivar from Chile exhibited antioxidant activity of 99.4 μg trolox equivalent (TE)/g under ideal conditions of extraction. Kaur et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] mentioned that the highest antioxidant activity assessed by DPPH method was recorded in red fruits (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 70.33 μg/mL) while the lowest in leaves (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 120.78 μg/mL). Also, the maximum antioxidant activity by ferric reducing power assay was in red fruits while the lowest antioxidant phenomenon was recorded in leaves (310.99 ± 0.98 μmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g and 69.99 ± 0.45 μmol Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>/g dry matter, respectively).
