<p id="par0315">It appears from the results of the present study that there is a correlation between the antioxidant adequacy and the chemical structure of phenolic compounds. The evidence for this compositional requirement is supported by Bendary et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] who mentioned that phenolic components are perfect electron donors due to the ability of their hydroxyl groups to participate to antioxidant process. In this context, Benjakul et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] reported that the differences in chemical structures and numeral of the hydroxyl groups in phenolic components contribute to the diversity in their antioxidant activity. It is worth mentioning that Derakhshan et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] mentioned that there is a significant positive relation between antioxidant ability and total phenols and that confirms the findings of the present study which indicated that pomegranate peels crude juice contained high quantities of total phenols possessed the highest antioxidant activity assessed by the aforementioned methods in comparison with other crude juices under study.
