<p id="par0335">The present work was focused on evaluating the resultant crude juices from the mechanical pressing of some agricultural and food industries by-products i.e., pomegranate leaves and peels, fig leaves, guava leaves and olive leaves as a source of naturalistic antioxidants. In general, HPLC, data showed that the crude juices of pomegranate leaves and peels, fig leaves, guava leaves and olive leaves under study contained high amounts of bioactive compounds. Pomegranate peels crude juice contained high amounts of phenols, flavonoids, tannins and anthocyanins, also, exhibited the strong antioxidant potential. In this context, pomegranate peels crude juice is a valuable source of health-promoting compounds, fulfilling concurrently the promising antioxidant activity that can be utilized virtually as food complements, to tardiness lipid oxidization and healing from particular ailments via its free-radicals scavenging ability. It would be interesting to conduct more researches to inspect the role of bioactive components which responsible for these activities. Hence, more studies are necessary to estimate the antioxidant, anticancer and antimicrobial efficiencies of their individual purified fractions.</p>
