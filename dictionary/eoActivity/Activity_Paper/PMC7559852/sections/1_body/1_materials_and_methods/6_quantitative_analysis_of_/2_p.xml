<p id="par0060">Polyphenolic constituents of pomegranate peels and leaves, fig leaves, guava leaves and olive leaves crude juices were distinguished by HPLC-UV system with a reversed phase column Eclipse Plus-C18 (250 × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 μm particle size (Agilent 1260 series, USA) and UV detector set at 280 nm (Hewlett- Packard, Pale Alto, A). Elution was carried out by mobile phase composed of water (solvent A) and trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (0.1 %, v⁄v as solvent B), at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The mobile phase was programmed consecutively in a linear gradient as follows: 0–5 min (80 % A); 5−8 min (40 % A); 8−12 min (50 % A); 12−14 min (80 % A) and 14−16 min (80 % A). The column temperature was maintained at 35 °C and polyphenols were assessed quantitatively at a wavelength of 280 nm by the authentic substances, i.e., ellagic acid, gallic acid, caffeic acid, vanillin, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, syringic acid, rutin, catechin, naringenin, cinnamic acid, methyl gallate, kaempferol, quercetin, taxifolin, procatechol and coumaric acid.</p>
