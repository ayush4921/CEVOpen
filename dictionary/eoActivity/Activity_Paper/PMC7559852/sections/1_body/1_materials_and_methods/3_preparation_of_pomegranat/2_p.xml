<p id="par0045">Leaves of fig, guava, olive and pomegranate and peels of ripe pomegranate fruits were manually peeled and washed to remove the unwanted materials to ensure that the peels and leaves were cleaned before proceeding to the next step. The seeds were removed. The peels and leaves of botanical parts (1 kg) were mechanically pressed by a Carver hydraulic laboratory press (Carver model C S/N 37000- 156; Fred S. Carver Inc, Menomonee Falls, WI, USA, raise force 10 tons/inch
 <sup>2</sup>, capacity 1 kg) to obtain the crude juices (amounts of resultant crude juices were varied according to the botanical parts under study). Freeze- dryer (Labconco Corporation, Kansas City, M.O. USA) was used to concentrate the resultant crude juices then preserved in brown bottles at −5 °C till use.
