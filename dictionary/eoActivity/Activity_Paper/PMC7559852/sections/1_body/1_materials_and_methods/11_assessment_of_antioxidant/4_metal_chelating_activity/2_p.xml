<p id="par0130">The chelating activities of pomegranate leaves and peels, fig leaves, guava leaves and olive leaves crude juices were determined following the method described by Oche et al. [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The absorbance at 510 nm was recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UVmini-1240, Japan). Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was utilized as a standard. The chelating ability was calculated as % chelation using the next equation:
