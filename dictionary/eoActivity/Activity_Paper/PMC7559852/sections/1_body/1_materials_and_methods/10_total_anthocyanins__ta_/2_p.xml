<p id="par0085">The TA was estimated by pH differential technique utilizing duo buffer systems, i.e., potassium chloride buffer (pH 1.0, 0.025 M) and sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5, 0.4 M) as described by Rios-Corripio and Guerrero-Beltran [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Absorbance (A) was calculated as follows:
 <disp-formula id="eq0005">A= [(A 
  <sub>510 nm</sub> –A 
  <sub>700 nm</sub>) of pH 
  <sub>1.0</sub> - (A 
  <sub>510 nm</sub> – A 
  <sub>700 nm</sub>) of pH 
  <sub>4.5</sub>].
