  <p>A 96-well plate for haemolysis of sheep erythrocytes exposed to 
   <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> crude (total) and hexane extract. The negative control (âˆ’ve control) was a measure of spontaneous haemolysis and contained centrifuged erythrocyte suspension in PBS from which an aliquot of the supernatant was withdrawn and mixed with Drabkin's reagent. The positive control (+ve control) contained uncentrifuged erythrocytes in PBS from which an aliquot was withdrawn and mixed with Drabkin's reagent to give 100% haemolysis.
