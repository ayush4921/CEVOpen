<p>Murine cells of a volume of 100 
 <italic>µ</italic>l were mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue staining dye and counted manually using a haemocytometer counting chamber under a Celestron digital light microscope to determine the number of viable cells. The cells were plated onto 96-well plates and incubated with the extracts of concentrations 6.3, 12.5, 25, and 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/ml for 48 h at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. The negative control contained cells and RPMI complete media only, and positive control contained cells, RPMI complete media, and daunorubicin, an anticancer drug. RPMI complete medium (in a 500 ml bottle) was made by mixing the following: 89% RPMI medium, 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% PNS, a cocktail of antibiotics comprising penicillin, neomycin, and streptomycin. After the 48 h incubation, 25 
 <italic>µ</italic>l of MTT was added to each well and plates were incubated for 4 hours. A volume of 50 
 <italic>µ</italic>l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added and absorbance was measured at 590 nm using a Tecan Genios-Pro microplate reader (Tecan Group Ltd, Mӓnnedorf, Switzerland).
