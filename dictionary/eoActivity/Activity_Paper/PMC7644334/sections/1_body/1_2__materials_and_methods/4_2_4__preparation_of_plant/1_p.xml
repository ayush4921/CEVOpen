 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> powdered leaves were used in total extraction process, using dichloromethane: methanol as cosolvents in equal ratio (50 : 50). Serial exhaustive extraction included the use of seven solvents of different polarities to obtain seven extracts. The sample to solvent ratio was 1 : 5. The solvents used for serial exhaustive extraction were beginning with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, acetone, ethanol, methanol, and ending with water. Extraction was carried out for 24 h on a magnetic stirrer at moderate speed. After extraction, the mixture was filtered first with cotton wool followed by the use of Whatman No. 1 filter paper (Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals, Steinheim, Germany), and the filtrate was left to dry in centrifuge tubes. The residue from one stage of serial exhaustive extraction was dried and resuspended in the next solvent, and extraction procedure was repeated until the last solvent has been used. The dried extracts were physically examined, labelled, and stored at 4 C.
