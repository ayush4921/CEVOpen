 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> fresh leaves were collected from Centenary (latitude: 16°48′00″S, longitude: 31°07′00″E and elevation above sea level is 1156 m) in the Mashonaland Central Province of Zimbabwe. Mr. Christopher Chapano, a taxonomist at the National Herbarium and Botanical Gardens (Harare, Zimbabwe), authenticated the identity of the plant. A voucher reference specimen (C6E7) was kept at the Biomolecular Interactions Analyses (BIA) Laboratory, in the Department of Biochemistry, at the University of Zimbabwe. The leaves were air-dried and ground using a pestle and mortar. The resulting leaf powder was stored in closed, labelled containers at room temperature.
