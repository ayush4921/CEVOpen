<p>Haemolysis of erythrocytes appears to result from saponin ability to form complexes with cell membrane cholesterol, resulting in pore formation, increased cell permeability, and alterations in the negatively charged carbohydrate portions on the cell surface [

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Saponins initially penetrate easily into the lipid bilayer and accumulate in the lipid raft microdomain. Lipid rafts are microspheres within cell membranes that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Saponins then bind to cholesterol in the lipid membrane and block cholesterol from interacting with sphingomyelin. Binding of saponins to cholesterol affects the delicate effect of sterols as membrane stabilizers. The saponin-cholesterol micelles destabilise the structure of the lipid raft and disrupt the lipid bilayer, which eventually leads to the haemolysis of the erythrocytes [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, the higher the concentrations of saponins within the extract, the higher the haemolytic activity observed.
