<p>Assessment parameters include inhibition of cell proliferation, cell viability indicators, and morphologic and intracellular differentiation markers [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In conducting cytotoxicity, it is important to consider factors such as cell culture systems and methods which affect test outcomes. For instance, some cell types may not be compatible with the solvent used to prepare the test solutions. Many plant extracts and compounds are nonpolar and prepared as solutions in dimethyl sulfoxide before cytotoxicity testing. DMSO has been reported to be cytotoxic at certain concentrations, and this effect varies between cell types. Therefore, it is often necessary to predetermine the maximum tolerable solvent concentration in cytotoxicity assays especially during validatory stages, and control using the carrier solvent alone must be used in the cytotoxicity testing [
