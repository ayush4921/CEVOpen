<p>The most abundant cells in the human body are the erythrocytes, which own many biological and morphological characteristics; hence, they have been widely exploited in drug transport and biocompatibility studies [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The erythrocyte model has been widely used as it presents a direct indication of toxicity of injectable formulations as well as a general indication of membrane toxicity. Another advantage of erythrocytes model is that blood is readily available and that cells are easy to isolate from the blood; moreover, its membrane has similarities with other cell membranes [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Many plants contain chemical substances that might have a haemolytic or antihaemolytic effect on erythrocytes. Studies have indicated that the membranes of human erythrocytes from blood types have varying stability as determined from the mean corpuscular fragility. Plant extracts can positively affect the red cell membrane and many plants have serious adverse effects, which include induction of haemolytic anaemia [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The ability of the plant extracts to lyse red blood cells at varying degrees could be attributed to the presence of different types of saponins where different saponins show different levels of haemolytic activity [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> water extract had the highest haemolytic activity among all solvent extracts, and the saponin fraction had the highest haemolytic activity among all the extracts and phytochemical-enriched fractions tested.
