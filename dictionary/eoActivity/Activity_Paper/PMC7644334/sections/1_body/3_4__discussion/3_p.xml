<p>Water is the most polar solvent compared to all the other solvents used, and its extraction spectrum contains the most polar biomolecules such as carbohydrates and other saponins that are not well extracted by other polar solvents such as methanol and ethanol [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Saponins are a structurally diverse family of plant secondary metabolites that possess the ability to haemolyse erythrocytes. Since saponins are polar compounds, the extraction methods use water, aqueous methanol or ethanol, absolute ethanol, methanol, or
