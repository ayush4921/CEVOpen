 <italic>P. curatellifolia</italic> extracts did not show cytotoxicity towards the mouse lymphocytes. The water extract showed significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) proliferative potential towards the peritoneal cells, and this could be attributed to the presence of several biomolecules within the water extract. The water extract is known to extract compounds such as anthocyanins, starch, polypeptides, saponins, terpenoids, and lectins, which increase T-cell and B-cell proliferation [

 <italic>α</italic> and IL-6 secretion, TLR2 and TLR4 expression, and increase macrophage phagocytic ability through NO and hydrogen peroxide release [
