 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], some plants may be toxic to humans. For example, some of the toxicities related to the use of medicinal plants include allergic reactions, irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, destruction of red blood cells, and injury to vital body organs such as the heart, liver, kidney, and carcinogenicity [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Most important causes of medicinal herb toxicity are the presence of toxic phytochemicals in the medicinal plant, improper identification or verification of herbals, and inappropriate or mislabelling of the plant material. Other causes are contamination of herbals with microorganisms, fungal toxins such as aflatoxins, and interactions with standard drugs upon simultaneous ingestion [
