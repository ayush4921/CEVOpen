 <p>7-Isopentenyloxycoumarin is among the most widespread naturally occurring prenyloxy umbelliferone derivatives. This secondary metabolite of mixed biosynthetic origin has been typically isolated from plants belonging to several genera of the Rutaceae and Apiaceae families, comprising widely used medicinal plants and in general plants with beneficial effects on human welfare, as well as edible fruits and vegetables. Although known for quite a long time (more than 50 years), only in the last two decades has this natural compound been revealed to exert powerful and promising pharmacological properties, such as active cancer chemopreventive, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antioxidant properties, among the activities best outlined in the recent literature. The aim of this comprehensive miniature review article is to detail the novel natural sources and the effects described during the last decade for 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin and what has been reported on the mechanisms of action underlying the observed biological activities of this oxyprenylated secondary metabolite. In view of the herein described data, suggestions on how to address future research on the abovementioned natural product and structurally related derivatives in the best ways according to the authors will be also provided.</p>
