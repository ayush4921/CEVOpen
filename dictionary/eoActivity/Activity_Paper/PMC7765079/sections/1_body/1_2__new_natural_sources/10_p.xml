<p>In the same year, Ferrone and coworkers tested the capacity of deep eutectic solvent dispersive liquid–liquid micro-extraction (DES-DLLME) as a novel and alternative extraction procedure for oxyprenylated secondary metabolites using edible oils (e.g., olive, soy, peanuts, corn, and sunflower) as the matrices [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Among the four ionic liquids employed in the course of this investigation, namely glycolic acid/trimethylglicyne, 2-furoic acid/trimethylglicyne, 
 <italic>S</italic>-(+)-mandelic acid/trimethylglicyne, and phenylacetic acid/trimethylglicyne, the latter showed the best performance in terms of higher recoveries and enrichment factor and was thus selected to further perform extractions for the UHPLC/PDA quantification of 7-isopentenyloxyxcoumarin in the oils cited above. This secondary metabolite was detected in all matrices except for sunflower oil. Concentration values were 1.82 μg/mL, 12.92 μg/mL, 1.20 μg/mL, and 2.73 μg/mL for olive, soy, peanuts, and corn oils, respectively. Although parent umbelliferone was recorded as the most abundant coumarin, the findings described in the manuscript by Ferrone and coworkers clearly indicate how prenylation should be considered as an effective metabolic step for the biosynthetic schemes of plants from which the respective oils are obtained, and represents the first example of isolation of the title active principle from plants belonging to the Oleaceae and Poaceae families.
