<p>Like several other oxyprenylated coumarins, 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin has also been found in a very restricted number of plant families, namely Apiaceae, Asteraceae, and Rutaceae, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Its biosynthetic pathway, one of the very few for oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids characterized until now, was discovered in cell suspension cultures of 
 <italic>Ammi majus</italic> L. (Apiaceae) by Hamerski and coworkers in 1990 [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin is obtained by the coupling reaction between umbelliferone and dimethyallyl diphosphate catalyzed by an enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum of plant cells, named dimethylallyl diphosphate umbelliferone transferase (DDU-7 transferase E.C. 2.5.1) (
