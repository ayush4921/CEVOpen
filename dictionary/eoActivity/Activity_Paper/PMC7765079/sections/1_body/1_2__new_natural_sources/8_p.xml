<p>In the same year, Lee and coworkers characterized the presence of 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin in five 
 <italic>Isocoma</italic> spp. (Asteraceae) native to southwestern United Stated and northern Mexico, namely 
 <italic>Isocoma pluriflora</italic> (Torr. and A. Gray) Greene, commonly known as “southern goldenbush”, 
 <italic>Isocoma tenuisecta</italic> Greene, “burrow goldenweed”, 
 <italic>Isocoma azteca</italic> G. L. Nesom, “aztech goldenbush”, 
 <italic>Isocoma acradenia</italic> (Greene) Greene, “alkali goldenbush”, and finally 
 <italic>Isocoma rusbyi</italic> Greene, “Rusby’s goldenbush”. All these plants are poisonous and cause trembles in livestock, although it may be that such a toxicity does not relate to the presence of the title compound. 7-Isopentenyloxycoumarin was detected in amounts ranging from 0.07 µg/mg of dry extract to 1.1 µg/mg and was not found in 
 <italic>I. pluriflora</italic> and 
 <italic>I. azteca</italic> [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, for the 
 <italic>Isocoma</italic> genus, the one described by Lee and coworkers is the first report on the isolation and structural characterization of an oxyprenylated coumarin.
