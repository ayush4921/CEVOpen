<p>The most recent articles in the literature concern the application of a novel extraction procedure based on the use of subcritical butane. Although this method was applied to already known sources of 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin like 
 <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> L. (Rutaceae) [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 
 <italic>Artemisia vulgaris</italic> (Asteraceae) [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], both reports illustrate the great potential for the future of subcritical butane as an extraction solvent. In the case of grapefruit seeds, quantities determined for 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin (234.00 Âµg/g of dry extract) were higher than those obtained by any other extraction methodologies employed so far.
