<p>The same research group adopted a similar approach in comparing several extraction methodologies of the above cited prenylated and unprenylated phytochemicals in analyzing by HPLC the chemical composition of three plants belonging to the Apiaceae family, namely dill (
 <italic>Anethum graveolens</italic> L.), anise (
 <italic>Pimpinella anisum</italic> L.), and wild celery (
 <italic>Angelica archangelica</italic> L.), which all represent notable examples of food and medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this case Taddeo and coworkers revealed how 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin was not part of the secondary metabolite pool of 
 <italic>A. graveolens</italic>, and was detected in very small amounts in extracts from 
 <italic>P. anisum</italic> (3.34 µg/g and 1.08 µg/g of dry extract after maceration with water containing β-CD 1.5% 
 <italic>w/w</italic> and ultrasonication using this same mixture). It was by far most abundant in 
 <italic>A. archangelica</italic>, reaching the best values after maceration (204.76 µg/g) and ultrasonication (177.60 µg/g) in ethanol.
