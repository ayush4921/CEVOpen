<p>The interest in the characterization of 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin in edible and medicinal plants greatly increased over the next three years. In 2018 the content of this secondary metabolite in oils used as food or as beneficial remedies was reported. In the first manuscript, Scotti and coworkers set up an efficient extraction procedure for tea tree oil (TTO), the well-known and fashionable essential oil obtained by the stem distillation of leaves and branches of 
 <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> (Maiden and Betch) Cheel, a plant native to Australia and belonging to the Myrtaceae family [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An experimental procedure, with the aim of separatingin the solid phase the highest quantities of oxyprenylated phenylpropanoids including 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin, was applied. Such a procedure consisted of the partition of TTO between a saturated NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> aqueous solution and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, followed by its adsorption on solid matrices represented by silica gel(pre-treated with Et
 <sub>3</sub>N) and alumina (Brockmann activity II). The latter, coupled to desorption with CH
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>, proved to be the most efficient process and provided 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin in a concentration of 44.03 µg/g of TTO, more than 2-fold in respect to the “classic” overnight maceration in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane. It is also noteworthy that the methodology set up by Scotti and coworkers also allowed a complete deterpenation of TTO leading to a selective extraction of oxyprenylated secondary metabolites. Furthermore, in this case, the experiment just described is the first example in the literature of the presence of 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin in a species belonging to the Myrtaceae family.
