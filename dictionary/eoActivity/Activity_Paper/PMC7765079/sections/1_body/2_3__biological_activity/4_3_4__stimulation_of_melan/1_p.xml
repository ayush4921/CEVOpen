<p>The last reports on the biological activity of 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin were in 2018 and 2019 by Fiorito and coworkers. The effects of this coumarin on the overall melanogenetic process in cultured Melan-a melanocytes were investigated [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05923" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On these cells, 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin showed no effect on cell viability even at high concentrations. At a dose of 40 μM, it showed a marked induction of melanin biosynthesis. This effect was later seen to be dose- and time-dependent with the highest values recorded after 72 h treatment (6-fold increase in respect to controls). Trying to depict a putative mechanism of action underlying the observed tanning activity, Fiorito and coworkers also showed that 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin was able to induce tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 as well as microphthalmia-associated transcription factors. More interestingly, this coumarin was seen to tightly interact with the estrogen receptor β (ER-β) as an effective agonist. Thus, it was hypothesized that the massive increase in melanin biosynthesis could be mediated by the strong activation of this receptor. As a confirmation, the effect of pre-treatment of Melan-a cells with the ER-β antagonist Faslodex
 <sup>®</sup> 1 μM was abolished by 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin, which induced a 2-fold increase in melanin biosynthesis in the same cell line with respect to controls. Furthermore, an involvement of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor could be hypothesized [
