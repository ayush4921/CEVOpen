<p>Digestible starch, which is the principal source of carbohydrates and accounts for 40â€“60% of the energy intake in the human diet, gives rise to a prolonged release of glucose moieties in the lumen of the small intestine, which are subsequently absorbed into the bloodstream, causing increased postprandial glycemia [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As glucose makes up 80% of the total absorbable monosaccharides, high blood levels trigger cells in the pancreas to secrete insulin, a hormone that is important for regulating glucose homeostasis [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Insulin then signals adipose tissue to metabolize glucose into triglycerides, and skeletal muscle tissues metabolize it to generate energy; excess glucose is stored in the liver in the form of glycogen [

 <xref rid="B5-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This tight regulatory process continuously maintains glucose homeostasis, even under prolonged fasting. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a condition in which blood hyperglycemia occurs and cannot be controlled due to a lack of insulin activity [

 <xref rid="B8-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; it is caused either by an insulin deficiency (type 1 diabetes) or by insulin resistance (type 2 diabetes) [

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-26-00317" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As 80% of the postprandial glucose is transported into muscles by the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) system, the resistance of muscle to insulin, which is typical in type 2 diabetes, disrupts glucose homeostasis in the whole human body [
