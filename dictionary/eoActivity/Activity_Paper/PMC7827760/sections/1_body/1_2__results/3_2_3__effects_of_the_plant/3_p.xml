<p>The concentrations of the 41 plant extracts were increased, and the impacts on scavenging (antioxidative) activity were assessed using the in vitro 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. This is a reliable assay commonly used for the large-scale screening of plant extract samples for in vitro antioxidant activity. The results show that
