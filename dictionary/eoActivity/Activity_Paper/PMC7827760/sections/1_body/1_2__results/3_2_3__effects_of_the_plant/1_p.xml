<p>The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (or free radicals) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes, resulting in increased oxidative damage at the molecular and cellular levels. Excessive production of ROS in diabetic patients has been targeted with antioxidants in an effort to prevent and suppress the development of oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids within cells and tissues.</p>
