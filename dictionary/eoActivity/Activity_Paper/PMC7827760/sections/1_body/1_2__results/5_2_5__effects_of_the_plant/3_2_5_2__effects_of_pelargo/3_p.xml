<p>Therefore, deficiencies in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells are mostly linked to defects in the insulin signaling pathway and are probably caused by changes in GLUT4 transporter translocation to the cell surface [

 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00317-f007">Figure 7</xref>B), which mobilize normal GLUT4 transporter levels to the cell surface, may be useful in the development of drugs for treating type 2 diabetes. 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract also exhibited increased anti-Î±-amylase, as well as FRSA. This higher activity might be due to the presence of supportive phytochemicals that need to be isolated and chemically identified, after which the biological activity of the individual phytochemicals, along with the mechanisms involved, should be verified.
