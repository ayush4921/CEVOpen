<p>The effects of 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extracts on GLUT4 translocation in L6-GLUT4myc cells were assessed by exposing cells to the extracts at three concentrations that were found to inhibit Î±-amylase and show FRSA. The solvent in which the extract was dissolved was used as a negative control. Insulin was used as a positive control, and solvent without extract was used as a negative control. No effect of the 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. extract on GLUT4 translocation was observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00317-f007">Figure 7</xref>A). In contrast, treatment of cells with 0.5, 1, or 2 mg/mL of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> extract increased the translocation of GLUT4 by 111% (1.11-fold, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), 119% (1.19-fold, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and 139% (1.39-fold, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), respectively, as opposed to the control (with 0% concentration of the extract).
