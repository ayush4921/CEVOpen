<p>The effects of increasing the concentrations of the plant extracts of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00317-f001">Figure 1</xref>B) to inhibit α-amylase activity were assessed, aiming to evaluate the values of EC
 <sub>50</sub> (acarbose at concentration of 1.25 mM was used as a positive control). The EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. and of 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic> were 0.60 and 1.78 mg/mL, respectively. The strong α-amylase inhibitory activity indicates the presence of active compounds that could inhibit the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into oligosaccharides, which could diminish the effects of carbohydrate consumption on postprandial hyperglycemia.
