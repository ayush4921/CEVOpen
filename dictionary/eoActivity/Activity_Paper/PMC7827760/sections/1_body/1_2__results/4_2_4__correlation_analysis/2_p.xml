<p>Rules-based analysis using Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) scores and enrichment factors as criteria for the evaluation of the efficiency of the model revealed that plant extracts with a free radical-scavenging EC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 10 µg/ml showed somewhat better inhibition of α-amylase (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00317-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The values for the enrichment factor, the MCC, accuracy, and precision were 1.7, 0.286, 0.61, and 0.25, respectively. These findings are of great importance for screening projects. Identifying extracts with a 1.7 order of enrichment in inhibiting α-amylase from among plant extracts with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of FRSA ≤ 10 µg/mL could save time and money in high-throughput screening. It is worth noting that, taking these results together, we might be deceived and conclude that there is no correlation between the inhibition of α-amylase and the free radical scavenging activities of the screened extracts (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00317-f002">Figure 2</xref>,

 </italic> = 0.0471). For the six most active plant extracts, there was a low correlation, with

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00317-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Five of the six active plant extracts (i.e., 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic>, 
 <italic>Olea europaea, Rhus coriaria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic>) showed relatively high FRSA, while the activity for
