<p>According to the results of the above analysis, there is, to some extent, a correlation between α-amylase inhibition and the FRSA of the tested plant extracts. Plant extracts with FRSA EC
 <sub>50</sub> ≤ 10 μg/mL have a higher chance (a 1.7 order of magnitude) of inhibiting α-amylase enzyme than plant extracts with FRSA EC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 10 μg/mL. This piece of information is significant because it helps to reduce the number of plant extracts that have to be included in subsequent investigational screenings and highlights natural products that have dual antidiabetic and antioxidant properties.
