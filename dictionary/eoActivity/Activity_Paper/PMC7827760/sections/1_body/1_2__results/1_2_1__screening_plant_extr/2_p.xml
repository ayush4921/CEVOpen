<p>Our initial objective was to examine the antidiabetic and antioxidant effects of the extracts of 41 medicinal/edible local plants (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00317-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All methanolic extracts of these plants were screened for α-amylase inhibitory activity at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. Two of the extracts demonstrated high α-amylase inhibitory activity, suggesting antidiabetic activity; these were from 
 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic>, which exhibited 100 and 82% inhibition, respectively. We performed evaluations of the free radical scavenging activity (FRSA) of the extracts in parallel. Of the 41, 
 <italic>Cinnamomum aromaticum</italic> extract showed the lowest EC
 <sub>50</sub> for FRSA, and 
 <italic>Ceratonia siliqua</italic> extract showed the highest (

 <italic>Pelargonium</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Rhus coriaria</italic>, which had a strong inhibitory effect on α-amylase activity, also exhibited high levels of scavenging activity, indicating a dual function.
