<p>FRSA is expressed in terms of the half-maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>), i.e., the amount of antioxidants necessary to decrease the initial DPPH absorbance by 50%. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> value for each plant extract was determined by calculating the value using the equation of the linear part of the graph. Gallic acid (100 Âµg/mL) was used as a positive control.
