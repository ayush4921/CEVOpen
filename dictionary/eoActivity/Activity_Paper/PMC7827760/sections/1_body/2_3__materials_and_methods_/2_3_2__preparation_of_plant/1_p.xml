<p>To produce each extract sample, approximately 1 g of dried plant material was packed in a tube and soaked in methanol (10 mL for each gram of material), sonicated for 75 min at 40 °C, then left for 3 h to cool for complete extraction. The methanolic extracts were then filtered through grade-1 Whatman paper, and the filtered solution was concentrated by evaporation to dryness in a vacuum, dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 100 mg/mL, and stored at 4 °C for future activity testing. </p>
