<p>Brain tissues (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12) were added to nine volumes (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) of pre-cooled distilled water and homogenized with a probe sonicator (Ultrasonic processor VCX-130, Sonics &amp; Materials Inc, Newtown, CT, USA) on ice. Each homogenate was mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold MeOH containing ISs with 1% formic acid, and followed by vortexing and centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were filtered through 0.2 µm GH Polypro (GHP) filter plates (Acro PrepTM, Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and stored at −20 °C until analysis by LC-MS/MS. Thirty-one neurotransmitters representing five different categories were separated by linear gradient elution at 0.2 mL/min using 0.1% formic acid in water (eluent A) and 0.1% formic acid in MeOH (eluent B) according to the following gradient mode: beginning at 0% B from 0 to 0.5 min, increasing to 20% B at 2.5 min, increasing to 90% B at 13.0 min, remaining constant for 13.5 min, and then re-equilibrating to the initial condition over 17.0 min. Chromatographic separation was conducted using a pentafluorophenyl (PFP) column (100 mm × 2.1 mm i.d., 1.9 μm; YMC, JAPAN) with a PFP guard column (2.1 mm × 5 mm i.d., 1.9 µm; YMC) at 40 °C. Injection volume was 3 μL. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode by electrospray positive ionization (ESI+) was used for neurotransmitters quantification. The optimized mass parameters were set as follows: source temperature of 150 °C, desolvation temperature of 550 °C, cone gas flow 150 L/h, desolvation gas flow of 1000 L/h, cone gas flow of 150 L/h, and collision gas flow of 0.15 mL/min.
