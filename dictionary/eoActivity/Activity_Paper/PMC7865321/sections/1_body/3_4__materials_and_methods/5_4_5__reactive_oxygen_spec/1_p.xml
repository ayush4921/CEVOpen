<p>To examine the protective effect of GM-90432 on PTZ-induced ROS generation and zebrafish death, 5 dpf zebrafish larvae were pretreated with 10 ÂµM GM-90432 for 1 h, and then fish were exposed to 5 mM of PTZ for either 1 h (to examine the ROS scavenging effect, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 8) or 24 h (to measure the survival rate, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 10, triplicates).
