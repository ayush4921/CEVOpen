<p>Increasingly, studies have emphasized that oxidative stress is associated with the initiation and progression of epilepsy, and that excessive ROS could be a key factor in seizure-induced neuronal damage [

 <xref rid="B73-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that PTZ is an inducer or ROS, and triggers excessive free radical generation and suppression of the cellular antioxidant defense system, leading to oxidative stress in animal seizure models [

 <xref rid="B75-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Several other studies describe the toxicological relationship between oxidative stress and epilepsy in animals. Brain tissue is very sensitive to excessive free radicals, which can induce neurological disorders including seizures, subsequently leading to neuronal cell death in vitro and in vivo. Our data showed that GM-90432 markedly suppressed ROS generation and increased survival rate in PTZ-induced oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae (
