<p>In the GABAergic ligand, the GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor has historically been the primary target of most anti-epileptic agents. In general, the GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor is known as the predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in the brain. The activation of GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor allows the influx of Cl
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>, which leads to inhibition of neuronal activity. In this study, PTZ, an antagonist of the GABA
 <sub>A</sub> receptor, was used to induce neurotransmitters imbalances in a zebrafish model. PTZ exposure led to increased levels of GABA and GLN, but not of GLU, compared to the control group. PTZ exposure also induced disruption of E/I balance, calculated by GLU/GABA levels, resulting in neural activation in the brain tissue of adult zebrafish compared to the control group. In general, the balance between excitatory GLU and inhibitory GABA neurotransmitters modulates excitatory and inhibitory conductance, affecting seizure activity in brain tissue [

We found here that GM-90432 co-treatment with PTZ clearly attenuated the PTZ-induced accumulation of GABA, leading to restoration of the E/I ratio to a similar level as the control group. This result suggested that the GABAergic modulating effect of GM-90432 may contribute to anti-epileptic mechanisms in zebrafish.
