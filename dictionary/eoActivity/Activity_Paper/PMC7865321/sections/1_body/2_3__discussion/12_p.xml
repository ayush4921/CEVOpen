<p>In this study, we performed neurochemical profiling analysis in brain tissue to better understand the neuroprotective mechanism of GM-90432 against PTZ-induced epileptic seizure in zebrafish. We showed that GM-90432 exerts multiple neuroprotective effects via correction of the expression of a variety of endogenous neurotransmitter and neurosteroid molecules disrupted by PTZ treatment. Furthermore, GM-90432 showed protective effects against PTZ-induced oxidative stress and zebrafish death, suggesting that GM-90432 may exhibit biphasic potential via antioxidant and anti-epileptic activities. Although our study did not elucidate the molecular mechanism of the anti-epileptic effect, our data suggest that GM-90432 exerts this anti-epileptic effect via upregulation of 5-HT, E2, DHT, Prog, 5a-dihydroProg, and Allo-P levels, and downregulation of NM, GABA, and C levels, in addition to the E/I ratio in PTZ-induced epileptic seizure zebrafish model. In addition, our study provides toxicological information about the PTZ-induced disruptions of neurotransmitters and neurosteroid levels in brain tissue, by analyzing the endogenous profiles to establish the epileptic patterns in brain tissue of this animal model. Finally, these neurochemical profiling approaches could be used for new drug development and discovery of anti-seizure agents.</p>
