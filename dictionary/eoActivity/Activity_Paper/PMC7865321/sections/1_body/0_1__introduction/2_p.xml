<p>Neurotransmitters function as chemical messengers that modulate emotion and behavior in animals [

Various neurotransmitter molecules, including dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic neurotransmitters, have been identified in brain tissue. GABAergic transmission is known as a key modulator of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials in the nervous system. As the primary molecular mechanism underlying epileptic seizure is the inhibition of GABAergic signaling via gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA
 <sub>A</sub>) receptors in vivo [

 <xref rid="B8-ijms-22-01285" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling (E/I ratio) is especially important. A variety of anti-seizure drugs (ASDs) have focused on targeting GABA
