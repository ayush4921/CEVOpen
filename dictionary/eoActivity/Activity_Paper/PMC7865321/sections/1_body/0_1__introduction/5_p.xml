<p>Previously, we performed a phenotype-based screening of 6566 small molecules, using the zebrafish model. Among these small molecules, GM-90432 had drug potential as a novel anti-seizure drug (ASD) candidate, as it significantly alleviated seizure-like behavior in genetically- (
 <italic>zc4h2</italic> knockout in zebrafish larvae) or chemically- (PTZ treatment of mouse and zebrafish) induced epileptic seizure models. Furthermore, GM-90432 was bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB)-permeable. The anti-epileptic effect was evaluated using p-ERK levels as a marker of neural activity, electroencephalograms (EEGs) as indicators of seizure-like events, and voltage-gated NA
 <sup>+</sup> channel currents as measurements of neural excitability in zebrafish and hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. However, the underlying anti-epileptic mechanism of GM-90432 remains unclear [
