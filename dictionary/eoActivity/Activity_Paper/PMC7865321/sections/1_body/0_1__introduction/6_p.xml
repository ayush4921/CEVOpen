<p>In the present study, to confirm the protective effect of GM-90432 against neurotoxicity induced by PTZ and the possibility of GM-90432 as an anti-seizure agent, we investigated metabolic alteration of neurotransmitters and neurosteroids induced by GM-90432, PTZ, or PTZ after treatment with GM-90432 in the brains of zebrafish. The levels of the neurotransmitters 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and E/I ratios, and neurosteroids E2, Prog, 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-dihydroProg), and allopregnanolone (Allo-P) reduced upon exposure to PTZ were significantly restored in zebrafish treated with GM-90432 prior to PTZ. We also examined the protective effect of GM-90432 via reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and overall survival in PTZ-induced oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae. While ROS were increased by PTZ, zebrafish larvae treated with GM-90432 prior to exposure to PTZ showed ROS levels similar to controls. These results indicate that GM-90432 exerts neuroprotective effects via improvement of neurotransmitters and neurosteroid imbalance, as well as ROS scavenging activity in a PTZ-induced epileptic seizure model in zebrafish.</p>
