  <p>The enzymatic activity by altered metabolic ratio in brain samples of zebrafish. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Altered metabolic ratio (5α-reductase) of T to DHT in brain samples of zebrafish exposed to GM-90432, PTZ, or PTZ following pretreatment with GM-90432. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Altered metabolic ratio (aromatase) of T to E2 in brain samples of zebrafish exposed to GM-90432, PTZ, or PTZ following pretreatment with GM-90432. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The metabolic pathway of T conversion to DHT or E2. Values represent means ± SEM of 6 samples. Brain samples from 2 individual zebrafish were pooled to form composite samples. Significance between control and exposure groups is indicated by *
