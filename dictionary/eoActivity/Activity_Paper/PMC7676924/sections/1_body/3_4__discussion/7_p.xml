<p>This study had a number of limitations. First, the study was 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and did not reflect the actual therapeutic effect that may arise from variations in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Second, the volatility of the essential oils could have reduced the activity. Third, the chemical composition of the essential was not studied though it has previously been studied. However, this study provides a broader insight for further 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies that would also include specific experiments involving the isolated and identified active components of the essential oil of
