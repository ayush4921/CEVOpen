 </sup>. Ethanolic extracts were obtained by sonication (for 15 min) using 70% ethanol at room temperature. The extraction was repeated twice. The organic solvent was evaporated under the vacuum at 40 °C. The water residue was freeze-dried. Dry extracts were dissolved in mixture of DMSO:water (v/v, 1:1) to prepare 20 mg/mL stock solution.
