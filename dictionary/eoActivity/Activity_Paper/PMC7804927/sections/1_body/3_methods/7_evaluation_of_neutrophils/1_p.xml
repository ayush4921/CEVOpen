 </sup>. After 24 h incubation cells were centrifuged (2000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatants were collected, and cells were washed twice with 500 µL of PBS. Then, the neutrophils were resuspended in binding buffer and suspension was taken to another 96-well plate to obtain a concentration of 0.5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well (4 × dilution). In the next step, the staining solution of Annexin (5 µL/mL) and IP (0.5 µg/mL) in binding buffer was prepared and added to each well. After 15 min incubation at room temperature in darkness the cells were analysed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur) within 1 h after labelling and data from 10,000 events were recorded in the gate. Before each experiment compensation was performed and quadrants have been set. Urolithin at the concentration 5, 10 and 40 µM and roscovitine at 40 μM were used as a positive control—apoptosis inducer. LPS at the concentration of 100 ng/mL was applied as a positive control—prevention of apoptosis.
