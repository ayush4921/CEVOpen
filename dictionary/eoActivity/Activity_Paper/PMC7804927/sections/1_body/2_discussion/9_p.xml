<p id="Par45">The results of conducted studies clearly indicate, that LPS contained in plant extracts interferes with in vitro human primary neutrophils model and can lead to significant disturbances of the obtained results regarding their immunomodulatory activity. These observations indicate the necessity of pyrogens removal whenever the in vitro studies include the addition of plant extracts directly to the cell culture in order to avoid false-negative or false-positive results. Ultrafiltration was shown to be an effective strategy for pyrogens removal, without affecting extract composition, which performance was validated by the LAL test and on native primary neutrophils model. Following the ultrafiltration, the tested extracts did not affect the pro-inflammatory functions of neutrophils.</p>
