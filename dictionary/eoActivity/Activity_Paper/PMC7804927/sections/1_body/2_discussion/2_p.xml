<p id="Par38">The low concentrations of pyrogens, such as lipopolysaccharide, have a less significant meaning in in vivo tests because under physiological conditions of the intact intestinal barrier they are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral ingestion. The situation is different when the plant extract is subjected to in vitro tests, which is usually the first step in its bioactivity evaluation. When the tested extract is directly added to the cell culture, the remaining pyrogens get in the contact with the receptors on the cell surface and can significantly interfere with the examined biochemical processes. The obtained results may be disturbed and inadequately referred to the actual activity of the plant extracts and their constituents leading to false positive or false negative results regarding immunomodulatory effects of the tested preparations. As a result, during the in vitro screening studies, some extracts can be considered as ineffective, despite containing active principles as well as some activities can be mistakenly attributed, what can cause inconsistencies during bioactivity guided fractionation and isolation of active principles. The most significant consequence of pyrogens interference with applied in vitro model is the discontinuation of further studies and oversight of constituents with potential pharmacological activity.</p>
