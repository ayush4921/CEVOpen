<p id="Par39">The present study clearly shows that applied native plant extracts stimulate the production of cytokines in human primary neutrophils in vitro. The conducted LAL test unambiguously indicated the presence of pyrogens, which concentration correlated with the observed induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Extract 
 <bold>5</bold>, as the extract with the highest content of LPS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a) and one of the most strongly stimulating inflammatory response of neutrophils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), was chosen to determine the mechanism standing behind the observed cytokine release stimulation. The experiments using TLR4 agonist confirmed, that the extract contained the LPS, which activated neutrophils in vitro by interaction with this receptor.
