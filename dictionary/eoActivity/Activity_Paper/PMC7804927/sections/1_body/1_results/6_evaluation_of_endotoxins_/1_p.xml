<p id="Par28">To evaluate the content of pyrogenic factors LAL test was conducted for all extracts at the highest applied concentration of 50 μg/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). The lowest LPS content was observed for 
 <bold>3n</bold> 0.02 ± 0.00 EU/mL) and 
 <bold>9n</bold> (0.02 ± 0.00 EU/mL) and slightly higher for 
 <bold>2n</bold>, 
 <bold>4n</bold>, 
 <bold>8n</bold> (0.16 ± 0.01; 0.31 ± 0.03 0.11 ± 0.00 EU/mL). For other extracts 
 <bold>1n</bold>, 
 <bold>5n</bold>–
 <bold>7n</bold>, the value was significantly higher and was 0.86 ± 0.01; 1.05 ± 0.00; 0.79 ± 0.08; 0.90 ± 0.06 EU/mL respectively. The statistical analysis has shown a strong correlation between the content of LPS and the ability of extracts to induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
