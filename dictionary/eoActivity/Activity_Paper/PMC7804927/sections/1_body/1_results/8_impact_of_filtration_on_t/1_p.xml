<p id="Par35">To test whether nanoparticles present in tested extract could be responsible for the induction of inflammatory response of neutrophils, subsequent filtration steps of extract 
 <bold>5</bold> were introduced: 450 nm, 200 nm, 100 nm followed by the ultrafiltration at 30 kDa. Only the ultrafiltration at 30 kDa was capable of removing pyrogenic agents, which confirms that the nanoparticles above 100 nm contained in extract did not contribute to the stimulation of neutrophils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a–c). The conducted LAL test has shown, that only ultrafiltration can result in pyrogens removal, which also excluded the potential interference of nanoparticles with the applied method for LPS determination (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).
