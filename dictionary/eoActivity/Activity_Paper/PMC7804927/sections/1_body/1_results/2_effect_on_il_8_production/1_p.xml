<p id="Par24">All tested extracts were shown to induce IL-8 production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The exceptions were 
 <bold>2n</bold> (at concentration 6.25 μg/mL), 
 <bold>3n</bold> (6.25–25 μg/mL) and 
 <bold>9n</bold> (6.25–50 μg/mL), which had a value comparable the non-stimulated control. Other extracts, at 6.25–12.50 (
 <bold>1n</bold>, 
 <bold>4n</bold>, 
 <bold>5n</bold>, 
 <bold>7n</bold>) or 6.25–25.0 μg/mL (
 <bold>6n</bold>, 
 <bold>8n</bold>) showed IL-8 secretion lower than stimulated control and highest than non-stimulated. The highest values were observed for extracts 
 <bold>1n</bold>, 
 <bold>4n</bold>, 
 <bold>5n</bold> at 25–50 μg/mL, for which cytokine production was higher than for cells treated with LPS (100 ng/mL) (123.6 ± 11.5 and 177.2 ± 16.1% (
 <bold>1n</bold>), 100.0 ± 19.9 and 114.4 ± 15.1% (
 <bold>4n</bold>), 104.6 ± 16.9 and 101.49 ± 17.8% (
 <bold>5n</bold>) respectively). For all extracts except 
 <bold>6n</bold> and 
 <bold>9n</bold>, the stimulation of cytokine production increased with the concentration of the extracts. Urolithin A (a positive control known to be TLR4 signalling inhibitor
