<p id="Par30">To confirm that TLR4 receptor stimulation was responsible for the induction of neutrophil inflammatory response by the tested extracts, LPS-RS—a selective, competitive inhibitor of the TLR4 was used

 </sup>. The pretreatment of the cells with LPS-RS at the concentration of 10 µg/mL almost completely inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS at 100 ng/mL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a–c). LPS-RS was shown in the same manner to prevent the induction of inflammatory response caused by the native extract 
 <bold>5</bold>, what indicates, that the TLR4 stimulation was responsible for its stimulating effect towards neutrophils. Compatible observations were made, when LPS was added to the extract as an internal control. As in previous experiments, ultrafiltration was shown to abolish the pro-inflammatory effect of extract 
 <bold>5</bold>, also when the LPS at 100 ng/mL was added as the internal control before conducting ultrafiltration.
