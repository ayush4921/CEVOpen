<p id="Par27">Ultrafiltration was shown to fully remove the inducing effect of extracts towards the production of IL-8, TNF-α (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d,e). In the case of IL-1β production (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f) extracts 
 <bold>4f.</bold>–
 <bold>8f.</bold> lost their inducing activity due to conducted ultrafiltration. A different situation was observed for 
 <bold>1f.</bold> and 
 <bold>2f.</bold>, for which at concentrations 6.25, 25 and 50 µg/mL slight stimulation of cytokine production (2.4 ± 1.6, 16.6 ± 1.2, 1.9 ± 0.7% for 
 <bold>1f.</bold> and 4.3 ± 2.6, 0.8 ± 0.4, 3.2 ± 1.8% for 
 <bold>2f.</bold>) was determined. Urolithin and rosocovitine did not induce production of any of tested cytokines.
