<p id="Par17">The crucial aspect which so far has not been addressed in the in vitro studies of plant extracts is the possible presence of pyrogenic factors in tested preparations deriving from bacteria residing on raw plant materials. Their interference with in vitro assays, especially targeted on the modulation of the inflammatory response can occur particularly detrimental by leading to false-positive or false-negative results. Bacterial endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide, are the most common pyrogens, which if present even at a very low concentration in tested extracts can potentially interfere with examined inflammation processes leading to disrupted results.</p>
