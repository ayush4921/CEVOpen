The commonly raised limitation of this strategy is the question regarding the bioavailability of plant extract constituents. This drawback can be however addressed if we consider in vitro examination of plant extracts as an initial step before conducting in vivo studies or as a screening strategy which leads to a selection of the most effective extraction procedure and active composition followed by bio-guided fractionation and subsequent isolation of active principles which will be next subjected for further pharmacological evaluations
