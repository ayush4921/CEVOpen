<p id="Par18">The inflammation is a complex process of an immune system response to the pathogenic agents infecting the organism. The aim of the inflammatory response is the prevention and elimination of the infecting agents from the organism, reparation of damaged tissues and prevention of further disease development. Although many factors can trigger the inflammation, the mechanisms of the immune system response are generally common for all of them. The widely applied therapies in diseases with excessive inflammatory response include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which due to the inhibition of COX-2 activity lead to attenuation of the processes orchestrated by immune cells. Despite high efficiency, the use of these drugs is associated with serious adverse effects including damage to the gastric mucosa as well as kidney and liver disorders. The consequence of this limitation is ongoing research on novel agents, which could modulate the inflammatory response in an alternative mechanistic mode, that it will be still effective towards pathogens, but will not cause the significant damage to the host tissues
