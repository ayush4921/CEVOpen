 <p id="Par1">The widely accepted strategy to justify the use of medicinal plant extracts in diseases with inflammatory background is their examination on in vitro models using immune cells. It is also a key initial step of research for active principles, which could be then isolated and tested on more advanced models, becoming new pharmacologically active lead molecules. The crucial aspect which has not been so far addressed in this context, is the presence of pyrogens in plant preparations. The aim of this study was the examination of pyrogens interference with in vitro evaluation of anti-inflammatory activity of plant extracts using human primary neutrophils model together with introduction of effective method of interfering factors elimination. The obtained results showed that chosen plant extracts contained pyrogens, which were responsible for concentration-dependent stimulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines production by human neutrophils in vitro in the same extent as LPS did. The ultrafiltration method was successfully applied for pyrogens elimination, which effectiveness was confirmed using LAL test. The determined interference of pyrogens implies the necessity of their consideration and removal when in vitro studies include direct addition of plant extracts to the cell culture, what can be obtained by ultrafiltration, which does not affect extract composition.</p>
