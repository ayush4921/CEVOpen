<p>Cao et al. [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] designed and synthesized seven propylene glycol-linked amino acid diester prodrugs of OA, which were designed to target peptide transporter 1 (PepT1). The water solubility of compound 1-6b (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is 35.3, 23.4, 12.3, 69.6, 58.2, and 83.2 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively, which is significantly higher than that of OA with poor water solubility. In situ rat single-pass intestinal perfusion model and Caco-2 cell model were used to screen the effective permeability and affinity of the prodrug to PepT1. The results showed that compound 1b and 5b were superior to other compounds. Pharmacokinetic experiments were carried out after oral administration of 1b and 5b. The results demonstrated that compared with OA group,
