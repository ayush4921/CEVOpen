<p>The OA derivative 1C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) has hepatoprotective effects, and it is superior to lamivudine in suppressing the rebound of the viral replication rate. Some researchers have studied the protective effect of 1C on liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) in rats and comprehensively evaluated the 1C liver protective effect using histological assay, immunohistochemical staining, and acute toxicity tests [
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Histological assay showed that the 1C high-dose group showed obvious relief in abnormal areas, and liver cells returned to a healthy state. Nevertheless, the low-dose group also had a moderate degree of relief. Moreover, 1C can inhibit the expression of cytokine TGF-
