<p>Deng et al. [
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>] used oleanolic acid aglycone as the starting material to esterify the C-28 position and introduce sugar group at C-3 position to obtain the OA derivative 7e (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Human colon cancer cells (HCT8) were selected for in vitro antitumor activity experiment, in which the inhibition rate of OA glycoside derivative 7e reached 98.26% at a concentration of 1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mmol/L, which was equal to that of the positive control drug Adriamycin, but not as good as Adriamycin at other concentrations. Although the antitumor effect of the derivative 7e is not ideal, it improves the water solubility of the derivatives, suggesting that glycosyl modification can be used to improve the water solubility of insoluble compounds.
