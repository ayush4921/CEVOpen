<p>Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>] used oleanolic acid 3-O-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-D-glucuronopyranoside (OAGP) as the raw material, after amidation at the C-28 position and modification of the sugar group, the resulting compound 6d (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Pretreatment of H9c2 cells with compound 6d exhibited a better protective effect than OAGP. The survival rate increased from 49.69% (with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> treatment alone) to 58.69%, but the effect is not as good as derivatives of ursolic acid skeleton. In summary, the experimental results showed that the amidation of C-28 and the connection of isobutyl are beneficial for the cardiomyocytes protection.
