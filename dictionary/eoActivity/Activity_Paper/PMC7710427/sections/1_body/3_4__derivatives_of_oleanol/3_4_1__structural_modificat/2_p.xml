<p>In addition, there is a report [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>] that for oleanolic acid derivatives, the role of free carboxylic acid makes it have better antiparasitic activity. Zou et al. [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>] analyzed the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of a series of semisynthetic OA derivatives. The results demonstrated that the inhibition of human carboxylesterase 1 (hCE1) by the 28-carboxyl group of OAs is very essential, and the OA modifications at this site including esters, amides, and alcohols are unbeneficial for hCE1 inhibition. In contrast, the modifications of the C-3 hydroxyl group are beneficial to the inhibition of hCE1. Substituting ketones or esters for the C-3 hydroxyl group can increase the inhibition effect of hCE1 and have a high selectivity to hCE2. Among them, the C-3 hydroxyl group is converted into 3-O-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-carboxypropionyl group, the inhibitory effect of compound 5a on hCE1 is significantly enhanced, and the selectivity to hCE2 is also very high, which can be used as a drug candidate for the development and design of hCE1. It can be seen from the above that the retention of the C-28 carboxyl group is beneficial to exert certain biological activities of oleanolic acid.
