<p>Liang et al. [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] designed and synthesized a series of 1
 <italic>α</italic>, 2
 <italic>α</italic>-epoxy-3
 <italic>β</italic>-hydroxy oleanolic acid derivatives. The antibacterial activity in vitro was studied, and the results showed that 1a (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) had good antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, and in vitro inhibition rate could reach 60% and 80%, respectively, which is equivalent to streptomycin. 2a and 3a had better inhibitory activity on Klebsiella pneumonia, similar to clindamycin. 4a had better inhibitory activity on the growth of Baumann bacilli. In vitro antibacterial activity studies indicated that the introduction of an ortho-cyano-substituted benzyl group and a short-chain alkyl ester at the 28-carboxyl might improve the antibacterial activity of 1
 <italic>α</italic>, 2
 <italic>α</italic>-epoxy-3
 <italic>β</italic>-hydroxy oleanolic acid. And introducing an acetyl group at the 3-hydroxyl group may improve the OA derivatives inhibitory activity against bacteria. As described, these newly designed OA derivatives have unique antibacterial activity and may be potential antibacterial drugs in the future.
