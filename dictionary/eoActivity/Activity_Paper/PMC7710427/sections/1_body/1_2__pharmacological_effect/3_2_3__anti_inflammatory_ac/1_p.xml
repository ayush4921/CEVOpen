<p>OA has a significant anti-inflammatory effect and is effective against a variety of inflammations [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], such as vasculitis [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], enteritis [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and tracheitis [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Particularly, OA has an inhibitory effect on rat complement and has anti-inflammatory activity in both adjuvant-induced arthritis and carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Kim et al. [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] suggested that the anti-inflammatory and antiasthmatic effects of OA may be exerted through inhibition of the GATA-3 and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor 
 <italic>Î³</italic> t pathways. In a later study, it was found that the OA anti-inflammatory activity is related to MAPK signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] demonstrated that OA treatments could dose-dependently ameliorate spinal cord damage through impeding p38- and JNK-regulated apoptosis and inflammation. Therefore, OA can be served as an effective therapeutic agent for spinal cord injury treatment. Furthermore, in vitro biological tests indicated that some OA derivatives showed significant anti-inflammatory activities, which suggested that hydroxylation at C-7 and glycosylation at C-28 had benefit effects [
