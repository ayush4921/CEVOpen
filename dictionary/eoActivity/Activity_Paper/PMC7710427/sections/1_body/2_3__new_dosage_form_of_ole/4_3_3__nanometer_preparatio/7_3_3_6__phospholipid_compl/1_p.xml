<p>Jan et al. [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] prepared a solidified phospholipid complex (OPCH) consisting of OA-phospholipid complex (OPC) and hydroxyapatite (HA) using a simple solvent evaporation method. Studies showed that the water solubility of OPCH is 15.3 times higher than that of OA, and the cumulative dissolution rate of OPCH in vitro is 2.23 times higher than that of OA at 2â€‰h. Furthermore, the combination of OPCH and ketoconazole can inhibit the OA metabolism in the intestinal tract and improve the OPCH bioavailability, which is 2.72 times higher than that of OA. In conclusion, OPCH is designed to improve intestinal absorption of OA, and its OA water solubility and bioavailability are improved in different degrees.
