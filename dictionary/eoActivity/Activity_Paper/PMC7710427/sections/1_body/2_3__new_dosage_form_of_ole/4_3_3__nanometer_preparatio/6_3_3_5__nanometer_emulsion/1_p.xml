<p>Some researchers [
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] prepared OA-loaded nanoemulsions with an average particle size of less than 60â€‰nm. Stability test studies showed that OA nanoemulsions have good physical properties (small droplet size, low viscosity), stable for at least 1 month, without instability. The results of experiments in vivo showed that the preparation is nontoxic and nonirritating to the skin, and the nanometer emulsion has a high ability to penetrate the skin, which can enhance the OA anti-inflammatory effect. Nanoemulsion made of OA can play a better role in anti-inflammatory after percutaneous absorption.
