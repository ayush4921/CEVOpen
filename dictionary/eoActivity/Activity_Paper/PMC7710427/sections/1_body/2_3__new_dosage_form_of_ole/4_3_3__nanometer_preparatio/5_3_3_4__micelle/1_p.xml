<p>Micelles can improve the solubility, dissolution, and bioavailability of OA. Commonly used preparation methods include dialysis, solvent evaporation, and film dispersion [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] prepared OA-loaded mixed micelles using ethanol thin-film hydration method, characterized OA micelles, and studied in vitro release and in vivo drug efficacy. The results showed that the average particle size of OA micelles in the aqueous phase was 95.7 ± 3.6 nm, DL is 3.5%, and EE is 93.6 ± 0.05%. The drug release studies in vitro showed that about 80% of OA released from the dialysis bag containing free OA at 24 h, while OA micelles are only 40%, which achieves the purpose of sustained release. Furthermore, OA-micelles displayed higher antitumor efficacy than free OA in both A549 and PC-9 cells. The results showed that OA micelles can significantly reduce tumor size, inhibit tumor invasion, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vivo. In conclusion, polymeric micelles are a promising nanodrug delivery system for lung cancer.
