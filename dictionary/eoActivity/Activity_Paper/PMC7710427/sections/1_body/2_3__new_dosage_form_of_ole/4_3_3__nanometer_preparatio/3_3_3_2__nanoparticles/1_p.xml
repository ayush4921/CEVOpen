<p>By preparing OA nanoparticles, OA can achieve the purpose of slow release and targeting, so as to better play the antitumor effect [

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] developed a novel OA nanoparticle (OA-NP)-loaded lactoferrin nanodelivery system. The dissolution experiment in vitro showed that at 20 minutes, the dissolution rate of OA-NPS was 80%, and that of the control OA was only 40%. The pharmacokinetic study in rats showed that its relative bioavailability was 320.5%. Wang et al. [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which can improve water solubility and release time of the drug and show strong antitumor activity. Khan et al. [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>] developed a pH-dependent calcium carbonate nanodelivery system for the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and OA in the hepatocellular carcinoma treatment. Research showed that it can mitigate the liver toxicity caused by chemotherapy drugs and overcome drug resistance. Moreover, some researchers [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] prepared nanoparticles with TPGS-PLGA and mPEG-PLGA-loaded OA, respectively, which can improve the antibacterial and antitumor activities. In vitro study showed that TPGS-stabilized OA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles were more sensitive to pathogenic bacteria. For example, TPGS-PLGA-OA is 25-fold more selective than pure OA in case of wild type strain. Similarly, mPEG-PLGA-OA exhibits stronger cytotoxicity to cancer cells and is more effective for the delivery of OA.
