<p>Liposomes have attracted people's attention because of their similar structure to biofilm structure, strong drug loading, and transport capacity. Developing oleanolic acid into nanoliposomes has slow and controlled release, targeting, reducing toxic and side effects, and enhancing the antitumor effects [

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] prepared hydrophilic polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP-K30) modified OA liposomes. The results of the characterization studies showed that the average particle size was 179.4â€‰nm, the encapsulation efficiency was above 90%, and the oral bioavailability reached 607.9%. Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>] designed and prepared a novel octreotide-modified magnetic liposomes (OMlips) for magnetically-orienting and receptor-mediated dual-targeting anticancer drug delivery. Using OA as a drug, OA-OMLips was prepared. In vitro drug-release study, about 23% of OA was released from OA-OMLips within 12 hours, which delayed the drug release. The antitumor effect studies in vivo showed that the tumor volume of OA-OMLips with magnetic group is 53% smaller than that of OA-OMLips without magnetic group, indicating that the drug delivery system effectively increases the drug accumulation in tumor tissues and improves antitumor effect. In summary, the OA antitumor activity makes it often used as an adjuvant for the development of combination therapies for cancer.
