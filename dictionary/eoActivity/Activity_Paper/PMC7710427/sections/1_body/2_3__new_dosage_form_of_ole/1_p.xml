<p>The pharmacokinetic data of different dosage forms of oleanolic acid are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. As is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the method used in most of the experiments is LC-MC, the experimental object is SD rats, and the absolute bioavailability and relative bioavailability are given. It can be seen that the new dosage forms have improved to varying degrees in bioavailability compared to commercially available oleanolic acid tablets. Next, we will conduct a specific analysis of the new dosage forms.
