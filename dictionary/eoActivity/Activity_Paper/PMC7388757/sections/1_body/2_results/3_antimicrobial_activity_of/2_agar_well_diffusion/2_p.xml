<p id="par0085">The results of agar well diffusion are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> . Both protein extracts showed antimicrobial effects against studied pathogens except for 
 <italic>T. mentagrophytes</italic>, 
 <italic>M. gypseum</italic>, and 
 <italic>M. ferugineum</italic>. The Tris buffer protein extract showed the strongest effect against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> with DIZ of 6.00 ± 0.00 mm, followed by 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (4.00 ± 0.00 mm), and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (3.66 ± 0.53 mm). The warm aqueous extract exhibited the most effectiveness against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with the DIZ of 3.66 ± 0.53 mm. Although ciprofloxacin and fluconazole antibiotics developed a larger inhibition zone diameter against studied pathogens than protein extracts, this difference was not significant (
