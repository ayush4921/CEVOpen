<p id="par0110">In this study, due to the traffic restrictions because of the Coronavirus disease COVID-19-related pandemic, we were unable to perform work on more samples and the study was completed in less than the allotted time. Due to the lack of enough financial sources the protein fractions extracted from mushroom were not analyzed and determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and chromatography. Besides, the mechanisms of action of 
 <italic>A. auricula-judea</italic> against the test pathogens were not investigated. Further work should address these issues.
