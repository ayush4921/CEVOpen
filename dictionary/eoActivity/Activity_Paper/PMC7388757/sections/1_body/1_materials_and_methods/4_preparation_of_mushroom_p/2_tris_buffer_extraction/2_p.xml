<p id="par0025">To extract with Tris buffer, the protocol provided by Tehrani et al. was used [
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The fruiting bodies of the mushroom (500 g) were washed with distilled water, then the samples were shade dried, sliced into small fragments and homogenized in 1000 ml of cold Tris buffer, 50 mM, pH 7.3 and stirred for 3−4 h. The homogenate was passed through a sieve cloth and centrifuged at 4500 rpm, for 30 min. The supernatants were saturated by adding cold acetone (80 % v/v) and left overnight in the fridge (4 °C). The collection of protein yield was done by centrifugation at 4000×
