 <italic>A. auricular-judae</italic> powder was poured into a beaker containing boiled warm water (50 °C) so that all the powder was immersed in water. The beaker was placed on a hot plate at 70 °C and allowed to stand for 4 h with intermittent stirring. After 4 h, the sample was filtered using sieve cloth. The homogenate was passed through a sieve cloth and centrifuged at 4500 rpm, for 30 min. The supernatants were saturated by adding cold acetone (80 % v/v) and left overnight in the fridge (4 °C) [
