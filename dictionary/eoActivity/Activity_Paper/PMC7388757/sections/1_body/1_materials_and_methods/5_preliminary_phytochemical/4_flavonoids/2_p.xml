<p id="par0045">The qualitative assay was done by adding a 0.1 g of the extract to 2 ml of distilled water. The addition of a few drops of sodium hydroxide generated an intense yellow color which became colorless on the addition of a few drops of dilute acid; suggesting the presence of flavonoids. For quantitative determination, 2.50 g of the extract was mixed with 50 ml of 80 % aqueous methanol and stored at 25−27 °C overnight. The sediment was recovered by decanting and re-extraction carried out using 50 ml ethanol. The whole solution of ethanol extract was filtered with the Whatman paper number 42 (125 mm). The filtrate was evaporated to dryness until a constant weight was gained [
