 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] that have shown antimicrobial effects of protein extract of some fungal species, this study hypothesized that the protein content of 
 <italic>A. auricula-judae</italic> is a potential source of an alternative treatment for microbial pathogens, but its therapeutic potential against microorganisms has not been evaluated till now. Hence this study aimed to evaluate the potential activities of the protein content of this mushroom against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
 <italic>, Dermatophytes</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> fungus.
