<p id="par0005">Irrespective of the discovery and wonders of antimicrobial drugs, microbial infection is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The menace has been aggravated by the lack of of new antimicrobials and the persistent emergence and re-emergence of resistant microbial strains in the last few decades. Despite the impact and benefits of antimicrobial chemotherapy in modern medicine, microbial resistance is now a global threat [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Today, uncritical use of antibiotics has been the leading cause in the development of drug-resistant bacteria. In addition, the consequence of acquired mutations assisting bacterial survival has also contributed to the non-susceptibility of microorganisms to commonly used antimicrobials [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This has increased the prevalence and incidence of opportunistic infections significantly beyond hospitalized patients, to the general population. The complexity in treating multi-drug resistant infections has led to an increase in the search for novel and effective antimicrobials, especially structures originating from natural products [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Research into natural products has demonstrated significant progress in the discovery of new compounds with antimicrobial activity because nature has generously handed us a source of compounds from medicinal plants, marine and terrestrial organisms, including fungi and bacteria which all has the potential to treat diseases, including infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Today, the need for novel antimicrobials has become greater than ever in the face of increasing resistance to the older ones, which has led to the exploitation of mushroom as an alternative source of protein both as food and antimicrobials [

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>]. Mushrooms are non-photosynthetic macrofungi with a fleshy distinctive fruiting body which can be either epigenous or hypogenous and visible to the naked eye [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The biological value of mushrooms, as a food product containing a unique complex of biologically active substances, has been proved in recent decades [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Edible fungi grown on plant residues contain proteins, all essential amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, macro and micro elements, polysaccharides, and melanin [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mushrooms are superior nutritional supplements with excellent medicinal values and have been evaluated for their nutritional status and medicinal values based on their chemical composition [

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Outside the nutritional and medicinal properties of edible mushrooms, theyâ€™ve also been reported to have antimicrobial activities [
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Like other bioactive compounds found in mushrooms, the proteins developed by these fungi have shown several biological activities including immunomodulatory effects, antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial properties [

 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To date, one of the edible fungi that has biological properties is 
 <italic>Auricularia auricular-judae</italic>. The 
 <italic>A. auricular-judae</italic>, a species that is well known as wood ear, tree ear, or black fungus originated from China where it grows mainly in decayed trees in the mountainside and accounts for more than 98 % of the overall production of this mushroom [
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The fruiting bodies of members of the genus 
 <italic>Auricularia</italic> are waxy and cartilaginous, and the color ranges from purplish-brown to black, especially when they are dried. The fruiting bodies are not only shaped like a human ear but also feel like ears, due to their rubbery, gelatinous state when fresh [
