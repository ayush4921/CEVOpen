<p>Plaque reduction assay was used to determine the antiviral activity of EO as previously described [
 <xref rid="B32-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Briefly, Vero cells (CCL-81) were cultivated for 24 h at 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 37 °C. The cells were inoculated for 1 h with individual viruses; herpes simplex type-1 virus HSV-1 (ATCC VR-1493), hepatitis A virus HAV (ATCC VR-1357) or vesicular stomatitis virus VSV (ATCC VR-1238) (1 × 10
 <sup>1</sup>‒10
 <sup>7</sup> plaque-forming unit PFU/mL). The infected cells (2 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU) were washed and incubated with several concentrations of EO as well as acyclovir (positive control) for 1 h. Then, cells were overlaid with nutrient agarose and incubated for 72 h. Formaldehyde (10%) in phosphate-buffer solution (pH 7.3) was used to fix cells for 1 h. Crystal violet, 0.5% in 20% ethanol, was used to stain cells and then plaques were counted. The percentage of viral inhibition was calculated as [1 − (V
 <italic>d</italic>/V
 <italic>c</italic>)] × 100, where V
 <italic>d</italic> and V
 <italic>c</italic> are the number of plaques in the presence and absence of test samples.
