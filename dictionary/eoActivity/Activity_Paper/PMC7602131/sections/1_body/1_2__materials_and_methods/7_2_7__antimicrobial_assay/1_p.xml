<p>Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6051), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Staphylococcus capitis (ATCC 35661), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 27956), Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 12344), Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas fluorescens (ATCC 13525), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Shigella flexneri (ATCC 700930), and fungi: Aspergillus fumigatus (ATCC 1022), Candida albicans (ATCC 90028), Geotrichum candidum (ATCC 12784), Syncephalastrum racemosum (ATCC 14831), and MDR (multidrug resistance) isolates were used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of EOs. Bacteria and fungi were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in Columbia media plus 5% sheep blood and for 48 h at 25 °C in CHRO-Magar
 <sup>®</sup> Candida, respectively (BD, Heidelberg, Germany). The agar diffusion method was used to determine the sensitivity of tested microbes to the tested EO. Pathogens 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL saline were incubated with Mueller Hinton agar as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B33-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Pasteur pipette was used to cup wells (6 mm diameter). The EO (3.2 mg/mL), DMSO, and reference antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamycin, and clotrimazole) were applied to the experimental set. The clear zones surrounding the wells indicated the growth inhibition and the average diameters of triple wells were recorded. Micro-broth dilution method was used for the assessment of the MIC (minimum inhibition concentration) and MMC (minimum microbicidal concentration) of tested EO [
 <xref rid="B34-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Several concentrations of EO were incubated with bacteria (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL Mueller Hinton broth) for 24 h at 37 °C and fungi (5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL Sabouraud Dextrose broth) for 48 h at 25 °C in a 96-well plate and reference antibiotics. The MMC of EO was determined as the lowest concentration of EO that completely killed the microbe.
