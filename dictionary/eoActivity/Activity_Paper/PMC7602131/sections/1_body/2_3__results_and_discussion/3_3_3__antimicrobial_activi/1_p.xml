<p>The antibacterial activity of essential oils obtained from the flower heads of 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> was evaluated in vitro using the agar diffusion method against different standard Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria via measuring the mean diameter of inhibition zones (DIZ) and determining the minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) values as well. Both oils exerted a moderate antibacterial activity against the tested Gram-positive bacteria with 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> essential oil being more potent comparable to 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> oil displaying MIC of 62.5 µg/mL against each of 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes.</italic> However, both oils exerted weak activity versus the examined Gram-negative bacteria and fungal strains with MICs &gt; 500 µg/mL. The mean diameter of inhibition zones (DIZ) and the minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) of both oils versus all the tested bacterial and fungal strains are illustrated in

 <italic>Chrysanthemum</italic> species that exhibited antibacterial and antifungal potential versus many fungal and bacterial strains [

 <italic>C. indicum</italic> essential oil flower heads growing in Korea exhibited significant antimicrobial potential versus all tested oral bacteria (showing MIC values between 0.1 and 1.6 mg/mL and Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBCs) between 0.2 and 3.2 mg/mL) [

The existence of considerable amounts of monoterpenes and oxygenated monoterpenes could greatly explain the high potency versus Gram-positive bacteria via diffusing and destabilizing the structure of cell membrane. Thus, terpenoid rich essential oils are more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than to Gram-negative ones. Besides, a synergism could exist between major and minor compounds might probably contribute to the moderate antibacterial effect [
