<p>The antiviral activity of the essential oils obtained from the flower heads of 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> was assessed using the plaque reduction assay on Vero cells (CCL-81). Nothing was previously reported in literature about the antiviral potential of the oils of interest. However, it was interesting to us that our previous work on aqueous extracts of both plants showed no activity against both hepatitis B virus (HBV), and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) [
 <xref rid="B44-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Generally, most of the oils derived from the plant origin are evaluated against HSV-1 or rhinovirus. No reports could be traced regarding evaluation most of the oils against HAV or VSV. Both oils lack measurable cytotoxicity on Vero cells at the selected doses with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values &gt; 100 μg/mL being 125.81 and 145.35 μg/mL for 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> and 
 <italic>C. morifolium</italic> oils, respectively as shown by the MTT assay. However, both oils in general and the 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> essential oil in particular, showed substantial antiviral potential in a dose dependent manner against VSV, HAV and HSV-1 as demonstrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01460-f005">Figure 5</xref>. However, VSV was more sensitive to the antiviral activity of the 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> essential oil comparable to HAV and HSV-1 showing IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.14, 3.38 and 3.51 μg/mL towards the three previously mentioned viruses, respectively. It is worthy to mention that the activity of the 
 <italic>Chrysanthemum</italic> oil is more potent than both clove and Eucalyptus oils which have a potent antiviral activity against HSV-1 [

 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.21, 1.84 and 1.49 μg/mL towards VSV, HAV and HSV-1, respectively. The substantial antiviral activity of 
 <italic>C. indicum</italic> essential oil could be interpreted in virtue of the presence of camphor, isoborneol and other major constituents. Camphor was previously reported to exert a remarkable virucidal potential versus herpes simplex virus-1 [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Additionally, isoborneol was previously reported to inhibit herpes simplex virus-1 replication via a specific inhibition in the glycosylation of its polypeptides exerting no cytotoxic effect on Vero cells (CCL-81) [
 <xref rid="B47-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It is noteworthy to highlight that evaluation of cytotoxicity is crucially important in the assessment of the antiviral activity as beneficial oil should selectively inhibits viral replication, growth and other process with no or rare effects on different cellular metabolic process [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-09-01460" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In general, lipophilic secondary metabolites interfere with the lipid membrane envelope of viruses. Therefore, they are not very specific and usually attack free viral particles and not intracellular viruses [
