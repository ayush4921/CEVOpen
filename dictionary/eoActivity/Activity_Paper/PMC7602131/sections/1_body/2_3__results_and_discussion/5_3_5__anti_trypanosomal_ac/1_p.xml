<p>Both essential oils showed a moderate anti-trypanosomal activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 49.02 and 45.89 μg/mL, albeit lower than diminazene (positive control; IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.075 μg/mL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-09-01460-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The selectivity indexes of the two oils were calculated as 1.8 and 1.5, respectively, indicating low selectivity against trypanosomes compared to their cytotoxicity versus HL-60 cells (88.24 and 68.84 μg/mL, respectively). It is worthy to highlight that nothing was traced in literature regarding the assessment of the anti-trypanosomal potency of both essential oils. However, it was noticed that both methanol and chloroform extracts of the same plants showed higher potency against
