  <p>Interaction forces between the identified inhibitors and the substrate binding residues of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. (A) The substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. S1, S1â€™, S2 and S4 subsites are labelled in blue. Catalytic residues (red) H41 and C145, and other substrate binding residues (black) are labelled. (B) Molecular docking of seven SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. Substrate binding subsites (blue) and catalytic residues (red) H41 and C145 are labelled. (C) Interaction profiles of seven SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. The interaction energy (kcal/mol) positively correlates with the brightness of the colour (bright green). Catalytic residues H41 and C145 are labelled in red. E: electrostatic force (red fill); H: hydrogen binding force (green fill); V: van der Waals force (gray fill).</p>
