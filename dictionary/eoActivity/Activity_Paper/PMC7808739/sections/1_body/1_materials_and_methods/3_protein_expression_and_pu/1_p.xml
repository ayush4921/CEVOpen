 </xref>. The purified protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and the image quantification with Multi Gauge densitometry (Fujifilm, Japan) characterised the protein purity to be over 95%. Biochemical protein quantification was performed using Bio-Rad protein assays (CA, USA), with the measurements at 595 nm in a SPARK® multimode microplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland).
