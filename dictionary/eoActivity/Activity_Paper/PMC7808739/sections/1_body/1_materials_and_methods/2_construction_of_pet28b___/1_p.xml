 </xref> was chemically synthesised and cloned into an yT&amp;A plasmid by Genomics, Taiwan. The insert, encoding full length SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, was amplified from the yT&amp;A plasmid using ExcelTaq™ Taq DNA polymerase (Smobio, Taiwan), primer 5′-ATGGGTCGGGATCCCAGTGGTTTTAGAAA-3′ and primer 5′-GGTGCTCGAGTTCATCTAGTTATTGGAAAGTAACACCTGAG-3′ and cloned into a T7-based pET-28b(+) plasmid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) digested with BamHI and XhoI (New England Biolabs, MA, USA). Plasmid extraction from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α cells was carried out using Presto™ Mini Plasmid kits or Geneaid™ Midi Plasmid kits. The amplicon was purified using a PCR clean-up DNA/RNA extraction kit (Viogene, Taiwan). The insert sequence of the pET28b(+) DNA plasmid was verified by the National Yang-Ming University Genome Research Center, Taiwan.
