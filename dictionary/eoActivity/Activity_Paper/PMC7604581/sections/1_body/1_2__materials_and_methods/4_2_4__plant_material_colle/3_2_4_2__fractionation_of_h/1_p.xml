<p>Coarsely powdered stem bark of 
 <italic>H. floribunda</italic> (3.49 kg) was Soxhlet-extracted successively using 3 L each of petroleum ether (pet-ether), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and methanol (MeOH) for 48 hours. The extracts obtained were concentrated on a rotary evaporator under low temperature and further dried to afford the pet-ether (PHE-5.2%), ethyl acetate extract (EHE-19.85% w/w), and a methanol extract (MHE-16.15% w/w). An alkaloidal fraction was obtained by dissolving 156.9 g of MHE in 1.25 L of 10% acetic acid. The resulting solution was made distinctly alkaline with 70 mL of strong ammonia. The alkaloids were then extracted with 2.5 L of chloroform. The chloroform extract was concentrated by evaporation on a rotary evaporator to yield 52.4 g of crude alkaloidal fraction.
