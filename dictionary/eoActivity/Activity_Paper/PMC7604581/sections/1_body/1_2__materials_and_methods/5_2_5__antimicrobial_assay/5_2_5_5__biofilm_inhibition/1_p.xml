<p>Eight plant extracts that showed antimicrobial activity in the susceptibility test were investigated in this assay. The test was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates. Briefly, 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of sterile liquid broth medium was inoculated with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of standardized overnight culture of the selected bacterium, and volumes of plant extracts reconstituted in distilled water were added to obtain concentrations of 10, 5, 2.5, and 1.25 mg/mL. For the determination of the minimum biofilm inhibitory concentrations of fractions and pure compounds, a concentration range between 1 and 0.0078 mg/mL was used. Ciprofloxacin was used as the reference drug. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. The experiment was performed in triplicate. After the incubation, the liquid suspension was removed and the amount of biofilm formed determined as described in
