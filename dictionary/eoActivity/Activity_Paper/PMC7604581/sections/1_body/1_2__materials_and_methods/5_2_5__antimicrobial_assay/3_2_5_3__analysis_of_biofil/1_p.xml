<p>To qualitatively investigate the biofilm-producing abilities of the selected bacteria, the method described by Amaral et al. was employed with some modification. Briefly, a sterile glass slide placed in a sterile petri dish was overlaid with 20 mL of Mueller Hinton broth seeded with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of standardized culture (∼10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/mL). After 24 and 48 hours of incubation, the slides were washed with normal saline to remove the floating planktonic bacteria, and the biofilm was fixed by heating the slide. Slides were then stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 15 minutes, washed with distilled water, air dried, and observed under the microscope. Photomicrographs of bacterial biofilms were recorded at a magnification of ×100 [
