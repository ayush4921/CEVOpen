In the rural and peri-urban areas like the Ejisu-Juaben district in the Ashanti region of Ghana, access to medical care is limited, and most indigenes rely on herbal medicine practitioners for their primary health needs. Herbal medicines are highly valued and enjoy patronage by a large number of the populace due to its acceptability, affordability, and perceived safety [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this study, an ethnobotanical survey was undertaken in the Ejisu-Juaben district to obtain comprehensive data on plant-based remedies commonly used by traditional healers to treat infection. Furthermore, the biofilm formation inhibitory activities of selected plant extracts were investigated and some bioactive constituents identified.
