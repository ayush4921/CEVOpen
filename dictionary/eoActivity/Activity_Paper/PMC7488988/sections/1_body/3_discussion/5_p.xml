<p id="Par42">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> illustrates the different plants cited by practitioners to be useful in treatment of cancer. Among the most cited plants was 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. which was used in cancer mainly for its analgesic, anti-nausea and antiemetic properties. Moreover, some claimed it was also helpful in reducing the spread of the disease. The findings dovetail with reports on the medical uses of cannabis elsewhere (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) wherein it is reported that cannabis was found to be useful as an analgesic as well as for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The Arab physicians were reported to be users of 
 <italic>Cannabis sativa</italic> L. extract for its diuretic, anti-emetic, anti-epileptic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. They would also apply the seed oil on to hardened tumours and the tumours would dissolve [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. There is also evidence of cannabis efficacy in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety and asthma among other uses. Cannabidol, a cannabinoid phytoconstituent, was thought to be responsible for the antipsychotic activity of cannabis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The other use of cannabis in cancer is related to its ability to increase appetite, a phenomenon very useful in cancer patients where appetite is normally suppressed. Scientific studies, though inconclusive, had hinted on the potential efficacy of cannabis as an anti-tumour agent and needed more exploration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Studies on the cannabis plant extract phytoconstituents indicate the presence of over 100 cannabinoids, 9-THC being the most potent and responsible for the psychoactive effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]; terpenoids, flavonoids and alkaloids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Given the high frequency index of cannabis in this study, it is prudent to pursue its efficacy in cell growth inhibition or as a cytotoxic agent.
