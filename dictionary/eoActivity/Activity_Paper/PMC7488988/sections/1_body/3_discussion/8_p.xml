However, generally, the commonly alluded to measure of dose was one to two tablespoonful of either the powder or extract administered twice or three times a day until the condition improves. In cases where patients fail to improve, combination of the plants’ extracts would be administered so as to get additive or synergistic effects.

Effects such as dizziness and diarrhoea were found to be common in many patients but reported as an indication that ‘the herbs were working’.</p>
