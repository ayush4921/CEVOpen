<p id="p0085">The medicinal plants showed activity against various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The antagonistic activity (zone of inhibition in mm) of medicinal plants (

 <italic>M. cerviana</italic> were described in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Methanol extract of 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> was found to be highly active against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (27 ± 2 mm), 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> (19 ± 3 mm) and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (18 ± 2 mm). Ethyl acetate extract showed high activity against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (24 ± 2 mm), 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> (22 ± 3 mm) and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (20 ± 1 mm). Acetone and water extract showed considerable activity against 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. The antimicrobial property of medicinal plants varied widely and was depend based on bacterial strains tested. The selected Gram-positive bacterial pathogens were highly susceptible to the polyherbal extract when compared to bacteria from Gram-negative group. The difference in cell wall structure cause significant changes in the permeability of the drug (
 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2001</xref>). Tannins from the medicinal plants disintegrate bacterial cells and affect bacterial cell wall (
 <xref rid="b0300" ref-type="bibr">Venkataswamy et al., 2010</xref>). Also, tannins from the medicinal plants are used to treat ulcerated tissues and inflamed tissues (
 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Akinpelu and Onakoya, 2006</xref>). In medicinal plants potential bioactive compounds are accumulated as secondary metabolites and this amount varies according to seasons, plant parts, growth phases and climatic conditions (

 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Mensah et al., 2008</xref>). The antimicrobial property of the whole plant of T. cucumirina has been described previously by 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Kage et al. (2009)</xref>. It has been effective against the bacterial pathogens such as, Staphyloccus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. The antibacterial activity of T. cucumirina has been tested against Staphyloccus aureus and Escherichia coli (

 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al. (2014)</xref> reported the effect of methanol of polyherbal medicine against bacterial species. The formulated polyherbal medicines showed less activity against C. albicans and high activity was reported against S. mutans.
