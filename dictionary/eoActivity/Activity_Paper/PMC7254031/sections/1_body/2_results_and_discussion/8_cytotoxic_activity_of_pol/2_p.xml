<p id="p0105">In our study, two cell lines (HeLa and MCF cell lines) were selected to analyze cytotoxic activity of polyherbal extract. The LC50 value was 467 ± 2.9 µg/ml against HeLa cell line and &gt;800 µg/ml against MCF-7 cell lines. In the present study, the methanol extract of polyherbal plant showed cytotoxicity against tested cell lines. Earlier, crude extract has also been used to identify the lead molecules for the preparation of drugs (

 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">Svejda et al., 2010</xref>). The present findings revealed promising anticancer activity against HeLa and MCF cell lines. Phytochemcials such as, polyphenols and flavonoids have potent anticancer activities by involving regulation of various signal transduction pathways of cancer cell growth and suppression and proliferation of oncogenes and formation of tumor, modulation of enzyme activity, induction of apoptosis, reduction, oxidation, regulation of hormone metabolism and stimulation of the immune system and DNA repair (
