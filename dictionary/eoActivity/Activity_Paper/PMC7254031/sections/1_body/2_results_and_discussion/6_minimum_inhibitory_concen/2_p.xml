<p id="p0095">MIC values of polyherbal extract ranged from 29 ± 2.5 µg/ml to 34 ± 2.5 µg/ml. MIC value was found to be less against 
 <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> and was high against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. MIC value of polyherbal extract against selected bacteria was described in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Previously, 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">Rios and Recio (2005)</xref> reported potent antibacterial properties for organic solvent extract with MIC value less than 100 µg/ml and in our study the evaluated extract showed promising antimicrobial activity with less MIC values. In a study, 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Barros et al. (2009)</xref> analyzed the antimicrobial property of oil from 
 <italic>V. zizanioides</italic> and reported varying MIC values. In their study, the reported MIC value was 150 µg/ml, however, polyherbal extract of our study showed less MIC value.
