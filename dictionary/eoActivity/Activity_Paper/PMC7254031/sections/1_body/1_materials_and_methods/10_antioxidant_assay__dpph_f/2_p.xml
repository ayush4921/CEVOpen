<p id="p0055">DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl) radical scavenging assay was performed to analyze the antioxidant potential of polyherbal methanol extract. In this assay, the sample was added with 0.1 M methanolic DPPH at different concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μg). It was mixed well for 20 min and incubated at 37 °C and the absorbance was measured at 517 nm. Blank experiment was run without plant extract. Lower absorbance of the sample indicated high degree of free radical scavenging activity. Finally, the free radical scavenging activity (%) was calculated.</p>
