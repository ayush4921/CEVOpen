<p id="p0050">The methanol extract was used to test the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for tested bacterial sample. MIC of the selected polyherbal extract was tested by broth dilution assay where plant extract (100 mg/ml) was resuspended in DMSO and dilutions were made upto 5 mg/ml. All dilution was seeded with selected bacterial suspension (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cfu/ml) and incubated at 37° for 24 h. After 24 h, the growth of the culture was monitored using a spectrophotometer (600 nm) against blank. Experiments were performed in triplicate analysis.
