<p id="p0070">MTT assay was performed as described earlier by 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Carmichael et al. (1987)</xref>. Briefly, HeLa and MCF-7 cells were aseptically seeded at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL in a microtiter plate in MEM medium. Then it was incubated for overnight and polyherbal extract was added in cell lines. The cells were treated with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltratrazolium bromide (MTT). After 4 h of incubation, cell culture medium was aspirated from the microtiter plates. Then the formazan crystal from the microtiter plates were dissolved in DMSO and the plate was subjected to analysis at 570 nm using a 96 well microplate reader. The cytotoxic effect (%) of polyherbal extract was calculated.
