 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed the anti-diabetic property of this plant on diabetic-induced zebrafish. Although several alkaloids in this plant have been reported, none of these alkaloids have been found to exert anti-diabetic activity. More research should be performed to identify bioactive compounds related to the anti-diabetic properties of this plant.
