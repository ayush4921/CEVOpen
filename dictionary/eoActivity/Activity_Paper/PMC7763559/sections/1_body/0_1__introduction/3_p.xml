<p>LC-MS-based metabolomics has been used to identify bioactive compounds in medicinal herbs [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Condensed tannins and flavonoid derivatives have been identified as antioxidant metabolites from the leaves of 
 <italic>Fragaria vesca</italic> by using LC-MS based metabolomics [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, Kamalrul et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] identified eight compounds from 
 <italic>Wedelia trilobata</italic> leaves that exhibited potential allelopathic effects. Liquid chromatography (LC) combined with quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was used to annotate metabolites that could act as 
 <italic>Î±</italic>-glucosidase (AG) inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Suganya et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported AG inhibitors from 
 <italic>Clinacanthus nutans</italic> leaves using a similar technology. Additionally, Gilda et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] identified 35 metabolites, along with antioxidant and AG inhibitory effects of the fruits of both 
 <italic>Morus alba</italic> and 
 <italic>Morus nigra</italic>. Similar technology has been applied to evaluate the activity of 
 <italic>Clinacanthus nutans</italic> leaves against cisplatin toxicity [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, potential thrombin/factor Xa inhibitors were reported from 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> Bunge and 
 <italic>Ligusticum chuanxiong</italic> Hort using the LC-MS-based multivariate data analysis technique [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Chromatographic technique-based metabolomics was also applied to compare and reveal the chemical profiles of raw and fermented Chinese Ge-Gen-Qin-Lian decoction (a traditional chinese medicine formula) during investigation of its anti-diabetic effects on high-fat diet and streptozotocin-induced rats [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The choice of using LC-MS is due to the technique having a high mass resolution and detection sensitivity in regard to mass detection, thus, it can precisely measure the mass [
 <xref rid="B23-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. LC-Q-TOF-MS provides improved detection for fragmented ions with a high resolution and mass precision in comparison to many other tandem mass spectrometries [
