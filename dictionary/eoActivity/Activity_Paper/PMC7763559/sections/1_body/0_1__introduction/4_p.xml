<p>Molecular docking plays an important role in predicting the binding modes and binding abilities of small molecules towards the targeted proteins, which is crucial in designing potential drugs [

 <italic>P. malayana</italic> Jack leaf extracts were investigated through an AG inhibition assay. Subsequently, the AG inhibitors in this herb were identified using LC-MS-based metabolomics. An in silico study was carried out to predict the molecular interaction between the AG enzyme (protein) and the tentative AG inhibitors (ligands) that were identified in 
 <italic>P. malayana</italic> leaf extracts.
