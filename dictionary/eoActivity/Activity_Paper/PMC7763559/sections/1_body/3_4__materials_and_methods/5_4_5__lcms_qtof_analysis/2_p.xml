<p>ACD/Spec Manager v.12.00 (Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., ACD/Labs Toronto, ON, Canada) software was used for analyzing the acquired LCMS-QTOF data and for in silico analysis of fragmention pathway. The raw (*.xms) data were converted into CDF (*.cdf) format by ACD/Spec manager. The data were subsequently pre-processed using MZmine software (VTT Technical Research Centre, Oulu, Finland) for baseline correction, peak detection, peak filtering, alignment, smoothing and gap filling and saved as a (*.csv) format [
