<p>The method used by Murugesu et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] was followed in this study with a slight modification. LCMS-QTOF instrument (Agilent 1290 Infinity and 6550 iFunnel, Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with an electrospray interface (ESI) with positive ion modes was used to analyze the sample. The sample was prepared using 250 μL of methanol to dissolve 1 mg of each plant extract. The mixture was vortexed and sonicated for 15 min, followed by the addition of 250 µL of water. Subsequently, it was centrifuged for 15 min to obtain a clear supernatant which was transferred into an insert glass vial through syringe filtration. Phenomenex Kinetex C18 core-shell technology 100 Å (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, California, United States) column was used for sample injection. The column temperature was 27 °C. The column was initially washed with methanol before sample injection. A total of 10 µL sample was injected through an autosampling system. Samples were eluted with a gradient system from 5% methanol in water with 0.1% formic acid to absolute methanol in 20 min. The machine was then operated for another 10 min with absolute methanol at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min for a total running time of 30 min. The MS/MS data were recorded between 
 <italic>m/z</italic> values of 50 to 1500 with a scanning rate of 1 spectrum per scan, and the MS/MS spectra were collected by a collision energy ramp of 35 eV. The source parameter was set to the following: gas temperature = 200 °C, gas flow = 14 L/min, nebulizer= 35 psig, sheat gas temperature = 350 °C, sheat gas flow = 11 L/min.
