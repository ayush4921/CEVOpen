<p>Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> showed the highest binding affinity among the three compounds, quercetin, and ADG. This high binding affinity is attributed to its chemical structure which contains three main parts (aromatic, alicyclic, and aliphatic parts). This allows the compound to interact with three catalytic residues (ASP352, ARG442, and ASH215) via pi–anion and pi–cation interactions, in addition to hydrogen bond interactions. The higher number of hydrophobic interactions between compound 
 <bold>3</bold> and the enzyme may lead to a high affinity towards the active site of the enzyme, which is in line with previous research [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Ahmed et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05885" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] reported a higher number of hydrophobic interactions between questin (an identified 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase inhibitor) and 3A4A that indicated a high affinity towards the enzyme’s active site by exhibiting a more negative binding affinity value of −8.3 kcal/mol. Three residues (ASP352, ASH215, and ARG442) that are present in the ADG-AG enzyme complex are also involved in the docked complex of compound 
 <bold>3</bold>–AG enzyme, supporting the high binding affinity exerted by compound 
 <bold>3</bold>. Given the above findings, it is anticipated that compound 
 <bold>3</bold> may serve as potential lead compound for the development of an AG inhibitor.
