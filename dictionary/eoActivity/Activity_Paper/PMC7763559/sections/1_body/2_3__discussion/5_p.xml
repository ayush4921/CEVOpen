<p>This present study appears to be the first to investigate the potential anti-diabetic effect of these compounds through an in silico approach. The best method to confirm the AGI activity of these compounds is through an in vitro AGI test on each of the pure compounds. However, these compounds are not commercially available, and the isolation of these compounds is difficult due to their low abundnace in this plant. Thus, in silico computational analysis, evaluating the binding characteristic between the identified compounds and the active site of the enzyme, was carried out.</p>
