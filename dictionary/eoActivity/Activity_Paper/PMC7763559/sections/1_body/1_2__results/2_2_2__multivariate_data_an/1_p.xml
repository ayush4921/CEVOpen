<p>Supervised multivariate data analysis, by means of orthogonal partial least square (OPLS), was used to correlate the x variables (LC-MS signals) and the y variable (AGI activity) of each sample. The mass to charge ratio (
 <italic>m/z</italic>) and retention time were considered as the x variables and resulted from the pre-processing of LCMS data using an online Mzmine platform. Pareto scaling was used in order to suppress the effect of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> noise in the statistical calculation, thus avoiding a biased result.
