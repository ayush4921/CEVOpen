 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f003">Figure 3</xref>A shows a score scatter plot that displays the separation among the samples. The sample separation can be viewed well through a combination of OPLS component one and two. The most active extract (100% methanol) was separated in the positive side, while the others—except part of the 25% methanol extract—were separated in the negative side of OPLS component one. While OPLS component two could not separate the most active extract from the less active extracts.
