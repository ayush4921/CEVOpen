<p>The loading scatter plot, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f003">Figure 3</xref>B, maps out the correlation of the x variables (
 <italic>m/z</italic>) to the y variable (AGI activity). The 
 <italic>m/z</italic> values being closer to the AGI activity indicates their positive correlation to the bioactivity. Plenty of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> vindicated this property. However, only three of them (
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 315.2, 317.2, and 349.2) could be identified after comparison with the available databases and publications. The detailed explanation of compound identification is described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-molecules-25-05885">Section 2.3</xref>. The three identified putative compounds are (5′-hydroxymethyl-1′-(1, 2, 3, 9-tetrahydro-pyrrolo [2, 1-
 <italic>b</italic>] quinazolin-1-yl)-heptan-1-one) (
 <bold>1</bold>), 
 <italic>α</italic>-terpinyl-
 <italic>β</italic>-glucoside (
 <bold>2</bold>), and machaeridiol-A (
