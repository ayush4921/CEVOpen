 <xref rid="molecules-25-05885-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the binding interactions of compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>, 
 <bold>2</bold>, and 
 <bold>3</bold>. Along with the H-bond interaction, other interactions such as pi-sigma, pi-alkyl, pi-pi t-shaped were also involved in the docked complexes. The binding interaction analysis showed that the hydroxyl moiety of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> interacts with ARG213, ASP352 and protonated GLU277 residues, whereas the carbonyl moiety of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> interacts with the ARG442 residue through hydrogen bond interaction. Among the four hydrogen bonds, the strongest hydrogen bond is the one involving ASP352 with a distance of 2.08 Å. Meanhile, TYR72 and PHE178 interact with the aliphatic chain of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> through pi-alkyl and pi-sigma interactions, respectively. Whereas, the pyrrolidines moiety of compound 
 <bold>1</bold> exhibited a pi-alkyl interaction with the PHE303 residue of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase.
