<p>Compound 
 <bold>1,</bold> an alkaloid, consists of a quinazoline ring with an aliphatic side chain containing carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. Compound 
 <bold>1</bold> was protonated at the oxygen attached to the O-H functional groups to form the parent ion [M + H]

 <sub>2</sub> from the parent ion resulted in ions with 
 <italic>m/z</italic> values of 286, 264, 257, 241, 132, 79, and 27, respectively. Removal of a methyl group from the parent ion produced an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 300. The loss of methane (CH
 <sub>4</sub>) from the parent ion results in the formation of an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 299 from which dihydrogen was removed to produce an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 297. Removal of CH
 <sub>4</sub>O from the parent ion produced an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 283, and the further loss of hydrogen caused the formation of an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 282. In another pathway, the parent ion lost pentanol (C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>O) to form an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 227, which was further fragmented to produce an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 185 by removal of ethenone (C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>2</sub>O). The loss of heptanol (C
 <sub>7</sub>H
 <sub>16</sub>O) from the parent ion leads to the formation of an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 199, from which, further loss of ethylene (C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>) forms an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 171. Further fragmentation of this ion leads to the formation of an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 157 by removal of methylene (CH
 <sub>2</sub>). The parent ion lost benzene (C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>) to produce an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 239 that was further fragmented to produce an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 139 by removal of hexanal (C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>O). Later on, a water molecule was removed to produce an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 121 that led to the production of another ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 93 by removal of ethylene (C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>).
