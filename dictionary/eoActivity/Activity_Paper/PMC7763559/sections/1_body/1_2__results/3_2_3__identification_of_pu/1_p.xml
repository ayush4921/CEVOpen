<p>Identification of putative compounds was performed by analyzing the 
 <italic>m/z</italic> spectrum of fragmented ions of each compound which was obtained from the LC-MS/MS instrument with a positive ionization mode (see 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05885-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The fragmentation pathway of three compounds is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-05885">Figure S1, the supplementary file</xref>. The chemical structures of the identified compounds are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05885-f004">Figure 4</xref>.
