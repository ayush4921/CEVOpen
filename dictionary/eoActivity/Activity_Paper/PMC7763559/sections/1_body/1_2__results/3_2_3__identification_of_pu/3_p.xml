<p>Compound 
 <bold>2</bold> is a diterpenoid glucoside which was protonated at the oxygen atom of one of the hydroxyl groups of glycoside during positive Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) to form the parent ion [M + H]
 <sup>+</sup> with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 317. The removal of C
 <sub>4</sub>H
 <sub>6</sub>, C
 <sub>11</sub>H
 <sub>20</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>, C
 <sub>14</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, and C
 <sub>14</sub>H
 <sub>25</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> from this ion led to the formation of ions with 
 <italic>m/z</italic> values of 263, 69, 61, and 60, respectively. The loss of C
 <sub>9</sub>H
 <sub>18</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> from the parent ion produced an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 95, which was further fragmented to form an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 81 by removal of methylene (CH
 <sub>2</sub>). In another pathway, the loss of C
 <sub>9</sub>H
 <sub>18</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub> led to the formation of an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 95. While an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 67 was formed from the ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 95 by removal of C
 <sub>2</sub>H
 <sub>4</sub>. Removal of water from the parent ion produced an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 299, this was followed by the loss of another water molecule to form an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 281. The removal of CH
 <sub>4</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> from the parent ion formed an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 263, which was further fragmented to produce an ion with an 
 <italic>m/z</italic> of 251 by the removal of water.
