<p>Currently, studies focus on optimal parameters of the extraction process, which should provide the necessary content of biological active substances. According to this fact, Bondar et al., tried to standardize the sum of flavonoids and hydroxycinamic acids derivatives found in ethanolic extracts (96% and 70%) of 
 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. buds (Ukraine). Extraction of the phytocompounds was carried out by the method of percolation and the quantitative determination of flavonoids and hydroxycinamic acids derivatives was performed using spectrophotometry. Results showed that the concentration of the extracting and infusion time influence the qualitative composition of the extract. For obtaining an extract rich in hydroxycinnamic acids (57.70%), it is advisable to use ethanol (70%) and for flavonoids (82.60%), it is advisable to use ethanol (96%) [
