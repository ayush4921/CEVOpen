<p>Since the research of Mainar et al., left the door open for further investigation and optimization of extraction conditions, Kuś et al., applied supercritical fluid extraction with carbon dioxide in a supercritical state and UPLC–DAD analysis of dried poplar buds of 
 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. (Poland). The extraction was conducted under different pressure (8.3–33.7 MPa) and temperature (35.8–64.1 °C). Based on the chromatographic analysis, it was found that the extraction efficiency of phenolic acids and flavonoids depends on the process parameters. The largest levels of bioactive phenols in SC-CO
 <sub>2</sub> extracts were 1.52, 47.24, 10.25, 79.56, 1.55 and 2.03 mg/g, respectively, for 
 <italic>p-</italic>coumaric acid, pinocembrin, galangin, pinostrobin, pinobanksin and chrysin at the temperature of 60 °C and pressure of 30 MPa [
