<p>It has been suggested that the presence of a large number of flavonoids and phenolic compounds are responsible for most of the biological and pharmacological activities of

 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. buds (Croatia). Cadinen, cineol, curcumene, bisabolene, farnesol, humulene and acetophenone were detected in significant concentration [

They have described that the hexane extract contains more than 54 neutral compounds, like 1,8-cineole, salicylaldehyde, cinnamate and the ether extract contain acid compounds such as ferulic acid, caffeic acid, pinocembrin, p-coumaric acid and benzyl-caffeate [
