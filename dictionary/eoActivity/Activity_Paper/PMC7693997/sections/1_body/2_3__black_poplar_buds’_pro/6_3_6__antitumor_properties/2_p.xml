<p>Studies have shown that this flavanone possesses a vast range of pharmacological effects including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antioxidant and the ability to reduce reactive oxygen species and regulate apoptosis (

In this case of the phytocompound increased the activity of Caspase 3, Caspase 9 and the mitochondrial membrane potential, but at the same time, it did not affect the cytochrome P450 reductase, quinone reductase and glucuronosyltransferase activity [

Gao et al., investigate the effect of different concentrations of pinocembrin (100–200 µM) in vitro on SKOV3 human ovarian cancer cell lines using some consecrated assays (cell scratch assay, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining, Western blot and RT-PCR). Results revealed that this molecule inhibited the proliferation, migration and promoted apoptosis of the tested ovarian cancer cell line [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-09-01464" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Kumar et al., have demonstrated that pinocembrin (50, 100 and 200 µM) induced apoptosis in HCT116 human colon cancer cell lines. It decreased the MMP with the subsequent release of cytochrome C and increase the level of Caspase 3 and 9 [
