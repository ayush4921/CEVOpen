<p>With respect to this direction the group of Zheng et al., highlighted the antitumor effects of pinocembrin extract against melanoma cells (A375, B16F10) in vitro and in vivo on an experimental model that includes B16F10 cells implanted in C57BL/6 mice strain. The phytocompound, in a dose dependent manner inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells and suppressed autophagy through the activation of Pl3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. These events have an important role as a dual mechanism responsible for the induction of melanoma cell death. Results also showed that 50â€“75 mg/kg pinocembrin successfully reduced tumor volume and weight in B16F10-implanted mice [
