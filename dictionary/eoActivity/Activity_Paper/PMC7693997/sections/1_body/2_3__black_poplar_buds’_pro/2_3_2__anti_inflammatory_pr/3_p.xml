<p>Debbache et al., examined in vivo the anti-inflammatory effect of poplar bud extract (Algeria; water and chloroform extraction). The anti-inflammatory potential was evaluated on an experimental animal carrageenan-induced mice paw edema model. A dose of 200 mg/kg of the poplar bud extract was administered. Results showed a potent anti-inflammatory activity in a similar manner as the reference drug (diclofenac, 50 mg/kg) [

Wang et al., analyzed in vivo (animal male ICR mice strain induced with LPS endotoxemia and acute pulmonary damage) the effects on acute inflammatory symptoms of an ethanolic extract obtained from poplar buds (China). Results have shown that the extract in different concentrations (25 and 100 mg/kg) exhibits significant anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-Î±) and blocking the activation of the nuclear factor [
