<p>Dudonne et al., evaluated in vitro the beneficial effects of poplar bud extract on skin aging, using the Oxygen Radical Antioxidant Capacity (ORAC) assay. Extracts (25–200 μg/mL) showed a strong modulation of gene transcription that are involved in inflammatory responses (CCL5 genes) and also cell renewal (KLF10, E2F-4 transcription factor and ZFP36L1) [

 <italic>Populus balsamifera</italic> L. buds (commonly known under the name balsam poplar) can be used to treat wounds and as a pain reliever. Balsam poplar buds are covered with bioactive compounds such as salicylates, which have been reported for antiadipogenic, analgesic and also anti-inflammatory activities [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-09-01464" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Due to their rich flavonoids components (especially pinocembrin and pinostrombin), poplar bud ethanolic extracts (20–40 µM; Poland) significantly reduced the proinflammatory interleukins, IL-6 and IL1β on an experimental in vitro model using the HGF-1 cell lines [
