<p>Debbache-Benaida et al., analyzed in vitro, the potential vascular relaxing ability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01464-f002">Figure 2</xref>) of ethanolic extract (10.4–10.1 g/L) of 
 <italic>Populus nigra</italic> L. buds (Province of Amizour, Algeria) using vascular preparation from porcine aorta precontracted with U46619, a synthetic analog of the endoperoxide prostaglandin PGH2. Results showed dose-dependent (10–1 g/L) an increase in the percentage of relaxation, which was comparable in both endothelium-intact (67.74%, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.04 mg/mL) and -denuded (72.72%, IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.075 mg/mL) rings of porcine coronary arteries. The mechanism of vasodilatation of coronary arteries was NO-independent, suggesting that the extract acts directly on smooth muscle, probably impeding the calcium inside the cell [
