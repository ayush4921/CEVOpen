<p>In a comprehensive study, Shiquin Peng et al. evaluated the antidiabetic effects of the ethanolic extract obtained from poplar buds (China). They conclude that the 50% fraction of poplar bud extract increased insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin resistance and decreased the glycated hemoglobin and glycosylated serum proteins, in vivo on an animal experimental model of diabetic mice. Furthermore, they revealed that poplar buds (50 or 100 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks) caused a more than 25% decrease in the serum insulin level of HFD- and STZ-induced T2DM model mice and were more prominent than that of metformin (100 mg/kg/day) (

It is well known that diabetes can cause different types of inflammation. In this study was also shown that this extract could reduce inflammatory factors, such as IL-6, TNF-Î±, MCP-1 and COX-2 in liver homogenate [
