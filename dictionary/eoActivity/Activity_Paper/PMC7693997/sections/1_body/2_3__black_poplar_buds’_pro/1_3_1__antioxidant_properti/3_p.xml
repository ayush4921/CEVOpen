<p>Mainar et al., evaluated the antioxidant activity of poplar buds (Spain). Using DPPH assay the research group have showed that the ethanolic extract is a powerful source of natural antioxidants, with a radical scavenging potential comparable to the well-known etalon, Trolox [

Merghache et al. evaluated the antioxidant properties of black poplar bud hydroalcoholic extracts (Algeria), using different concentrations (5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 Âµg/mL). The best antioxidant effect was elicited at the concentration of 1 mg/mL with a potential similar to the antioxidant activity of ascorbic acid [
