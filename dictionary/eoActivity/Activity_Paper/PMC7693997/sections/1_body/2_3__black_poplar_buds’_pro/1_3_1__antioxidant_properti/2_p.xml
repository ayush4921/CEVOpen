<p>Wang et al., investigated in vitro (murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cells) and in vivo (animal experimental model on male ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice) the antioxidant effects of an ethanolic extract obtained from Chinese poplar buds (
 <italic>Populus × canadensis</italic>). Results have shown that the extract in different concentrations (10–150 µg/mL in vitro and 25 and 100 mg/kg in vivo) exhibit strong free-radical scavenging activity [

Using the modified Folin Ciocalteu and photochemiluminescence methods Stanciu et al. demonstrated that the ethanolic extract of black poplar leaf-buds (Romania) present high antioxidant properties. Results have shown that the antioxidant capacity increased continuously in time from 183.85 to 391.48 nmol/mg dry weight [
