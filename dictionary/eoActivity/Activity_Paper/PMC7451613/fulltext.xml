Medicinal plants; <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic>, <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>, and <italic>Lepidium sativum</italic> which is believed to have active components that help to treat and manage various diseases were investigated for their antibacterial activities against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi, <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> and <italic>Shigella boydii</italic>. Solvent methanol and aqueous were used for extraction of crudes by means of maceration. Susceptibility testing was determined by using disc diffusion method and Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined by broth dilution method. Heat treated plant material activity against test pathogen was aimed to identify resistance capacity of plant material at different interval of time and temperature. All plant extracts under study was active against all tested pathogen after exposure to 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. The antibacterial activities of the non-heat-treated extracts of <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> were relatively low; the results of this study show that extracts of <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> have better residual antibacterial activities. Methanol extracts of all plant leaves showed highest activity as compared to the aqueous extracts. This is probably assigning the choice of extraction solvent for extracting desired active phytochemical from plants. Many of the people in the study area were illiterate and they did not have awareness about the ways use of medicinal plants. They use the medicinal plants by cooking and frying for different purposes. In the main, plant material can be affected as the temperature of treatment is increases with respect to various times of exposures.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Medicinal plants</kwd><kwd>Antibacterial activity</kwd><kwd>Disc diffusion</kwd><kwd>Heat treatment</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Medicinal plants play a key role in the development and advancement of modern studies by serving as a starting point for the development of novelties in drug (<xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">Wright, 2005</xref>) and various modern drugs were extracted from medicinal plants through the use of plant material as indigenous cure in folklore or traditional system of medicine (<xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">Verma and Singh, 2008</xref>). Plant materials will continue to play a major role in the primary health care as therapeutic remedies in many developing countries. Herbal remedies were known to treat many infectious diseases throughout the history of humankind. Thus, the discovery of medicinal plants as source of antimicrobial agents is useful in expanding the wide variety of antibiotics available (<xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">Zaidan et al., 2005</xref>). The majority of these herbal plants contain substances, which are precursors for the synthesis of conventional drugs, or substances that can be used for therapeutic purposes. Extracts which proved to be potentially effective can be used as natural alternative preventives to control food poisoning diseases and preserve food stuff avoiding health hazards of chemically antimicrobial agent applications (<xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Mostafa et al., 2018</xref>). Plants are used medicinally in different countries and are a source of many potent and powerful drugs. A number of workers have approved that medicinal plants represent a rich source of antimicrobial agents. A wide range of medicinal plant parts are being used for extract as raw drug and they possess varied medicinal properties (<xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). These medicinal plants are used against different pathogens in raw form and as extracts. It is well known that even the most synthetic drugs have their origin from plant products (<xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Malarkodi and Manoharan, 2013</xref>). Antibiotic resistance is a problem that continues to challenge the healthcare sector in a large part of the world in both developing and developed countries. The spread of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria in hospital and community settings remains a widely unresolved problem and a heavy burden to health services (<xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">Eliopoulos et al., 2003</xref>). A great efforts are being made to reverse this trend, and one of them is the wide spread screening of medicinal plants from the traditional system of medicine hoping to get some newer, safer, and more effective agents that can be used to fight infectious diseases (<xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Natarajan et al., 2003</xref>).</p><sec id="s0010"><label>1.1</label><title>Azadirachta indica</title><p id="p0010"><italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> is used in folklore medicine for the treatment of diabetes, shows the potential role of antidiabetic activity (<xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">Dholi et al., 2011</xref>).

Absence of antimicrobial activity does not mean that the bioactive compounds are not present in the plant or the plant has no antimicrobial activity against microorganisms. The present study denotes that antimicrobial activities was dose dependent and influence of solvent on extraction of metabolites required for antibacterial activity, thus the availability of plant crude extracts is depending on type of solvent used for extraction and concentration of the plant material. The aqueous extract had minimum antibacterial activity against the test organisms. This for the reason that, activities of water extracted plant material has reduced due to the fact that time used during rotary evaporator has influence on crude extracts when compared to low boiling point solvents. Hence, the aqueous extracted crude extract has lower zone of inhibition than methanol crude extracts as in the results obtained by (<xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">Dewangan et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0080">According to this study, various factors such as rotary evaporator used during extraction of crude also trigger influence on the activities of crudes based on boiling point of solvent used for extraction.

In case of <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> leaf first they ground into small peace and then they boil it very well. They do this for the sake of reducing the bad smell of the leaves because the leaves of Neem have bad smell during grinding. This is due to having no further concern with the nature of plant material and lack of awareness regarding to usage of medicinal plants. It is important to explore the nature of active constituents of plant crude extracts, including their stability to heat treatment. As heat used for treatment exposed to even less time of exposure, the value of inhibition zone was come to be zero, thus at 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C there were no antibacterial activities because it depreciate the antibacterial activity of crude extracts of plants. The higher the heating temperature, the weaker was the antibacterial effect (<xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2002</xref>).<fig id="f0010"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>The antibacterial activities of heat-treated leaf extracts against pathogenic bacteria.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0095">The extracts of all tested plant species (<italic>M.&#x000a0;oleifera, A.&#x000a0;indica</italic> and <italic>L.&#x000a0;sativum</italic>) retained their antibacterial activities after 30&#x000a0;min of heat treatment at 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C against all test pathogen. The data showed that some of the plant crude extracts were more resistant to heat treatment and shows antibacterial activities regardless of time of exposure than others as from the result. According to (<xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Ginovyan, 2017</xref>) some of the plant crude extracts retained their antimicrobial activity even after 121&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C heat exposures. This was indicated by methanol extracts of <italic>M. oleifera and L. sativum</italic>, persist there antibacterial activities against all tested pathogen after exposure for 60&#x000a0;min at temperature of 50&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C except crude extracts of <italic>L. sativum</italic> against <italic>Sh.

However, almost all aqueous extracts of plant material lost their antibacterial activities against after just 60&#x000a0;min of exposure to 50 &#x000b0;C except aqueous extracts of <italic>M. oleifera</italic> which retain its antibacterial activities against Sal.

The result was observed the same result for the control experiments as in non-heat treated plant material in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Aqueous solution used as negative control was not shown antimicrobial activities while Amoxicillin which used as positive control was shown the highest antibacterial activities against all tested pathogenic bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>3.3</label><title>Percentage&#x000a0;residual antibacterial activity</title><p id="p0100">In this study, the percentage residual antibacterial activities were calculated only for result having the highest inhibition zone (i.e. for 150&#x000a0;mg/mL and after heat treatment at 45&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min). In this study, the non-heat-treated plant extracts showed a better antibacterial activity than heat-treated ones. This is used to look thoroughly in order to understand which plant is sensitive to heat and which is resistant by comparing the percentage calculated from the result obtained before and after heat treatment. As can be seen from the <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the percentage residual antibacterial activities of crude extracts ranged from 6.7 to 35% for both solvents. The lowest values of the percentage indicate that the inhibition zone of the crude extract of heat treated and non-heat-treated plant material was more or less similar and vice versa. Although the antibacterial activities of the non-heat-treated extracts of <italic>A. indica</italic> were relatively low, the results of this study show that extracts of <italic>A. indica</italic> have better residual antibacterial activities than the other two plant extracts against all tested pathogens except <italic>Sal</italic>. Typhi. This implies that this plant has sensitive to heat as compared to the remaining two test plants.<fig id="f0015"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Percentages mean residual antibacterial activity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>3.4</label><title>Determination&#x000a0;of&#x000a0;(MIC)</title><p id="p0105">In the present study, the MIC of the extracts ranged from 1.25&#x000a0;mg/ml &#x02212;10&#x000a0;mg/mL. The MIC was determined by selecting the lowest concentration of plant extract that completely inhibited the growth of the organism in the broth medium as detected by the unaided eye. The results of the MIC determination for the different plant extracts against the test pathogens are shown in <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. The result of this study directs that, methanol crude extracts shows better antibacterial activities. The same result with <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Kinsalin et al. (2014)</xref> states that methanol extract possesses potent antimicrobial activity which in turn may be due to the presence of biologically active ingredients with antimicrobial activity in the medicinal plants. Hence, aqueous crude extracts have lower MIC as compared to methanol extracts because the plant material may contain the non-polar parts of molecules. This is due to the fact that, the polar components frequently do not dissolve non-polar components, therefore aqueous crude extracts lose some of their antibacterial activities. Whereas using water mixable solvents such as methanol were used as optional solvent to enhance the extraction of non-water soluble material, because methanol has potential to dissolve both polarities.&#x000a0;The higher MIC indicates that the plant extracts had weaker activities of killing or inhibiting the test pathogens and vice versa.&#x000a0;According to (<xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Okeke et al., 1999</xref>) the extract was more active against Gram-positive bacteria and had MIC values against different strains of like <italic>Stp.

Heat treatment of the crude extracts of medicinal plants to various times and temperatures can be gradually reduces the effectiveness of the plant material. All plants lost their antibacterial activities after exposure to 55&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C as observed from the present study. Methanol extracts of all plant leaves showed highest activity as compared to the aqueous extracts. This is probably assigning the choice of extraction solvent for extracting desired active phytochemical from plants. The minimum inhibitory concentration value was ranged from 2.5 to 10&#x000a0;mg/ML and is the lowest concentration of crude extract that completely inhibited the growth of test organism in the broth medium. In contrast to this, the minimum inhibitory concentration was evaluated for heat treated crude extracts and didn&#x02019;t show any inhibition against pathogenic growth. Generally, biological molecules can be affected as the temperature of treatment is increases with respect to various times of exposures. Accordingly, the community who need to consume medicinal plants either as nutrients or treatment of different ailments should not subject the plant material to temperature, especially above 50&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C even to make the plants texture decent for use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0115">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi005"><title>References</title><ref id="b0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="h0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amer</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Helmy</surname><given-names>W.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Taie</surname><given-names>H.A.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>In vitro antitumor and antiviral activities of seeds and leaves Neem <italic>(Azadirachta indic</italic>a) extracts</article-title><source>Int.
