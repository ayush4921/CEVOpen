<p id="p0110">Crude extracts of M. 
 <italic>oleifera</italic>, 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>L. sativum</italic> has satisfactory antibacterial effects against all test pathogen before exposed to heat. Heat treatment of the crude extracts of medicinal plants to various times and temperatures can be gradually reduces the effectiveness of the plant material. All plants lost their antibacterial activities after exposure to 55 °C as observed from the present study. Methanol extracts of all plant leaves showed highest activity as compared to the aqueous extracts. This is probably assigning the choice of extraction solvent for extracting desired active phytochemical from plants. The minimum inhibitory concentration value was ranged from 2.5 to 10 mg/ML and is the lowest concentration of crude extract that completely inhibited the growth of test organism in the broth medium. In contrast to this, the minimum inhibitory concentration was evaluated for heat treated crude extracts and didn’t show any inhibition against pathogenic growth. Generally, biological molecules can be affected as the temperature of treatment is increases with respect to various times of exposures. Accordingly, the community who need to consume medicinal plants either as nutrients or treatment of different ailments should not subject the plant material to temperature, especially above 50 °C even to make the plants texture decent for use.
