 <italic>Moringa oleifera </italic>has been used extensively in traditional medicine for the treatment of several ailments, promotes digestion, skin diseases, diarrhea, as stimulant in paralytic afflictions, epilepsy and hysteria (
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Farooq et al., 2012</xref>). It was shown to possess antimicrobial activity against wide array of pathogens (
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Thilza et al., 2010</xref>). Seeds and leave extracts show activity against different bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic action against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enteritidis, Aeromonas caviae, Pasteurellamultocida, Bacillus subtilis, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris</italic> and

 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Jabeen et al., 2008</xref>). Community in the study area use medicinal plants as sole for treatment of any type of ailments from either human or animal. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess susceptibility test of selected medicinal plant species based on their traditional medicinal uses for infectious diseases treatment in local community of Oromia, Eastern Ethiopia due to the commonness of selected strain in the area. There is a strong positive motivation for further research into the antibacterial components of 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica, Lepidium sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> considering the fact that plants are naturally endowed with a variety of bioactive compounds. Although some of these plants are cultivated as food and for other purposes in different parts of Ethiopia, there has been little study conducted in Ethiopia with respect to their antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi and 
 <italic>Shigella boydii</italic>. The objective of the study was therefore determe the antibacterial activities of non- heat and heated treated methanol and aqueous leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Lepidium sativum</italic>, 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> and 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> against selected food born bacterial pathogens
