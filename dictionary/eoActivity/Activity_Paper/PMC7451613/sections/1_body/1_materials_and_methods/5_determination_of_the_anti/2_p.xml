<p id="p0040">Mueller Hinton agar was prepared in the plates as the media for the test microorganisms. Sterile filter paper discs (Whatman N

 <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">Andrews, 2001</xref>) and the discs were sterilized. Each sterile disc was impregnated individually with 3 mg of 150 mg/ml, 125 mg/ml and 100 mg/ml concentration using a micropipette. Then discs impregnated with concentrations of non-heat treated and heat-treated plant extracts were placed on the spread plated Muller Hinton agar surface using sterile forceps. Disc impregnated with Amoxicillin (5 μg/mL) was used as positive control while a disc soaked with pure solvent of aqueous solution was used as a negative control. The Petri dishes were then incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the diameters of the zone of inhibitions were measured by using transparent ruler and the mean values of three readings were recorded.
