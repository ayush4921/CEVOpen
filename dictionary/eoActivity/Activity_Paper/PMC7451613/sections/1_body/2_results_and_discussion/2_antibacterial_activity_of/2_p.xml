 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. However, 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> has proficiency to inhibit the growth of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria regardless of the solvent used for extraction. As stated by 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">Dike-Ndudim et al. (2016)</xref> inhibition of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms by 
 <italic>M. oliefera</italic> extract depicts that it can serve as a source of broad spectrum antibiotics, which justified the traditional use of this plant for therapeutic purposes. In contrast methanol extracts of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> shows high zone of inhibition at 150Â mg/mL against 
 <italic>Stp. Aureus</italic>. The leaves, stems and seeds of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> could be an alternative for the control of infections caused by
