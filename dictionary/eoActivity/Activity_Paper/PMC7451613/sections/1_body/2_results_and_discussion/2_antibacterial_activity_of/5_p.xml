 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> shown the highest antibacterial activities against 
 <italic>Stp.aureus,</italic> and followed by methanol crude extracts of 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic> and 
 <italic>L.sativum</italic> against Sal.Typhi at 150Â mg/mL concentration as presented by figure. As from the figure, aqueous solution used as negative control was not shown antimicrobial activities while Amoxicillin which used as positive control was shown the highest antibacterial activities against all tested pathogenic bacteria. Methanol crude extracts at high concentration show better antibacterial activities to reliable points when compared with positive control as depicted on the figure.
