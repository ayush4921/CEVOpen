<p id="p0100">In this study, the percentage residual antibacterial activities were calculated only for result having the highest inhibition zone (i.e. for 150 mg/mL and after heat treatment at 45 °C for 30 min). In this study, the non-heat-treated plant extracts showed a better antibacterial activity than heat-treated ones. This is used to look thoroughly in order to understand which plant is sensitive to heat and which is resistant by comparing the percentage calculated from the result obtained before and after heat treatment. As can be seen from the 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the percentage residual antibacterial activities of crude extracts ranged from 6.7 to 35% for both solvents. The lowest values of the percentage indicate that the inhibition zone of the crude extract of heat treated and non-heat-treated plant material was more or less similar and vice versa. Although the antibacterial activities of the non-heat-treated extracts of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> were relatively low, the results of this study show that extracts of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> have better residual antibacterial activities than the other two plant extracts against all tested pathogens except 
 <italic>Sal</italic>. Typhi. This implies that this plant has sensitive to heat as compared to the remaining two test plants.
