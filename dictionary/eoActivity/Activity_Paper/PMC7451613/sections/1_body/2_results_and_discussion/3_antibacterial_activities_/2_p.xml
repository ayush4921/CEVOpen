<p id="p0090">The results showed that antibacterial activities were reduced with heat treatment from temperatures of 45–55 °C for both 30 and 60 min. Relatively higher retention of antibacterial activity was observed for 30 min of heat treatment. Previous researchers had also reported that heat treatment (including pasteurization and sterilization) could lead to decomposition of active phytochemicals (

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The activities of all crude extracts were reduced to zero by heat treatment at a temperature of 55 °C for both 30 and 60 min. Community in the study area used medicinal plants like 
 <italic>moringa oliefera,</italic> leaf for consumption by cooking; thus using the same procedure for cooking cabbage. In case of 
 <italic>Lepidium sativum</italic> they use the seeds for treatment of many stomach and intestinal diseases by frying on frying pan and leaves by cooking even if they need to treat any types of diseases either infectious or noninfectious diseases. In case of 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> leaf first they ground into small peace and then they boil it very well. They do this for the sake of reducing the bad smell of the leaves because the leaves of Neem have bad smell during grinding. This is due to having no further concern with the nature of plant material and lack of awareness regarding to usage of medicinal plants. It is important to explore the nature of active constituents of plant crude extracts, including their stability to heat treatment. As heat used for treatment exposed to even less time of exposure, the value of inhibition zone was come to be zero, thus at 55 °C there were no antibacterial activities because it depreciate the antibacterial activity of crude extracts of plants. The higher the heating temperature, the weaker was the antibacterial effect (
