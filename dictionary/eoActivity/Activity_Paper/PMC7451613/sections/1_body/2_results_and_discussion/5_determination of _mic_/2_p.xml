<p id="p0105">In the present study, the MIC of the extracts ranged from 1.25 mg/ml −10 mg/mL. The MIC was determined by selecting the lowest concentration of plant extract that completely inhibited the growth of the organism in the broth medium as detected by the unaided eye. The results of the MIC determination for the different plant extracts against the test pathogens are shown in

 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">Kinsalin et al. (2014)</xref> states that methanol extract possesses potent antimicrobial activity which in turn may be due to the presence of biologically active ingredients with antimicrobial activity in the medicinal plants. Hence, aqueous crude extracts have lower MIC as compared to methanol extracts because the plant material may contain the non-polar parts of molecules. This is due to the fact that, the polar components frequently do not dissolve non-polar components, therefore aqueous crude extracts lose some of their antibacterial activities. Whereas using water mixable solvents such as methanol were used as optional solvent to enhance the extraction of non-water soluble material, because methanol has potential to dissolve both polarities. The higher MIC indicates that the plant extracts had weaker activities of killing or inhibiting the test pathogens and vice versa. According to (
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">Okeke et al., 1999</xref>) the extract was more active against Gram-positive bacteria and had MIC values against different strains of like
