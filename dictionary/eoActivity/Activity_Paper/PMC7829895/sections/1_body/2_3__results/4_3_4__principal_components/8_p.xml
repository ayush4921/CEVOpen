<p>In a study by Takshak et al. [
 <xref rid="B53-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], it was seen that supplementation of UVB radiation in 
 <italic>Coleus forskohlii</italic> (or 
 <italic>P. barbatus</italic>) favored phenylpropanoid paths generating production of flavonoids, for example. On the other hand, it was seen on the same study, that UVB radiation also induced an increase of carotenoids production in the leaves of this species, such as lycopene and Î²-carotene for its protection. So, although it is necessary more studies to confirm UV radiation role in secondary metabolites production in 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>, it is possible to suggest that another biosynthetic path may be favored to increase its SPF.
