<p>These results are corroborated by Dolzhenko et al. [
 <xref rid="B52-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], who evaluated the influence of UVB radiation on polyphenols production in 
 <italic>Mentha x piperita</italic> L. species. In their study, it was seen that polyphenols content increased after irradiation of the plant with UVB radiation, and it stimulated the production of flavonoids with light-absorbing properties at the wavelength corresponding to UVB radiation, such as eriocitrin, hesperidin, and kaempferol 7-O-rutinoside, and it also caused production decrease of narirutin, 4â€²-methoxykaempferol 7-O-rutinoside, suggesting a possible transformation of these latest flavonoids cited in those with increased production. The same study also showed that there is a decrease in essential oils production in 
 <italic>M. piperita</italic> and an increase on polyphenols production and suggests a correlation between these results, showing that UVB radiation may favor one biosynthetic path over another.
