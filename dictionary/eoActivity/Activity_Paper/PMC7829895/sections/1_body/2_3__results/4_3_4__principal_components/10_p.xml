<p>In addition, it is also important to highlight that as seen in a review made by Gobbo-neto and Lopes [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], certain polyphenols may have their production increased, as in the case of 
 <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> in which the proportion of luteolin glycosides/apigenin glycosides increases by the influence of exposure to UVB radiation. In this situation, although the absorption capacity of UVB rays does not increase, because luteolin derivates are more efficient in disperse observed energy, it causes an increase of defense antioxidant levels in the plant. The same observation was made in the flavonoids/hydroxycinnamates ratio, with an increase in this proportion being seen by induction of UVB radiation. So, it is seen that the ability to act as an antioxidant and not only as an absorber of UVB radiation, it is important to define which metabolites will be produced to act against UVB rays. Thus, more studies need to be done to better understand the metabolic changes mainly in
