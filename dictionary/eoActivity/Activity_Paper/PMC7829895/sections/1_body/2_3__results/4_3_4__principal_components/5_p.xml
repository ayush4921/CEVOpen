<p>Another parameter observed was the influence of the solar radiation on the concentration of studied secondary metabolites and its consequences to SPF. Thus, evaluating the linear projection presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00110-f008">Figure 8</xref>, it is seen that the solar radiation has great influence on increasing or decreasing SPF in 
 <italic>M. villosa.</italic> In months when both solar radiation and polyphenols production are higher, SPF of 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> extracts increases. However, in months when production of flavonoids and RA is high, but the level of solar radiation is lower, SPF is also lower, suggesting that production of specific components with photoprotective properties is stimulated by solar radiation.
