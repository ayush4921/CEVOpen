<p>In 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> samples, different observations were made. Through 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00110-f008">Figure 8</xref>, it is seen that the solar radiation does not seem to have an influence as directed as in 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic>, because although SPF was high in samples when solar radiation was higher compared to others, the same observation was made when RA and flavonoids concentrations are higher, and the sample with the highest SPF is found when polyphenols content is higher, but radiation level is lower.
