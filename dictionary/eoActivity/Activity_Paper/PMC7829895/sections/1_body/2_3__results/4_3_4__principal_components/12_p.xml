<p>According to Gobbo-neto and Lopes [
 <xref rid="B8-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], there are controversies about what can occur in polyphenol production depending on environmental levels of precipitation, showing that its production can be increased or decreased, with no trend or pattern to be followed, suggesting that there is no clear correlation between these metabolites concentrations and hydric stress, but short periods of dryness can lead to an increase of phenolic compounds production. Studies such as Gomes et al. [
