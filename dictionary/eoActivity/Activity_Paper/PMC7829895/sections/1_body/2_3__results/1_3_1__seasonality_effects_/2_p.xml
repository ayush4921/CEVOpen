<p>When the two species were evaluated individually, it was possible to observe that there was no statistical difference in total polyphenols content in several months of different seasons of the year in both 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>, showing that their production does not obey a specific trend for each season, e.g., January, which belongs to summer season did not show statistical difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) when compared to April (autumn), August (winter), or October (spring). Thus, these results added to the fact that there are no well-defined seasons at the region where plants were collected, justified by their geographical location close to the equator line, seasons seem to have less influence in the variation of these metabolites concentration. Similar results were observed in a study by Wo≈∫niak et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], where the concentrations of most polyphenols remained constant during different seasons, showing that they did not influence the variation of these metabolites.
