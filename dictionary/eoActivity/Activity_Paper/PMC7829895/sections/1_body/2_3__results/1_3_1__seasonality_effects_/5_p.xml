<p>According to a previous study by Terto et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and unpublished data [
 <xref rid="B41-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], it was seen that RA was the most produced compound in CEE of aerial parts of 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>, and so because of this, its variation was also evaluated. Thus, it was observed that 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> had the highest concentrations of this metabolite in a good part of the year and the only month that there was no statistical difference in RA content between the two species was August, when they showed statistically equal production, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceutics-13-00110-f003">Figure 3</xref>. The best month for 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> harvest was September (39.28 mg/g) and to 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>, it was observed that in six months of the year, RA concentrations remained practically constant, and it did not show statistical difference among them. These months were January, May, June, July, October, November, and December. Absolute values ranged from 39.46 to 44.24 mg/g, tables containing values of polyphenols, flavonoids and RA content of all months can be found in
