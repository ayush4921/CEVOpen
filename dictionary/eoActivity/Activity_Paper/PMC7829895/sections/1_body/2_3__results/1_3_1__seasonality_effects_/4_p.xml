<p>As observed for total polyphenols content, when the two species are evaluated individually, it was seen that there was no statistical difference of flavonoids concentration in several months of different seasons in 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>, indicating that their production also did not obey a specific trend to each season, which shows that seasons seem to have less influence in variation of flavonoids quantitatively production.
