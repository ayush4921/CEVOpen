<p>When is considered that in this test were only used plant extracts of the two studied species incorporated at 10% in Polawax
 <sup>Â®</sup> cream, it is possible to suggest that these results are promising in the photoprotection area, since reaching SPF levels close to 15 without the addition of any synthetic sunscreen is not easy, as shows the study made by Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], that evaluated the SPF of 
 <italic>Schinus terebinthifolius</italic> Raddi ethanolic extracts and none formulation composed only but extracts had SPF above 5.08. In another study made by Mota et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], it was evaluated SPF of 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> ethanolic extract and they found SPF = 1. Similarly, Mota et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] evaluated SPF of 
 <italic>Nephelium lappaceum</italic> L. ethanolic extract (peels) and its SPF = 0.4.
