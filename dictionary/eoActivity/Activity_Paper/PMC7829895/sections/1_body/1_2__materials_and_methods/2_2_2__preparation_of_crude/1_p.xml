<p>Fresh aerial parts (500 g) of 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> were crushed and submitted to maceration in 96% ethanol for three consecutive days; this process was repeated three times. 4 l of ethanol was used in the maceration process of 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 3 l of ethanol for 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>. After maceration, extracted solutions were concentrated using rotary evaporator equipment at 40 Â°C to obtain the crude ethanolic extracts (CEE) of the two species, weighing approximately 11.5 g for 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> and 12.37 g for 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic>. The maceration process was repeated every month of 2019 right after aerial parts harvest, resulting in 12 
 <italic>M. x villosa</italic> ethanolic extracts and 12 
 <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> ethanolic extratcs. All of these extracts were used in every test made.
