<p>Flavonoids content was evaluated by the spectrophotometric method proposed by Schmidt and Ortega, [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] with adaptations, using aluminum chloride (AlCl
 <sub>3</sub>) as a reagent. Thus, 0.1 mL of AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (2.5%) was added to 0.1 mL of samples (1 mg/mL) in 96 well plates. The mixture was kept away from light for 30 min, and later, absorbance was measured at 410 nm, using a spectrophotometer UV-Visivel (UV-2550, Shimadzu) [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The assay was made in triplicate and flavonoids total content was calculated through a linear regression equation obtained from the quercetin calibration curve (5; 25; 50; 100 and 200 Î¼g/mL). Results were expressed as mg of quercetin/g of sample.
