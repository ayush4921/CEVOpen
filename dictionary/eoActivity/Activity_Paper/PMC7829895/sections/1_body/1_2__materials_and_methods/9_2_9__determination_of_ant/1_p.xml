<p>DPPH method was applied for this assay [
 <xref rid="B45-pharmaceutics-13-00110" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], using methanol as a solvent. Thus, in 96 well plates, DPPH solution at 0.3 mM (100 μL) was added to 100 μL of different concentrations of extracts of both plants studied (usually 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 μg/mL were used, but in certain samples, it was also necessary to use 320 μg/mL). This reaction remained at rest and away from light for 30 min and subsequently, the reading was done on a spectrophotometer UV-Visivel (UV-2550, Shimadzu) at 518 nm. This assay was performed on samples of all months in triplicate and, free radical scavenging activity (SA) of each concentration used was calculated by the following Equation (1). After calculating SA, calibration curves were done and results were expressed as CE
