<p>The method used for quantification of RA in 
 <italic>M. villosa</italic> begins at 38% of solvent B, reaching 42% in 5 min and remains at this concentration until 9 min. From 9 to 12 min, the gradient is altered from 42 to 45% of solvent B and it reaches 50% in 15 min. From 15 to 17 min, the gradient returns to 45%, and it remains unchanged until 20 min, when it returns to the initial condition at 38% of mobile phase B, and the run stops at 24 min at this concentration. The flow rate used was 1 mL/min, oven temperature at 26 °C, the injection volume of 20 µL, the detection was performed at 330 nm by a diode array UV (DAD). In addition, extract and standard samples were made in triplicate and filtered with the diluent solution at a concentration of 50% : 50% MeOH : acidified water (0.1% of H
 <sub>3</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>).
