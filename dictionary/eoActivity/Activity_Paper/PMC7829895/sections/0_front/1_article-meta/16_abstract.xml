 <p>Secondary metabolite production by plants is influenced by external environmental factors that can change depending on the seasons, which makes it important to know how the plant, through its metabolism, is able to adapt to these variations
  <italic>. Mentha x villosa</italic> and 
  <italic>Plectranthus amboinicus</italic> present in their chemical composition polyphenols, and through previous studies, it has been seen that these two species present promising in vitro photoprotective activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate seasonal alterations in photoprotective and antioxidant activities and the influence of factors such as precipitation levels and sun radiation incidence. Thus, polyphenol quantification, cromatographics (HPLC-DAD) and multivariate (PCA) analyses of extracts of the two species through twelve months were done. It was observed that the best months for photoprotective and antioxidant activities were September for 
  <italic>M. villosa</italic> and July for 
  <italic>P. amboinicus</italic> (SPF = 14.79). It was possible to conclude that solar radiation more clearly influences the production of phenolics and the increase of SPF in 
  <italic>M. villosa,</italic> in addition to favoring the antioxidant activity of the two species, while precipitation seems to have no influence.
