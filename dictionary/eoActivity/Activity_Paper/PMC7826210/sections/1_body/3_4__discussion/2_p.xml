<p>Rb3 is a representative triterpenoid saponin isolated from ginseng, which could exert various biological activities in the apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and others. Recent studies suggested that Rb3 could serve as a protective agent to alleviate the injury of kidney tissue, cardiomyocyte, and hippocampus [

 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism confirmed that Rb3 suppressed the expression of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> induced by CPT in the kidney tissue of the xenograft nude mice model bearing oral tumor and in renal cells GP-293 and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in GP-293 cells.
