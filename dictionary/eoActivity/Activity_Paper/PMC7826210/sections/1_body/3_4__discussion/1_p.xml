<p>CPT has been commonly used in the treatment of oral cancer clinically for several decades; however, the toxicity to normal tissue including the kidney limited its benefits as an effective antitumor agent. Although it was in the vague understanding that how CPT induced kidney toxicity, some shreds of evidence have shown that the pathway of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, autophagy, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are associated with the kidney toxicity by CPT. Additionally, the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> pathway plays a vital role in the kidney injury via kidney fibrosis, macrophage infiltration, and cellular apoptosis. However, the role of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> in CPT-evoked kidney toxicity is rarely reported. In the present study, we found that CPT could induce the expression of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> in the kidney tissue of the xenograft nude mice model bearing oral tumor and in the human renal epithelial cells GP-293; furthermore, CPT could also mediate the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway characterizing by the expression and phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 in GP-293 cells. The results demonstrated that TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> might take part in CPT-evoked kidney toxicity.
