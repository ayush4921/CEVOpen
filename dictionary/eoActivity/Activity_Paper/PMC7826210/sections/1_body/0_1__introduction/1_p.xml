<p>Oral cancer, occurring in the oral cavity and lip, is the sixth most common carcinoma and accounts for approximately 300,000 new cases around the earth [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The lack of early diagnosis strategy to oral cancer delayed the treatment and led to the dismal survival rates and mortality in oral cancer [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to the statistics, there are 145,000 patients of oral cancer who died in 2012 [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Oral cancer has caused an alarming mental and health burden in human [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although there are plentiful of therapy methods for oral cancer in clinic and theory, the effective strategy for cancer treatment remains a challenge [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Currently, chemotherapy is still one of the usual therapies to various cancers including oral cancer [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and cisplatin (CPT) is an essential chemotherapeutical agent wildly applied to oral cancer for years [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, CPT could kill almost all of the contacted cells of normal and cancer cells in the body, which lead to the toxicity to normal tissues such as the heart, kidney, and liver [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The lack of selectivity to cells restricted the clinic application of CPT in treating against oral cancer [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Excitingly, recent research studies have shown that several traditional Chinese herb extractions and their components could suppress CPT-trigged liver impairment, kidney injury, and myocardial damage [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Among these active herb extractions and components, it was reported that Rb3 could alleviate CPT-evoked kidney injury in the cancer model [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, the potential effect and mechanism of Rb3 on the kidney toxicity during CTP treating against oral cancer remain obscure. Therefore, it is urgent to elucidate the kidney protective role of Rb3 in the process of CPT-treating oral cancer for Rb3's medicinal development and the clinic treatment of oral cancer.
