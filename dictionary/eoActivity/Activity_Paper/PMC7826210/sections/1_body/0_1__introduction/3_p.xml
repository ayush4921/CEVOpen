<p>In the present study, we aimed to confirm the role of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> in the CPT-evoked kidney toxicity during the treatment of oral cancer and elucidate the underlying mechanism that Rb3 alleviates kidney toxicity by CPT via TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. First, the xenograft nude mice model bearing oral carcinoma cells ACC83 was constructed. The kidney toxicity by CPT, the protective effect of Rb3, and the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> expression in kidney tissue were evaluated. Second, the human renal epithelial GP-293 cells were employed to determine the effect of Rb3 and CPT on the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway and mitochondrial apoptosis. Finally, the role of the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway on Rb3 suppressing mitochondrial apoptosis evoked by CPT in GP-293 cells was studied.
