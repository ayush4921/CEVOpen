<p>Bodyweight and histopathology are standard methods for the evaluation of medicinal toxicity. In the control group, the bodyweight of xenograft nude mice bearing oral carcinoma cells ACC83 had a linear increase from 0 to 28 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). The mice injected with CPT displayed a horizontal linearity in bodyweight which was evident beneath compared with that of the control group, demonstrating that CPT caused the bodyweight loss of mice. Expectedly, ginsenoside Rb3 (the structure shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(a)</xref>) administration by gavage at 20 mg/kg dosage in CPT + Rb3 groups alleviated the loss of bodyweight caused by CPT as determined by the bodyweight curve close to that of the control group. Furthermore, histopathology analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(c)</xref>) showed that numerous necrotic areas were found in the kidney tissue of the CPT group rather than that of the control group. Meanwhile, ginsenoside Rb3 pretreatment inhibited the necrosis of kidney tissue caused by CPT. These results indicated that ginsenoside Rb3 could protect against the CPT-evoked kidney toxicity in xenograft nude mice bearing an oral tumor.
