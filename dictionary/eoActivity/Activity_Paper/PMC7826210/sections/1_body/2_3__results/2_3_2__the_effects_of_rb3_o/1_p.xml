<p>The level of TGF-

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref>), kidney tissue of mice in the control group presented a normal cellular morphology and TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> expression. In contrast, CPT injection promoted the induction of deformed cellular morphology and TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> expression compared with these of the control group (

 <italic>β</italic> expression and repaired the deformed cellular morphology in kidney tissue, and its levels were similar with these in the control group (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2(b)</xref>). Additionally, Western blotting assay revealed the similar changing trend of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> expression with data obtained by immunohistochemical staining, which was that CPT induced the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> expression and Rb3 suppressed the induction of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> expression by CTP in kidney tissues of xenograft nude mice bearing oral tumor.
