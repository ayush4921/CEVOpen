<p>Caspases play an essential role in initiating and executing the cellular apoptosis process. The ELISA assay and Western blotting were employed to examine the activities and cleaved level of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 in GP-293 cells, and the results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"> Figure 6(a)</xref> displayed that the cells exposed to CPT had an apparent increase of activities in caspase 3 (7.4 folds,

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) compared with those of cells in the control group, whereas Rb3 inhibited the activities of the three caspases induced by CPT in the varying degree. Besides, Western blotting showed that CPT induced the cleaved levels of caspases and Rb3 suppressed the induction (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(b)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(c)</xref>). The changing trends of the cleaved level of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 are consistent with that of caspases activities in
