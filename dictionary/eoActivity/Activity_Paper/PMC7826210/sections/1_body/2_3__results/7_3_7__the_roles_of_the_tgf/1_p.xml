<p>The information mentioned above has shown that Rb3 could mediate the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway and endogenous apoptosis. To illuminate whether the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway is essential to Rb3 suppressing endogenous apoptosis evoked by CPT, we further used the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> pathway inhibitor of disitertide in human renal epithelial GP-293 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7(a)</xref>, the apoptosis ratio of the cells under the condition of CPT treatment was 24.3 ± 4.1% and Rb3 administration significantly suppressed the cellular apoptosis ratio to 4.3 ± 1.9%. However, after pretreatment with disitertide and Rb3, the cellular apoptosis ratio of 18.0 ± 3.1% was not a statistical decrease compared with that in the CPT group, which was opposite to that only Rb3 administration could just relieve the apoptosis ratio evoked by CPT. Moreover, Western blotting assay showed that Rb3 inhibited the expression of Bax and induced Bcl-2 expression compared with the CPT group, while combinational administration of Rb3 and disitertide deprived Rb3 of the rights mediating Bax and Bcl-2 expression. These results demonstrated that the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway is essential to Rb3 suppressing endogenous apoptosis evoked by CPT.
