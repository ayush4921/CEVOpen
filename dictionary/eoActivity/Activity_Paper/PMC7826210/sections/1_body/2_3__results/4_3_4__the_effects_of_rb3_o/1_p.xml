<p>To confirm the role of cellular apoptosis in Rb3-protecting CPT-evoked toxicity, flow cytometry of dual-staining of FITC-Annexin V/PI and Western blotting were performed to detect cellular apoptosis in human renal epithelial GP-293 cells. As shown in the quadrant scatter spot graphs of flow cytometry (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(a)</xref>), the cells in the control group exhibited an apoptosis ratio of only 2.88% ± 1.43%, while the apoptosis ratio of the cells exposed to CPT rose to 18.10% ± 1.28% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(b)</xref>) and demonstrated that CPT significantly induced the cellular apoptosis in GP-293 cells. After the supplement of Rb3 at different concentrations, the apoptosis ratio of cells gradually decreased with the rising of Rb3 concentration, and the higher dose of 2 
 <italic>μ</italic>M and 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>M Rb3 had statistical differences in apoptosis ratio compared with that of the CPT group (

Furthermore, the cleaved level of PARP (poly ADP-ribose polymerase), a usual and classic indicator of apoptosis, was detected using Western blotting and displayed a consistent with the results of flow cytometry. The cleaved level of PARP in the CPT group was induced compared with that in the control group (
