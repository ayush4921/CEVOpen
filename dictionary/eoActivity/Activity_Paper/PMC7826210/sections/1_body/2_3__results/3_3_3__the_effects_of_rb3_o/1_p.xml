<p>To further evaluate the effect of Rb3 on the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway, we detected the expression and phosphorylation level of Smad2 and Smad3 using Western blotting assay in human renal epithelial GP-293 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the expression level of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> of cells exposed to CTP was induced compared with that in the control group which is consistent with the data mice (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(e)</xref>) and but no statistical changing in the expression of Smad2 and Smad3. Following the treatment with Rb3 at different concentrations, the TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> expression level and phosphorylation level of Smad2 and Smad3 in GP-293 cells were suppressed compared to the CPT group, and its suppression level was concentration-dependent. Together, the data in vivo/in vitro imply that CPT could mediate TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> expression and its pathways and Rb3 possesses the suppression abilities to the CPT-mediated TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> signal pathway.
