<p>The above dewaxed slices were put into the boiled solution of citrate for antigen retrieval and then blocked in 10% goat serum at room temperature for 1 hour. The blocking slices were added 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L diluted solution of a primary antibody of TGF-
 <italic>β</italic> (1 : 500 dilution) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hour, washed with PBS for three times followed by the secondary antibody for another 1 hour. After washing with PBS for three times, the slices were colored with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L amount of the fresh chromogenic reagent of DAB and stained with hematoxylin for 30 seconds. The running water washed the slices for 20 minutes to cease the staining. Finally, the stained kidney tissues were dehydrated in the solution of 95% alcohol I for 3 seconds, 95% alcohol II for 3 seconds, anhydrous alcohol for 5 minutes, xylene-alcohol (1 : 1) for 5 minutes, xylene I for 2 minutes, and xylene II for 2 minutes in tune and coverslipped with neutral resins for detecting and imaging using a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany).
