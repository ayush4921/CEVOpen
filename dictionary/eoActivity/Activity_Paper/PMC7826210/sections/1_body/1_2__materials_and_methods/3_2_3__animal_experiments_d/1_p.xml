<p>The nude mice bearing oral tumor were divided into four groups: control, CPT, CPT +  low Rb3, and CPT + high Rb3 groups. The control group was administrated with saline once daily for continuous 28 days. The CPT group was intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg cisplatin every other day for 28 days. The CPT + low Rb3 and CPT + high Rb3 groups were administrated with 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg ginsenoside Rb3, respectively, once daily, and the same cisplatin injection for the CPT group for 28 days. Bodyweight of mice was measured once weekly. At the end of the treatment on 28
