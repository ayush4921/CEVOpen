<p>After euthanizing, the kidneys from all groups of nude mice were collected. The left kidneys were washed with precooled phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and stored in an ultralow temperature freezer of −80°C for the following Western blotting experiment. The right kidneys were cut into the squares (0.7 cm × 0.7 cm) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for more than 24 hours. The fixed squares of kidneys were embedded in paraffin, sliced in 3 
 <italic>μ</italic>m thickness, and then adhered to slides. The sliced thin kidney samples were dewaxed via continuously placing in the solution of xylene I for 10 min, xylene II for 10 min, anhydrous alcohol I for 5 min, anhydrous alcohol II for 5 min, 95% alcohol for 5 min, 90% alcohol for 5 min, 80% alcohol for 5 min, and 70% alcohol for 5 min, respectively, and then washed with distilled water. The dewaxed slides were further stained with hematoxylin for 5 min and eosin for 3 min. At last, the stained kidney tissues were dehydrated in the solution of 95% alcohol, anhydrous alcohol, and xylene in tune and coverslipped with neutral resins for detecting and imaging using a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany).
