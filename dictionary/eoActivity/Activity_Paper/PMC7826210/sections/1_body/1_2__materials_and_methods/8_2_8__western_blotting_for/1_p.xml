<p>The GP-293 cells treated by CTP and/or Rb3 were harvested and lysed with RIPA buffer. The total protein concentration of cell lysates was detected using BCA kit and then was denatured with loading buffer under the condition of boiling. 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of the total denatured proteins were loaded and subjected to the sodium dodecyl sulphate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for protein separation. The separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in Tris buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hour, the PVDF membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies against TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>, Smad2, Smad3, p-Smad2, p-Smad3, Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, and cleaved caspase 9 at 4°C overnight, and the antibody of 
 <italic>β</italic>-actin was employed as an internal reference. The PVDF membranes were washed with TBST three times and further incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 hours. Finally, the corresponding target on the PVDF membrane was probed using ECL reagent.
