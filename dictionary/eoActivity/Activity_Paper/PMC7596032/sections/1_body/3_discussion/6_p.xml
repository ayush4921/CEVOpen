<p>Nrf2 binds to negative regulator protein keap1 and is sequestered in the cytoplasm and inhibited under basal conditions. Nrf2 is activated in the nucleus when cells suffer oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Pandey 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). The binding of activated Nrf2 to the antioxidant response element (ARE) initiates antioxidant gene transcription and synthesis of phase II enzymes such as GCLC, GST, HO-1, SOD1, and SOD2. Phase II enzymes protect cells against oxidative stress and thus constitute a protective antioxidant defense system (

 </xref> indicate that phenolic compounds can increase Nrf2 levels to enhance the levels of phase II enzymes GCLC, GCLM, and GST, and increase the GSH production of non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. An increase in HO-1 activity allows cells to avoid oxidative damage (
