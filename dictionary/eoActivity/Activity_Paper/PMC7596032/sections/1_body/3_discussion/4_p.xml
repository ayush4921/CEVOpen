<p>Our results showed that dietary supplementation with RC powder had no effect on egg weight, eggshell strength, Haugh unit, or shell thickness. However, egg yolk color was significantly increased. This result is similar to 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Cayan and Erener (2015)</xref>, who reported that supplementation with olive leaf (
 <italic>Olea europaea</italic>) powder has no significant effect on egg weight in laying hens but significantly increases egg yolk color. Similar results were obtained by 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Ghasemi 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)
 </xref>, who found that the addition of garlic and thyme does not affect the Haugh unit or eggshell thickness but increases egg yolk color and egg weight. We speculated that the yolk color in the RC-supplemented group was due to the carotenoid pigment in RC. The depth of pigmentation of the egg yolk reflected the level of carotenoids in the feed. Consumers in most countries prefer eggs with a deeply colored yolk, which increases consumer acceptance and increases profits (

However, the result of phytogenic supplementation on egg quality is influenced by the different types of phytochemicals and active materials available, which are dependent on the parts of the plant, geographic location, harvesting season, etc. Moreover, egg quality is also affected by the variety of laying hens and the feeding environment (
