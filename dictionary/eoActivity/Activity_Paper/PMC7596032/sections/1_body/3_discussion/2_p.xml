<p>The chemical antioxidant capacity of plants cannot be determined by a single evaluation method since it is achieved via the interaction of multiple compounds (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Atere 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). Therefore, this study used five methods for measuring antioxidant capacity to demonstrate the antioxidant capacity of the RCE. Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> produced in animals causes the generation of hydroxyl radicals, leading to lipid oxidation. 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Chvátalová 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, (2008)
 </xref> reported that polyphenols in plants can chelate transition metal ions. RCE could also chelate ferrous ion and reduce peroxidation of ferrous thereby inhibit hydroxyl radicals produce and further decrease the liposome oxidation (

 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Loganayaki 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)
 </xref> reported that the antioxidant activity in the extract reduced the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>/ferricyanide complex to its ferrous form. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, the RCE donates electrons and hydrogen atoms to break free radical chains and prevent the formation of peroxide (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). Antioxidants provide the hydrogen ions needed to transform DPPH radicals into DPPH-H; therefore, DPPH radicals can be used to evaluate the ability of natural compounds to provide hydrogen ions (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009
 </xref>). TEAC assays are widely used to evaluate the total amount of free radicals that can be scavenged by antioxidants (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Arts 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004
 </xref>). However, based on the results of these two analyses, RCE did not demonstrate good scavenging ability. Natural phenolic compounds have a wide variety of molecular structures, so they have distinct free radical scavenging activities due to hydroxylation, glycosylation, and methoxylation (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Cai 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006
 </xref>). In the current study, the antioxidant properties, including ferric-reducing antioxidant power (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), reducing power (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>), and inhibition of liposome oxidation (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), demonstrated that the RCE contained abundant phenolic and flavonoid components. In addition, it showed that RC had a high antioxidant capacity.
