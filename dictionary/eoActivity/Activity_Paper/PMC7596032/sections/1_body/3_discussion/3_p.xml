<p>The benefits of dietary supplementation in poultry with phytogenics have previously been investigated (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Lin 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref> reported that dietary supplementation with mulberry leaves improves the performance of laying hens since their antioxidant status improved. Our results showed that 0.5% supplementation with RC improved the FCR (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05), which could also be explained by the increased antioxidants in the hens. Our results are similar to those of 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Amirshekari 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)
 </xref>, who reported that an increase in antioxidants does not necessarily lead to a better production performance. This was verified by 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Lee 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2013)
 </xref> who found that dietary supplementation with 0.5% 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> L., versus higher concentrations, generates the best FCR in broilers.
