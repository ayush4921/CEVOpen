<p>The reducing power of RCE was measured using the methods described by 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Oyaizu (1986)</xref>. RCE was mixed with phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and potassium ferricyanide (1%). The mixture was incubated at 50Â°C for 20 min, before the reaction was terminated by adding 2.5 mL 10% trichloroacetic acid. Five milliliters of the upper layer of the solution was then mixed with the same volume of distilled water and 0.1% ferric trichloride. After 10 min of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 700 nm using a spectrophotometer and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as the control. Increased reaction mixture absorbance indicated greater reducing power.
