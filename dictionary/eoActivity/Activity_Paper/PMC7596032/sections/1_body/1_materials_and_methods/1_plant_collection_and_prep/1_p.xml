<p>RC leaves were obtained from the Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station of the Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan. The leaves were dried at 50°C for 3 h, and then crushed into a fine powder (particle size approximately 1 mm) before being added to the feed. Additionally, RC powder was weighed and added to distilled water, which was extracted at 95°C for 2 h. The solution was then filtered (Advantec No. 1, Tokyo, Japan) to obtain the RC extract (RCE), which was stored at −20°C for further analysis.</p>
