<p>The ferrous ion-chelating capacity of the RCE is represented in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. Compared to 0.1 mg/mL EDTA, the chelating capacity of RCE was 56.24% at a concentration of 2 mg/mL. The increasing chelating capacity of the RCE slowed once the RCE concentration exceeded 2 mg/mL and increased only slightly beyond that. 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> illustrates the reducing power of the RCE. The reducing power of 1 mg/mL RC was 1.17 times better than 1 mg/mL of BHT. The reducing power of RC increased slightly with increased concentration. The free radical scavenging capacity of the RCE is represented in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>. With 0.25 mg/mL, the scavenging effect of BHT was 87.6%, and the RCE exhibited scavenging effects of 16.8% and 26.7% with 0.125 and 0.25 mg/mL, respectively. 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> represents the TEAC value of the RCE. A TEAC value of 12.5 mg/mL was slightly higher than the TEAC value for ascorbic acid (6.25 mg/mL). The TEAC observed when 25 mg/mL of the RCE was added was approximately equivalent to 1.5625 mg/mL BHT. 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> illustrates the liposome oxidation inhibition ability of the RCE. When the BHT concentration was 2.5 mg/mL, its inhibitory ability was 63.76%, which gradually increased with its concentration. For 10 mg/mL of vitamin C, the inhibitory ability was 58.67%, which gradually increased with concentration. In comparison, RCE concentrations of 10 mg/mL and 20 mg/mL demonstrated inhibitory abilities of 35.29% and 51.06%, respectively. The increase in the RCE's inhibitory ability decreased once the RCE concentration exceeded 20 mg/mL and increased only slightly after that.
