    "This study evaluated the antioxidant capacity of <i>Ricinus communis</i> L. (RC) leaves and powder when used as a feed additive for laying hens. Results showed that the total phenolic content of the aqueous leaf extract of <i>Ricinus communis</i> L. (RCE) was 48.39 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram dry weight (DW). The flavonoid content was 9.76 mg quercetin dihydrate equivalent (QE)/g DW. Ferrous chelating activity was approximately 56.2% with an RCE concentration of 1 mg/mL; the highest chelating activity was 91.2% with 4 mg/mL extract. The reducing power of 1 mg/mL RC was 1.17 times better than 1 mg/mL butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) value of 12.5 mg/mL RCE was equivalent to 3.09 mg/mL Trolox. RCE (10 mg/mL) had a lipid oxidative inhibition capacity of 35.3%. A total of 80 ISA brown laying hens at twenty-nine weeks of age were randomly allocated into the control or 1 of 3 treatment groups; the latter received 0.5%, 1% or 2% of RC, respectively, for 12 weeks. Results showed that the RC supplementation improved the feed conversion rate and 0.5% RC generated the best results. Additionally, the egg yolk score was significantly increased in all RC-supplemented groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference in serum characteristics between the treatment groups. Serum antioxidant enzyme activity showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity increased in the RC-supplemented groups relative to the control but was not significantly different. mRNA expression levels of the antioxidant regulatory genes <i>GCLC</i>, <i>GST, HO-1, SOD1</i>, and <i>SOD2</i> were significantly increased with 2% RC supplementation. In summary, RC is a suitable feed additive for laying hens and the addition of 0.5% RC leaf powder resulted in the greatest benefits."
