<p>This assay was performed according to Campana et al. [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Briefly, THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB-202) were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL gentamicin at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The medium was renewed twice a week when the cell concentration reached 1.0 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL. The cells were transferred to a 96-well microplate at a concentration of 100,000 cells per well and incubated for 18 h with RPMI supplemented with 1% FBS to initiate serum starvation, which was kept throughout the experiment.
