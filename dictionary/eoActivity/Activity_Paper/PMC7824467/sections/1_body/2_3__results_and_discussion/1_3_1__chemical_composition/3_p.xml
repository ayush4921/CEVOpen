<p>Although a few studies evaluated the EO composition from 
 <italic>Brachylaena huillensis</italic> aerial parts, only three studies reported the essential oil composition from the wood or saw powder of this species [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Although no detailed composition has been reported, α‑amorphene was the dominant constituent in the studies of Klein and Schmidt [
 <xref rid="B70-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] and of Maitai et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (17% and 15%, respectively), whereas β-caryophyllene (19%) was the major constituent described by Oliva et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, α‑amorphene was the second main component, together with gleenol (both 6%), whereas β-caryophyllene was found only in trace amounts. Baarschers et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00050" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] reported the isolation of diterpenes from 
 <italic>Spirostachys africana</italic> wood, but no previous studies addressed the EO composition from the wood.
