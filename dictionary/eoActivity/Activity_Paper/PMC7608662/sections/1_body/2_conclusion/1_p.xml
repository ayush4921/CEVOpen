 <italic>Thymus albicans</italic> essential oil showed a broad spectrum antifungal activity. The oil was able to inhibit germ tube formation and biofilm integrity in 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which are two key virulent factors of this highly prevalent etiologic agent of topical and invasive candidiasis in humans. In addition, at concentrations devoid of toxicity, 
 <italic>Thymus albicans</italic> essential oil was able to reduce the production of the pro-inflammatory mediator NO. This anti-inflammatory effect was shown to be partly related to the reduction of iNOS levels.
