<p id="Par14">Among 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species, 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is the main etiological agent of candidiasis and one of the main causes of hospital-acquired infections
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. The pathogenicity of 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> is associated with two major virulence factors: germ tube and biofilm formation. The germ tube (filamentation) confers increased resistance to phagocytosis and allows the penetration into deeper layers of the mucosa leading to invasive infections
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. Biofilms, formed on both implanted medical devices and host tissues, potentiate 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> dissemination and increase its resistance to conventional drugs
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup>. They act as reservoirs of multi-resistant yeast cells, which upon filamentation trigger resistant systemic infections. Despite the major role of these virulence factors in the pathogenesis of invasive 
 <italic>Candida</italic> infections, to date, no-specific germ tube and biofilm antifungal drugs are available.
