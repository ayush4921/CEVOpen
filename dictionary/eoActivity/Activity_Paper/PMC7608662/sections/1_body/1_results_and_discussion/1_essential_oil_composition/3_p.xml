  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>
 </sup> reporting a yield of 2.2%. This yield is quite relevant since it is higher than that obtained with industrially relevant species, such as 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic>, 
 <italic>T. zygis</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mastichina</italic>, thus highlighting the industrial potential of
