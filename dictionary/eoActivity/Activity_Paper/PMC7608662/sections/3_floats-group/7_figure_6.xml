  <p>Effect of 
   <italic>Thymus albicans</italic> essential oil on the iNOS and COX-2 protein levels in LPS stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages. Cells (1.2 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> cells/well) were kept 24 h in medium (control) or pre-treated for 1 h with 0.64 μL/mL of 
   <italic>T. albicans</italic> essential oil and then stimulated with LPS (1 μg/mL). Total cell lysates were analyzed by western blot. Results are expressed as protein levels compared to LPS. Statistical differences were calculated by two-tailed unpaired student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (###
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, compared to control; **
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, compared to LPS).
