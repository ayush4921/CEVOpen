  <p>The antifungal activity of 
   <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> ethanolic extract and silver nanoparticles. The antifungal activities of 
   <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic>, and AF-AgNPs, were tested against four fungal species. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The species were cultured on potato dextrose agar Petri dishes and treated with either 
   <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> ethanolic extract or AF-AgNPs. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The mycelium growth inhibition in (mm) for the fungal species treated with either 
   <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> ethanolic extract or the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles.
