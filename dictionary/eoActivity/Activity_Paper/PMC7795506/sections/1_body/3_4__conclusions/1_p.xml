<p>The biogenic AgNPs showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activities against all studied species particularly, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic>. The innovation of the present study is that the green synthesis of NPs, which is simple and cost effective, provides stable nano-materials and can be an alternative for the large-scale synthesis of silver nanoparticles. More investigations might be conducted against other species.
