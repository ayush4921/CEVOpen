<p>Several studies had suggested and proved the antibacterial activity of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> and silver nanoparticles. AgNPs showed adequate antimicrobial activity against 
 <italic>E. coli, Klebsiella oxytoca,</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> where the diameters of inhibition zones were about 10 to 23 mm; and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AgNPs was 15 μg/mL against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> [

 <sub>3</sub> at 20 µg/mL possessed an antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> with inhibition zone diameters of 9, 8, and 13 mm, respectively [

Several studies suggested that the spherical shape, concentration, and type of silver nanoparticle might play a key role in the bacterial inhibition, which is absorbed inside the bacterial cells to interact with the bacterial DNA and proteins causing their damage [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which further resulted in more oxidative stress through the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. ROS accumulates into the bacterial mitochondrial membrane resulting in dysfunctional mitochondria and, hence, inhibit the bacterial growth [
 <xref rid="B32-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It was reported that the antibacterial activity of AgNPs is greater against gram-negative bacteria because of their interaction with the lipopolysaccharide and thick peptidoglycan layers of the bacterial membrane and cell wall, causing its disruption [
