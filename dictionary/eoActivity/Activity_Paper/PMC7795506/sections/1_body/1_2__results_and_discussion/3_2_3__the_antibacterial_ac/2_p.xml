<p>Unlike 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi,</italic> the AF-AgNPs showed stronger inhibition against all bacterial strains, particularly, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> with mean average inhibition of 19.00 Â± 2.94 mm, despite the fact that the water extract did not show any efficacy in the inhibition, as shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00130-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Noticeably, the treatment with Silver Nitrate (AgNO
 <sub>3</sub>) alone resulted in stronger inhibitory effect against all strains, suggesting that the antibacterial activity of AF-AgNPs is modulated mainly by the chemical composition of the nanoparticle and that the combination with 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> will enhance and induce more inhibitory impact.
