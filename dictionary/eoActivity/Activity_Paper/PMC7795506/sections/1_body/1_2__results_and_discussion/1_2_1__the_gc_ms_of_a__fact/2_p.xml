<p>As shown in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00130-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the highest relative intensity belonged to valeric acid (48.46%) that is commonly found in the perennial flowering plants, such as 
 <italic>Valeriana officinalis,</italic> which is known for its antibacterial activities against both Gram-negative (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) and 
 <italic>Salmonella enterica typhimurium</italic>) and Gram-negative (
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, 
 <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus suis)</italic> bacteria, as shown by Kovanda and colleagues, in 2019 [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The second-highest relative intensity was that of the 1,3-benzodioxol-4-ol, a phenolic benzothiazole derivative, which approved various biological importance because of its anticancer, antimicrobial, and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The results showed the presence of higher content of coumarin, an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound, which is known for its antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains, and its antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, besides it exhibited an appropriate antioxidant activity, as had been tested by the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) in the radical scavenging activity assay [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Previous studies showed that silver nanoparticles loaded with 9-anthracenecarboxylic acid showed strong antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or antibacterial activity against human bacterial pathogens [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Few studies had shown the antimicrobial activity of cyanogenic glucoside, such as its antibacterial effect against 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), Corynebacterium spp., E. coli,</italic> and 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].
