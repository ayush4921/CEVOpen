<p>Furthermore, we used the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to scan the presence and structural properties of the biosynthesized AF-AgNPs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00130-f002">Figure 2</xref>B. The AF-AgNPs seem to be aggregated or separated with a uniform spherical shape. The reaction of AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> with the extract of 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> increased the diameter of the nanoparticles to approximately 104-140 nm, indicating the formation of AF-AgNPs as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00130-f002">Figure 2</xref>B. Similar studies highlighted the increase in the size of silver nanoparticles loaded with different plant extracts such as the size of silver nanoparticles from 
 <italic>Tectona grandis</italic> seeds up to 27 nm [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], or 200–223 nm average diameters for the synthesized silver nanoparticles with 
 <italic>Cynara scolymus</italic> leaf extracts [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. These findings clarify that the characteristics of the biosynthesized silver nanoparticles depend on the type of the plant material extract, driven by the sunlight irradiation, besides other factors such as temperature and pH. In the current study, we used the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique by Zeta potential analyzer to calculate the nanoparticle size, according to the intensity of the scattered light. The results shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00130-f002">Figure 2</xref>C revealed that the mean diameter size of the AF-AgNPs was 197 ± 89.32 nm, with 100% intensity and Zeta average, the intensity weighted mean hydrodynamic size of the nanoparticle, was 160.9 d.nm (Z-average in nanometer).
