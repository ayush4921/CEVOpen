<p>By the UV-2450 Shimadzu spectrophotometer, the UV visible spectra of Ag nanoparticles using the UV spectrophotometer, the presence of the expected AF-AgNPs component was confirmed, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00130-f002">Figure 2</xref>A. A strong surface plasma resonance (SPR) peak located at 430 nm had been detected with maximum absorption OD at 0.3 arbitrary unit. This result is in agreement with another similar study conducted by Dadashpour and colleagues, in 2018, who reported the maximum absorption of the biosynthesized AgNPs, combined with
