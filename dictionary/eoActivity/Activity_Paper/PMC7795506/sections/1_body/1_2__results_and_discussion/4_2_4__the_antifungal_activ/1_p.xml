<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00130-f005">Figure 5</xref>, all fungi were sensitive for the treatment with Fluconazole. The effect of 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> ethanolic extract has been studied against 
 <italic>Fusarium solani (F. solani), Fusarium oxysporum, Helminthosporium rostratum,</italic> and 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata.</italic> The results showed mild mycelium growth inhibition of 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> and 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> by 39% and 49%, respectively compared to the control, however, the inhibitory effect was weaker against 
 <italic>H. rostratum,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alternata</italic> by 29% and 19% respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00130-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The treatment with AgNO
 <sub>3</sub> induces some growth inhibition effect, despite it was not significant except for 
 <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. The treatment with AF-AgNPs resulted in significantly stronger inhibition (
 <italic>p &lt; 0.05</italic>) with 83%, 88%, 85%, and 77% growth inhibition against 
 <italic>F. solani, H. rostratum, F. oxysporum,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. alternata,</italic> respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00130-f005">Figure 5</xref>). These results indicated a robust antifungal property of AF-AgNPs.
