<p>Several previous studies had reported the antifungal activities of silver nanoparticles. AgNPs showed high antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> anastomosis groups (AGs) by 73.60% mycelium growth inhibition [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Another study reported the antifungal property of AgNPs synthesized by 
 <italic>Ligustrum lucidum</italic> leaf extract that induced 50% inhibition of 
 <italic>Setosphaeria turcica</italic> at the concentration of 170.20 μg/mL [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In another study, the AgNPs exhibited strong antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Trichosporon asahii</italic> with MIC of 0.5 μg/mL, which caused serious cell wall damage, mitochondrial membrane disruption, and other cellular changes [
 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Several studies suggested the antifungal effect of AgNPs was due to its effect on the membrane-bound enzymes, such as those included in the respiratory chain [
 <xref rid="B40-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] or by the destruction of the cellular membrane integrity [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Other nanoparticles, such as ferric oxide (Fe
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>) nanoparticles, were reported to have a stronger antifungal activity against the 
 <italic>Cladosporium herbarium,</italic> which was marked by ROS generation [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A previous study showed that the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> L. has a good inhibition effect on the growth of 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida tropicalis</italic> because of the lipophilic essential oils rich in flavonoid and apigenin, which are known for their antifungal properties [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It can be concluded that AgNPs constitute an effective antimicrobial agent against common pathogenic microorganisms.
