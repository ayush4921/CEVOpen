<p>Currently, great efforts are being made in the field of medicinal microbiology to find suitable alternatives to commonly known antibiotics, which became less effective because of the elevated bacterial resistance reported in the last decade [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Many studies have shown the antimicrobial activities of some medicinal plants and herbs against different bacterial and fungal species. Of these plants, the members of 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family, approximately 23,600 species, include different classes of sesquiterpenes that proved many applicable biological activities including the anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer effects, as they are important chemo-preventive agents rich in antioxidants [

 <italic>Aaronsohnia factorovskyi (A. factorovskyi</italic>) is a member of 
 <italic>Asteraceae</italic> family, which includes several medicinal plants, such as 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> and 
 <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic> (sunflower) that are characterized by their rich content of sesquiterpenes, flavonoids, and coumarins, which are active constituents of interesting therapeutic importance [
