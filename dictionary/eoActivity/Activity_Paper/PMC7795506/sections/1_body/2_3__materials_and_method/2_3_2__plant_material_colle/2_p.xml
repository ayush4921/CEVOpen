<p>The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. factorovskyi</italic> was prepared, as it has been described before [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Briefly, the fresh plant parts were cut into small pieces, boiled for 15 min, shade dried at an ambient temperature of about 25–30 °C, and then powdered by vigorous grinding. To remove the large undesirable parts, a 4% solution of the plant powder was soaked in distilled water for 15 min, filtered through Whatman filter paper, and followed by air drying. The dried powder was weighed and stored at 4 °C for further experiments. On the experimental day, the powder was dissolved in absolute ethanol according to the required concentrations.
