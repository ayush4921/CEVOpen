<p>The extremal characterizes and morphology of the AF-AgNPs were distinguished by the FE-SEM technique using the JSM-7500F Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA, USA). Briefly, 8 Î¼L of AF-AgNPs suspensions were located in 200 mesh grids with a carbon support film (Agar Scientific, London, UK), rinsed with ethanol, air-dried, fixed on the appropriate SEM holder where images were captured at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV, according to the manufacturer instructions.</p>
