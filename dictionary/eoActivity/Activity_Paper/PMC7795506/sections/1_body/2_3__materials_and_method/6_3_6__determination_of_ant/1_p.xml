<p>The antifungal activity was performed with little modifications from Andleeba and colleagues in 2020 [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Briefly, either the AF or AF-AgNPs was mixed with potato dextrose agar (PDA) media at the mean concentrations, added to Petri dishes, and incubated at room temperature for 48 h. After the incubation period, 8 mm diameter agar plugs with the fungi strains were introduced to the center of each Petri dish and re-incubated at 28 ± 2°C. In parallel, the fungi were incubated with Fluconazole (32–320 μM) to act as a positive control. On the seventh day of incubation, the mycelial growth inhibition was determined by measuring the colony diameter of the cultured fungi.
