<p>The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method as described before [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-26-00130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Briefly, the strains were cultured separately in the Mueller-Hinton Agar plates for 24 h, and the growth efficiency was evaluated by observation of the inhibition areas against antibiotic discs. On the next day, two colonies were picked and transferred to a tube of 10 mL distilled water, mixed thoroughly, and spread on new Mueller-Hinton Agar plates by a sterile cotton swab (2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL). In each plate, three 4 mm diameter adequately spaced holes were made in the culture agar surface by a metal rod and 0.2 mL of either different concentration of the plant ethanolic extract, AF-AgNPs, or the control (distilled water) were loaded under aseptic conditions and incubated for 18–24 h hours at 37 °C. In parallel, the bacterial cultures were incubated with Tetracycline antibiotic discs (30 µg) to act as a positive control. The inhibition rate was evaluated by measuring the distance between the hole and the nearest growth area in mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract was calculated using serial dilution concentrations (50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, and 3.13 mg ⁄ml) as described before [
