 <p>The green biosynthesis of nanoparticles by plant extracts is an attractive and promising technique for medicinal applications. In the current study, we chose one of the daisy plants, 
  <italic>Aaronsohnia factorovskyi</italic> (which grows in the Najd region, Saudi Arabia), to investigate its anti-microbial efficacy, in combination with silver nanoparticles. The biosynthesized nanoparticles were evaluated for antibacterial activity against 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus</italic>
  <italic>subtilis</italic> (Gram-positive), 
  <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and 
  <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> (Gram-negative) using the disc diffusion method, while the antifungal activity was assessed against 
  <italic>Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Helminthosporium</italic>
  <italic>rostratum, and Alternaria</italic>
  <italic>alternata.</italic> The potential phytoconstituents of the plant extracts were identified by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques, the Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, and Zeta potential analysis. The current study revealed the ability of the tested plant extract to convert silver ions to silver nanoparticles with an average diameter of 104–140 nm. Biogenic 
  <italic>Aaronsohnia factorovskyi</italic>-silver nanoparticles (AF-AgNPs) showed significant antibacterial activity against 
  <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> with inhibition zone diameter to 19.00 ± 2.94 mm, and antifungal activity against 
  <italic>Fusarium solani,</italic> which reduced the growth of fungal yarn to 1.5 mm. The innovation of the present study is that the green synthesis of NPs, which is simple, cost-effective, provides stable nano-materials, and can be an alternative for the large-scale synthesis of silver nanoparticles.
