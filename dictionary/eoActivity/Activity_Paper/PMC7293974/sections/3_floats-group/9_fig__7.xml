  <p>Figures are showing phytochemical test results for different plant compounds. 
   <bold>a</bold> Alkaloids (Hager’s test): from left to right—Hager’s reagent, test result, and ethanolic extract. There was a visible color change of the sample which indicates a positive result for alkaloids. 
   <bold>b</bold> Alkaloids (Wagner’s test): from the left side is the test sample, Wagner’s reagent mixture, Wagner’s reagent, and ethanol. The visible color change of the sample indicates a positive result for alkaloids. 
   <bold>c</bold> Test for the identification of phenolic compounds. From the left side, the first two are sample extracts showing the desired color change which indicate positive result and the 3rd one is the control, FeCl
   <sub>3</sub>. A dark green color indicates the presence of phenolic compounds in the sample. 
   <bold>d</bold> Tests for tannins (lead acetate test): no yellow precipitation in the test sample indicates a negative result. 
   <bold>e</bold> Test for flavonoids: from the left side—1st one is test sample showing yellow color, 2nd one ethanol, 3rd one NaOH, and 4th one is the mixture of ethanol and NaOH. There was a visible color change of the sample which indicates a positive result for flavonoids. 
   <bold>f</bold> Tests for saponins (froth test): the left one is the test sample and the other one is distilled water. No froth formed in the test sample indicates a negative result for saponins
