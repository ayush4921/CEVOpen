<p id="Par27">Ten grams of powdered sample was dissolved in 100 ml of absolute methanol in a conical flask, covered with aluminum foil and then kept at 37 °C in a shaker incubator at 120 rpm for 24 h. The filtrate was collected slowly in a conical flask using an autoclaved filter paper. It was then evaporated using a rotary evaporator till the final volume was reduced to one-fourth of the original volume of the solvent used. Then the concentrated extract solution was poured on a sterile petri dish lid and kept in the incubator at 55 °C for 20 min. Finally, a sticky semi-solid extract appeared on the surface of the plate when all the solvent was evaporated. The extract was collected and stored in a McCartney bottle that was autoclaved and weighed. The extract inside the container was weighed, recorded, and the exact amount of the extract was calculated by subtracting the mass of the empty bottle. Then the bottle was labeled and stored at 4 °C in the refrigerator.</p>
