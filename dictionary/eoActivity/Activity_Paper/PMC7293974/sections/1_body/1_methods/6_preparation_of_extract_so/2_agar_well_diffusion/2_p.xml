<p id="Par31">Plates of bacterial strains were taken in the laminar hood. A loop was sterilized in the Bunsen flame and was used to scrape off the bacteria and dipped into the test tubes containing saline solution (each containing 9 ml of NaCl) to make a suspension. The test tubes were vortexed and the turbidity of the suspension was visually compared with the 0.5% MacFarland standard solution in order to keep the number of bacteria in the saline suspension within a given range for standardizing the lawn culture of antimicrobial tests. Then, an autoclaved cotton swab was dipped into the suspension and pressed against the inner walls of test tubes to remove excess liquid before taking them out. The cotton swab was rubbed horizontally across the surface of the labeled Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates to conduct the lawn culture of the bacterial strains. A cork borer was heated to sterilize, cooled, and then pressed onto the MHA plates to create the required number of wells on the quadrants of the agar. After that, each well was labeled and filled with 60 μL of diluted methanolic, ethanolic, and aqueous extracts, respectively. Different antibiotic disks were used as a positive control and placed onto one quadrant. Then the MHA plates were kept in the incubator for 24 h at 37 °C and the results were observed and recorded the next day.</p>
