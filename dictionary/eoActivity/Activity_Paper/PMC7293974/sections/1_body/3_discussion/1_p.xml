<p id="Par52">Tribal people have been using plants to treat different kinds of diseases for a long time. Years of experience has made them a “knowledge house” on herbal remedies. An ethnobotanical survey of medicinal plants in the Chittagong Hill Tracts has revealed that 56 plant species were used by the tribal people only to treat dermatological disorders [

Our study also found that 62 plant species were used by the tribal people of Rangamati to treat almost 20 different diseases, namely abdominal pain, common cold and sneezing, injury, diarrhea, and dysentery. In this study, about 77% of the participants reported that they had recovered from the above-mentioned diseases within 1 to 10 days using only the medicinal plants as a remedy. In contrast, only 2–3% of the participants took additional medications (besides the medicinal plants) which might contribute to their quick recovery. Our study also found that age has significant influence when choosing medicinal plants over traditional medications. Older people naturally ought to have a better understanding and greater knowledge about the traditional use of medicinal plants as pharmaceuticals or modern medicines were unavailable in their era. The fact of having superior knowledge about the use of medicinal plants is reflected to some extent in this survey as about 34% of the total people questioned aged above 50 years old. While using plants as remedies against diseases, leaves (42.68%) were found to be the most used part as medicine as they are most easily accessible can also be used in different ways very easily. Different plants and their parts may have a distinct mode of preparations and are preferred over one another according to the user’s flexibility and satisfaction. The simplest and most common modes of preparation are extraction, juice, paste, and decoction. In this study, most people used paste (33%).
