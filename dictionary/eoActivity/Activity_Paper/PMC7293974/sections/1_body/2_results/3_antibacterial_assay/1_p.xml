<p id="Par49">The antibiotic disks used were ampicillin and gentamicin (for 
 <italic>S. typhii</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>), gentamycin (for 
 <italic>E.</italic> coli), chloramphenicol (for 
 <italic>S. pneumonae</italic>), and cefoxitin (for 
 <italic>S. flexneri</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The tests were repeated thrice to ensure the accuracy of the results. Among the three different types of extracts, the distilled water extract showed hardly any positive result. However, ethanolic and methanolic extracts were able to show some positive results, but not against all the organisms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Ethanolic extract showed the highest zone of inhibition against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which was 21 mm (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The average result of the three trials are given below (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
