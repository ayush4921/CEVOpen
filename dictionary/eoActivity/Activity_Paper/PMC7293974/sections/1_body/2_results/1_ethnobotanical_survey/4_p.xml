<p id="Par47">A wide range of diseases was cured using different kinds of plants. The diseases include minor injuries, common viral infections, and also bacterial diseases, all common throughout our country, Bangladesh. In this survey, common cold, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysentery, and allergy or rashes are the most common ones, including 19 types of different diseases in total. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we can conclude that anemia, piles, and measles were the least common. The highest count of occurrence was for common cold, while the second-highest count was for diarrhea among the participants of this study. The least count of occurrence was for piles and the second least count was for both anemia and measles. Although the count of occurrence was quite high for dysentery and abdominal pain and gastric, it was still lower than for common cold, throat pain, and diarrhea. The cases of arthritis, diabetes, worms, hypertension, fever/dengue, constipation, snake-bite, and asthma were very low, but they were still higher than the occurrence of piles, allergy, jaundice, eczema/skin disease, and bleeding from wounds (Fig.
