<p id="Par45">In this survey, 42.86% of the plant part used were the leaves, confirming the fact that leaves are the most used part of a plant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The second most used parts were fruits and whole plants, each having 15.65% of the total count. The least used parts were the seed and bulb, having just 1.36% each. The second least used parts were the rhizome and stem, being only 2.04% each. The percentage of bark used (8.84%) can be termed as the third least part used as it has a higher percentage of use than the seed, rhizome, bulb, and stem. The root (10.20%) is utilized more than the bark but still less than the fruit, whole plant, and leaves (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
