<p id="Par46">In this survey, 33 people preferred to make “paste” from the plant parts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), which is also the highest count and shows the highest percentage (23.91%). From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, we can see that plant parts were also taken in the form of “juice” by 31 people, which is the second-highest form (22.46%). In addition, 23 and 20 people used the “decoction” (16.67%) and “extraction” (14.49%) method respectively. Twenty-one people took the whole plant as medicine or processed in some way like cooking (15.22%), which is lower than for the decoction method and higher than for the extraction method. The lowest number of people, 3, took the plant in a powdered form (2.17%) and the second-lowest number of people, 7, used the plant as an infusion (5.07%). In summary, the highest percentage of people used medicinal plants in the form of “paste,” while the least number of people used the plant in the “powdered” form.
