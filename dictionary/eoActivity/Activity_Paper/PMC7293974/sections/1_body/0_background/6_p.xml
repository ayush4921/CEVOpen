<p id="Par20">In this study, the test microorganisms were 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The aqueous, ethanol, and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic> were subjected to microbial susceptibility assays using the agar well diffusion method. After the phytochemical screening of plant extract, we have successfully detected alkaloids, phenolics, steroids, and flavonoids in different solvents. However, no saponins and tannins were identified in our extract. This study reveals the antibacterial effects of ethnobotanical medicinal plants as well as the presence of phytochemicals that may have antimicrobial activity against diarrhea-causing pathogenic microorganisms.
