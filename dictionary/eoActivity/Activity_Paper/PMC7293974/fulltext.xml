In light of this global threat, researchers all over the world have been gravitating towards herbal medicines. In order to find out new ways of saving the planet using medicinal plants, ethnobotanical studies must be carried out. Concerning this, an ethnobotanical study has been done in this paper to identify potential medicinal plants in Rangamati, Bangladesh.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">For the ethnobotanical survey, randomized 104 people were interviewed and 62 different plant species were found to treat 19 different kinds of diseases and 84% of people reported to be completely recovered. Furthermore, among the 19 diseases found, the majority of them were common cold, abdominal pain or gastric, diarrhea, and dysentery. From the 62 different plant species, <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic>, used for the treatment of diarrhea, was selected for conducting further studies due to its heavy use as reported by the tribal people. In this study, the aqueous, ethanol, and methanol extracts of <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic> were subjected to microbial susceptibility assays using the agar well diffusion method. The test microorganisms were <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, <italic>and Escherichia coli.</italic> Among these, the most susceptible organisms were <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (21&#x02009;mm) and <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> (19&#x02009;mm) in the ethanolic extract. Also, the methanolic extract showed an inhibition zone of 13&#x02009;mm against <italic>E. coli</italic>, which was more than that of the antibiotic&#x02019;s (11&#x02009;mm). Phytochemical screening of the plant revealed that it contains alkaloids, phenols, steroids, and flavonoids, but lacks saponins and tannins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">To combat the rising threat of antibiotic resistance, ethnoscience needs to be consolidated with modern biotechnological techniques to make the most use of the vast amount of natural resources.

Sadly, the uncontrolled and unprescribed use of antibiotics has turned them into the enemy of human existence as microorganisms are becoming multi-drug resistant. Given this, researchers and scientists agree that medicinal plants are a substantial alternative to this global crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, to discover new species of medicinally important plants, ethnobotanical surveys are needed to be conducted. In respect to that, an ethnobotanical study has been done as a part of this research paper to identify some of the plants used by tribal people in Rangamati, Bangladesh.</p><p id="Par16">Medicinal plants are a common phenomenon in various continents and are also an essential source of different medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Being a developing country, the use of medicinal plants in Bangladesh is notable in many regions. Therefore, medicinal plants have become one of the leading choices for treating different injuries and diseases. A significant portion of the plant species has been recognized as valuable resources of natural antimicrobial compounds which can be used as an alternative for the treatment of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They are the most suitable solution to the problems regarding antibiotic resistance, as they are cost-effective and have the least amount of side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Medicinal plants exhibit antibacterial activities because of the phytochemicals produced during the secondary metabolism of the plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Plants are rich in a wide variety of secondary metabolites, including tannins, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These phytochemicals are known to exhibit anti-inflammation, antimicrobial, and antifungal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Reports suggest that phenolic and flavonoid compounds prevent diseases such as cancer, heart problems, cataracts, eye disorders, and Alzheimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The most vital properties of flavonoids include their ability to protect against oxidative diseases, reduce the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins to provide protection against cardiovascular diseases, and activate or inhibit various enzymes bind specific receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Moreover, it is suggested that herbal extracts may be an effective alternative to antibiotics in order to cure common recurrent diseases like diarrhea, skin disease, throat, or ear infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Surprisingly, medicinal plants have also shown their efficiency in treating diabetes due to the presence of carotenoids, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and glycosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The anti-hyperglycemic effects that result from treatment with plants are often due to their ability to improve the performance of pancreatic tissue, which is done by increasing insulin secretions or reducing the intestinal absorption of glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">A survey conducted among the Santal tribe of Joypurhat District, Bangladesh, found 33 plant species that were used by the tribal people for treating diabetes (A.H.M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]).</p><p id="Par19">Ethnobotanical surveys in our country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] have brought plants having effective medicinal characteristics into attention. Some studies have been done specifically to search for different medicinal plants, which are being used for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. After conducting the survey, a medicinal plant&#x02014;<italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic>, locally known as Jharobbo hogoeya (Bangladesh Ethnobotany Online Database), was collected to evaluate its antibacterial activity against some pathogenic microorganisms responsible for causing diarrhea. This plant grows in the forest regions of the Rangamati, and people from the survey have claimed to use this plant for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery. Tribal people are extremely experienced as they have been treating diseases using medicinal plants since prehistoric times and thus are knowledgeable about herbal medicine including those used for the treatment of diarrhea (M.S. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]).</p><p id="Par20">In this study, the test microorganisms were <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. The aqueous, ethanol, and methanol extracts of <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic> were subjected to microbial susceptibility assays using the agar well diffusion method. After the phytochemical screening of plant extract, we have successfully detected alkaloids, phenolics, steroids, and flavonoids in different solvents. However, no saponins and tannins were identified in our extract. This study reveals the antibacterial effects of ethnobotanical medicinal plants as well as the presence of phytochemicals that may have antimicrobial activity against diarrhea-causing pathogenic microorganisms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Survey site selection</title><p id="Par21">The region selected for this research purpose has an area of 6116.13 km<sup>2</sup> and is located in between 22&#x000b0;27&#x02032; and 23&#x000b0;44&#x02032; north latitudes and in between 91&#x000b0;56&#x02032; and 92&#x000b0;33&#x02032; east longitudes.

Years of experience has made them a &#x0201c;knowledge house&#x0201d; on herbal remedies. An ethnobotanical survey of medicinal plants in the Chittagong Hill Tracts has revealed that 56 plant species were used by the tribal people only to treat dermatological disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In another ethnobotanical study, conducted among Pangkhua community in Bilaichari, Bangladesh, revealed the traditional use of 117 plant species to treat 11 categories of ailments, recorded from 218 traditional healers and elderly men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Our study also found that 62 plant species were used by the tribal people of Rangamati to treat almost 20 different diseases, namely abdominal pain, common cold and sneezing, injury, diarrhea, and dysentery. In this study, about 77% of the participants reported that they had recovered from the above-mentioned diseases within 1 to 10&#x02009;days using only the medicinal plants as a remedy. In contrast, only 2&#x02013;3% of the participants took additional medications (besides the medicinal plants) which might contribute to their quick recovery. Our study also found that age has significant influence when choosing medicinal plants over traditional medications. Older people naturally ought to have a better understanding and greater knowledge about the traditional use of medicinal plants as pharmaceuticals or modern medicines were unavailable in their era. The fact of having superior knowledge about the use of medicinal plants is reflected to some extent in this survey as about 34% of the total people questioned aged above 50&#x02009;years old. While using plants as remedies against diseases, leaves (42.68%) were found to be the most used part as medicine as they are most easily accessible can also be used in different ways very easily. Different plants and their parts may have a distinct mode of preparations and are preferred over one another according to the user&#x02019;s flexibility and satisfaction. The simplest and most common modes of preparation are extraction, juice, paste, and decoction. In this study, most people used paste (33%).</p><p id="Par53">Knowledge regarding medicinal plants is obtained from different sources such as family, the local Kaviraaj, and the local people. Consequently, the information gained is discrete, given that, it was found that several plants or plant parts were used for treating the same disease. For instance, for treating the common cold, &#x0201c;Tulsi&#x0201d; (<italic>Ocimum tenuiflorum</italic>), &#x0201c;Bashok&#x0201d; (<italic>Justicia adhatoda</italic>), &#x0201c;Dhan-shabarang&#x0201d; (<italic>Cymbopogan citratus</italic>) etc. were used. Supporting this fact, a study conducted in the Lushai community of Bandarban district of Bangladesh, pointed out that 37 different plant species were used to treat diarrhea and 40 plant species were used to treat dysentery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On the other hand, one particular plant was used to treat many different diseases. The plant &#x0201c;Thankuni&#x0201d; <italic>(Centella asiatica)</italic> was used to treat both diarrhea and gastric. Similarly, &#x0201c;Ghritkumari&#x0201d; (aloe vera) is used as a remedy for both constipation, due to its laxative property which relieves constipation by promoting intestinal motility, as well as diabetes, as aloe vera is believed to improve insulin secretion and enhance pancreatic &#x003b2; cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The plant <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic> was selected for further study as this has been used most commonly to treat diarrhea in the tribal areas. The stem part of the plant was collected and processed into powder and examined to assay its antibacterial activity against several diarrhea-causing bacteria. From the trials, the highest inhibition zone was seen by ethanolic extract against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which was 21&#x02009;mm.

Additionally, the aqueous extract showed results only against <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. Although the activity for commercial antibiotics is much higher than herbal plants, the use of medicinal plants should be encouraged as the overuse of antibiotics will eventually lead to the development of superbugs which will hinder proper treatment. As the extract of our medicinal plant was not purified and yet we found a comparable value (21&#x02009;mm in ethanolic extract and 27&#x02009;mm in commercial antibiotic against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>), we believe purification of the plant extract will increase its activity significantly.</p><p id="Par55">Medicinal plants certainly contain various types of minerals and both primary and secondary metabolites and for these, they confer antimicrobial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In this study, phytochemical analysis of the plant extract showed both positive and negative results for several compounds. The plant extract has shown to contain alkaloids, phenolics, steroids, and flavonoids, whereas a negative result was observed for saponins and tannins, which indicates that <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic> lack these two phytochemicals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par56">Ethnoscience and indigenous knowledge need to be consolidated with modern biotechnological techniques and approaches to achieve the desired end products with scientific validation and to make the most use of the vast amount of natural resources around us. This study suggests that various medicinal plants can serve as an alternative to the mainstream drugs to which bacteria are gradually becoming resistant. From the results, <italic>Heptapleurum hypoleucum</italic> has not only shown significant antibacterial effect against several diarrhea-causing pathogens, but we also found some medically important constituents after conducting the phytochemical tests; thus, further research is recommended to purify these phytochemicals to understand the full potentials of this medicinal plant.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>MHA</term><def><p id="Par4">Mueller Hinton Agar</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AI</term><def><p id="Par5">Activity index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GIA</term><def><p id="Par6">Gastrointestinal ailments</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RSD</term><def><p id="Par7">Respiratory system disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PB</term><def><p id="Par8">Poisonous bites</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMSD</term><def><p id="Par9">Skeleton muscular system disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ED</term><def><p id="Par10">Endocrinal disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEM</term><def><p id="Par11">Hemorrhoids</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LP</term><def><p id="Par12">Liver problems</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DID</term><def><p id="Par13">Dermatological infections and diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HTN</term><def><p id="Par14">Hypertension</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#x02019;s Note</bold></p><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn><fn><p>S.
