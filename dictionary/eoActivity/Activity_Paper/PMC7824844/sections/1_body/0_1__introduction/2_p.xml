<p>Japan was one of the countries that first started the artificial cultivation of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> in the mid-1980s. There are in general three methods for the artificial cultivation of the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting body, they are bottle culture, bag culture and outdoor bed culture. Bag culture is the most popular cultivation method in Japan [
 <xref rid="B2-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] because of its advantages such as the low cost of plastic bags, small space requirements and easily-controlled indoor environment. Bag culture can achieve higher yields of mature 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> mushrooms than bottle culture and requires a shorter cultivation time than outdoor bed cultures. As shown in

 <xref rid="B2-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], the major steps of bag cultivation include substrate preparation, substrate sterilization, mycelium inoculation and incubation. In addition to the fruiting body, there is also an increasing demand for 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>â€™s mycelium and its bioactive metabolites. Solid-state fermentation (SSF) [
 <xref rid="B3-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and submerged fermentation [
 <xref rid="B4-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] are two common methods of mycelium cultivation. A common substrate for SSF is sawdust supplemented with rice bran or wheat bran [
