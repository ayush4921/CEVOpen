<p>Several kinds of bioactive proteins and peptides have been isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> with notable health benefits and medicinal values, although studies on these aspects are fewer than those on the bioactive polysaccharide fractions. 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> summarizes some typical bioactive proteins and peptides isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. As shown in the table, these bioactive proteins/peptides were extracted mainly from the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting body, with average molecular weights around 20â€“88 kDa.
