<p>In recent years, there has been growing evidence of the important role of gut microbiota in the mediation/action of the various health benefits of mushrooms, especially their polysaccharide components [
 <xref rid="B104-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Many studies have investigated the regulation of gut microbiota by the bioactive polysaccharides from edible and medicinal mushrooms such as 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> because the biological macromolecules of polysaccharides, which cannot be directly absorbed, can be utilized by intestinal flora [

Friedman reviewed mushroom polysaccharides and their anti-obesity, anti-diabetes, anti-cancer and antibiotic properties, and suggested that the regulation of gut microbiota by polysaccharides was the major mechanism behind these properties [
