<p>Additionally, GFP has also been found to regulate the gut microbiota of rats with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Li and coworkers found that GFP could partly recover the HFD-induced alteration of cecal microbiota structure [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. GFP treatment could decrease the 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> to 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> ratio, indicating a lower possibility of lipid production from undigested carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="B108-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Friedman also suggested in his review that the ratio decrease of the two major classes of gut bacteria, namely, 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, could have fat-lowering effects in obesity treatment [
 <xref rid="B106-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In addition, GFP supplementation significantly increased the proportion of 
 <italic>Allobaculum</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, 
 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> and some other microbial groups in the cecal microbiota, which might boost the immune system of the host and the defense against NAFLD [
 <xref rid="B30-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The boosting of the immune system may contribute to the anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effect of GFP as well [

 <xref rid="B111-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Nevertheless, the functions of gut microbiota on the various bioactivities of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> polysaccharides and other components still require further exploration.
