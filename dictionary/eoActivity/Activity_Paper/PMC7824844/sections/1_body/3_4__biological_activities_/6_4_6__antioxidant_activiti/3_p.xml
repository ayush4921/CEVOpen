<p>Other than polysaccharides, proteins, fatty acids and other molecules from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> such as phenols and flavonoids also showed antioxidant activities. Dong and coworkers hydrolyzed protein from the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting body using different proteases and found that trypsin hydrolysate had the strongest antioxidant potential, especially the GFHT-4 fraction, with a molecular weight lower than 3 kDa [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> were 98% and 99%, respectively. Moreover, the inhibition of liposome peroxidation by the fatty acid was also as high as 79% [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>. All of these extracts exhibited various antioxidant activities, including reducing power, chelating ferrous ions and scavenging DPPH and superoxide anions [
