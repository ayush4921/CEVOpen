<p>The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> polysaccharides could be further enhanced by incorporation of zinc or selenium. Zhang and coworkers used the strain of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> as a vector of zinc biotransformation to produce zinc-incorporated intracellular polysaccharides, which showed notable antioxidant and anti-aging activities compared with the corresponding non-zinc-incorporated intracellular polysaccharides [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> and obtained a heteropolysaccaride of Se-GFP-22 with more remarkable antioxidant effects than that of non-Se-incorporated GFP-22. The antioxidant activity might be affected by the degree of branching, molecular weight and configuration, as well as the synergistic effect of polysaccharide and Se [
