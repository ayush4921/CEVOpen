<p>In addition to antiviral effect, the D-fraction isolated from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> has also shown antibacterial effects. Kodama and coworkers found that the mechanism of antibacterial action of D-fraction was related to the immune-stimulating activity. The D-fraction could activate immuno-competent cells and induce the production of cytokines, which further lead to the activity enhancement of splenic T cells to kill 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> [
