<p>The antitumor activity of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> was first reported by Miyazaki et al. in 1982 [
 <xref rid="B16-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], followed by their further study on the chemical structure of glucans extracted from the 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fruiting body and their antitumor activity against Sarcoma 180 tumors in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Nanba’s group obtained different polysaccharide fractions and reported the D-fraction for the first time in 1988 [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Unlike many other antitumor polysaccharides derived from 
 <italic>Basidiomycetes</italic>, which may become ineffective if administered orally, the D-fraction exhibited promising prospects, because it could be administered orally, intravenously and intraperitoneally [
 <xref rid="B21-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Nanba and Kubo conducted a nonrandomized clinical study to assess the effects of the D-fraction from 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> on 165 advanced cancer patients who received the D-fraction as crude powder tablets alone or in addition to chemotherapy. Results showed that 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> was effective against breast, liver and lung cancers, but less effective against leukemia, stomach and bone cancers [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Further studies conducted by Alonso et al. demonstrated that the D-fraction was able to function on mammary tumor cells directly through the modulation of different cellular processes during cancer development [
 <xref rid="B48-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Zhao and coworkers found that a combination of the D-fraction (0.2 mg/mL) and vitamin C (0.3 mmol/L) resulted in a 70% reduction in the viability of human hepatocarcinoma SMMC-7721 cells [
 <xref rid="B76-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Further purification of the D-fraction yielded the MD-fraction, which, as described in the patent of Nanba and Kubo, showed even better results than the D-fraction in terms of the inhibitory effect on mouse tumor growth [
 <xref rid="B22-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition to intraperitoneal injection in Nanba and Kubo’s test, the MD-fraction has also been demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth in mice via oral administration [
 <xref rid="B77-foods-10-00095" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Both the D-fraction and the MD-fraction were proven safe, with low or no toxicity.
