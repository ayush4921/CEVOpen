<p>The antihypertensive effects of the active ingredients of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> have been determined mainly through the measurement of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in animal models, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00095-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>. Kabir et al. conducted an experiment on hypertensive rats with a diet containing 5% 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> or 
 <italic>Lentinus edodes</italic> (
 <italic>L. edodes</italic>) mushroom powder. The results showed that both 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> and 
 <italic>L. edodes</italic> treatment could result in a significant decrease in the SBP of spontaneously hypertensive rats. The reduction in SBP level was similar for 
 <italic>G. frodosa</italic> and 
 <italic>L. edodes</italic>, which was around 15 mmHg after 63 days of a mushroom diet compared with the control group [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> could not only suppress the development of hypertension (preventive effect), but also lower elevated blood pressure (treatment effect) [

 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> fractions could lessen age-related hypertension partly via their effects on the renin-angiotensin system [
