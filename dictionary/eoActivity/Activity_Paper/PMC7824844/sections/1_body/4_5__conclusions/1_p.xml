<p>Edible and medicinal fungi or mushrooms are among the most common sources of health foods and nutraceutical products. 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> is one of the most widely explored fungal species for nutraceutical and therapeutic compounds. The fungal biomass of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic> displays a high content of proteins and carbohydrates and a relatively low content of fat compared with other commonly cultivated mushrooms. The crude water extracts, isolated fractions and purified components have shown a number of bioactivities, including antitumor, immunomodulatory, antiviral, antibacterial, antidiabetic, lipid metabolism regulation, hypertension control and antioxidation. Some of these health effects may be associated with the regulation of the human gut microbiota. Polysaccharides, which represent the most significant bioactive components of 
 <italic>G. frondosa</italic>, contribute to many of its bioactivities and health benefits. The most successful and valuable health products from this fungal species are represented by the polysaccharide fractions and polysaccharide protein complexes, including the D-fraction or the MD-fraction and Grifolan, which have been approved for human use in immunotherapy and complimentary treatment of cancers with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
