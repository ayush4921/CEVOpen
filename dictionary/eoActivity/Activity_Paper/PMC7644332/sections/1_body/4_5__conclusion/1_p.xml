<p>The purpose of this study was to generate recent data on the toxicological profile of 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> leaves, 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> roots, and 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> whole plant. The results obtained following the larval cytotoxicity model indicated that the studied plants were not cytotoxic. Data from subacute toxicity indicate that the studied plants did not induce any mortality or structural alterations in the liver and kidneys. However, disorders of certain biochemical and hematological parameters were noted in animals treated with 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> and 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> at high doses (400 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg). These data suggest a moderate use of these medicinal plants in traditional medicine. Furthermore, toxicological studies (chronic and subchronic toxicity) are needed to better understand the toxicological profile of these plants.
