 <italic>Artemia salina</italic>' eggs (ARTEMIO JBL D-67141 Gmbh Neuhofem), acquired from the Applied Hydrobiology's Laboratory of Agricultural Sciences' Faculty at University of Abomey-Calavi (UAC, Benin), were used for the larval cytotoxicity test. Male Wistar albino rats aged at least three months with a body weight between 150 g and 200 g were used as the animal material for the subacute toxicity test. These animals have been acquired at the animal farm of the Institute of Applied Biomedical Sciences of the University of Abomey-Calavi of Benin. They have been housed in cages covered with wood chips and acclimatized for 2 weeks before experiment at the animal farm of the Research Unit in Applied Microbiology and Pharmacology of natural substances (URMAPha). The rats had free access to water and food. Animal Research Review Panel and Animal Welfare Unit regulations of temperature and lighting systems were maintained with a room temperature of 20–26°C and regular light cycles of 12 hours light/dark. All methods and protocols used in this study were observed following established public health guidelines “Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.”
