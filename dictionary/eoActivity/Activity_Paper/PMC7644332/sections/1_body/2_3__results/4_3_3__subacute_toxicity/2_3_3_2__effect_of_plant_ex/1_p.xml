 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides information on the effect of the studied plants extracts on the hematological parameters of the animals of the different lots. The analysis of this table shows a significant reduction in the hematocrit level for animals treated with extracts of 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> and 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> compared to untreated rats for the erythrocyte data (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In addition, a nonsignificant dose-dependent reduction in the red blood cell count, mean cell volume, hemoglobin level, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration was also noted for the treated rats with 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). For 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic>, a nonsignificant reduction in the mean blood volume and mean body hemoglobin content accompanies the significant reduction in the hematocrit. These data suggest microcytic hypochromic anemia in Wistar rats treated with 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> and 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic>. For 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic>, no significant effect on hematological parameters is reported for the studied doses.
