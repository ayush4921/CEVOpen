<p>The evolution of the weight of the animals during the experimental period is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In general, it is noted that the treatments performed have an influence on the weight growth of animals. This influence varies according to the plants studied and the period of exposure of the animals to the different plant extracts. Thus, compared to the weight change control group rats, a nonsignificant weight growth was observed throughout the experimental period for treated rats with the three doses of 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The same situation is observed for the treated animals with 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic>. However, for 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic>, a variable influence of dose and time (treatment week) on animal weight growth was observed. Thus, at the 200 mg/kg, a nonsignificant weight loss was observed after two weeks of treatment before a resumption of weight growth in the last two weeks. At doses of 400 and 800 mg/kg, a nonsignificant loss of animal bodyweight was observed for treatments performed. This weight loss was significant during the last week of treatment for rats treated at 800 mg/kg dose (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
