<p>In addition, concerning to liver parameters, a significant reduction in serum ASAT was observed in animals treated with 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> and 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> particularly at doses of 400 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg. However, no significant difference was noted for this parameter in rats treated with 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic>. On ALAT, except the animals treated with 
 <italic>Cassytha filiformis</italic> 200 mg/kg and 
 <italic>Gardenia ternifolia</italic> 400 mg/kg, no significant influence was noted for this hepatic parameter of animals in other lots (
