<p>Africa is known for the richness of its flora, which is conducive to scientific studies for a better valuation of these natural resources. Benin has an interesting ethnobotanical potential. Ako√®gninou et al. [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] estimated the Beninese flora at more than 2807 plant species. 
 <italic>Gardenia ternifolia</italic> (
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic>), 
 <italic>Cassytha filiformis</italic> (
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic>), and 
 <italic>Rourea coccinea</italic> (
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic>) are three plants of Beninese flora used in the traditional treatment of male infertility [

 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic>, 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> have numerous ethnopharmacological applications.
