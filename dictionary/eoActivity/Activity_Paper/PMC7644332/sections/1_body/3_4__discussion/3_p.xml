<p>Concerning 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic>, a significant increase in uremia and nonsignificant increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) observed in this study suggest a possible impairment of hepatic and renal functions. Similar data were reported in literature. Indeed, Armenia et al. [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] indicated in an acute toxicity study that the ethanolic extract of the plant at doses of 100 and 400 mg/kg induced hepatic and renal functions in Wistar rats. Similar observations were reported by Yuliandra et al. [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] who showed that the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> at doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg exhibited reversible hepatotoxicity indicated by increased alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) enzyme activity. This trend contrasts with data reported by Babayi et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] in Nigeria. These authors, in assessing the subacute toxicity of the watery extract of 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic> to Wistar rats, indicated that this type of extract from the plant at doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg of live body weight did not influence the biochemical and hematological parameters of the animals or alter vital organs such as the heart, liver, and kidney. This observed difference could be explained by the influence of biotic and edaphic conditions (species, plant physiological status, chemical composition, and soil factors).
