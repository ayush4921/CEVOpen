<p>Medicinal plants and their derivatives are used as an alternative in healthcare by the majority of people in developing countries. Despite its medicinal uses, very few toxicological studies have been conducted on these medicinal plants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicological effect of 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic>, 
 <italic>C. filiformis</italic>, and 
 <italic>G. ternifolia</italic> through larval cytotoxicity and subacute toxicity tests. The cytotoxic effect of the extracts evaluated according to the 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic> model was used as a preliminary screening to determine the safety of the plants studied. The results indicated that plants studied at tested concentrations are noncytotoxic to the larvae of 
 <italic>Artemia salina</italic>. Lagarto Parra et al. [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] demonstrated a good correlation (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.85; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between this larval cytotoxicity test and toxicological effects on an entire animal. However, such extrapolation is strongly discussed in the literature [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To support this data and to explore the safety of the plants studied following daily exposure to repeated doses in the Wistar albino rat, the subacute toxicity test was conducted. The results of this toxicological screening indicated that prolonged exposure of rats to different doses could affect weight growth, biochemical, and hematological parameters. For weight growth of animals during the period of experimentation, a loss of bodyweight should be reported in rats treated with 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> extract at high doses (400 and 800 mg/kg). These data can be explained by the anorexia observed in these animals during the experiment. Bodyweight change is used as a general indicator of the adverse effects of chemicals on a living organism [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, weight loss is correlated with the physiological condition of the animal and can be explained not only by anorexia [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] but also by impaired metabolism in animals [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These data indicate that 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> may have adverse effects on animal metabolism. In addition, biochemical parameters related to the liver and kidney functions and hematological parameters are generally explored in the study of the toxicity of medicinal plants. It should be noted that ALAT and ASAT are important markers of liver function. Under normal physiological conditions, these markers are present at low concentrations in the serum. The elevation of serum levels of these enzymes, particularly ALAT, is considered a sensitive marker of liver lesions [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Similarly, uremia and creatinine are markers of renal function. Any increase in their serum levels reflects a probable tissue damage to the kidneys [
