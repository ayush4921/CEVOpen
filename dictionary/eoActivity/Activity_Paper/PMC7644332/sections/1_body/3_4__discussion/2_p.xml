<p>Moreover, the hematopoietic system is one of the most sensitive targets for toxic substances [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It is an important marker of the physiological and pathological state of humans and animals. Any alteration in erythrocyte parameters is perceived as a potential risk for anemia [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In this study, it should be noted that different treatments have some influence on biochemical markers of renal and hepatic functions. Indeed, there was an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) levels and a significant increase in uremia in animals treated with 
 <italic>Cassytha filiformis</italic>. This significant increase in uremia was also observed in rats treated with 
 <italic>Rourea coccinea</italic> at doses of 400 mg/kg and 800 mg/kg. However, rats treated with 
 <italic>Gardenia ternifolia</italic> showed a nonsignificant decrease in alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) levels and a significant increase in uremia. In addition, an influence on the hematopoietic system marked by a reduction in the hematocrit level, the number of red blood cells, the mean globular volume, the hemoglobin level, and the mean corpuscular concentration of hemoglobin was also noted for the treatment with 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic>. These data suggest possible alterations of renal and hepatic functions and risk of anemia. However, histological examination of the kidneys and liver did not reveal any structural alterations of these organs. The confrontation of the data in this study with those in the literature shows variable relationships. Indeed, the studies of Adeyemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], on the subacute toxicity of the aqueous extract from the leaves of the plant, reported that daily exposure of Wistar rats to this extract by oral route at doses of 40, 200, and 1000 mg/kg for 30 days had no significant influence on the hematological and biochemical parameters of these animals. However, at an exposure time of 60 days, significant changes in these parameters and bodyweight were reported. Moreover, Wazis et al. [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] reported the toxicity of the ethanolic extract of the leaves of the plant administered by the intraperitoneal route to mice (DL
 <sub>50</sub> = 282.24 mg/kg) and Wistar rats (DL
 <sub>50</sub> = 1 g/kg). In addition, in this study, no mortality was recorded for animals treated with this plant. These observations indicate that the use of 
 <italic>R. coccinea</italic> at high doses in traditional medicine requires special attention.
