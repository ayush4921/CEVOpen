<p>The results of this study indicate that polysaccharide from 
 <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> polysaccharide can regulate the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting the activation of the Akt/mTOR and NF-
 <italic>Îº</italic>B signaling pathway. This study also confirms that IOP has obvious antitumor activity against osteosarcoma and has the potential for clinical application in osteosarcoma treatment. At the same time, the molecular study provides a theoretical basis for the application of IOP in the treatment of osteosarcoma. However, this study lacks in vivo animal and clinical experiments, which are the shortcomings of this study and the direction for future development.
