<p>Osteosarcoma is one of the most common malignant bone tumors, which seriously endangers the health of adolescents. In recent years, with the development of chemotherapy drugs, the survival rate of osteosarcoma has improved; however, the overall effectiveness is still not satisfactory. Drug resistance and side effects are the leading causes of cancer treatment failure. Therefore, it is imperative to seek alternative methods, and it has become a hot spot for research. In China, IOP has been used as a folk medicine for treating cancer and other diseases for thousands of years [
