<p>Thereby, Akt/mTOR signaling pathway plays an important role in a variety of cellular biological processes of tumor cells, including autophagy, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis [

 <italic>κ</italic>B has been shown to control the expression of tumor-related genes, such as Cyclin D1, c-Myc, HER2, interleukins, and XIAP, to regulate chronic inflammation, tumor cell survival, antiapoptosis, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis [

 <italic>κ</italic>B, can increase transcription activity after phosphorylation, causing the activation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, thereby promoting the transcription of related oncogenes [

 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway and further supplement the understanding of the antitumor mechanism of IOP.
