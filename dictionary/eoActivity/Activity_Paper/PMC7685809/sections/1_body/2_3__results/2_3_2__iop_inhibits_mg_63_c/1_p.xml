<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, CCK8 assay was used to measure the proliferation of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells, and after IOP was added to MG-63 cells and U2OS cells at different concentrations (10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), compared with the control group, the cell proliferation activity was significantly reduced (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) when the IOP was at the concentrations of 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL after 48 h and 72 h of treatments. This result indicates that IOP can inhibit the proliferation of osteosarcoma cells.
