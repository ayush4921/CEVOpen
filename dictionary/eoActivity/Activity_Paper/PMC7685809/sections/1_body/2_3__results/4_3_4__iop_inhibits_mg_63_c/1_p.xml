<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, when IOP was added to MG-63 cells and U2OS cells at different concentrations (80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) compared with the control group, the invasive ability of the cells was significantly reduced in the 80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL groups (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). And this inhibition of cell invasion by the treatment of IOP was in a concentration-dependent manner. This result indicates that IOP can inhibit the invasion of osteosarcoma cells.
