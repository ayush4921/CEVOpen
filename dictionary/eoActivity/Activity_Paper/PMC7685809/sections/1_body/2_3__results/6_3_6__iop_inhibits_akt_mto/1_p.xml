<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, after adding IOP to MG-63 cells and U2OS cells at different concentrations (80 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 160 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 320 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), compared with the control group, the phosphorylation levels of Akt and mTOR as well as NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B p65 were significantly reduced (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) at all treatment groups. And with the increase of the IOP levels, the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 and Thr308 as well as the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B p65 decreased dramatically. This result indicates that IOP can inhibit the activation of the Akt/mTOR and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathways.
