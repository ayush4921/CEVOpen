<p>Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common malignant bone tumor that occurs mainly in adolescents and young people [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Osteosarcoma is an extremely aggressive malignant tumor characterized by rapid growth and early metastasis [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is suggested that clinical prognosis from conventional osteosarcoma treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy is still not satisfactory [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although new drugs have been applied in osteosarcoma chemotherapy, however, it could also result in strong drug resistance and unnecessary side effects, which can further cause serious problems [
