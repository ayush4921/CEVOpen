<p>After the cells were treated with different concentrations of IOP for 24 h, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Total protein was then extracted using a RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor, and total protein was then quantified using a BCA protein concentration determination kit. An equal amount of protein (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/well) from each treatment was taken and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and the protein was then electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was then blocked with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The membrane was then washed and was incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Protein bands were then detected using the ECL luminescence kit.
