<p>Cell invasion tests were carried out using a matrix gel-coated transwell cell. Specifically, 1.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> MG-63 cells or U2OS cells treated with different concentrations of IOP for 24 h were inoculated into the upper chamber with 100 ml of serum-free DMEM, and 500 ml of medium containing 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. After 24 h of incubation, the cells on the surface of the upper membrane were wiped with a cotton swab, and the cells passing through the membrane were fixed with methanol, stained with crystal violet, and counted afterward.
