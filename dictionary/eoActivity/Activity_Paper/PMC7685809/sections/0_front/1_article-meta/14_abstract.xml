  <title>Objectives</title>
  <p> To observe the effect of 
   <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic> polysaccharide (IOP) on the proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells and to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism.

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p> IOP was extracted from 
   <italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic>, human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells and U2OS cells were cultured in vitro, and the effects of IOP on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells were determined by CCK-8 assays, cell scratch assays, transwell assays, and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression of related proteins in the Akt/mTOR and NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathways.

 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p> Compared with the control group, MG-63 cells and U2OS cells treated with IOP of 80 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, 160 
   <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, and 320 
   <italic>μ</italic> g/ml in the experimental group had significantly lower proliferation activity, decreased migration and invasion ability, and increased apoptosis rate (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, IOP could significantly inhibit the activation of the Akt/mTOR and NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B signaling pathway (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p> IOP can regulate the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. It has antitumor activity on osteosarcoma and has the potential of clinical application in osteosarcoma treatment.</p>
