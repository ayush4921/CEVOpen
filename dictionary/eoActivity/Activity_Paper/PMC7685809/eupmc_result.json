    "<h4>Objectives</h4>To observe the effect of <i>Inonotus obliquus</i> polysaccharide (IOP) on the proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells and to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism.<h4>Methods</h4>IOP was extracted from <i>Inonotus obliquus</i>, human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells and U2OS cells were cultured in vitro, and the effects of IOP on the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of MG-63 cells and U2OS cells were determined by CCK-8 assays, cell scratch assays, transwell assays, and flow cytometry, respectively. Western blot was used to detect the expression of related proteins in the Akt/mTOR and NF-<i>κ</i>B signaling pathways.<h4>Results</h4>Compared with the control group, MG-63 cells and U2OS cells treated with IOP of 80 <i>μ</i>g/ml, 160 <i>μ</i>g/ml, and 320 <i>μ</i> g/ml in the experimental group had significantly lower proliferation activity, decreased migration and invasion ability, and increased apoptosis rate (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, IOP could significantly inhibit the activation of the Akt/mTOR and NF-<i>κ</i>B signaling pathway (<i>P</i> < 0.05).<h4>Conclusion</h4>IOP can regulate the proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. It has antitumor activity on osteosarcoma and has the potential of clinical application in osteosarcoma treatment."
