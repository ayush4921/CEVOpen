    "Current treatments for complex diseases have remarkable side effects that negatively impact patients' quality of life. Thus, natural compounds with fewer side effects represent a promising source for safe drugs. The genus <i>Senecio</i> is widely used in folk medicine due to its various pharmacological properties. In the present study, the total phenolic content of <i>Senecio glaucus</i>, which is grown in Saudi Arabia, was assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteau colorimetric method. Scavenging DPPH and ABTS assays were utilized to determine the antioxidant properties of <i>S. glaucus</i> fractions, and MTT assay was used to screen the cytotoxic activity of <i>S. glaucus</i> against various cancer cells. In addition, HPLC-UV was utilized to detect the presence of two phenolic acids, namely, vanillic acid (VA) and gallic acid (GA). Among all fractions tested, <i>S. glaucus</i> chloroform fraction (SGCF) yielded the highest value (125.3 mg·GA/g) in terms of total phenolic content. SGCF also exhibited the highest scavenging activities (76.7 and 74.1%) on both DPPH and ABTS assays, respectively. Similarly, SGCF also possessed the most potent cytotoxic activity against the MCF-7 cell line, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 41.8 <i>μ</i>g/ml. The validated HPLC method confirmed the presence of VA (4.8 <i>μ</i>g/mg DW) and GA (3.9 <i>μ</i>g/mg DW) in SGCF. Overall, our data show that <i>S. glaucus</i> had antioxidant and cytotoxic properties. A developed validated HPLC method which could be helpful for quantifying phenolic compounds in <i>S. glaucus</i> was established."
