<p>HPLC-grade acetonitrile and acetic acid were obtained from VWR International Ltd. (Poole, England). The water used in the analysis was purified by a Milli-Q purification system manufactured by Purelab Flex: Elga Veolia Ltd. (High Wycombe, UK). Standard compounds of gallic acid (≥96%) and vanillic acid (99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). All solvents used during the mobile phase were previously filtered through 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m Millipore and degassed prior to use. The standard solutions were prepared by dissolving the accurate weights of the reference standards in methanol to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and then further diluted with additional methanol to arrive at different diluted solutions for the preparation of standard calibration curves. All samples for HPLC analysis were filtered through 0.45 
 <italic>μ</italic>m Millipore and immediately used for analysis.
