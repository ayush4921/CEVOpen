<p>The antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> crude extract and fractions was estimated utilizing the ABTS method as utilized by Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with slight modifications. In brief, ABTS (7 mM) and potassium persulfate (2.45 mM) aqueous solutions were mixed, incubated for 0.5 h, and kept in the refrigerator for 24 h, after which it was diluted with ethanol. Thereafter, the ABTS solution (50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) was mixed with different concentrations for each fraction (1 : 1). The antioxidant percentage activity of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> fractions was demonstrated based on the reduction of ABTS, which was optically measured at 734 nm using the following formula [
