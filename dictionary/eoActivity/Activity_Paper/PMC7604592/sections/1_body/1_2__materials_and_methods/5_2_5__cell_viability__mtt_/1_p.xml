<p>Cell viability MTT assay was carried out according to Alqahtani et al. [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In brief, A549 (lung), MCF-7 (breast), and HepG2 (liver) cancer cells were harvested, counted, and plated on the bottom of a 24-well plate (5 x  10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) for 24 h to allow for attachment. Various concentrations of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> fractions were added to each well and incubated with the cells at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. After 48 h, 0.1 ml of 5 mg/ml MTT was added to each well, and the plates were again incubated at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 2–4 hours. Next, the media were aspirated, a solution of 0.01 N HCl in isopropanol was added to each well, and the plates were placed in a shaker for 10 min to dissolve the formed formazan crystals. The absorbance was read at 570 nm using a microplate reader. The concentration at which cell viability is reduced by 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using OriginPro 8.5 software.
