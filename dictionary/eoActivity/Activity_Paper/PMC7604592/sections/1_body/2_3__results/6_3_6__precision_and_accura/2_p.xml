<p>Accuracy was determined through percent recovery with the addition of the standard solution to the 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> sample at three different concentrations: 0.50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 5.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 20.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. 
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> shows the mean recoveries calculated on the basis of determination after exposing the samples with known amounts of analytes at three concentration levels. The mean recovery values of the two investigated analytes ranged from 95.43 to 100.39%, and their % RSD at each concentration was all less than 1.60%, which indicated that the proposed method was accurate enough for the quantification of VA and GA in 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic>.
