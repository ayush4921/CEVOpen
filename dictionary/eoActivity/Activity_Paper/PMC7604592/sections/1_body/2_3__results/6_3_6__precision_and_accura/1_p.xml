<p>The quantification, repeatability (intraday), and intermediate precision (interday) of the method proposed here were measured and presented as the relative standard deviation (% RSD). The experimental data are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The proposed method was precise, as indicated by % RSD values for the intraday (within 1 day) and interday (between three consecutive days) precision measurements. The precision assays for GA and VA were in accordance with the limit recommended by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] as the % RSD values ranged from 1.13–3.45 to 1.53–4.10% for intra- and interassay precision values, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>).
