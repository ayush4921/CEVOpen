<p>The wavelength maxima (
 <italic>Î»</italic> max) of standard GA and VA were analyzed in order to obtain the optimal detection wavelength to be used for chromatographic analysis. The UV/vis spectrum scan of each HPLC peak was determined, and the detection wavelength was set according to the ultraviolet (UV) absorption maxima of the two analytes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Different mobile phase compositions, flow rates, and injection volumes were tested to improve the peak shape and resolution for the optimization of chromatographic conditions. Recognition and peak assignment of GA and VA were identified by comparing the mean of retention times and absorption spectrum of individual standards with the chromatographic profile of the extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Once the optimum chromatographic conditions that allowed the satisfactory resolution of the two studied analytes were detected, the performance of the HPLC method was assessed by validating the method with an 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> sample. The quality parameters of the chromatographic method, such as linearity, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy, were determined [
