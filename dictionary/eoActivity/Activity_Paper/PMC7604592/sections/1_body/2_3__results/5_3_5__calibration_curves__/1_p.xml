<p>Detector response linearity was evaluated based on calibration curves. Calibration curves were studied based on the linear correlation between the peak area (
 <italic>y</italic>-axis) and concentration (
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of the standard (
 <italic>x</italic>-axis). Linear curves for each analyte were constructed using six concentration points, in triplicate, for each phenolic compound. The correlation coefficient, intercept, and the slope of each calibration line were calculated using regression analysis. The linear range was found to be from 0.10 to 20.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for GA and from 0.20 to 20.00 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for VA. The values of the limit of detection (LOD) of the proposed method were 0.16 and 0.12 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for GA and VA, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and those for the corresponding limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.47 and 0.36 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. The linear curves showed best-fit linear regression (coefficient of determination r
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.997 for GA and VA, 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
