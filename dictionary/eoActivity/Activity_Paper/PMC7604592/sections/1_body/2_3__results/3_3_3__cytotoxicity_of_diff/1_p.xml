<p>All fractions showed cytotoxic activity in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The most effective fractions were the chloroform fractions (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 41.8), which showed potent cytotoxic activity against MCF-7, followed by the hexane fraction, which showed moderate cytotoxicity in comparison with the remaining fractions. The results of the cytotoxicity evaluation in terms of IC
 <sub>50</sub> against all tested cell lines are summarized in
