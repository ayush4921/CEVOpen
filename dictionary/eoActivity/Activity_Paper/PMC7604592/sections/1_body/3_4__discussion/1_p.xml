<p>Plants are a valuable source of different phytochemicals that display various biological activities, including antioxidant and anticancer properties. The exploration of natural sources in search of biological agents with fewer side effects and good efficacy compared to synthesized compounds is continuously being conducted. In this report, we documented the profile of phenolic contents and the antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of 
 <italic>S. glaucus</italic> found in Saudi Arabia. Species of the 
 <italic>Senecio</italic> genus are known for containing an abundance of phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Albayrak et al. (2014) reported that several species of the 
 <italic>Senecio</italic> genus growing in Turkey contained high total phenolic contents that ranged from 11.63 ± 2.1 mg GAE/g extract in 
 <italic>S. viscosus</italic> to 117.45 ± 1.8 mg GAE/g in 
 <italic>S. cilicius</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The total phenolic contents for the same species found in Egypt also showed comparable values [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
