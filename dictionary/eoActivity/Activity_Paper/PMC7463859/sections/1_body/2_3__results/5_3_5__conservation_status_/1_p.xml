<p>In recent times, global conservation of threatened plant diversity has gradually increased, and governments around the world have been working on this issue. Climate change, human-caused habitat change, and the introduction of exotic plants are considered among the main drivers for habitat loss and species extinction. Therefore, ex-situ conservation is recommended for endangered species. The same holds true for the study area, but until now no project has been started for the conservation of forests or vegetation. Consistent with IUCN Red List Criteria (2001) the conservation status of the 96 wild medicinal species encountered was assessed, and 28 species were found to be vulnerable followed by 25 that were rare, 17 infrequent and 16 dominant, respectively, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01001-f005">Figure 5</xref>. We found that 10 species were endangered in the study area, due to urbanization, small size population, anthropogenic activities, much collection, marble mining and adverse climatic conditions. The remaining 11 plants were cultivated, and 1 plant (

Indigenous knowledge can also contribute to sustainable use and conservation of important medicinal plant species.
