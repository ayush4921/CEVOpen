<p>Phytochemical investigation of the methanol extract of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> leaves has resulted in the identification of three terpenoids and six flavonoids. The terpenoids were found to be stigmasterol, betulinic acid, and an isomeric mixture of sitosterol (∆
 <sup>5</sup>) glycoside and stigmasterol (∆
 <sup>5,22</sup>) glycoside, whereas the flavonoids were quercetin, hypolectin, isoscutellarein astragalin, kaempferol, and kaempferol-3-O-(6″-O-p-trans-coumaroyl) glucoside. Further assay of hypoletin showed its adipocyte stimulation and skeletal muscle glucose-uptake stimulation activities, suggesting its usefulness for the management of type 2 DM.[
