<p>After the confirmation of safety, the main experiment was carried out in order to investigate the effectiveness of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> leaves as an antidiabetic herb. Healthy and alloxan-induced diabetic rats were fed orally with aqueous and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> leaves, and blood glucose levels were measured every 2 h (at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h). The results were compared with those of a positive control group treated with the antidiabetic drug glibenclamide at a concentration of 0.25 mg/kg of body weight. Both aqueous and methanol extracts produced a significant fall in the fasting blood glucose levels of diabetic rats (as compared to glibenclamide) without inducing hypoglycemia in healthy nondiabetic rats. Moreover, the aqueous extract showed a more potent antihyperglycemic effect than the methanol extract.[
