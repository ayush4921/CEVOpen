<p>Glucose-uptake stimulant effect was assessed for each of the isolated metabolites. Genistein did not enhance glucose-uptake at all tested concentrations, whereas the other four compounds produced a considerable increase in the basal and insulin-treated glucose uptake. Furthermore, muscle cell toxicity was investigated for each compound. Compounds 3–5 did not show any toxic effect at concentrations up to 60 µM after a 24-h treatment. On the contrary, genistein and 3′,5′-diprenylgenistein showed muscle cell toxicity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 34.27 and 18.69 µM, respectively. Results of this study confirmed the antihyperglycemic effect of
