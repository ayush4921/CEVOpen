<p>Furthermore, the total contents of phenols and flavonoids were measured spectrophotometrically in both aqueous and methanol extracts and were expressed as gallic acid equivalents (GAE) and quercetin equivalents (QE) mg/g of plant extract, respectively. The chemical characterization of the aqueous extract resulted in 4.75 GAE mg/g of phenolic compounds and 5.77 QE mg/g of flavonoids, whereas the methanol extract was found to contain 7.26 GAE mg/g of phenolic compounds and 6.34 QE mg/g of flavonoids.[
