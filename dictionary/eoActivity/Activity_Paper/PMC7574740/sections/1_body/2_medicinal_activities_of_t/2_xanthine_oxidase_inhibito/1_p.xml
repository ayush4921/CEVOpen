 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory activity of the 1:1 methanol:water extract of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic>, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 15.6 µg/mL. Nguyen and Nguyen[
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] followed the activity-guided fractionation approach to characterize the metabolites responsible for XO inhibitory activity. Quercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.9 µM), kaempferol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4 µM), tiliroside (13) (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 10.7 µM), betulinic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.8 µM), platanic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 42.3 µM), and emodin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;100 µM) were isolated from the methanol extract of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic>’ stem. In addition to these previously known flavonoids, a new nor-lupane triterpene was also isolated. The triterpene was found to be 28-O-ß-D-glucopyranosyl ester of platanic acid (with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 65.9 µM). It is noteworthy that quercetin was the most potent of the isolated compounds with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.9 µM, even more potent than the prototype XO inhibitor allopurinol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.5 µM).
