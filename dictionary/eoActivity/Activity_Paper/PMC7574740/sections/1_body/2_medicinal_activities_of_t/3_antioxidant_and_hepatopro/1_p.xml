 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] proposed that the hepatoprotective effect of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> is due to the antioxidant properties of the plant metabolites. To explore the hepatoprotective potential of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> and to prove their hypothesis, Thanh 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] conducted an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study using a model of acute hepatitis based on the well-known hepatotoxin “carbon tetrachloride” (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>). Metabolism of CCl
 <sub>4</sub> results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including trichloromethyl free radical (CCl
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>•</sup>) and trichloromethyl peroxy radical (CCl
 <sub>3</sub>OO
 <sup>•</sup>). Hepatotoxicity caused by CCl
 <sub>4</sub> is mediated by the induction of oxidative stress in the hepatic tissue, leading eventually to hepatic necrosis and fibrosis.
