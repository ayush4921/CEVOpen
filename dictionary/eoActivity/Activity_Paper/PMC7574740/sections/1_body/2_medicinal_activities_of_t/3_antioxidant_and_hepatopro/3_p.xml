<p>Serum levels of AST and ALT were considerably higher in the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group as compared to the control group (proves the hepatotoxic effect of CCl
 <sub>4</sub>) and were significantly lowered in the extract-pretreated group as compared to the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group (indicates the hepatoprotective effect of 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> leaves in the prevention of hepatotoxin-induced acute liver injury). Similarly, levels of the biomarkers that denote lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were much higher in the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group than in the control group. Furthermore, pretreatment with 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> ethanol extract had significantly reduced their levels in the extract-treated group. On the contrary, activities of the antioxidant enzymes were significantly reduced in the CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-treated group but were of normal levels for the extract pretreated animals. These findings proved that 
 <italic>T. scandens</italic> extract has a significant protective effect against CCl
 <sub>4</sub>-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, which may be due to its antioxidant properties.[
