<p>Our study had additional strengths in the following aspects. First, various types of natural compound and drug information, including latent knowledge, molecular interactions, and chemical properties, can be utilized in many other 
 <italic>in silico</italic> studies. All of the information was not extracted under specific conditions or constraints; thus, they can be easily used in various fields. We expect that the information will help address the lack of information that natural compound-related studies have been experiencing. Moreover, it can be utilized in drug-related studies such as drug repositioning, drug-drug interactions, and drug-target identification. Second, we can perform bidirectional analysis, including both bottom-up and top-down analyses. Our approach was basically a bottom-up analysis, as it was possible to find medicinal natural compound candidates for disease treatment based on the model trained using the extracted natural compound information. Additionally, we can perform top-down analysis of the predicted results by investigating detailed characteristics, including molecular mechanisms, oral bioavailability, drug availability, and tissue specificity, based on the input features. In conclusion, our study provided a combination of top-down and bottom-up analyses for more precise prediction.
