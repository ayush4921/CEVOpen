<p>There are additional considerations that may improve our method. First, there was a limited number of drugs and natural compounds that were used as training and test sets in the deep learning model. In the training step, a total of 2,882 approved and investigational drugs were used, which is relatively small compared with the number of input features. To compensate for this problem, inferred compound-disease associations from the CTD database were used in training, but another problem still remained: the inferred information was relatively unreliable. Furthermore, in the test step, only 4,507 natural compounds were considered owing to the limited current knowledge on natural compounds. However, these problems will be solved as knowledge on natural compounds will accumulate in future experiments. Second, it was difficult to clearly interpret the exact manner in which the current deep learning model made predictive results. This problem has been raised continuously in the field of machine learning, and efforts have recently been made to solve it through layer-wise analysis (

With further improvements, we expect that our model will make more reliable predictions of the medicinal uses of natural compounds.
