<p>In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach to predict the medicinal uses of natural compounds. Our previous studies have shown that the various properties of natural compounds, such as molecular and chemical properties, can be utilized to predict the medicinal uses of natural compounds (

Moreover, additional information was extracted by capturing latent knowledge from scientific literature to complement the incomplete molecular and chemical information. However, it is still difficult to perform integrated analysis because the extracted information is complex and heterogeneous. Also, the number of extracted features are relatively large comparing with the number of samples of training dataset. To solve this problem, we applied a partially connected deep neural network approach. The complex and heterogeneous information can be captured and analyzed by constructing multiple hidden layers in the deep learning model. For all approved and investigational drugs, we extracted latent knowledge, molecular interactions, and chemical property features and used them as inputs of the model. To predict the medicinal use of natural compounds, we used medicinal effects of drugs as the output class labels. Finally, the medicinal uses of 4,507 natural compounds for 15 diseases were predicted by the trained deep learning model. The evaluation results showed that a large number of predictions were successfully identified with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. To conclude, the novelty of the present study is three-fold. Firstly, it is the first deep learning-based approach that identifies the medicinal uses of natural compounds. Secondly, it can be used to perform a large-scale natural compound study by utilizing large amounts of heterogeneous information, including latent knowledge, molecular interactions, and chemical properties, to mitigate the inadequacies of incomplete information, which causes a bottleneck effect. Finally, this approach can be used in a preliminary screening of natural compounds from a large number of candidates.
