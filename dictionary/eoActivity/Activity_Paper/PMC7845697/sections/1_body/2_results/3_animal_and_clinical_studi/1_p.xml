<p>In this study, the medicinal uses of natural compounds were identified by deep learning. To evaluate the predicted effects of the natural compounds, we performed evidence-based analysis (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Firstly, we investigated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies. 5-Caffeoylquinic acid may prevent cognitive impairment in mice with Alzheimer’s disease (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ishida et al., 2020</xref>). Tangeretin may have therapeutic effects on rheumatoid arthritis in a rat model (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Gossypol family members, such as BH3 mimetics, may have benefits in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Billard, 2013</xref>). Indolyl-methyl-glucosinolate was reported to exert anti-inflammatory activity (
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">Vo et al., 2014</xref>), and gentianine showed low anti-inflammatory activity in carrageenan-induced hind-paw edema (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Perez, 2001</xref>). Gambogic acid may ameliorate angiogenesis in mice with diabetic retinopathy (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2018</xref>). Gamma-oryzanol was shown to be safe and effective in improving the conditions of diabetes mellitus in several animal studies (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Szcześniak et al., 2016</xref>). Octopamine may be involved in central blood pressure regulation (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Delbarre et al., 1982</xref>). According to the reperfusion duration, route of administration, and timing of the pretreatment regimen, resveratrol showed benefits in the treatment of myocardial infarct-sparing (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2019</xref>). N-methyl-(R) salsolinol, as an endogenous neurotoxin, may induce Parkinson’s disease in rats (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Naoi et al., 1997</xref>). The proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells was prohibited using neohesperidin in a time- and dose-dependent manner in human breast adenocarcinoma (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Tritiated norephedrine may inhibit the substitution of beta-phenylethylamines in rats (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Henderson et al., 1995</xref>). Agmatine protected brain tissues from edema after cerebral ischemia in mice (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2010</xref>).
