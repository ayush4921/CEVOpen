<p>Our method provided a list of the effects of the natural compounds with quantified scores. To assess the predictive performance, the AUROC and accuracy were calculated. We tested the performance for two different types of model structure and four different types of input data: 1) partially connected model using all features; 2) fully connected model using all features; 3) fully connected model using the latent knowledge feature only; 4) fully connected model using the molecular interaction feature only; 5) fully connected model using the chemical property feature only.</p>
