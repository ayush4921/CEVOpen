<p>We performed various statistical tests to analyze the characteristics of the chemical property features. Firstly, we compared the distribution of the chemical properties of the natural compounds and drugs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure S1 in Supplementary Data S1</xref>). The results indicated that the median values of 68% chemical properties of natural compounds lie inside of the interquartile range of drugs. The mean, standard deviation, and standard error of the mean values of the chemical properties of the natural compounds and drugs are provided in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table S1 in Supplementary Data S1</xref>. Secondly, we compared the average similarity between compounds with the same medicinal effects and randomly selected drugs. It was confirmed that the average similarity of compounds with the same medicinal effect was 0.259 ± 0.031, whereas the average similarity of randomly selected compounds was 0.091 ± 0.014. This result indicated that the chemical properties of compounds with the same medicinal effect were likely to be similar.
