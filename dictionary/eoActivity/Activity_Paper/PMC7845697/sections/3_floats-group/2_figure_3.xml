  <p>Architecture of the deep learning model for predicting the potential effects of natural compounds. We used latent knowledge, molecular interaction, and chemical property features as the inputs of the model, and each feature consisted of 101, 241, and 300 fixed‚Äêlength numeric vectors. To capture the high-level representation of each feature, we applied both partially connected and fully connected neural network structures. The model was trained based on the extracted features and verified indication information of drugs. Models were generated for 15 diseases, respectively. Finally, we predicted the potential medicinal effects of natural compounds based on the trained model.</p>
