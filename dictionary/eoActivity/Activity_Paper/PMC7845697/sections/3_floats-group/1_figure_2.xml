  <p>A systematic procedure of deep learning model for the identification of medicinal use of natural compounds. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> We constructed an integrated database to merge various types of drug and natural compound information. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> For all natural compounds and drugs, input features were generated based on the latent knowledge, molecular interaction and chemical property information. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> We trained a deep learning model by using the extracted features and known efficacy of approved drugs. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Potential medicinal use of natural compounds was predicted by applying extracted features of natural compounds to the trained model.
