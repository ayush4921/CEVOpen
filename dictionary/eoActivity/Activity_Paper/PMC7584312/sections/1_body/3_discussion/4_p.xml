<p>The UK National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies 2017 [
 <xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] documented an increased likelihood of emerging infectious diseases relative to the year 2015. However, the impact severity (ranked 3 out of 5) and likelihood of occurrence (ranked 4 out of 5) in the five years following the report's publication was considered equivalent to low air quality, heat waves and space weather. Nonetheless, the government continued to acknowledge the high impact severity (5 out of 5) of a potential flu pandemic. However, the likelihood was considered equivalent to that of other emerging infectious diseases (4 out of 5). Despite the relatively high likelihood of a (flu or emerging infectious disease) pandemic on the national risk register, this risk was primarily omitted in risk assessments before January 2020 at both trial and institutional level. Perhaps unsurprisingly, little guidance exists as to where the responsibility falls for assessing and adapting risk mitigation protocols for national and/or systemic risks not specific to the trial environment, such as the emergence of a pandemic.
