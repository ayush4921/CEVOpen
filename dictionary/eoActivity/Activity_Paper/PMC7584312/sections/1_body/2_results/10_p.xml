<p>The impact of COVID-19 on IMP regimes is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG3">3</xref>. For participants enrolled in trials, 13/34 (38%) made no changes to the IMP regime. 3/34 (9%) temporarily discontinued the IMP, and 3/34 trials (9%) reported that they prolonged or extended the treatment duration. 7/34 trials (21%) were not administrating the IMP at the time. 6/34 trials (18%) changed the logistics of the IMP management to allow participants to be titrated, infused or receive the IMP via post as to avoid the need to attend face-to-face appointments or collections.
