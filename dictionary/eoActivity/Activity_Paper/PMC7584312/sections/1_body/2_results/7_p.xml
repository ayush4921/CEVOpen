<p>Sixteen out of 34 trials (47%) temporarily halted recruitment during the pandemic, 4/34 trials (12%) continued recruitment with modification to procedures, and the remaining 14 trials (41%) were not actively recruiting e.g. studies in the follow -up phase. Data on recruitment decisions as well as the primary factor for the decision is shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG2">2</xref>. Of the trials that halted recruitment, the majority of 9/16 (56%) identified participant safety as the most important factor in the decision. Seven trials halted recruitment as directed by the sponsor (4/16 (25%)) or by an NHS Trust (n=3, (19%)). The decision halt recruitment was driven by several factors. Patient safety and staff considerations that included e.g. healthcare staff redeployment were independent factors in 11/16 trials (69%). Institutional guidance from the sponsor influenced decision making in 8/16 trials (50%), and an NHS Trust directive influenced 7/16 trials (44%). Guidance from funders had less bearing influencing the decision in only 2/16 (5%) trials. Furthermore, logistics such as drug delivery was a factor in decision making in only 5/16 trials (31%). Other factors that were considered included the risks associated with treatment, data integrity/validity considerations and participant benefit of treatment.
