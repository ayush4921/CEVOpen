<p>The sponsor organisations of the 265 CTIMPs were identified via EudraCT and invited to take part using contact details via publicly available sources such as trial registries. This survey included a total of 149 sponsor invitations (given that some sponsors provide support to more than one study). Also, 46 clinical trial units (CTUs) who are fully registered with the UK Clinical Trials Research Network (UKCTRN) were identified via the UKCTRN website. Of these, seven CTUs specialised in areas beyond the scope of the trial criterionÂ (e.g. paediatrics or cancer research) and were excluded. A total of 39 CTUs were invited to take part in the survey.</p>
