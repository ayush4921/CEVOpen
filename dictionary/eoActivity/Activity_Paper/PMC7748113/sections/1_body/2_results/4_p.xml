<p>The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> was assessed by evaluating H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> and DPPH radical scavenging ability and RP assays (FRAP and RP), and the results are represented in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. As revealed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, all the extracts showed dose-response scavenging activity on DPPH. The ability of plant extracts to scavenge the DPPH radical is presented by the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. The lower is the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value, the stronger is the antioxidant activity of extracts. It was found that the type of solvent significantly affects the DPPH scavenging activity of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic>. The extracts obtained using 70% acetone exhibited the highest DPPH scavenging capacity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.551 ± 0.1 mg/ml), followed by the 70% methanol extract. The weakest DPPH scavenging capacity was obtained for the 70% ethanol extracts. However, the synthetic antioxidant, BHA, exhibited a higher DPPH radical scavenging effect than all 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> extracts. The FRAP values of different extracts were consistent with the antioxidant potential obtained from the DPPH assay. The result emphasized that 70% acetone extract possessed the strongest ferric RP as compared to other extracts (0.74 ± 0.049 mM Fe(II)/gDW). The weakest capacity to ferric RP was obtained in the ethanolic extract. The RP assay was peformed based on the redox reaction of the ferric ion in the presence of an antioxidant. The presence of antioxidants in the extracts led to the conversion of the oxidized Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>/ferricyanide complex to its reduced form, where the formation of Perl’s Prussian Blue was monitored at 700 nm. The higher absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated its higher reducing ability. As depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, three extracts of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> showed a concentration-dependent increase in their RP. The extract obtained with acetone exhibited the higher RP compared to those obtained with two other solvents. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of RP are presented in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The hydrogen peroxide scavenging ability of different extracts of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> is indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A, 2B, and 2C</xref>. An apparent decrease in absorbance at 530 nm in the presence of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> reflected the scavenging ability of the extracts. During this process, the phenolic compounds present in the extracts were oxidized, resulting in the discoloration as mentioned earlier. IT
 <sub>50</sub> (the time needed to dispose 50% of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> radical) is another parameter for the evaluation of the inhibitory effect of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> radical, where the lower the IT
 <sub>50</sub> value, the stronger the antioxidant activity. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the extracts obtained using 70% acetone exhibited the highest hydrogen peroxide scavenging ability, followed by the 70% methanol extract and 70% ethanol. A previous study regarding the effect of solvents on the extraction of phenolic compounds of the eggplant byproduct showed a similar trend for hydrogen peroxide scavenging ability
