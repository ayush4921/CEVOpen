<p>In this study, an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibitory effect of different extracts of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> on α-amylase and AChE was investigated. As revealed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>, all the extracts showed concentration-dependent inhibitory activity. The ability of different extracts to inhibit α-amylase and AChE is presented by the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the AAI rate of the acetone extract was significantly higher than the methanol and ethanol extracts. On the other hand, all the 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> extracts possessed promising inhibitory activity on AChE; among them, acetone suggested the best inhibitory effect, followed by methanol and ethanol extracts.
