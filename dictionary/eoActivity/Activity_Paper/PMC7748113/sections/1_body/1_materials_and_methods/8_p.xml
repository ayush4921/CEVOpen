<p>The chemical compositions of the essential oil were determined by GC-MS on a HP-6890/HP5 equipment (Agilent-7890A, Madrid, Spain). The GC was equipped with a TRB-5MS column (32 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 mm). The carrier gas was helium, wirh the split injection of 1 ml at 1 ml/min flow rate, and the injection temperature of 60 - 220 °C, with an increasing rate of 6 °C/min. The chemical constituents of the oil were identified by comparing their mass spectra with those available in the Wiley GC-MS library as well as by comparing them with those reported in the literature
