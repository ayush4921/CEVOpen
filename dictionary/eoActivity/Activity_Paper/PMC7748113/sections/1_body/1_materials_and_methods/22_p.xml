 <sup>]</sup>. Briefly, FRAP reagent was prepared by mixing acetate buffer (300 mM, pH 3.6), TPTZ (10 mM in 40 mM HCl), and FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (20 mM) in a ratio of 10:1:1. Afterwards, 500 Âµl of each sample was mixed with 1.5 ml of FRAP reagent. The mixture was shaken vigorously and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min before measuring the absorbance at 593 nm. Ferrous ammonium sulfate hexahydrate was used to create the standard curve. The FRAP value was expressed as mM FeSO
 <sub>4</sub> equivalents per gram of DW.
