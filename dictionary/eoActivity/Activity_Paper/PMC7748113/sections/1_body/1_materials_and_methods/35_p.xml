 <sup>]</sup>. At first, 200 µl of DTNB (5 mM), 150 µl of Tris/HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4), 10 µl of AChE, and 50 µl of different concentrations (0.1-1.5 mg/ml) of extracts were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. After incubation, the enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 100 µl of acetylthiocholine chloride. Control was prepared using the same procedure without any plant extracts. The hydrolysis of the substrate was recorded at 410 nm. AChE inhibitory activity was calculated according to Eq. (5)
