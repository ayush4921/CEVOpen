 <sup>]</sup>. Briefly, all extracts (1.5 ml) were mixed with 20 Âµl of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution 30%. The absorbance was monitored at 530 nm at 5-min intervals until it remained constant. The decrease in the absorbance was proportional to the H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> scavenging ability of extracts. The percent inhibition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> by the extracts was calculated according to Eq. (3).
