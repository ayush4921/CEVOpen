<p>The leaves of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> were collected from Neyriz, east of Fars Province (Iran), in April 2019. The air-dried and grounded leaves of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> were extracted using 70% aqueous solution of ethanol, methanol, and acetone. Then 10 g of dry powder of leaves was separately subjected to solvent extraction using 100 ml of solvents for one day. The mixture was then filtered on Whatman No. 1 filter paper, and a second extraction was performed. Both supernatants were mixed and concentrated in vacuum at 40 °C. The extraction for each solvent was conducted three times, and the obtained extracts were stored at 4 °C until further analysis.
