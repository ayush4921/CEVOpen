<p> The beneficial health (antioxidant and anti-inflammatory) or nutraceutical effects of anthocyanins on visual capacity, brain cognitive function, obesity, cardiovascular risk, and cancer prevention notified the importance of the efficient extraction of these compounds. Accordingly, three solvents (70% acidified methanol, 70% acidified ethanol, and 70% acidified acetone) were chosen here. Acidified organic solvents, especially methanol, are widely used for the extraction of anthocyanins from plant materials
