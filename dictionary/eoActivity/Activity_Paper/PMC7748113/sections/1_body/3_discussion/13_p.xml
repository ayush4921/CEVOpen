<p>Medicinal herbs offer potent natural alternatives for synthetic antioxidants and disease-associated enzyme inhibitors. To our knowledge, this study was the first to evaluate the bioactivities of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> extracts prepared by different extraction solvents. Our data revealed that the extraction with different solvents affects the contents of phenolic compounds and their bioactivities. Among the extracts, the aqueous acetonic extract exhibited the highest phenolic content, antioxidant ability, anti-cholinesterase, and anti-amylase activity. Meanwhile, it would be interesting to identify the key compounds contributing to these activities to accurately evaluate the influence of different solvents on the extraction of phenolic constituents and the association between their compositions and the resulting activities. Taken together, 
 <italic>A. repens</italic> extracts have been found to be a promising antioxidant-rich therapeutic component with antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory features for the food and pharmaceutical industry. However, further studies are required to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
 <italic>A. repens.</italic>
