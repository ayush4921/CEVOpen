<p>Diabetes, as a chronic disease, is characterized by high blood glucose levels, particularly after fasting and consumption of meals. The inhibition of α-amylase as an enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of starch and oligosaccharides, has been considered as an important strategy for the management of diabetes. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the AAI rate of the acetone extract was significantly higher than the other extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Since the acetone extract possessed the highest level of phenolic contents (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it appears that the presence of phenolic compounds might contribute to AAI. Different studies have revealed that phenolics-rich extracts exhibited a good inhibitory effect on α-amylase
