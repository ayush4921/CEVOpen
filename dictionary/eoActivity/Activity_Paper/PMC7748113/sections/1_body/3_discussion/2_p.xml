<p>Phenolic compounds are one of the most important natural antioxidants because of their important bioactivities. Significant differences have been observed between TPC of various extracts of 
 <italic>A. repens</italic>, in a way that the acetonic extract exhibited a meaningful difference compared to two other extracts (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). No significant difference was observed between methanolic and ethanolic extracts. It seems that acetone is the most appropriate solvent for the extraction of phenolic compounds. In support of our results, other studies showed that acetone and ethanol are the most and least effective solvents for extracting phenolic contents from different plant sources
