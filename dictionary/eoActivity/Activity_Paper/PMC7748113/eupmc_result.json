    "<h4>Background</h4>This study was devoted to assessing the inhibitory potential of acetone, methanol, and ethanol extracts of Acroptilon repens against disease-associated enzymes, as well as their antioxidant/antibacterial activity and phytochemical composition.<h4>Methods</h4>Comparative assessment using various antioxidant evaluation methods, including ferric reducing antioxidant power, scavenging ability on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical and hydrogen peroxide, and reducing power, indicated that the acetone extract presented the highest antioxidant activity, due to its highest total antioxidant content.<h4>Results</h4>The total phenolic content and total flavonoids content of these extracts were 3.44 ± 0.32 mg GAE/g DW and 2.09 ± 0.2 mg QE/g DW, respectively. The hydrodistillation essential oil from A. repens was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and 17 compounds were identified. All extracts showed good inhibitory activities against disease-related enzyme acetylcholinesterase and α-amylase, with the lowest IC50 for acetonic extract. Extracts of A. repens exhibited inhibiting activities against the Gram-positive bacteria, with the most effect of acetone extract.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our findings suggest A. repens as a promising source of natural antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-cholinesterase and anti-amylase agents for the management of oxidative damage, and pharmaceutical, food, and cosmeceutical purposes."
