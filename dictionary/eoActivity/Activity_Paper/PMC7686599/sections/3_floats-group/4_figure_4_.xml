  <p>Kinetic analysis of BuChE inhibition. Different concentrations of galantamine (a) and REVERC3 (b) were incubated with various concentrations (100–1000 µM) of butyrylthiocholine iodide (BTC). The data are presented as graphics of nonlinear (Michaelis–Menten graph) and linear regressions (Lineweaver–Burk plots).</p>
