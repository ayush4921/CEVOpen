<p>BDMC was docked into the active sites of the cholinesterases and the top 10 binding poses were analyzed. The best binding conformation of BDMC with AChE active site showed profound interaction of the molecule with the substrate-binding site of the enzyme. BDMC exhibited hydrogen bond interaction with the key residue Phe295 in the acyl pocket of the active site (
