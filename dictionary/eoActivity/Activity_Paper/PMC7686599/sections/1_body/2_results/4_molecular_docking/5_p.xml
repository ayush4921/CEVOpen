<p>The preference of BDMC for the binding site of BuChE was different as compared to that for AChE. Here, we have used the substrate (BTC) bound enzyme as the receptor. BDMC was found to have H-bond interactions with the key residues of the catalytic triad His438 and Ser198. The affinity of BDMC with the enzyme-substrate complex was appreciable (Ki = 4.73 μM) with a binding energy of –7.27 kcal/mol.</p>
