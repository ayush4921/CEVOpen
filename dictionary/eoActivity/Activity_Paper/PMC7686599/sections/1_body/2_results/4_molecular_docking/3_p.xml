 </sup> In the case of AChE, the catalytic triad is formed by Ser203, Glu334, and His447. The anionic site involved in the binding of choline moiety of ACh contains the aromatic amino acids: Tyr130, Trp86, Tyr337, and Phe338. Another important region in the binding site is the acyl pocket required for the selective binding of ACh (Phe295 and Phe297). Furthermore, the oxyanionic hole formed by Gly121, Gly122, and Ala204 is the site where the structural water molecule stabilizes the enzyme-substrate complex. There exist peripheral anionic site (PAS) in proximity with the catalytic site of the enzyme which allosterically regulates the catalysis. PAS is formed by five residues: Asp74, Tyr72, Tyr124, Trp286, and Tyr341 (

However, the small structural differences in the active site are evident due to the difference in several amino acid residues determining the binding domains in the active site (
