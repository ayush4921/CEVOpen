<p>Different concentrations of galantamine and REVERC3 were further tested for the inhibition of BuChE enzyme and the kinetic parameters determined. Galantamine was found to inhibit the enzyme activity competitively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2050312120973499">Figure 4b</xref>). REVERC3 had reduced V

 <sub>m</sub> (139 µM) values compared to the enzyme activity without inhibitor (V
 <sub>max</sub> 0.08, K
 <sub>m</sub> 289.4 µM).
