<p>AChE kinetic analysis was performed using different substrate and inhibitor concentrations. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2050312120973499">Figure 3a</xref> shows the Michaelisâ€“Menten graph and the reciprocal L-B plot of AChE activity in the presence and absence of galantamine. From the data, it appears that galantamine exhibits mixed inhibition of AChE. On the contrary, it was observed from the kinetic analysis that REVERC3 demonstrated a competitive mode of inhibition (
