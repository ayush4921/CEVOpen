<p>Based on the inhibition data, we further rationalized the role of BDMC in REVERC3 by predicting its binding into the active sites of cholinesterases. Molecular docking analysis revealed that BDMC could strongly interact with the catalytic site of AChE with low binding energy and K
 <sub>i</sub> value. It was observed that the molecule had H-bond interaction with Phe295 residue in the acyl pocket of the active site. The competitive nature of inhibition of REVERC3 is well supported by the docked binding poses.
