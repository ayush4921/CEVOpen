<p>Further to investigate the interactions of BDMC with the active site residues of BuChE, we have used the substrate-bound protein as the receptor. The substrate was found to have interactions with the active gorge residues especially the Asp70 in the PAS region. BDMC could strongly interact with Ser198 and His438 residues in the catalytic domain, in presence of the substrate. This could explain the mode of binding of BDMC exerting the uncompetitive inhibition of BuChE.</p>
