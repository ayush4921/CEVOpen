 </sup> Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock 4.2. Autogrid was utilized to prepare the grid maps using a grid box size of 50 × 50 × 50 xyz points and the active site of AChE (x = 20.823, y = 16.078, and z = 18.939) and BuChE (x = 137.156, y = 113.437, z = 43.769). The Lamarckian genetic algorithm and the pseudo-Solis and Wets methods were applied for minimization, using default parameters.
