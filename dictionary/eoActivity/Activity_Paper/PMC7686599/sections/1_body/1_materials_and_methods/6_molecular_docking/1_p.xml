<p>The crystal structures of recombinant human AChE bound to donepezil (PDB ID: 4EY7, R = 2.35 Ǻ) and BuChE (PDB ID: 1P0P, R = 2.30 Ǻ) bound to BTC were downloaded from PDB database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.rcsb.org/</ext-link>) in .pdb format. The coordinates of PDB structures were prepared for molecular docking by removing the water ions and ligands using Python molecule viewer. AutoDock tool (ADT 1.5.4) was used to add polar hydrogens and Gasteiger charges. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of BDMC was obtained from Pubchem (
