 </sup> with modifications in the concentration of the substrate and enzyme used. Briefly, 200 µL of the reaction mixture in a 96-well plate contained 5 µL of AChE (0.012 U/mL, pH 7.8 sodium phosphate buffer) or BuChE (0.05 U/mL, pH 7.8 sodium phosphate buffer), 100 µL of DTNB (1.5 mM in pH 7.8 sodium phosphate buffer), and 20 µL of different concentrations of REVERC3 or galantamine. The reaction mixture was incubated at 25°C for 10 min and then 5 µL of the respective substrate solutions for AChE (0.75 mM ATC) or BuChE (0.75 mM BTC) assays were added to initiate the reaction. After 15 min incubation, the absorbance was measured at 405 nm using Ascent Multiskan EX plate reader. The assays were performed in triplicates. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as follows
