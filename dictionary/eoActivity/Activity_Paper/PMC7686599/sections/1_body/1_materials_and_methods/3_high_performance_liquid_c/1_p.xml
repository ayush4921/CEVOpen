<p>Quantification of BDMC in REVERC3 was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Shimadzu LC2030C Prominence-i (Japan) system at UV detection of 420 nm. Separation was carried out in Kinetex C-18 column (100 Ǻ, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm pore size) with a mobile phase of water: tetrahydrofuran (60:40) flowed at 1 mL/min. BDMC peak was identified based on retention time (RT) matched with the corresponding reference standard.</p>
