<p>In addition to air-drying or heating to process ginseng post-harvest, sulfur fumigation is also used. In this method, slices of ginseng and sulfur powder are placed in a desiccator in the lower and upper layers at 25 Â°C for 12 h. Sulfur-fumigation processing may reduce the concentrations of major ginsenosides (Rg1, Re, Rc, Rb2, and Rd) and produce some minor ginsenosides, such as Rh2 and Rg5, through hydrolysis, dehydration, and decarboxylation [
