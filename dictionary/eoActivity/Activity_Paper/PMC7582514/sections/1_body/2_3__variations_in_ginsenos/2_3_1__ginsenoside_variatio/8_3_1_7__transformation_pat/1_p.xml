<p>The diverse ginsenoside profiles in physically processed ginseng products indicate that several transformation pathways are involved in altering the saponin composition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04390-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The pathways may include demalonylation of unstable malonyl-ginsenosides into the corresponding neutral ginsenosides during dehydrating, streaming, heating or other processing [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The sugar moiety attached to the C–3, C–6, or C–20 may also be deglycosylated to produce minor ginsenosides, such as Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd→Rg3, F2, Rh2; Re, Rf→Rg1, Rg2, F1, and Rh1 [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Dehydration may occur at C–20 and the resulting double bond is formed either between C–20 and C–21 or between C–20 and C–22, leading to positional and geometric isomerism: Rk1, Rg5 and Rz1 are dehydrated ginsenosides of Rg3 [
