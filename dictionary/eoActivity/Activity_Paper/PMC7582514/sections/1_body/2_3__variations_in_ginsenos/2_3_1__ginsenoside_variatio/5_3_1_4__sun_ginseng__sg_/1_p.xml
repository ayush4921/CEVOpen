<p>To enhance the yield of the specific ginsenosides in RG and BG, a method of steaming raw ginseng at a higher temperature (120 Â°C) for 3 h has been developed. Heat-processed ginseng, designated as sun ginseng (SG), has been found to possess multiple biological activities, such as radical scavenging, anti-tumor, vasorelaxation, and anti-diabetes activities [

After heating at high temperature, the major ginsenosides (such as Rb1, Re, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Rg1, and malonyl-ginsenosides) are not detectable in SG or are present only at very low concentrations; however, the concentrations of the rare ginsenosides Rg3, Rg5, Rh4, and Rk1 are greatly increased, and several new acetylated ginsenosides (Rs4, Rs5, Rs6 and Rs7) have also been isolated from SG [
