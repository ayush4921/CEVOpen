<p>Black ginseng, as a promoted product of RG, is produced by steaming raw ginseng nine times at 95–100 °C for 2–3 h and then dehydrating the resulting product. Because of the different processing method, the color of ginseng changes to black and special ginsenosides are produced in addition to the main ginsenosides found in FG and WG. The major ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rb1, Rc, Rb2, and Rd are considerably reduced, while the concentrations of the minor ginsenosides Rg2, Rg3, Rh1, Rk1, Rs3, and Rg5 in BG are greater than in RG. The notable structural changes produced during the steam cycles are hydrolysis of the sugar moieties at C–3, C–6 or C–20 and subsequent dehydration at C–20 [
