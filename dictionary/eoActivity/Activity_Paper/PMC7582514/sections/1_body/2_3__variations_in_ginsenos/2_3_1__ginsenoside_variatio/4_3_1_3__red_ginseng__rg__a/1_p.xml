<p>Instead of processing by air-drying and heating for short periods, red ginseng is prepared by steaming fresh ginseng at 95–100 °C for 2–3 h before drying. The color of the ginseng changes from white/yellow to red after steaming [

 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Malonyl and major ginsenosides that are present at high concentrations in FW and WG are absent or reduced in RG, but Rb1 is present at high concentrations, possibly due to the dramatic loss of malonyl-Rb1 after steaming [

After steaming, the concentrations of ginsenosides Rg2, Rg3, Rh2, and Rh1 in RG are greater than in TG or DG, and the rare ginsenosides Rk1, Rs3, and Rg5 are also present in RG. The present of rare ginsenosides promotes pharmacologically activities more than the above ginsengs [
