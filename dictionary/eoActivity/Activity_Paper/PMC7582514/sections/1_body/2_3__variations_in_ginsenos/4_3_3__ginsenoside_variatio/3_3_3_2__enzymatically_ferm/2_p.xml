<p>Apart from commercial enzymes used for hydrolysis of ginsenosides, enzymes isolated from bacteria and fungi have also been recombined in host strains to enhance the enzyme activity. Several recombinant β-glucosidases show outstanding abilities for conversion of Rg3, Rh2, and CK by hydrolysis of the glucose at C–3 and C–20 [

 <xref rid="B121-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Recombinant β-glucosidase (bgp 1) not only transforms Rb1 and Rd into Rg3, but also generates Rg2 and Rh1 from Re when reacted with ginseng leaf saponins [
