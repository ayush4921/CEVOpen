<p>Fermentation of ginseng using microorganisms has been reported to improve the beneficial effects of ginseng because the microorganisms can convert glycosides to aglycones and/or produce their metabolites. One special ginsenoside, compound K (CK), is a bioactive ginsenoside that can be produced from ginsenoside Rb1and Rb2 by intestinal microflora [
 <xref rid="B103-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Production of CK by physical or chemical methods has proven challenging. As a result, microorganisms have been widely used to increase the concentrations of compound K in ginseng products. When comparing fermented ginseng samples produced using various microorganisms, ginseng root fermented with 
 <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> (isolated from Kimchi) for five days produced the greatest concentrations of CK, and the resulting product may have potential as a functional food for treatment and prevention of various diseases [

 <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp., the concentrations of Rd and Rg3 increase due to microbial transformation of Rb1 and Rc [

 <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> Hâ€“1 produces mainly CK, Rg3, and Rh2, and the product exhibits significantly better protection against ischemia-reperfusion brain injury than RG (which lacks Rh2 and CK). Kim et al. (2010) confirmed that red ginseng fermented with 
 <italic>L. plantarum</italic> M1 is very useful for preparing minor ginsenoside metabolites (Rg3, CK, Rh1, Rh2) while being safe for foods [

 <xref rid="B107-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Fermented black ginseng (FBG) is processed by repeated steaming and drying of fresh ginseng followed by fermentation with 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Fermentation of BG can produce more active ginsenosides and may have potential anti-wrinkle activity that could make it a desirable ingredient in cosmetics [
 <xref rid="B108-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]; FBG may also protect cells against oxidative damage by scavenging ROS [
