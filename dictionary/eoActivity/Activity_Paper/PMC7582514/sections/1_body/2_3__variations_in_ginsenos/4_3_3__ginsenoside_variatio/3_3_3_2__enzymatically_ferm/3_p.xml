<p>In addition to enzymatic deglycosylation by hydrolyzing the sugar moieties linked to C–3, C–6, or C–20, glycosylation catalyzed by glycosyltransferases (GTs) also plays a key biological role as the final step in ginseng saponin synthesis. The GT enzymes transfer glycosyl residues from activated sugars to the aglycones of ginsenosides, thus regulating the properties of ginsenosides, such as bioactivity, solubility and stability [
