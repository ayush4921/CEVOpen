<p>Many different processing techniques are employed, ranging from fresh ginseng (right out of the field with simple washing) to various physical (drying, boiling, steaming, heating, sulfur-fumigation, microwaving, and puffing), chemical (acid and alkaline treatments), and biological (fermentation using microbial or enzymes) processes [

 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There are a large number of reports describing the processing conditions and main methods for ginsenoside analysis [

 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, there have been few reviews addressing the diversity of ginsenosides found in various ginsengs subjected to different processing methods. Such information may allow better use of the various ginsengs and provide clues to direct future research into the biological functions of ginsenosides. Therefore, this review summarizes the distribution of ginsenosides in different ginseng species and processed products, and aims to improve the utilization of ginseng and particular ginsenosides in agricultural products, food, dietary supplements, health supplements, and medicines.
