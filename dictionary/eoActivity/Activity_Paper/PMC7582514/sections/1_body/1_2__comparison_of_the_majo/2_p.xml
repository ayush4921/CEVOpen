<p>Recently, 17 ginseng species in the genus 
 <italic>Panax</italic> were described by Zhang et al. (2020) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and the results are summarized in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04390-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Major ginsenosides (including Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, Rf, and Rg1) are naturally present in most ginseng plants, however the distribution and concentrations of the major ginsenosides differ in each 
 <italic>Panax</italic> species. Park et al. (2017) [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported that six major ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re, and Rg1) were found to comprise 90% of the total ginsenoside content of 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic>, and Chen et al. (2019) [
 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] used the six ginsenosides to evaluate ginsenoside abundance in 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> from different regions. The major ginsenosides are also present in other ginseng species at varying concentrations. The Rb1:Rg1 ratio is commonly used to assess the differences between ginsengs: Rb1:Rg1 ratios between 1 and 3 are typical for 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic> and 
 <italic>P. notoginseng,</italic> while ratios around 10 or greater are characteristic of 
 <italic>P. quinquefolius</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, several researchers have identified potential marker ginsenosides that could discriminate among ginseng species: For example, Yang et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] found that ginsenoside Rf and Rs
 <sub>1</sub> were unique to 
 <italic>P. ginseng,</italic> whereas pseudoginsenoside-F11 (p-F11) was only present in 
 <italic>P. quinquefolius</italic>; four characteristic markers for 
 <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> (Ra3) and 
 <italic>P. quinquefolius</italic> (Ro and p-F11) can be used to differentiate American ginseng and Notoginseng; Rf, Re, Rg1, Rc, Rb2, and Rd are abundant in 
 <italic>P. ginseng</italic>; Re, Rb1, and Rd are rich in 
 <italic>P. quinquefolius</italic>; and noto-R1, Rg1, and Rd are plentiful in 
 <italic>P. notoginseng</italic> [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04390" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
