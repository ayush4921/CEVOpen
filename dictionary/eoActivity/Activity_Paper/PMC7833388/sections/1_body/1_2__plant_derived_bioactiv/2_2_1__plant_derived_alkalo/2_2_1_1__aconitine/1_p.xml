<p>Aconitine, a diterpenoid alkaloid found in 
 <italic>Aconitum</italic> spp., is a voltage-gated sodium channel activator that effectively opens the Na
 <sup>+</sup> channels causing the prolonged presynaptic depolarization of muscles and neurons. In Chinese folk medicine, aconitine is used for pain relief caused by trigeminal and intercostal neuralgia, rheumatism, migraine, and general debilitation. Aconitine is a strong cardiotoxic and neurotoxic agent, and its side effects may cause bradycardia, hypotension, ventricular dysrhythmia, and inhibition of the release of neurotransmitters [

 <italic>Aconitum leucostomum</italic> [
