<p>Sanguinarine (SA), a toxic benzophenanthridine alkaloid found in the root of 
 <italic>Sanguinaria canadensis</italic> and leaves of 
 <italic>Macleaya cordata</italic>, recently gained attention for its cytotoxic and anticancer activities [
 <xref rid="B68-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It suppresses NF-ÎºB activation and induces a rapid apoptotic response via glutathione depletion, and mitochondrial damage [
 <xref rid="B96-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. It exhibits cytotoxicity via affecting the Na
 <sup>+</sup>-K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase transmembrane protein, which regulates the MAPK pathway, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and intracellular calcium level [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It also inhibits microtubule polymerization and specifically induces DNA damage in cancer cells. SA has also been produced by endophytic 
 <italic>F. proliferatum</italic> isolated from leaves of 
 <italic>M. cordata</italic> [
