<p>Camptothecin (CPT), a potent anticancer quinoline indole alkaloid, was first isolated from the bark of the 
 <italic>Camptotheca acuminata</italic> in 1966, but it was also produced by some other plant species, including 
 <italic>Miquelia dentata</italic>, 
 <italic>Nothapodytes nimmoniana</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ophiorrhiza</italic> [
 <xref rid="B84-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Inadequate water solubility and high toxicity are two limiting factors for the application of CPT as an anticancer agent. However, its two derivatives 10-hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT), and 9-methoxycamptothecin (MCPT) retain the same medicinal efficacy without above limitations [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. CPT and HCPT reversibly stabilize the Top1–dsDNA complex by selectively inhibiting eukaryotic topoisomerase I (TopI) activity. In virtue of this, CPT derivatives are currently being used extensively as precursor compounds for efficient broad-spectrum anticancer drugs irinotecan, topotecan, and belotecan [

 <xref rid="B85-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Recently, a chemically bespoke camptothecin–antibody drug conjugate named traztuzumabderuxtecan (Enhertu
 <sup>®</sup>) has also been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Puri et al. in 2005 and Rehman et al. in 2008 isolated the camptothecin-producing potential endophytic fungi 
 <italic>Entrophospora infrequens</italic> and 
 <italic>Neurospora</italic> sp. respectively from the inner bark of 
 <italic>Nothapodytes foetida</italic> [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Again, endophytic fungus 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> isolated from 
 <italic>C. acuminata</italic> was found to produce CPT, HCPT, and MCPT [
 <xref rid="B36-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Endophytic fungus 
 <italic>F. solani</italic> isolated from 
 <italic>Apodytes dimidiata</italic> in the Western Ghats, India also yielded camptothecin [
 <xref rid="B39-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Three fungal species, 
 <italic>Alternaria alternata</italic>, 
 <italic>Fomitopsis</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Phomopsis</italic> sp., isolated from fruits of 
 <italic>M. dentata</italic>, were found as prominent CPT producers [
 <xref rid="B41-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In another bioprospection study, 161 fungal endophytes from 
 <italic>C. acuminata</italic> were screened for CPT production in which 
 <italic>Botryosphaeria dothidea</italic> was found as a prominent producer of MCPT [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Two camptothecin-producing fungi, 
 <italic>Trichoderma atroviride</italic> and 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> sp., were also isolated from 
 <italic>C. acuminata</italic> [
 <xref rid="B42-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B85-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. CPT-producing endophytic fungi have also been isolated from 
 <italic>N. nimmoniana</italic> [
 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. We found a total of 22 CPT-producing endophytic fungal species from five different host plant species, as listed in 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-09-00197-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. These findings suggested that the endophytic fungi could be a future alternative source of not only CPT but also of its safer and more efficient analogues.
