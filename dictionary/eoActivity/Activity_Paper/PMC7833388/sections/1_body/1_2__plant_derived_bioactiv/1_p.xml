<p>A wide array of secondary metabolites in fungi is biosynthesized from very few key precursor compounds by slight variations in basic biosynthetic pathways and can be classified into nonribosomal peptides, polyketides, terpenes, and alkaloids. Nonribosomal peptides are biosynthesized by multimodular nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) enzymes using both proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acids. Polyketides are biosynthesized by polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymes from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA units. Terpenes consisting of isoprene subunits are biosynthesized from the mevalonate pathway catalyzed by terpene cyclase enzymes. Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing organic compounds biosynthesized as complex mixtures through the shikimic acid and the mevalonate pathways, as they are usually derived from aromatic amino acids and dimethlyallyl pyrophosphate [

For ease and better understanding, we have classified different fungal secondary metabolites as alkaloids, coumarins, flavonoids, lignans, saponins, terpenes, quinones, and xanthones, and miscellaneous compounds. Coumarins are a class of lactones consisting of a benzene ring fused to a Î±-pyrone ring and are mainly biosynthesized by the shikimic acid pathway from cinnamic acid. Flavonoids are synthesized by the phenylpropanoid pathway from phenylalanine using enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and flavonol reductase [
 <xref rid="B21-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Lignans are low molecular weight polyphenols biosynthesized by enzymes pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase (PLR), PAL, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), and cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) [
 <xref rid="B22-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Saponins are glycosides containing a non-sugar triterpene or steroid aglycone (sapogenin) attached to the sugar moiety. Saponins are derived from intermediates of the phytosterol pathway using enzymes oxidosqualene cyclases (OSCs), cytochromes P450 (P450s), and UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) [
 <xref rid="B23-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Quinones are biosynthesized through several pathways; for example, isoprenoid quinones are synthesized by the shikimate pathway using chorismite-derived compounds as precursors, terrequinone by NRPS from L-tryptophan, dopaquinone by tyrosinase from tyrosine, and benzoquinone by catechol oxidase/PKS from catechol [
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Xanthones comprise an important class of oxygenated heterocyclics biosynthesized through the polyacetate/polymalonate pathway by the internal cyclization of a single folded polyketide chain [
