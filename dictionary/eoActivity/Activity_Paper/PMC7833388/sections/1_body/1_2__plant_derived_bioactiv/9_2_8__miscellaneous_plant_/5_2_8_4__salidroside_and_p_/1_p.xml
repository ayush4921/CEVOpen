 <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>, a traditional medicinal herb used as stimulant and antidepressant, has great pharmaceutical value including antioxidant, antihypoxic, adaptogenic, cardiovascular, and neuroprotective properties. Its active principals are phenolics (salidroside and p-tyrosol) and glycosides (rosavins) [
 <xref rid="B400-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">400</xref>]. Salidroside and p-tyrosol inhibit the hypoxia-induced endocytosis of pulmonary Na,K-ATPase via the inhibition of the ROS– AMPK–protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) pathway, signifying the use of 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> as a popular folk medicine for high-altitude illness [
 <xref rid="B401-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">401</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying the potential neuroprotective effects of salidroside involve the regulation of oxidative stress response, inflammation, apoptosis, hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis, neurotransmission, neural regeneration, and the cholinergic system [
 <xref rid="B402-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">402</xref>]. Cui et al. isolated four endophytic fungi from different species of 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> that could produce salidroside and p-tyrosol and characterized 
 <italic>P. fortinii</italic> as the most capable and stable producer [
