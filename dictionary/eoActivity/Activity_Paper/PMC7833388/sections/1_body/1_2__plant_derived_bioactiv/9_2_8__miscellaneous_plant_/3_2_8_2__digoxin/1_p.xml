<p>The glycoside digoxin from 
 <italic>Digitalis</italic> spp. has been reported to be cardiotonic and is widely used in the treatment of various heart disorders such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and heart failure. Digoxin induces an increase in intracellular sodium followed by calcium in the heart by reversibly inhibiting the activity of the myocardial Na+-K+-ATPase pump, leading to an increased force of myocardial contraction and cardiac output. By stimulating the parasympathetic nerve, it slows electrical conduction in the AV node by increasing the refractory period of cardiac myocytes; therefore, it decreases the ventricular response and heart rate. Overall, the stroke volume is increased while the heart rate is decreased, resulting in a net increase in blood pressure [

 <italic>Digitalis lanata</italic> also showed the production of digoxin [
