<p>Isofraxidin is a coumarin compound produced in the Siberian ginseng (
 <italic>Acanthopanax senticosus</italic> or 
 <italic>Eleutherococcus senticosus</italic>) and 
 <italic>Apium graveolens</italic>. Isofraxidin mainly regulates lipid metabolism and protects from related disorders by reducing triglyceride accumulation, TNF-α release, and ROS activation, enhancing the phosphorylation of AMPKα and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC). It also reduces hepatic expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2 (HMGC), inhibiting lipogenesis. Additionally, isofraxidin shows anti-inflammatory activity by significantly depleting infiltrating inflammatory cells (F4/80+ Kupffer cells, and CD68+ macrophages) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) in liver cells. Moreover, the anti-inflammatory activity of isofraxidin is correlated with the down-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-κB expression [

Isofraxidin bioactivity as a potent hyperpigmentation agent is exerted by increased melanin synthesis via stimulated tyrosinase activity, increased expression of tyrosinase, and melanogenesis regulator microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) in melanocytes [

The cytotoxic effects of isofraxidin on cancer cells is exerted via inhibition of AKT kinase and increase in caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax/Bcl-2 levels. Isofraxidin has also shown anti-hypertension effects via inhibiting the activity of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). Isofraxidin protects axons and dendrites against amyloid β (Aβ 25–35) and inhibits neuron-degenerating enzyme monoamine oxidase B [
