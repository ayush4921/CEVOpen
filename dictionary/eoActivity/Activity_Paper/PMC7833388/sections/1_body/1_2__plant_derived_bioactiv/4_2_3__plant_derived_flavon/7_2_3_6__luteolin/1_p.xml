<p>Luteolin is a plant metabolite with reputed antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antidiabetic properties. Its anticancer property is manifested via cell cycle arrest in S phase, modulation in ROS levels, inhibition of topoisomerases type I and II, reduction of NF-kB and AP-1 activity, stabilization of p53, and inhibition of PI3K, STAT3, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and HER2 [
