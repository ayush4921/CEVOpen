<p>Silymarin, a bioactive natural compound found in fruits of milk thistle (
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic>), has cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, antihepatitic, and antimetastatic activities [
 <xref rid="B170-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>]. The hepatoprotective property of silymarin is accomplished via an increase in glutathione level, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, activation of antioxidant defense, and translational activities in hepatic cells [
 <xref rid="B171-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. Its anticancer activity is related to the modulation of NF-kB, suppression of EGFR-MAPK/ERK1/2 and IGF1R signaling, up-regulation of tumor-suppressor genes p53 and p21
 <sup>CIP1</sup>. Similarly, its antiangiogenic activity is linked to suppression of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and MMP-2 [
