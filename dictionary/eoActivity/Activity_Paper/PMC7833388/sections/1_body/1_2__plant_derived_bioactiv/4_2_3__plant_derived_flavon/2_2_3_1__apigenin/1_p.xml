<p>Apigenin, amply present in 
 <italic>Matricaria</italic> spp. and vegetables, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Apigenin inhibits the proliferation of malignant cancer cells causing G
 <sub>2</sub>-M arrest by inhibition of the mitotic kinase activity of p34
 <sup>cdc2</sup> and perturbation of cyclin B1 levels [

 <xref rid="B154-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. It is also a ligand for the central benzodiazepine receptors exerting anxiolytic and sedative effects [
 <xref rid="B155-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. Apigenin activates different anti-inflammatory pathways, including p38/MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, to exert its anti-inflammatory effect. Further, it prevents the IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of the NF-κB, and reduces cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 activity. Additionally, apigenin up-regulates the expression of anti-oxidant enzymes such as glutathione (GSH)-synthase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) to counteract cellular oxidative stress. Its neuroprotective effect is exhibited by the lowering of β-amyloids and restoring the ERK/cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)/ brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway [
 <xref rid="B156-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. Apigenin also regulates hyperglycemia, thyroid dysfunction, and lipid peroxidation [

 <italic>Chaetomium globosum</italic>, isolated from 
 <italic>Cajanus cajan,</italic> produced apigenin with good antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B135-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Its glycosidic derivatives, namely apigenin-5-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→3)-β-D-glucopyranoside and euryanoside (apigenin-5-O-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)-(6″-O-acetyl)-β-Dglucopyranoside), were detected in 
 <italic>Paraconiothyrium variabile</italic>, which is an endophytic fungus in the Japanese plum yew (
 <italic>Cephalotaxus harringtonia</italic>) from which these compounds had previously been reported [
