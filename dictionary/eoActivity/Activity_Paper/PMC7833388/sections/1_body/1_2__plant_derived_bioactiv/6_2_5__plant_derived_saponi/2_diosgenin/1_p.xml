<p>The anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent diosgenin is primarily obtained from 
 <italic>Dioscorea zingiberensis</italic>. Its anti-inflammatory activity is exerted via reduction in the levels of several inflammatory mediators, including NO and IL-1 and -6, inhibition of the MAPK/AKT/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, and ROS production. Diosgenin anticancer effects have been linked to p53 activation, immune modulation, cell cycle arrest, modulation of caspase-3 activity, and activation of STAT3 signaling pathway [

 <italic>Dioscorea zingiberensis</italic>, endophytes might be suitable alternatives to produce diosgenin. Zhou et al. in 2004 first reported 
 <italic>Paecilomyces</italic> sp. residing in 
 <italic>Paris polyphylla</italic> var. 
 <italic>yunnanensis</italic> as an adiosgenin-producing endophytic fungus [
 <xref rid="B193-microorganisms-09-00197" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Later, an endophytic strain of 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> sp. from 
 <italic>Dioscorea nipponica</italic> was also been reported for enhanced production of diosgenin in its liquid cultures when supplemented with the rhizome extract of its host plant [
