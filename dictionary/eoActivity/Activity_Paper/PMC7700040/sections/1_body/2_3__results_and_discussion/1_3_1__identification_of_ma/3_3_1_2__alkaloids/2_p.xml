<p>Compounds 
 <bold>44</bold>, 
 <bold>48</bold>, 
 <bold>52,</bold> and 
 <bold>57</bold> were diterpenoid alkaloids, which were belonging to aconitum alkaloids. In tandem mass spectrum of aconitum alkaloids commonly observe the neutral losses of H
 <sub>2</sub>O (18 Da), MeOH (32 Da), CO
 <sub>2</sub> (44 Da), and PhCOOH (122 Da). Take the case of the 
 <bold>52</bold>, it gave fragment ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 574.3045, 542.2772, 510.2458, and 105.0336 in the positive mode were corresponding to [M + H]
