<p>Take compound 
 <bold>11</bold> as an example, its fragment ions at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 167.0359, 152.0128, 123.0474, and 108.0251 were identified as vanillic acid hexose. The ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 167.0359 was obtained by the loss of hexose, while the ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 123.0474 was produced by continuous loss of CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Meanwhile, the ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 152.0128 was obtained by the loss of CH
 <sub>3</sub> from the precursor ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 167.0359, while the ion at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 108.0251 was produced by continuous loss of CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Based on the above fragment ions, which was obtained in the MS
 <sup>2</sup> spectrum, the structure of compound 
 <bold>11</bold> was easily confirmed as vanillic acid hexose.
