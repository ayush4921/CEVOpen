<p>The mass spectra fragmentation patterns were widely used to provide the structural characterization of flavonoids in relation to the flavonoid aglycone and flavonoids glycoside. Moreover, the identification of the flavonoid aglycone was based on fragmentations, which related to the lost small neutral molecules and radicals (CH
 <sub>3</sub>, H
 <sub>2</sub>O, CO, and CO
 <sub>2</sub>), as well as the loss of a glucuronic acid (176 Da), hexose residue (162 Da), and apiose residue (132 Da) for flavonoids glycoside [
