<p>The DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging activity assays were mostly used to evaluate the antioxidant effect of natural antioxidants [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hence, the antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> roots ethanol crude extract was evaluated using ABTS and DPPH assays, and the results are shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The ethanol crude extract of 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> roots showed the outstanding antioxidant activity, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 255.8 ± 10.3
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for DPPH assay and 151.9 ± 6.5
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for ABTS assay; however, there were exhibited significant differences (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) comparable to those of the positive control V

 <sub>50</sub> values of 6.0 ± 0.2 and 1.2 ± 0.1
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively.
