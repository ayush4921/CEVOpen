<p>The UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was provided in our previously published article [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Chromatographic separation was conducted on a Luna Omega C18 (100 × 2.1mm, 1.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>m, Phenomenex Inc., CA, USA) keeping at 40°C. 0.1% aqueous formic acid (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>, A) and acetonitrile (B) were used as mobile phases. The gradient elution with the flow rate of 0.3 mL/min was performed as follows: 0-15 min, 25% B; 15-18 min, 25%-55% B; 18-40 min, 55%-95% B; 40-42 min, 95% B for column cleaning, and a conditioning cycle time of 3 min with the same initial conditions of 5% B. The sample inject volume was 3
