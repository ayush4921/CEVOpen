<p>The anti-inflammatory effect of the sample against COX-2 inhibition was determined using colorimetric COX-2 inhibitor screening assay kit (no. S0168) and using celecoxib as the positive drug [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Briefly, 75 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of assay buffer, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of cofactor working solution, and 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of working solution were mixed with 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the sample at different concentrations and then incubated at 37°C. After 10 min, 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of probe and 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of substrate were added in all wells and then incubated at 37°C for 5 min, and the absorbance was determined (A
 <sub>sample</sub>). The absorbance of a blank (A
 <sub>blank</sub>) and control (A
 <sub>control</sub>) composed of only the sample and COX-2 enzyme solutions was also determined, respectively. The COX − 2inhibitoryactivity(%) = [(A
 <sub>control</sub>–A
 <sub>sample</sub>)/(A
 <sub>control</sub>–A
 <sub>blank</sub>)] × 100%.
