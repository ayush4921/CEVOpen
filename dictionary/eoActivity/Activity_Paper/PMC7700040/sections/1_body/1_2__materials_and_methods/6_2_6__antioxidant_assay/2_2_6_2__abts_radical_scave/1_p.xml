<p>The ABTS radical scavenging activity of the sample was carried out using the method reported by Sun et al. with minor modification [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Briefly, 1.76 mL of K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub> (140 mM) and 100 mL of ABTS solution (7 mM) were mixed and stored in the dark at 25°C for 12 h. Then, the ABTS stock solution was diluted with PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) until an absorbance value of 0.70 ± 0.02 was reached at 734 nm to obtain the diluted ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical solution. Subsequently, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the sample was mixed with 195 
 <italic>μ</italic>L the diluted ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical solution and incubated in the dark at 25°C for 106 min, and the absorbance of the sample at 734 nm (A
 <sub>sample</sub>) was measured. The absorbance of a blank (A
 <sub>blank</sub>) and negative control (A
 <sub>control</sub>) composed of only the sample and diluted ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> radical solutions was also determined, respectively. The ABTS radical scavenging activity of the sample was calculated by the following equation: ABTSscavengingactivity = [1 − (A
 <sub>sample</sub>–A
 <sub>blank</sub>)/A
 <sub>control</sub>] × 100%. Vc was used as a positive control in this experiment.
