<p>To summarize our findings, this study revealed that the root of 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> was rich in phenylpropanoids, alkaloids, and flavonoids by UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and showed significant anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. This is the first study to describe the phytochemical profiling and COX-2 inhibitory activity of this plant [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This study can provide important chemical information for the application of 
 <italic>D. dentiger</italic> as a new source of natural COX-2 inhibitors and antioxidants in heath food and pharmaceutical industry.
