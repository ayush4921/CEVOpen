  <italic>Dendropanax dentiger</italic> root is a traditional medicinal plant in China and used to treat inflammatory diseases for centuries, but its phytochemical profiling and biological functions are still unknown. Thus, a rapid, efficient, and precise method based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was applied to rapidly analyse the phytochemical profiling of 
  <italic>D. dentiger</italic> with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>. As a result, a total of 78 chemical compositions, including 15 phenylpropanoids, 15 alkaloids, 14 flavonoids, 14 fatty acids, 7 phenols, 4 steroids, 4 cyclic peptides, 3 terpenoids, and 2 others, were identified or tentatively characterized in the roots of 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>dentiger</italic>. Moreover, alkaloid and cyclic peptide were reported from 
  <italic>D</italic>. 
  <italic>dentiger</italic> for the first time. In addition, the ethanol crude extract of D. dentiger roots exhibited remarkable anti-inflammatory activity against cyclooxygenase- (COX-) 2 inhibitory and antioxidant activities 
  <italic>in vitro</italic>. This study is the first to explore the phytochemical analysis and COX-2 inhibitory activity of 
  <italic>D. dentiger</italic>. This study can provide important phytochemical profiles and biological functions for the application of 
  <italic>D. dentiger</italic> roots as a new source of natural COX-2 inhibitors and antioxidants in pharmaceutical industry.
