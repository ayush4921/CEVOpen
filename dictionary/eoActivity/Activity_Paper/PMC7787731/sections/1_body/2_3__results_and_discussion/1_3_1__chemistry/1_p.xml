<p>Starting with 6-methoxy-1-tetralone 
 <bold>1</bold>, its hydrazine derivative 
 <bold>2</bold>, was prepared as previously reported method [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], reaction of the hydrazine derivative 
 <bold>2</bold> with different aryl isothiocyanates, namely, p-bromophanyl, p-flourophanyl, p-phenoxybenzene, and ethyl isothiocyanates produced the desired thiosemicarbazides 
 <bold>3a-d</bold> in 85-94% yield. Thiosemicarbazides 
 <bold>3a-d</bold> was separately refluxed with ethylchloroacetate in ethanol to give the thiazolidinone derivatives 
 <bold>4a-d</bold> in 76-94% yields. Pyrano thiazole-carbonitrile derivatives 
 <bold>5a-f</bold> were prepared in 55-81% yields, by heating a mixture of compound 
 <bold>4a</bold> or 
 <bold>4c</bold>, different aryl aldehydes namely, p-methoxy benzaldehyde, p-nitrobenzaldehyde, and/or 2-furaldehyde at 50Â°C and malononitrile utilizing distilled water as a solvent and in the presence of catalytic amount of potassium hydrogen phthalate (
