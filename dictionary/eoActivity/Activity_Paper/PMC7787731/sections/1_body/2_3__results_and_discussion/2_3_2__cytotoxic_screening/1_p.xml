<p>Eleven compounds were investigated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for their activities against breast cancer cell line MCF-7 using MTT assay. The effect of different concentrations of the newly synthesized compounds was evaluated by determining the percentages of viable cells after being exposed to the applied concentrations, compared to Staurosporin as a reference drug. In this screening, all the tested compounds showed potential cytotoxic activities against MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, it can be seen that the compounds affected cell viability in different patterns. This can be attributed to the differences of cellular response to each compound, depending on the nature of its terminal and functional groups [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Results demonstrated that five of the tested compounds 
 <bold>5a</bold>, 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>, and 
 <bold>3d</bold> showed potential cytotoxic activities against breast cancer cell line MCF-7, recording IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.93 ± 0.02, 1.76 ± 0.04, 2.36 ± 0.06, 2.83 ± 0.07, and 3.73 ± 0.09 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, it can be seen that these potential compounds had cytotoxic activities higher than the tested positive control (Saturosporin, IC
 <sub>50</sub>6.08 ± 0.15 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). Comparing these results with those obtained against normal breast cell line (MCF10A) showed that the tested compounds were less toxic toward normal cells. Compound 
 <bold>5a</bold> was the most effective against MCF-7 cells and was less toxic than Saturosporin by about 18.45-folds towards MCF01A normal cells. The acquired data revealed that coupling the pyrano ring in this fused heterocyclic ring system was critically influenced the cytotoxic activity. All the tested pyrane containing compounds (
 <bold>5a</bold>, 
 <bold>5d</bold>, and 
 <bold>5e</bold>) were the most effective cytotoxic agents and were more potent than Staurosporin (IC
 <sub>50</sub>; 0.93, 1.76, and 2.36 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively, IC
 <sub>50</sub> Staurosporin; 6.08 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). The size of N-substitution in thiourea-imino-linked to hydronaphthaline core directly affected the cytotoxic activity. Accordingly, the N-ethyl thiourea derivative 
 <bold>3d</bold> had a very good cytotoxicity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>; 3.73 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). On the other hand, the N-4-bromophenyl substitution of thiourea in analog 
 <bold>3a</bold> resulted in more than 3 times decrease in cytotoxicity. Also, a closer antiproliferative potency was exhibited in compound 
 <bold>10</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>; 2.83 
 <italic>μ</italic>M), in which our core was imino-linked to 5-thioxo-2,3,4,5-tetrahydrothiazole [4,5-b]pyridine-6-carbonitrile ring system. While, the methylation of C-5 and acetylation of C-6 of the dihydrothiazolo [4,5-b] pyridinyl ring system in compound 
 <bold>8</bold> yielded a significantly weaker cytotoxic activity than compound 
 <bold>10</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>; 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). This highlighted the importance of 5-thioxo and 6-carbonitrile functionality for MCF7 antiproliferative activity in this fused heterocyclic ring system.
