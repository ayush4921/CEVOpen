<p>In the course of our research work, some new dihydronaphthalene derivatives were synthesized starting with 6-methoxy-1-tetralone 
 <bold>1</bold>. Cytotoxic evaluation of eleven compounds was estimated against MCF-7 human cancer cells (breast cancer) utilizing Staurosporin as a reference drug. Results declared that compounds 
 <bold>5a</bold>, 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5e</bold>, 
 <bold>10,</bold> and 
 <bold>3d</bold> appeared to be the most active products of IC
 <sub>50</sub> values; 0.93 ± 0.02, 1.76 ± 0.04, 2.36 ± 0.06, 2.83 ± 0.07, and 3.73 ± 0.09 
 <italic>μ</italic>M, respectively, which were more potent than the reference used (Saturosporin, IC
 <sub>50</sub>6.08 ± 0.15 
 <italic>μ</italic>M). These active products possessed selectivity and showed lower toxicity than the reference drug. Compound 
 <bold>5a</bold> was the most effective against MCF-7 cells and was less toxic than Saturosporin by about 18.45-folds towards MCF01A normal cells. At the same time, the tested products possessed selectivity and showed lower toxicity than the standard drug used when examined towards the breast normal cells.
