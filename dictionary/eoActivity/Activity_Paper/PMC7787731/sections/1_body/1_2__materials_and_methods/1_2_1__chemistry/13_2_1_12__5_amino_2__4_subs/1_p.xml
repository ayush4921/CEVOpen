 <bold>4c</bold> (0.001 mol), aryl aldehyde, namely, 4-methoxy benzaldehyde, 4-nitrobenzaldehyde and 2-furaldehyde (0.001 mole), and malononitrile (0.001 mole), potassium hydrogen phthalate (KHP) (25 mol %) in distilled water (5 mL), was added. The mixture was heated at 50°C, after completion of the reaction and cooling, and the solid product was collected by filtration, washed with distilled water, dried, and recrystallized from dilute ethanol to give compounds (
 <bold>5a-f</bold>), respectively.
