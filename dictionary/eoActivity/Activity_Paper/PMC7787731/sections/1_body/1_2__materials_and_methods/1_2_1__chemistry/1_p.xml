<p>Melting points were uncorrected and were taken in open capillary tubes using Electrothermal apparatus 9100. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu FT-IR Affinity-1 Spectrometer, Infrared spectrometer at cm
 <sup>−1</sup> scale using KBr disc technique at Faculty of Pharmacy-Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were determined by using a Bruker High-Performance Digital FT-NMR Spectrometer Avance III 400 MHz, Faculty of Pharmacy-Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. Chemical shifts were expressed in 
 <italic>δ</italic> (ppm) downfield from TMS as an internal standard. The mass spectra were recorded on a GCMC-QP 1000 EX Shimadzu gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS; Shimadzu Corp. Kyoto, Japan) at electron ionization (EI) of 70 eV. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were conducted at the Micro Analytical Center of the Faculty of Science of Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. All reagents were commercial grade and used without further purification. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on precoated (0.75 mm) silica gel GF254 plates (Merck Group, Darmstadt, Germany). Products were visualized under ultraviolet (UV) light.
