 <italic>In vitro</italic> cytotoxic activity of the prepared compounds against breast (MCF-7) cancer cells was assessed using MTT assay [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The assay depends on the mitochondrial reduction of the colorless 3-(4,5-methyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) within viable cells into a dark blue formazan product. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS at a final concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL in 96-well plates and incubated in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C. Twelve hours later, different concentrations (0.39-100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) of the tested compound (2 
 <italic>μ</italic>L) were added to the cells (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) in 96-well plates and cultured at 37°C for 3 days. Then, 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of MTT solution was added to the cultured cells and incubated for four hours at 37°C. The supernatant was taken away from each well, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals. After mixing with a mechanical plate mixer, a microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance of each well at a wavelength of 570 nm. Data were expressed as IC
 <sub>50</sub> (
 <italic>μ</italic>M), i.e., the concentration required to inhibit 50% of viable cell growth. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated from the linear regression of the corresponding calibration curves using the Origin® 6.1 software. Each experiment was carried out in triplicate with good reproducibility and standard errors.
