<p>HPLC analysis was performed on Shimadzu (Japan) HPLC instrument consisting of pump LC‐10AT, UV‐VIS detector 2SPD‐10AV. The analysis of silymarin samples were carried out by using C18 column. A mixture of phosphoric acid–methanol–water used as mobile phase. The elution was made in an isocratic mode at a flow‐rate 1 ml/min and the UV‐detector was used with wavelength at 288 nm. The quantitative analysis was based on silymarin standard and external standard method was used. Standard and sample were dissolved in the mobile phase for further processing (Radjabian et al.,
