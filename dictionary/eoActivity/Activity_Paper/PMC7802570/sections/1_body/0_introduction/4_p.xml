<p>Milk thistle comprises high amount of oil due to this reason silymarin extraction is impossible in one step. Oil should be removed from the seeds before extraction of silymarin as it is the by‐product of silymarin industrial production. For recovery and purification of silymarin from silybum marianum plant seeds, extraction is first and important step. Studies described many different extraction methods for the extraction of silymarin from milk thistle plant seeds (Alvarez et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Now days, Microwave‐assisted extraction (MAE) has been usually documented as a useful, simple, and effective extraction method. When extraction is done through microwave than high extraction yield obtained in less time by using less solvent at same temperature (Hoang et al.,
