<p>Antioxidant activity of milk thistle tea was assessed by measuring total phenolic, flavonoid, DPPH, and FRAP. Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31990-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref> showed that milk thistle tea comprised of total phenolics (15.08 ± 0.47–25.13 ± 1.50 mg GAE/g), total flavonoids (8.1 ± 0.24–15.19 ± 0.75 mg QE/g), DPPH (15.09 ± 0.75–22.08 ± 1.37%), and FRAP (7.02 ± 0.22–13.53 ± 0.81AAE mg/g edw). In case of location, Islamabad showed higher amount than other two cities whereas in case of variety, blue variety showed higher results than the white variety. Earlier, Gramza et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>) yielded the phenolic contents of green tea as 20.52 g/100 g. However, Soysal (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>) reported lowest 11.52% phenolic contents in green tea than the TPC contents of current results of milk thistle tea, whereas Asghar and Masood, (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) observed high TPC content in green tea than milk thistle tea. Furthermore, Mohammed et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) quantified 17.7–78.8 value of total flavonoid contents in different green tea brands, respectively. Kodama et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) indicate low flavonoid contents in green tea than milk thistle tea. Bhagwat et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>) investigate 2.19 to 73.44 mg QE/g flavonoid contents in black tea whereas, 16.72 to 88.32 mg QE/g in different green tea brands their results revealed high flavonoid contents than milk thistle tea. Mohammed et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) revealed higher DPPH contents in green tea than milk thistle tea. Moreover, Kodama et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) finding are corroborated with the current DPPH results of milk thistle tea. Iris et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">1999</xref>) revealed higher FRAP value in green tea, black and oolong tea than milk thistle tea. Moreover, Mohammed et al., (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) finding are corroborated with the current FRAP results of milk thistle tea.
