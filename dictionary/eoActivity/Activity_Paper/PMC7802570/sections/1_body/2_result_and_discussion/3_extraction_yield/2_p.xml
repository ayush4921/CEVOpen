<p>The extract yield of milk thistle seeds by soxhlet extraction ranged from 3.10 ± 0.15–6.69 ± 0.33%. In case of variety, the highest (6.69%) yield was found in 
 <bold>Blue</bold> while the lowest (3.10) was found in 
 <bold>White</bold>. Meanwhile, maximum (6.69%) was found in Islamabad and minimum (3.10%) was found in Jhang in case of location. Whereas it is clearly depicted from the results (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31990-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) that extract yield of milk thistle seeds in microwave‐assisted extraction varied from 9.99 ± 0.49 to 6.67 ± 0.34%. The silymarin yield of milk thistle in the present research is in close conformity with the work of Jahan et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) who examined silymarin yield 6.7% in Soxhlet and 9.2%–11.2% in MAE. However, Wianowska and Wisniewski (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) reported 8.14% yield by soxhlet extraction in comparison with the current results whereas, Subramaniam et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31990-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>) observed silymarin yield 18.28 mg/g by MAE.
