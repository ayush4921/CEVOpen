<p id="Par19">Genistein possesses many therapeutic uses against numerous disorders including osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, a variety of tumors, diabetes, inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic syndromes. Genistein was successfully used as an immune-suppressive agent both in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] due to its ability to inhibit the infectivity of enveloped or non-enveloped viruses, as well as single or double-stranded RNA or DNA viruses by different mechanisms. Genistein has been shown to reduce the infectivity of a variety of viruses affecting humans and animals, including adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and rotavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. An ethyl acetate extract from Chongkukjang, a traditional Korean fermented product prepared from soybeans, was shown as an effective therapeutic agent to treat influenza A virus infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. Genistein may be also a useful candidate for developing a new anti-rotavirus (RV) by inhibiting rotavirus replication and upregulating aquaporin 4 (AQP4) expression via the cAMP/PKA/CREB signaling pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. A study has reported that an increasing consumption of genistein or a diet with moderate to high amounts of soy genistein is associated with a better lung function in patients with asthma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. The African swine fever virus (ASFV) was inhibited in vitro by genistein through disrupting the viral DNA replication, blocking the transcription of late viral genes as well as the synthesis of late viral proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that pre-treatment of host cells with the kinase inhibitors (genistein and tyrphostin) leads to an inhibition of infection or transduction in cells infected with Ebola virus, Marburg virus, and Lassa virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Therefore, the strong influence of genistein as an antiviral agent against different kinds of virus infections may promote its use as a potential candidate for defeating COVID-19 and related symptoms.
