 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. It was reported that, gallic acid has several antiviral activities such as anti‐enterovirus 71 (EV71), anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 and anti‐human immunodeficiency virus activity and anti-hepatitis C (HCV) [

Moreover, gallic acid along with other related phenolic acids (caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid) was found to exert sustainable anti-viral activity against human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), one of the main circulating coronaviruses worldwide that causes respiratory tract diseases like runny nose, cough, bronchiolitis and pneumonia [
