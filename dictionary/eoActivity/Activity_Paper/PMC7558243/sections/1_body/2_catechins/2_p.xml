<p id="Par6">Catechins present in many dietary products, medicinal plants, and fruits including apples, blueberries, gooseberries, grape seeds, kiwi, strawberries, green tea, red wine, beer, cacao liquor, chocolate, cocoa. Catechins particularly, those found in green tea (mainly EGCG and EGC) have many favorable properties for human health and were confirmed in vivo and in vitro as an anticancer, anti-obesity, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, anti-cardiovascular, anti-infectious, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In fact, catchins exert a strong anti-inflammatory property due to their ability to activate/deactivate inflammation-related oxidative stress-related cell signaling pathways, such as NF-ÎºB, MAPKs, transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), signal transducer and the activator of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3). This ability of catchins to interact with those pathways might contribute to their role in inhibiting the infiltration and proliferation of immune-related cells and regulate inflammation and oxidative reactions by lowering of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory-related enzymes, like iNOS and COX-2, augmenting the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, and suppress many oxidative stress-related pathways responsible for the inflammation processes [
