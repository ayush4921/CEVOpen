<p id="Par25">In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that caffeic acid and its derivatives such as caffeic acid phenethyl ester have numerous physiological activities including antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherosclerotic, immunostimulatory, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, antiproliferative, hepatoprotective, anticancer, and anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity [

 <italic>Sambucus Formosana Nakai</italic> ethanol extract significantly repressed the replication of human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) that causes upper respiratory tract illnesses, in a cell-type independent manner, and blocked virus attachment. The study proposed that caffeic acid could be the vital component with anti-HCoV-NL63 activity [

In vitro caffeic acid demonstrated an antiviral activity by acting on severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, which causes tick-borne hemorrhagic fever in East Asia, and hinders viral infection and spread by inhibiting the binding of SFTSV to the cells [

Moreover, a study has reported antiviral activity of caffeic acid towards herpes simplex (HSV), VSV-Ebola pseudotyped and vaccinia viruses and that antiviral activity increased and occurred early in the virus replication cycle with the addition of chelated inorganic ions or a metal such as iron to caffeic acid [
