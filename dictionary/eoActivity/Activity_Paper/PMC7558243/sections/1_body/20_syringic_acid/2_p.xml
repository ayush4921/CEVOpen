A study has reported in asthma mice model that the effect of syringic acid is prominent in the treatment of asthma by controlling the accumulation of inflammatory cells, other inflammatory markers such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and TNF-Î± along with enhancement of antioxidant markers, suppression of ROS and controlling airway hyper-reactivity. Therefore, syringic acid may be recommended for clinical trials in the treatment of asthma [
