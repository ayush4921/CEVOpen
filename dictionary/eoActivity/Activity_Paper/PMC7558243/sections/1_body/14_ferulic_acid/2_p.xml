<p id="Par31">Ferulic acid is rapidly absorbed into the body and stays in the blood stream longer than any other antioxidant, even longer than vitamin C. Because of these features, ferulic acid is considered to be a superior antioxidant and therefore it is widely used in health foods and nutrition [

In addition, ferulic acid possesses many physiological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer, antiarrhythmic, antithrombotic, antidiabetic, lipid peroxidation prevention, free radical scavenger; increase NO synthesis and immunostimulant properties [

Sodium ferulate, the sodium salt of ferulic acid, in a combination with oxymatrine had a protective effect on LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice principally by inhibiting the production of CRP and TNF-α, which inhibited the myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung homogenate and attenuated inflammatory cell numbers and protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Similarly, sodium ferulate protects against influenza virus infection through activation of the TLR7/9-MyD88-IRF7 pathway, which recognizes viral nucleic acids and activates different cascades that contribute to the production of interferons (IFNs) and also by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway, which resulted in blocking the influenza virus replication [

Moreover, a ferulic acid derivative had the best inhibition activity against the neuraminidase (NA) influenza virus (H1N1), in vitro, due to the interactions with conserved and essential residues of NA, which is comparable to those of oseltamivir and zanamivir, two available commercial NA inhibitors [
