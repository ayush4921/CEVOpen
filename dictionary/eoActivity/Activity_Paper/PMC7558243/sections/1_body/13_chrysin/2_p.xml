<p id="Par29">Chrysin exhibits many biological activities and pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, pro-apoptotic, antiangiogenic, antimetastatic, immunomodulatory, antiasthmatic, antibacterial and antiviral activities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. Actually, chrysin exerts its activities against various diseases by different mechanisms including the suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NF-κB, inhibition of histone deacetylase and DNA topoisomerases, inhibition pro-inflammatory cytokine expressions such as TNF-α and IL-1β through blocking histamine release and also decreasing matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Chrysin could also prevent airway inflammation by inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-8, and myeloperoxidase (MOP) expression via restraining ERK and P38 pathway [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Chrysin has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and also has been shown to inhibit the enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) replication [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that chrysin inhibited the interaction between SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>]. Consequently, this huge capacity of chrysin in protecting against several diseases especially virus infections may give it a vital role in the fight against COVID-19 principally, via its ability to interact with the virus receptor.
