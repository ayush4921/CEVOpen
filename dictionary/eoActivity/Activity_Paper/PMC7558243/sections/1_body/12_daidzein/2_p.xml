<p id="Par27">Daidzein is classified as a phytoestrogen because it has oestrogen-like properties; with its partner genistein, daidzein compromises 90% of the intake of oestrogenic isofalvones from the diet [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>]. Soy isoflavones consumption such as genistein, daidzein, and glycitein has been associated with a reduced prevalence of chronic health disorders and regulation of the immune response, which give them an important potential role in clinical applications in immune-dysfunction [

Daidzein markedly attenuated TNF-α-induced lung inflammation and lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury through blocking of NF-κB pathway via different interaction mechanisms, which inhibited several pro-inflammatory markers such as Cxcl2 in lung tissues [

Furthermore, during influenza infection, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides are generated in several tissues such as the lung, and daidzein was reported to exert an antiviral activity through its antioxidant capacity to decease ROS and lipid peroxide generations. Consequently, daidzein regulates influenza virus replication via signal transduction through 5-lipoxygenase products induced by daidzein [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. Due to their role in the regulation of immune responses and antioxidant activity, daidzein could be applied to enhance body immunity against emergence diseases such as COVID-19 and related immunity dysfunctions.
