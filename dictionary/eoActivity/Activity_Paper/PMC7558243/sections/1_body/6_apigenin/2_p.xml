<p id="Par15">Apigenin encompasses a number of biological functions, for instance strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial and antiviral activities and blood pressure reduction agent. Several in vivo and in vitro studies and clinical trials suggested that apigenin is a potent therapeutic agent to overcome diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disorders, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and a various type of cancers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. In fact, apigenin stimulates different anti-inflammatory pathways, including p38/MAPK and PI3K/Akt, prevents the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB, reduces COX-2 activity and strongly decreases levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ levels [

Furthermore, apigenin has shown several antiviral activities against different viruses such as adenoviruses (ADV) and hepatitis B virus in vitro, African swine fever virus (ASFV), by suppressing the viral protein synthesis and reducing the ASFV yield by 3 log, inhibition of viral protein synthesis through suppressing viral IRES activity of picornaviruses and disrupting viral RNA of enterovirus-71 (EV71) [

An anti-inflammatory effect of apigenin-7-glycoside in LPS-stimulated acute lung injury via downregulation of oxidative enzyme expression and protein activation through inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation and NF-κB pathways was also reported which may be a promising therapeutic candidate for various lung inflammatory disorders, such as lung disease and obstructive pulmonary [
