<p id="Par9">Rutin, like other polyphenolic compounds is found in several fruits and vegetables such as apple peels, black tea, asparagus, buckwheat, onions, green tea, figs, and most citrus fruit like grapefruit, lemon, lime, apple, berries (mulberry), ash tree fruits, and cranberries. Rutin was also found in several African medical plants such as 
 <italic>Araliaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Moringaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Leguminosae</italic>, 
 <italic>Guttiferae</italic>, 
 <italic>Euphorbiaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Convolvulaceae</italic> [

Rutin has demonstrated a number of beneficial activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, vasoprotective, anticarcinogenic, neuroprotective, cardioprotective, antiasthmatic, antimycobacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In fact, rutin exerts its main activities from its ability to inhibit the nuclear factor NFκB, ERK1/2 up-regulation of Nrf which leads to reduced pro-inflammatory agents such as IL-6, TNF-α, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin [

Sodium rutin sulfate, a sulfated rutin modified from the natural flavonol glycoside rutin was revealed in vitro to possess an antiretroviral effect against HIV-1 X 4 viruses IIIB, HIV-1 R5 isolates Ada-M and Ba-L strains by blocking viral entry and virus-cell fusion through interacting with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein [

 <italic>Capparissinaica Veill</italic>, which consists mainly of rutin, was tested for its in vitro antiviral activity against avian influenza strain H5N1 using plaque inhibition assay in Madin-Darby canine kidney. The test showed a significant inhibition of the virus by about 73% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Moreover, rutin, isolated from 
 <italic>Prunus domestica</italic> was suggested as a strong inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry; rutin inhibits the early entry stage of HCV lifecycle by directly acting on the viral particle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Based on the above summarized effects of rutin, this flavonoid appears to be a potent component that could be considered in the treatment of several viral infectious diseases.
