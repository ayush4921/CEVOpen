<p id="Par35">Vanillic acid is a well-known generally regarded as a safe flavoring agent with beneficial biological activities such as anti-oxidant, anti-lipid peroxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, neuroprotective/cognitive and regulation of insulin secretion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. Several studies have reported the efficiency of vanillic acid in controlling the immune response or the inflammatory ones. Vanillic acid improved the activity of human lymphocyte proliferation and secretion of interferon-gamma (INFγ) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additional study indicated that vanillic acid has a hepatoprotective effect through its suppressive action on immune-mediated liver inflammation in concanavalin A-induced liver injury [

Vanillic acid was found to inhibit inflammatory state in mice by suppressing neutrophil recruitment and its mechanisms of action involves antioxidant effects and NFκB-related inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production such as IL6, COX2, IL-1β and TNF-α [
