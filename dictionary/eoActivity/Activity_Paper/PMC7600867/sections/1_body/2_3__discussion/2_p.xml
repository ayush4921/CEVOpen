<p>The FT-NIR pattern confirmed that there were no differences between the CS and SS samples and that the starch and crude fat content in CS- and SS-derived plants was almost the same. This confirmed CS stability and meant that CS material could potentially be used in herbal medicines. If the CS material is to be developed further, then it is essential to determine the gene distribution, expression, and genotype differences between the CS and SS samples to confirm that the CS-derived plants are stable as a food or medicine. The FT-NIR experimental results suggested that there were no significant differences between the two types. However, more accurate analyses that include additional statistical tests based on the FT-NIR patterns should be undertaken. The LC-MS results showed that the TSG concentration (the 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> index material) was more than 3% higher in the CS samples than in the SS samples, which confirmed that CS-derived plants showed other improvements over SS-derived plants apart from biomass. An analysis of emodin-8-

 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside, physcion-8-

 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside, emodin, and physcion compounds will also be conducted after this study. In addition, the stability evaluation of TSG for use as a drug should be further improved based on the study results [
