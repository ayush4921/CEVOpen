<p>The TSG was analyzed using LC-MS (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). A calibration curve and a linear regression equation were generated for the external TSG standard. The standard TSG stock solution was prepared in MeOH at 1.0 mg/mL, and work solutions were mixtures of the stock solution after series dilutions with methanol to obtain five concentration levels. The work solutions were filtered through a 0.45 mm hydrophobic PTFE filter prior to LC-MS injection. The linearity was plotted after undertaking a linear regression analysis of the integrated peak areas (Y) vs the concentration of each standard (X, µg/mL) at the five different concentrations. Each 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> crude MeOH extract (1.0 mg) was dissolved in MeOH (1.0 mL), which generated the sample stock solution. This was further diluted with MeOH to provide a 100 µg/mL solution. The solution was filtered through a 0.45 mm hydrophobic PTFE filter and finally subjected to LC-MS analysis with a Kinetex C
 <sub>18</sub> column (2.1 × 100 mm, 5 µm; Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) set at 25 °C. The mobile phase consisted of formic acid in water [0.1% (

 <italic>v</italic>)] (A) and methanol (B) and was delivered at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min, and the following programmed gradient elution was applied: 10–100% (B) for 30 min, 100% (B) for 1 min, 100% (B) isocratic for 10 min, and 10% (B) isocratic for 10 min to perform post-run reconditioning of the column. The injection volume was 10 µL. The quantification of TSG was based on the peak area under the line obtained after MS detection in selected ion monitoring mode and calculated as equivalents of the standard. The content was expressed as µg per 1 mg of extract weight. The sensitivity was assessed by determining the LOD and LOQ, which were determined by the signal-to-noise (S/N) method. The S/N ratios were 3 and 10 for LOD and LOQ, respectively.
