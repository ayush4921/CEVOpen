<p>The fresh weight of the harvested roots tubers were obtained and their lengths measured using a ruler. The tubers were then dried in an oven at 150 Â°C for 3 days. The exact root surface area was measured using WinRHIZO (Regent Instruments, Quebec, QC, Canada) and three parameters of projected area (PA), surface area (SA), and volume (Vol) were determined. The roots were spread on a root-positioning tray and scanned using a flatbed scanner (GT-20000, EPSON, Nagano, Japan). The acquired images were analyzed using WinRHIZO Pro software, v.2005a (Regent Instruments, Quebec, QC, Canada). Finally, the overall fresh and dry weights of all underground parts were measured and compared.</p>
