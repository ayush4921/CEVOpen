 <italic>P. multiflorum,</italic> which is a vital herbal medicine resource plant in the field. The experiments were conducted at the National Forest Medicinal Resources Research Institute located in Punggi-eup, Yeongju, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea. Two types of seedlings, namely, SS and CS, were grown under suitable conditions for field transplantation. They were then transplanted into soil and grown for forty (40) weeks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01280-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B). The annual average temperature and humidity of the planting season were not different from those of the previous year and there were no natural disasters, such as cold or wet weather. The transplanted soil area was divided into three 6 × 6 m plots, and the two types of seedlings were randomly transplanted at 15 × 15 cm intervals from left to right in each area. A total of 40 transplanted plants of each type were planted in one plot. The transplanted seedlings were watered on the first day after transplantation to enable them to adapt to the soil. However, no further water, fertilizer, or pesticides were applied.
