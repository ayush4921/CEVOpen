<p>Extract samples (10 g each from CSs and SSs) were prepared for LC-MS analysis. Each sample was ground and extracted with 70% MeOH/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (250 mL) twice over 90 min using an ultrasonic cleaning bath (Model 8510E—DTH, Branson, USA). The resultant solution was then filtered using Whatman filter No. 1 (Whatman, Maidstone, U.K.) and concentrated under vacuum reduced pressure at 40 °C and 55 rpm using an EYELA N-1200B rotary evaporator (Tokyo Rikakikai Co. Ltd., Japan) to obtain the MeOH extract (1.2 g), which was then used in the LC-MS analysis. The same extraction procedure was conducted in triplicate.
