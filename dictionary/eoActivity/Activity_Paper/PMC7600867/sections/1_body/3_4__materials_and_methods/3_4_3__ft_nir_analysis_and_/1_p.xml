<p>FT-NIR spectra were recorded on a TANGO FT-NIR spectrometer (BRUKER Corporation, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) equipped with an NIR fiber optic probe (type 847-072200), interferometer, InGaAs detector and broadband light source (50 W), and a quartz halogen lamp that provides interaction measurements. A sample of 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> was placed in a holder with the stem-axillary axis horizontal. The interaction spectrum for each sample was measured using three opposite equatorial positions and the average spectrum for each sample was analyzed. The source and detector fibers were randomly placed on top of the branch cable. Light was directed to the sample using a source fiber, separated from the sample by a detector fiber and directed to a TANGO FT-NIR spectrometer with a spectral range of 800–2500 nm. The mirror speed was 0.9494 cm/s and the resolution was 16/cm. Place the branched optical probe at an angle of 75° to the level to avoid surface reflection and guaranteed subsurface penetration of light into 
 <italic>P multiflorum</italic> samples.
