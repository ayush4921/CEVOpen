<p>When the CS plants, developed using plant tissue cultivation under optimized conditions, were grown in the field, the results showed that the medicinally active area of the underground parts was larger than that of the SS plants and that the CS-derived plants produced more active material than the SS-derived plants. The findings showed that it is possible to efficiently mass produce 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> for medicinal purposes. The results also suggested that it should be possible to reduce labor requirements and production times and costs. Furthermore, we showed that the 
 <italic>P. multiflorum</italic> medicinal areas reached a state where they could be harvested more rapidly using tissue culturing than was possible using conventional growing methods.
