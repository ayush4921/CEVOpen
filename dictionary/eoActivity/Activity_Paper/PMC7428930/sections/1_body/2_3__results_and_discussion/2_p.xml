<p>After the processing steps, such as peaks alignment, normalization, and binning, of the NMR spectral data, we excluded the solvent signals at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.45∼3.51 ppm of the residual MeOH, 
 <italic>δ</italic> 4.05∼4.10 and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 9.16∼9.25 ppm of methyl 3,5-dinitrobenzoate, and 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.24∼7.28 ppm of the residual non-deuterated chloroform which hindered the interpretation of minor peaks in samples. Firstly, the data matrix was subjected to the unsupervised multivariate analysis (MVA) and the explorative principal components analysis (PCA) to investigate the general trend of clustering between three species, but the samples labelled with species were not clearly clustered by major principal component (PC) 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Though 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>bungeanum</italic> samples were roughly separated from two species along PC2, the scores for 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>piperitum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>schinifolium</italic> were nearly identical. 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>piperitum</italic> samples were clustered closer together than the other two species, and their qualities were more consistent than others. In the loading plot, 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.82 and 3.85 ppm (PC1 &gt; 0.15 and PC2 &gt; 0.11), 4.11 (PC1 &gt; 0.06 and PC2 &lt; -0.03), and 5.34 ppm (PC1 &lt; −0.06 and PC2 &gt; 0.11) were contributed as the significant variables. The supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) (R2X = 0.54; R2Y = 0.71; 
 <italic>Q</italic>2 = 0.61) improved the separation between species (

 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>piperitum</italic> samples were more compact than 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>bungeanum</italic> and 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>schinifolium</italic>, along the three major predictive components. The groups corresponding to 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>schinifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>piperitum</italic> samples were observed at negative values of PC1, while 
 <italic>Z</italic>. 
 <italic>bungeanum</italic> samples were found at positive ones of PC1. Next, we investigated the loading plot for identifying the metabolic markers contributing to the separation of three species in the score plot in PLS-DA. The variables for 
 <italic>δ</italic> 3.82 and 3.85 ppm (PC1 &gt; 0.1, PC2 &gt; 0.1, and PC3 &gt; 0.12) and for 
 <italic>δ</italic> 5.34 ppm (PC1 &lt; −0.05, PC2 &gt; 0.11 and PC3 &gt; 0.02) were significantly scattered in the direction of
