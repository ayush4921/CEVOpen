<p>The NMR experimental parameters were optimized to obtain clear resolution and separation of peaks (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2">Section 2</xref>). Methyl 3,5-dinitrobenzoate was added in NMR solvent as the internal standard of which the chemical shifts at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 9.2 (2H, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.13 Hz) and 9.3 (
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <italic>t</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.13 Hz) ppm were totally not overlapped with other peaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> samples, we excluded the up-fielded peaks in the range of 
 <italic>δ</italic> 0.8∼2.5 ppm which were tentatively expected as the aliphatic lipids and overwhelmed other minor peaks. Therefore, we processed the down-fielded peaks in the ranges of above 3.0 ppm which were normalized by the integral of two peaks at 
 <italic>δ</italic> 9.2 (2H, 
 <italic>d</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.13 Hz) and 9.3 (
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <italic>t</italic>, 
 <italic>J</italic> = 2.13 Hz) of the internal standard for the further study.
