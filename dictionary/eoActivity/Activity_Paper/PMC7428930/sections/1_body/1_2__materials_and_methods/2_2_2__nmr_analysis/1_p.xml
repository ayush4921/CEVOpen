<p>10 mg of freeze-dried samples and 1 mg of the reference standard, xanthoxylin (Corescience Inc., Seoul, Korea), were dissolved in 1 ml of CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> (euriso-top, Saint-Aubin, French) mixed with the internal standard, methyl 3,5-dinitrobenzoate (1⟶20) (Alfa Aesar, Massachustts, USA). All the NMR experiments were performed with a Bruker Avance II 600 spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a 5 mm BBO probe with 
 <italic>Z</italic> gradient in the Central Laboratory of Kangwon National University. NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K. Data acquisition and processing were performed with Bruker Topspin 3.0. 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra were acquired using the Bruker zg30 pulse program with the following settings: relaxation delay (d1), 1 s; flip angle, 30°; acquisition time, 1.33 s; free induction decay (FID) data points, 64 kbytes; spectral width, 20.55 ppm; and number of scans, 256. In all cases, the acquired FIDs were Fourier transformed to yield spectra with 128 kbyte data points (zero filling). Manual phase correction and baseline correction were always used. Chemical shift values were referenced to the calibration standard (TMS) signal.
