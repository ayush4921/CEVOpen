<p>In the present study, we performed the multivariate analysis (MVA) to simultaneously discriminate three 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum</italic> species which were expected to have different NMR profiles due to their own biosynthetic systems and tried to discover and quantitate the metabolic marker which was contributed to the discrimination of three species using by the qNMR approach.
