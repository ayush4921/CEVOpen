<p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a versatile technique in metabolomics and can be applied to monitor the metabolic profiles and quantify the target molecules in the biofluid matrix, as well as to elucidate the structures of small and large molecules in natural products chemistry. NMR spectroscopy yields highly accurate, precise, and reproducible spectroscopic data compared with other spectroscopic techniques, mass spectrometry [
