<p>In this review, we presented more than 170 polycyclic endoperoxides isolated from various sources and showed that all endoperoxides demonstrate antiprotozoal activity with varying degrees of reliability, and among them, the artemisinin group and some other compounds are significantly distinguished from of all endoperoxides presented and have a strong antiprotozoal activity. Our data only confirm that the artemisinin group has unique properties, which is why it has been used in medical practice for more than 50 years in the fight against malaria parasites. In addition, the artemisinin group has a high antifungal activity, while some other endoperoxides have a strictly strong anti-inflammatory activity.</p>
