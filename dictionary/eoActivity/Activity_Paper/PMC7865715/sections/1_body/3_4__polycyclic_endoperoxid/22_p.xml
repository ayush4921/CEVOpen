<p>Interesting and rare 1,2,4-trioxolanes (
 <bold>142</bold> and 
 <bold>143</bold>) were derived from natural two allobetulin derivatives; however, biological activity has not been determined [
 <xref rid="B226-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. Two 9,13-diepoxy labdane diterpenoids called amoenolide K (
 <bold>144</bold>) and its 19-acetate (
 <bold>145</bold>) were detected in the areal parts from 
 <italic>Amphiachyris amoena</italic> [
 <xref rid="B227-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>], and ent-8β,12α-epidioxy-12β-hydroxylabda-9(11),13-dien-15-oic acid γ-lactone (
 <bold>146</bold>) was obtained from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Premna oligotricha</italic> [
