<p>Some polycyclic endoperoxides, in addition to antiparasitic, antiprotozoal, and antitumor activities, demonstrate other activities with Pa &gt; 90%, which should also be mentioned in this article. This is primarily anti-inflammatory activity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00686-f015">Figure 15</xref> demonstrates such compounds as well as their predicted anti-inflammatory activity. It should also be noted that endoperoxide artemisinin (
 <bold>86</bold>) and its analogs, and some other compounds, show antifungal activity.
