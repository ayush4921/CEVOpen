<p>In this study, PASS predictions were used to estimate the general pharmacological potential for the analyzed natural polycyclic endoperoxides. For about 8000 pharmacological effects and molecular mechanisms of action, probabilities of belonging to the class of “actives” Pa, varied from zero to one, were estimated. The higher the Pa value is, the higher the probability of confirming the predicted activity in the experiment. On the other hand, estimated Pa values might be relatively small for some activities if the analyzed molecule is not like the active compounds from the PASS training set. Thus, PASS prediction interpretation requires considering two contradictory issues high probability of activity vs. high structural novelty. The researcher decides which issue is more critical, depending on the task or the project [
