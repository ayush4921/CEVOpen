 <xref rid="B255-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>], of which the development has been started more than 30 years ago [
 <xref rid="B256-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">256</xref>]. Its current implementation predicts about 8000 pharmacological effects, molecular mechanisms of action, pharmacological effects, toxicity, side effects, anti-targets, transporters-related interactions, gene expression regulation, and metabolic terms [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-26-00686" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Due to the utilization of chemical descriptors that reflect the essential features of ligand-target interactions and a robust mathematical approach for analysis of structure-activity relationships, the average accuracy of PASS predictions was 96% [
