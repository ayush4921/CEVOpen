 <p>Polycyclic endoperoxides are rare natural metabolites found and isolated in plants, fungi, and marine invertebrates. The purpose of this review is a comparative analysis of the pharmacological potential of these natural products. According to PASS (Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances) estimates, they are more likely to exhibit antiprotozoal and antitumor properties. Some of them are now widely used in clinical medicine. All polycyclic endoperoxides presented in this article demonstrate antiprotozoal activity and can be divided into three groups. The third group includes endoperoxides, which show weak antiprotozoal activity with a reliability of up to 70%, and this group includes only 1.1% of metabolites. The second group includes the largest number of endoperoxides, which are 65% and show average antiprotozoal activity with a confidence level of 70 to 90%. Lastly, the third group includes endoperoxides, which are 33.9% and show strong antiprotozoal activity with a confidence level of 90 to 99.6%. Interestingly, artemisinin and its analogs show strong antiprotozoal activity with 79 to 99.6% confidence against obligate intracellular parasites which belong to the genera Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Leishmania, and Coccidia. In addition to antiprotozoal activities, polycyclic endoperoxides show antitumor activity in the proportion: 4.6% show weak activity with a reliability of up to 70%, 65.6% show an average activity with a reliability of 70 to 90%, and 29.8% show strong activity with a reliability of 90 to 98.3%. It should also be noted that some polycyclic endoperoxides, in addition to antiprotozoal and antitumor properties, show other strong activities with a confidence level of 90 to 97%. These include antifungal activity against the genera Aspergillus, Candida, and Cryptococcus, as well as anti-inflammatory activity. This review provides insights on further utilization of polycyclic endoperoxides by medicinal chemists, pharmacologists, and the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
