  <p>The 3D graph shows the predicted and calculated pharmacological activities of artemisinin (
   <bold>86</bold>), which was found in 1979 in the extract of the Chinese herb Qinghaosu (
   <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>). According to PASS data, this endoperoxide demonstrated 16 different activities, with 5 activities having a found confidence of more than 90 percent. Antiprotozoal selective activity of artemisinin against obligate intracellular protozoan parasites belonging to the genera 
   <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (99.5%), 
   <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (93%), 
   <italic>Leishmania</italic> (92.3%), and 
   <italic>Coccidia</italic> (78%) is the main pharmacological activity. In addition, artemisinin demonstrated strong anti-schistosomal activity (91.1%) against 
   <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, a human blood fluke parasite. Additionally, artemisinin shows antifungal activity against an opportunistic pathogenic yeast 
   <italic>Candida</italic> (91.5%) and 
   <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> (85.3%), although anticancer activity is found at 80%.
