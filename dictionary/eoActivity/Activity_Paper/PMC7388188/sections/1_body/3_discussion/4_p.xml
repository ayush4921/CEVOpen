 </xref> The different bodily perceptions of the East and West may render it difficult to integrate groups of skin-active herbs. In this sense, our first achievement was to define functional terms associated with skincare. We classified SRKs not by specific disease names, but rather on a holistic basis (in terms of affected bodily parts, functions, and applications). The candidate herbs and prescriptions were thus functionally defined, enhancing our understanding of the potential benefits of these herbs. Herbal functions and characteristics can then be quantitatively compared. We believe that our novel approach will aid the development of natural ingredients.
