<p id="par0035">The permutation test was used to reveal significant associations between medicinal herbs and the SRKs. The SRK list of the compounded prescriptions was randomly permutated. The resulting tf-idf values between the herbs and the SRKs were calculated, and the process was repeated 10,000 times to obtain a null distribution of the tf-idf values. P-values were calculated based on the locations of true observations within the simulated null distribution. As the SRK tf-idf values were tested separately for each herb, we corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate. The statistical relevance of each SRK was presented as a Z-score calculated using the null distribution from the permutation test.</p>
