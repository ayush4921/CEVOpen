 </xref> We first created a co-frequency table of SRKs and compounded prescriptions. We also prepared a co-frequency table of compounded prescriptions and herbs. The co-frequency table of SRKs and herbs was the dot product of the two co-frequency tables mentioned above. The co-frequencies between herbs and compounded prescriptions were divided by log (1 + the number of herbs in each prescription). Based on the co-frequency table, a tf-idf value for each herb was calculated by assigning the Document descriptor to herbs and the Term descriptor to the SRK categories. The tf-idf value of the category for each herb was L2-normalized
