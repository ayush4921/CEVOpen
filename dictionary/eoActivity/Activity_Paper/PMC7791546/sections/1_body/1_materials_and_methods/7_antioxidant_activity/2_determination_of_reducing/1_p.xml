<p>The reducing power assay was investigated according to the modified method [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. About 1 ml of the test sample or standard at different concentrations level (31.25–500 μg/mL) was mixed with 2.5 ml of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and potassium ferricyanide (1% w/v), respectively and incubated for 20 min at 50°C to complete the reaction. The mixture was then centrifuged (at 3000 rpm for 10 min) with added 2.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid solution for put an end to the reaction. The supernatant (upper layer) solution was discarded, and 2.5 ml of distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>0 and 0.5 ml FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (1% w/v) were added, a visible Prussian blue colour indicating the endpoint of the reaction. Finally, the absorbance was taken at 700 nm by using UV-visible spectrophotometer (AE-S90, A &amp; E Lab, U.K. CO., LTD.) against blank.
