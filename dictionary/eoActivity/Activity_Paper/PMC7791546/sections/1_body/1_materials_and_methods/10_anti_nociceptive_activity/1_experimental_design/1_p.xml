<p>In 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiment, 24 animals were divided into four groups where each group consists of six animals (n=6). The standard drug diclofenac sodium (10 mg/kg, b.w, i.p.) was used for acetic acid-induced writhing test and formalin-induced paw licking test. The test groups were administrated AFMV at doses of 200 and 400 (mg/kg, b.w, p.o.), respectively, whereas the control group received vehicle (1% Tween 80 in saline water, 10 mL/kg, p.o). The standard drugs (diclofenac sodium) were administrated at 15 min and AFMV (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle at 30 min before the experiments.
