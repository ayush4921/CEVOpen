<p>The thrombolytic activity of the AFMV was evaluated and compared with positive and negative control, respectively. Available marketed thrombolytic agents demonstrate their action by blocking thrombus formation in the blood vessel, thereby plasminogen converts into plasmin, resulting in clear tracery of cross-linked fibrin. However, these agents also show severe adverse effects are major clinical drawback also linked to many limitations [

Phytochemicals from several ethnomedicinal sources likely, vegetables and fruits are reported to have anticoagulant, antiplatelet and fibrinolytic potential and hence able to mitigate instance of coronary complications and stroke. AFMV was also found to provide significant thrombolytic activity in this study. This inhibition of clot formation could be attributed to various phytochemicals in it.
