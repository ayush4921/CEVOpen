<p>The study evaluated antioxidant and anti-arthritic effects of AFMV through 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> models. The study also examined associated biological effects such as thrombolytic action and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-nociceptive activity. Based on the data, AFMV could be a potential source of antioxidant, anti-arthritic, thrombolytic and anti-nociceptive effects. These effects possibly attributed to secondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins and triterpenoids) present in the plant. However, AFMV needs to be further analysed by various techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry for the identification of its major isolates to elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for the activities.
