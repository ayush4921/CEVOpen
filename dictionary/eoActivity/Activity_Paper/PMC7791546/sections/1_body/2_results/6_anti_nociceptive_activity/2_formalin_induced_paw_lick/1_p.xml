<p>The effect of AFMV on formalin-induced nociception is presented in (
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). In the formalin-induced licking test, pain responses were evaluated individually in both early and late phases through analysing the duration of licking in animal models. The AFMV at 200 and 400 (mg/kg, p.o.) extract showed significant (
 <italic>P&lt;0.01</italic>) and dose-dependent anti-nociceptive effect in both phases (early and late) of the test (44.19 ± 1.00% and 26.45 ± 1.05%) and (30.43 ± 1.02% and 19.89 ± 1.10%) though reducing paw licking duration in a meaningful manner when compared with the vehicle group. The reference drug diclofenac sodium significantly exerted 20.43 ± 0.73 and 15.16 ± 0.87% inhibition, at the same concentrations.
