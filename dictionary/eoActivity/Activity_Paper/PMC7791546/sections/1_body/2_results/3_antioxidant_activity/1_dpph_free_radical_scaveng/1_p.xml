<p>The result of DPPH activity of AFMV extract and ascorbic acid are presented in (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, a dose-dependent radical scavenging effect was observed in the DPPH assay. Among all concentrations, AFMV showed the highest scavenging (
 <italic>P&lt;0.001</italic>) activity (76.11 ± 1.05%) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 146.61 µg/mL at the concentration of 500 µg/mL, while the ascorbic acid exhibited 84.62 ± 0.74% with IC50 30.38 µg/mL. The outcomes suggested that AFMV can decrease OS-induced free radicals.
