<p>In this study, 27 out of the 54 strains possessed at least one of the test genes. Among the 54 antagonistic strains examined, 4 (7.4 %), 21 (38.9 %), and 15 (27.8 %) were identified as positive of 
 <italic>PKS I</italic>, 
 <italic>PKS II</italic>, and 
 <italic>NRPS</italic> encoding genes, respectively, in the PCR reactions (
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). 
 <italic>PKS-II</italic> (25.9%) and 
 <italic>NRPS</italic> (24.1%) genes exhibited a high positive rate in the members of Streptomyces, while that of 
 <italic>PKS-I</italic> genes was higher in rare actinobacteria (5.6%).
