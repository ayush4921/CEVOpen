<p>Among these positive isolates, 14 strains, including T4RB005, T3RB010, T4SA004, T4SB028, T4LB048, T4LB001, T3SB005, T3RB033, T4SA006, T3RB005, T4SB004, T3RB001, and T4LB045, showed a high and broad antimicrobial spectrum. Strain T4SB030 namely 
 <italic>Streptomyces armeniacus</italic> had an inhibitory effect on the growth of all nine tested organisms. Moreover, strain T4SB028, namely 
 <italic>Streptomyces polyantibioticus</italic>, showed inhibition against all the pathogens except for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and the inhibition ratio of T4SB028 reached 67.06, 64.20, and 70.55% against 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Valsa malicola</italic>, and 
 <italic>Valsa mali</italic>, respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that the highest inhibition activity against 
 <italic>Valsa mali</italic> was shown by T4SB028 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (
