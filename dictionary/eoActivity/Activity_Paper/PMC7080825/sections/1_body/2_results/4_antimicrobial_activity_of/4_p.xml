<p>Of the 14 antagonistic strains, T3RB005 and T4LB045 displayed antagonisms against at least five indicator organisms. T3RB005 exhibited 98.48% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the 
 <italic>Saccharopolyspora taberi</italic>, while strain TLB045 displayed 97.51 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with 
 <italic>Alloactinosynnema album</italic> (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The active strains exhibited some selectivity in terms of some pathogens. Strain T4SB004 inhibited the growth of three pathogens, including 
 <italic>Valsa malicola</italic>, 
 <italic>Valsa mali</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>; in a similar way, strain T3RB001 inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp., 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>. Moreover, these two strains exhibited 100 % similarity with 
 <italic>Streptomyces enissocaesilis</italic>; however, the two strains isolated from 
 <italic>T. roseus</italic> Schipcz. in Ili and Tacheng, respectively (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). This result revealed that the strains with the same taxonomy—but that are isolated from different geographic sites—showed different antagonistic activity, which can be further exemplified by the statistical analysis between strain T4SA006 and T3RB005 as well as strain T3RB010 and T4LB001 (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). A representative picture illustrating the antagonistic activities is shown in
