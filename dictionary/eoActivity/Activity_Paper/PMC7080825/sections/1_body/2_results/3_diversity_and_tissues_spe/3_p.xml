<p>In this research, the endophytic actinomycete isolates displayed considerable diversity. The diversity parameters of each sample were different, and the values of the Shannon H indices (3.7205) and Margalf (11.26) of the species from Tacheng were higher than in the Ili site, while the Evenness (0.8460) was lower than the Ili site. All the indices clearly demonstrated that the diversity of endophytic actinomycete communities from Tacheng was more abundant than in Ili (
