<p>The isolates from both sites grouped into 24 genera with a predominance of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>Nocardiopsis</italic>, 
 <italic>Micrococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Kocuria</italic>, and others. Among these isolates, the number of these genera was four times as predominant from Tacheng than at the Ili site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Six rare genera representative 5.56 % of all genera obtained—
 <italic>Agromyces</italic>, 
 <italic>Alloactinosynnema</italic>, 
 <italic>Labedella</italic>, 
 <italic>Microbacterium</italic>, 
 <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Williamsia</italic>—were isolated only from Tacheng, while the five rare genera representative 4.76% of all genera obtained—
 <italic>Blastococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Dietzia</italic>, 
 <italic>Micromonospora</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudarthrobacter</italic>, and 
 <italic>Solirubrobacter</italic>—were isolated only from Ili site. These results indicated that there are some differences in the composition of endophytes from the same plant species in different geographical sites (
