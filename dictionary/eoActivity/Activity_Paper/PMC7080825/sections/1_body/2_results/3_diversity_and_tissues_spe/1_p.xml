<p>A total of 126 endophytic actinobacteria isolates were obtained from the 
 <italic>T. roseus</italic> S based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and 55 and 71 isolates were from Ili and Tacheng sites, respectively. The diversity of culturable endophytic actinobacteria were the highest at the Tacheng site and included one class, five orders, nine families, 19 genera, and 49 species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). While isolates from the Ili site included two classes, eight orders, 12 families, 18 genera, and 37 species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). The endophytic actinobacteria community clearly differed in composition with regard to geography.
