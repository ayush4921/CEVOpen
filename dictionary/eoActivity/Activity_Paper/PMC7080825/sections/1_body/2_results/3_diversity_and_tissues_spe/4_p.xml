 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> exhibited that the genera to which strains from each sampled area and tissues belonged as well as the quantity of endophytes from each genus. The abundance of endophytic actinobacteria isolates in root tissues (
 <italic>n</italic> = 54, 42.86%) was significantly higher than in stems (
 <italic>n</italic> = 35, 27.78%) and leaves (
 <italic>n</italic> = 37, 29.37%), especially the isolates belonged to genera 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, 
 <italic>Nocardiopsis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Kocuria</italic>. However, the distribution of the genus 
 <italic>Micrococcus</italic> was relatively similar in three kinds of tissues.
