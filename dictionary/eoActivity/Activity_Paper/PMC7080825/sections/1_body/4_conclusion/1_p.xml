<p>In summary, the results from our pilot study revealed that medicinal plant 
 <italic>T. roseus</italic> Schipcz. provided a rich source of endophytic actinobacteria that exhibited a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. Besides, the diversity of endophytes differed between the plant tissues and geographic locations. These results further confirmed the notion that the pretreatment of plant materials, using selective media and different geographic locations, is an essential step for pure culture isolation. This study showed that bacterial isolates, such as 
 <italic>S. armeniacus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. polyantibioticus</italic>, with antifungal activity could be used as potential biocontrol agents against different kinds of plant pathogens. Furthermore, systematic investigations are needed to explore the chemical diversity of bioactive metabolites produced by these endophytes, which can offer an opportunity to discover novel natural products for the treatment of human diseases as well.
