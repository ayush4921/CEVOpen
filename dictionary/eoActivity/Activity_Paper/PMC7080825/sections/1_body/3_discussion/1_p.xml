<p>Endophytic actinobacteria associated with medicinal plants as a biocontrol agent are considered to be beneficial for plant diseases management, and they spend their whole life cycle within plant tissues without causing any detectable infectious or signs of disease symptoms and may also produce the same metabolites and within the living tissues of host plant (
