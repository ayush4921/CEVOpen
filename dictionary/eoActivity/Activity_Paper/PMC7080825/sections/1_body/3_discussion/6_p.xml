<p>Interestingly, strain T4SB004 and T3RB001 with the same taxonomy based on the 16S RNA analysis and isolated from two different geographic and environmental sites exhibited different antagonistic activity. For instance, strain T4SB004 showed antagonistic activity toward the growth of 
 <italic>Valsa malicola</italic>, 
 <italic>Valsa mali</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>, while strain T3RB001 inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp., 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>, and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. This indicated that active endophytic strains showed specific selectivity to some pathogens as well as further confirm the fact that the antimicrobial properties of endophytes had a relationship with the geographical site of host plants. In the present study, 30.95%, 23.00% of the tested endophytic actinobacteria were capable of producing siderophores and chitinase, respectively. It is well known that endophytic actinobacteria inhibit the growth of the phytopathogen by competing for iron in the environment (

 <italic>Achillea fragrantissima</italic> showed varying degrees of antifungal activity against fungal pathogens and produced chitinases or siderophores, according to
