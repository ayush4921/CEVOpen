<p>The antagonistic activity of the endophytic actinobacteria community associated with medicinal plant 
 <italic>T. roseus</italic> S were screening 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> condition by using a dual culture technique against a diverse range of phytopathogens. The results showed, substantial antagonistic activities against five pathogens, including 
 <italic>Fulvia fulva</italic> (Cooke)Cif., 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Valsa malicola</italic>, 
 <italic>Valsa mali</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic>. In contrast, all tested strains showed moderate and weak activities against 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f.sp. and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. The antagonism of endophytic actinobacteria observed in this study was in accordance with previous reports; this includes, for example, the activity of actinobacteria isolated from tomato plants toward a diverse range of phytopathogens, such as 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Fusarium oxyporum</italic> f sp. lycopersici, and 
 <italic>Rhizoctonia</italic> sp. (

 <italic>Streptomyces albidoflavus</italic> showed antagonistic activity against three human pathogens, and it strongly inhibited the growth of

 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2015)</xref> found that the secondary metabolites of strain 
 <italic>Nocardiopsis dassonvillei</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>dassonvillei</italic> showed potent inhibitory activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. In addition, strain 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. T4SB030 and T4SB028 were able to control many bacterial and fungal pathogens. The inhibition ratio of T4SB028 against 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Valsa malicola</italic>, and 
 <italic>Valsa mali</italic> was 67.06, 64.20, and 70.55%, respectively. This had accordance with the previous study (

 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. T4SB030 and T4SB028 isolated from 
 <italic>T. roseus</italic> S. in the biocontrol of 
 <italic>Alternaria solani</italic>, 
 <italic>Valsa malicola</italic>, and 
 <italic>Valsa mali</italic>. According to our work, the strain T4SB030 and T4SB028 were related to 
 <italic>S. armeniacus</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. polyantibioticus</italic> could be used as putative broad-spectrum biocontrol agents in future studies. Moreover, T3RB033 and T4LB045 might be a new putative antagonistic novel species isolated from 
 <italic>T. roseus</italic>.
