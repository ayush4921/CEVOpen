<p>A total of 126 isolates belonging to 2 classes, 8 orders, 14 families, and 24 genera were isolated from medicinal plants 
 <italic>T. roseus</italic> S from Ili and Tacheng sites in Xinjiang. The results showed a great diversity in populations of endophytic actinobacteria. The diversity analysis showed that the evaluated parameters from each location sample were different; the diversity from Tacheng was more abundant than the Ili site. For example, Venny of endophytic actinobacteria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) showed that 5.56% rare genera were only from Tacheng, while 4.76% rare genera were only from the Ili site (

 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genus was the most abundant genus isolated from two samples (45 out of 126). These data corroborated the results obtained by 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al. (2015)</xref>, who isolated 119 endophytic actinobacteria 66 of them being affiliated to genus Streptomyces based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. In accordance with these results, previous study has shown that 192, 146, and 159 endophytic actinobacteria were isolated from mangrove plants sampled in the three different natural protection areas Macao, Hainan, and Guangdong, respectively, and only 12 genera were isolated from Macao site (

However, these results suggested that the select of different geographical environmental habitat to the same host plant to explore the diversity of endophytic actinobacteria resources will helps us to understand more characteristics of the symbiotic relation of host plants with respect to geographical environment of sampled area such as the type of soil and nutrient content (
