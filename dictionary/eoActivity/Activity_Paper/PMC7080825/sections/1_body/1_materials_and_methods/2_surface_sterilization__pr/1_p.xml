<p>Each plant sample was washed with running tap water to remove surface clays and adhering epiphytes completely. The plant samples were separated into stem, root, and leaf segments by using sterile scissors. Subsequently, samples were washed by sonification for 30 min at 45 kHz to remove the dislodge soil and organic matter. The surface sterilization protocol included five steps: plant segments were rinsed in 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 min, sequentially immersed in 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 4 min leaf segments and 6 min for stem and root segments, washed for 10 min in 2.5% Na

Finally, the samples were placed on sterilized filter paper and thoroughly dried in a sterile Petri dish under the laminar flow chamber for 24 h. After drying under sterile conditions, the sterilized samples were crushed in a sterilized commercial blender (Joyoung, JYL-C012) for 20 s (leaves) and 30 s for (stems and roots) (
