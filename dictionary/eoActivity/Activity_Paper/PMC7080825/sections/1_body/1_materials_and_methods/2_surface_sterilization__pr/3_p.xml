<p>For each pretreated sample (roots, stems, and leaves), about 1 g of tissue homogenate was weighed aseptically and macerated with a sterile mortar and pestle along with 9 mL sterile double distilled water. After precipitation for 10 min at room temperature, the supernatant was serially diluted (10
 <sup>–2</sup> and 10
 <sup>–3</sup>), and a suspension of 0.2 ml was spread onto ten different selective isolation media (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In order to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi, the isolation media were supplemented with antibiotics: nystatin 50 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup>, K
 <sub>2</sub>Cr
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub> 25 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup> and nalidixic acid 25 mg L
 <sup>–1</sup>. All agar plates were performed three replicates for each dilution and then warped with parafilm and incubated at 28°C for 45 days before being monitored every 7 days for microbial growth. The colonies were observed and selected according to their characteristics and colony morphology. The purified actinobacteria isolates were stored on the ISP2 slope medium at 4°C and in 20% glycerol at −80°C (
