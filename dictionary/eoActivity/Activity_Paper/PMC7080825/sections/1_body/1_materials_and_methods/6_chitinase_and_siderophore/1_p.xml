<p>Chitinase production was assessed by using a Colloidal chitin-supplemented medium, as described by 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal and Kotasthane (2012)</xref>. The protocol for preparing the colloidal chitin was such that Chitin was hydrolyzed in concentrated hydrochloric acid by stirring at 4°C for 12 h, and this was followed by extraction of colloidal chitin in 200 mL
 <sup>–1</sup> of ice-cold 99% ethanol, neutralization at room temperature for another 12 h, and then centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was washed with distilled water by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min for several times until the smell of alcohol was removed entirely and the pH was natural. Chitinase medium composed of (L
 <sup>–1</sup>) 2.0 g of KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 1.0 g of citric acid monohydrate, 0.3 g of MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>⋅7H
 <sub>2</sub>O, 3.0 g of (NH
 <sub>4</sub>)2SO
 <sub>4</sub>, 15 g of agar, 200 μL of Tween-80, and 4.5 g of colloidal chitin was supplemented with 0.15 g of bromocresol purple and then autoclaved at 121°C for 20 min. All agar plates were wrapped with parafilm and three replicates for each isolate, incubated at 25 ± 2°C for 3–7 days, and were observed for the formation of a colored zone around bacterial colony. Sterile chitin agar media was used as a control for bacterial growth.
