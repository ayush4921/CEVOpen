<p>Siderophore production was evaluated by incubating endophytic actinobacteria on Chrome azurol S (CAS) agar medium at 28Â°C for 7 days following the methods described by 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2018)</xref>. An orange halo surrounding the actinobacteria colony indicates the tested strains have the siderophore-producing ability. The experiment was conducted with three replicates.
