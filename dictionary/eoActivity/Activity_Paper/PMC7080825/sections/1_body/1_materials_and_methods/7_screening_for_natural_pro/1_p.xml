<p>Fifty-four strains showed antimicrobial activity against one or more indicator organisms and were used for screening for natural product biosynthetic gene clusters by PCR. Three sets of degenerate primers targeting biosynthetic genes were used for PCR amplification: KSF (5′-GTSCCSGTSSCRTGSSHYTCSA-3′) and KSR (5′-CGCTCCATGGAYCCSCARCA-3′), which target 
 <italic>PKS-I</italic> KS and methyl malonyl transferase domains (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kun et al., 2010</xref>); KSαF (5′-TSGCSTGCTTGGAYGCSATC-3′) and KSαR (5′-TGGAANCCGCCGAABCCGCT-3′), which target 
 <italic>PKS-II</italic> KSα genes (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Metsä-Ketelä et al., 1999</xref>); and A3F (5′-GCSTACSYSATSTACACSTCSGG-3′) and A7R (5′-SASGTCVCCSGTSCGGTAS-3′), which target non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (
 <italic>NRPS</italic>) genes. A PCR amplification protocol as described by 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al. (2009)</xref> was followed.
