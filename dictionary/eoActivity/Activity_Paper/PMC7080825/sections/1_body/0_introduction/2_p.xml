<p>Endophytic actinobacteria exploit an unusual habitat may contribute to plant natural defenses by preventing herbivores and promoting the biocontrol of pathogens and pests due to their ability to produce the same or similar compounds with the host plants (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Shimizu et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, great attention has been paid by researchers toward their potential applications in pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food industries (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Singh and Gaur, 2016</xref>). For instance, a total of 150 endophytic actinobacteria were isolated from three medicinal plant species (
 <italic>Annonaceae squamosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Camptotheca acuminata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Taxus chinen</italic>), and 72.4% of them showed inhibition against more than one indicator microorganism, including

 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aspergillus niger</italic> (

 <italic>Pythium aphanidermatum</italic> and significantly promoted plant growth and reduced the crown and root rot of cucumber that was caused by the
