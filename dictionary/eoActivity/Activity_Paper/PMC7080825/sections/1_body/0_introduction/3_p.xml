<p>Medicinal plants in China have an ethnomedicinal history, and there are about 128,000 kinds of crude medicine resources (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2013</xref>). In other words, the vast majority of traditional Chinese medicine and natural chemical products had been derived from medicinal plants due to their effectiveness in various components for disease prevention and treatment. 
 <italic>Thymus roseus</italic> Schipcz is one of the traditional Chinese medicinal herbs belonging to the 
 <italic>Labiatae</italic> family, and it has a strong adaptive capability for a variety of particular habitats, such as arid lands, saline-alkali soils, and desertified soils (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, modern pharmacology has demonstrated that 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> and thyme essential oils possess of anti-inflammatory, antibiosis, antiviral, antioxidant, anticancer, and antithrombus properties (

 <italic>T. roseus</italic> S.; thus, the study of endophytic actinobacteria and their interaction with the host plants 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> and its adaptive properties to arid lands is of great import within arid land ecology. This has the potential to significantly better our understanding of its diversity and antimicrobial activities as well as to further investigate its biotechnological applications potentials. However, the selection rationale of host plants, locations, and pretreatment methods for the isolation of endophytes is essential in biodiversity research (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Besides, endophytic resources of arid land are most likely to possess unique and diverse functions, such as degrading chitin, producing siderophore, encoding antimicrobial and antibiotic biosynthetic genes, because of their high ability to adapt the extremely arid environment (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2017c</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, our research group reported that the vast majority of endophytic isolates from Chinese traditional medicinal plants 
 <italic>Ferula sinkiangensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ferula songorica</italic> in Xinjiang arid land were capable of producing both antifungal and plant growth-promoting traits (
