<p id="p0190">There are striking similarities in the phytochemical components of plants belonging to the same family. For example, in the current study, Apiaceae was represented by 11 species, all of which tested positive for the presence of glycosides, eight of these species contain alkaloid, eight had tannins, seven contain flavonoid, six contain saponin and only three of these species had Resin. Another example is Lamiaceae, which was represented by 9 species, all of which tested positive for the presence of glycosides. In contrast, all of them lacked resin except one species contain resin. Furthermore, the two species that represent the Arecaceae (
 <italic>Hyphaene thebaica</italic> (L.) Mart. and 
 <italic>Phoenix dactylifera</italic> L.) contain glycosides and tannins, while they lacked alkaloid, flavonoid, saponin and resin.
