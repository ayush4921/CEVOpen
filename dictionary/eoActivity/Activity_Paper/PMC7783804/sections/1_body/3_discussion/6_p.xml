<p id="p0195">On the other hand, there are relatively wide differences in the secondary metabolites of plants belonging to the same family. For example, the three representatives of the Myrtaceae had relatively wide differences in the secondary metabolites they contain. This observation is the same for the two species representing the Amaranthaceae. The similarity and wide diversity in the distribution of secondary metabolites among plants in the same family, as revealed in this study, are of taxonomic importance. As a result, the use of phytochemical constituents in plants as a taxonomic tool in classification has wide acceptability (
