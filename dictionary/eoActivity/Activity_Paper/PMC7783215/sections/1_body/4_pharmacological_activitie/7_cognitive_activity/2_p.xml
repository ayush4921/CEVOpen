<p id="p0135">A polysaccharide isolated and purified by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-75 chromatography from 
 <italic>M. pulchra</italic> Kurz was investigated for its cognitive activity. The polysaccharide was evaluated in experimental animals (Kunming mice) by performing the behavioural study (
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). From this study, it was found that polysaccharide significantly reversed D-galactose induced learning and memory impairments by reducing the oxidative stress along with suppression of inflammatory response. It was also found that polysaccharide distinctly lowers the content and deposition of Î²-amyloid peptide increase the level of acetylcholine but decreased the cholinesterase activity. These outcomes suggested that polysaccharide may be the active constituent to exert a protective effect on cognitive impairment in mice (
