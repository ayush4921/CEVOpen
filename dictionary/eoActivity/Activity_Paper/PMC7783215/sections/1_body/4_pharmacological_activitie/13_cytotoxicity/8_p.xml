<p id="p0220">Studies were conducted to investigate the cytotoxicity activity of different fractionated isolates of ethanol extracts of stems of 
 <italic>M. pachyloba</italic> Drake on HeLa and MCF-7cell lines by MTT assay. Total of 10 compounds showed potent cytotoxicity activity for which these were again subjected, to study the activity against different cancer cell lines viz. HeLa, HepG2, MCF-7, Hct116, and MDA-MB-231 and one normal cell line HUVEC. This revealed that these compounds have specific cytotoxicity potential in a cancer cell line whereas, there are no such results obtained in case of the normal cell line. Again, the autophagic effect was investigated by using GFP-LC3-HeLa cells and confirmed about the compound known as durmillone, which significantly induces autophagy. From the PI/Annexin V double staining assay, it was confirmed that durmillone, also induces apoptosis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells. These findings suggest the compound, as a potent anti-cancer agent demonstrated by highest cytotoxic activity, through the combined action of apoptosis and autophagy (
