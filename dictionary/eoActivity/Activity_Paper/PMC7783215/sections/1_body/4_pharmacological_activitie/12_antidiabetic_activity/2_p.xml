<p id="p0185">Different solvent extracts of leaves of 
 <italic>Pongamia piñata</italic> (synonym of 
 <italic>M. pinnata</italic> (L.) Panigrahi) was evaluated for antidiabetic activity in alloxan-induced diabetic rats against standard drug Glibenclamide. It was observed that the aqueous and ethanol extract showed less potential but significant than the standard Glibenclamide at an oral dose of 500 mg/kg. Both of the extracts also decrease blood glucose and increase body weight. So the possible mechanism may be for the increase insulin secretion which improves the rate of glucose utilization. Different bioactive constituents like flavonoids, phenolics and steroids also play an important role in the antidiabetic study (
