<p id="p0170">The anti-inflammatory activity of ethanol extracts of stems of 
 <italic>M. dielsiana</italic> Harms ex Diels was evaluated. The nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine RAW264.7 macrophage cells showed the highest inhibitory effect (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value 16.0 ± 1.5 μM). Isoliquiritigenin and tupichinol C showed the modest inhibitory effects on NO production having IC
 <sub>50</sub> values 31.2 ± 2.5 and 38.4 ± 1.9 μM respectively (
