    "Gastrointestinal nematode infections can cause great losses in revenue due to decrease livestock production and animal death. The use of anthelmintic to control gastrointestinal nematode put a selection pressure on nematode populations which led to emergence of anthelmintic resistance. Because of that, this study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of aqueous and methanol extract of <i>Cassia siamea</i> against the motility of <i>C. elegans</i> Bristol N2 and <i>C. elegans</i> DA1316. <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> Bristol N2 is a susceptible strain and <i>C. elegans</i> DA1316 is an ivermectin resistant strain. <i>In vitro</i> bioassay of various concentrations of (0.2, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 2.0 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) aqueous and methanol extracts of <i>C. siamea</i> was conducted against the motility of L4 larvae of <i>C. elegans</i> Bristol N2 and <i>C. elegans</i> DA1316. The L4 larvae were treated with 0.02 Î¼g mL<sup>-1</sup> of ivermectin served as positive control while those in M9 solution served as negative control. The activity of the extracts was observed after 24 h and 48 h. A significant difference was recorded in the extract performance compared to control at (<i>P</i> < 0.001) after 48 h against the motility of the larvae of both strains. The methanol extracts inhibited the motility of <i>C. elegans</i> Bristol N2 by 86.7% as well as DA1316 up to 84.9% at 2.0 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> after 48 h. The methanol extract was more efficient than aqueous extract (<i>P</i> < 0.05) against the motility of both strains of <i>C. elegans. Cassia siamea</i> may be used as a natural source of lead compounds for the development of alternative anthelmintic against parasitic nematodes as well ivermectin resistant strains of nematodes."
