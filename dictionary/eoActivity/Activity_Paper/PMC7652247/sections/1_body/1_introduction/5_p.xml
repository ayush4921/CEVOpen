 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has been used for more than 30 years for the study on anthelmintic resistant and screening for the potential compound or drug target in parasitic nematodes (

 <italic>Annona crassiflora</italic> (marolo) extract on 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> shows some promising results where it inhibited the motility of the tested worms up to 98.13% (

 <italic>C. elegans</italic> in 
 <italic>Combretum mucronatum</italic> (bushwillow) was found to be effective to reduce the survival rate up to 89.2% (

 <italic>C. elegans</italic> CB193 levamisole resistant strain shows that, 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> (guajava) extract inhibit the motility and oviposition activity of the worms which suggested some potential anthelmintic activity of the plant. A similar evaluation of activities of others plant extracts were carried out with different plant extract show similar results on the motility of
