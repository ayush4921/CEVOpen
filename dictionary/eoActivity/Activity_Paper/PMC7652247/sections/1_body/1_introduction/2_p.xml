<p>Therefore, 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> is one of the most studied model organisms to overcome the obstacles interfering with the screening of products for alternative anthelmintic. For instance, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> screening of plant as an alternative to synthetic anthelmintic is faced with numerous challenges ranging from the high cost of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> screening and time-consuming procedures to ethical constraints. Furthermore, difficulty in obtaining suitable adult parasitic nematode that could be used to evaluate the efficacy of anthelmintic makes it difficult to study drugs effect on the adult parasites 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. These challenges have been overcome with the discovery of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> and its subsequent uses as a laboratory model in screening for anthelmintic. The application of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a model in the screening of plants and plant products for anthelmintic have generated the advantages of cheap 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activities, easy maintenance, short generation time coupled with the transparent body of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> which may permit easy observation of the drugâ€™s effects against the adult organism. In addition, it is possible to study the drugs effect or activity of compounds against adult 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> and applied the idea of the effect of the drug on parasitic nematodes of the same clades (
