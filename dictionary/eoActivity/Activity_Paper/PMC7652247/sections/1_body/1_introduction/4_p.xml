 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> belongs to the same Clade V with some economically influential nematodes parasites from the family of Trichostrongylidae such as 
 <italic>Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Ostertagia ostertagi</italic> and 
 <italic>Oesophagostomum columbianum</italic>, as they share common anatomical and physiological relationship with 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. According to 
 <xref rid="b12-tlsr-31-3-145" ref-type="bibr">Jones 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (2005)
 </xref>, by being a parasite makes it difficult to commence the study in the laboratory without using the artificial laboratory animal hosts. This is because parasitic nematodes are difficult to culture and analyse independently of their hosts (
 <xref rid="b6-tlsr-31-3-145" ref-type="bibr">Blaxter 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 1998
 </xref>). In addition, there are some limitation to study the parasite in their natural hosts which is including the labour-intensive, time-consuming, issues on animal ethic and the costs (
 <xref rid="b34-tlsr-31-3-145" ref-type="bibr">Wimmersberger 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2013
 </xref>). Because of that, this study is focused on the use of two strains of 
 <italic>C. elegans. Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> N2 strain is a wild type strain that susceptible to all anthelmintic and 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 is an ivermectin-resistant strain which contains mutation in 
 <italic>avr-14, avr-15</italic> and 
 <italic>glc-1</italic>. Each of genes encode glutamate-gated chloride channel and highly resistant to ivermectin (

  <italic>et al</italic>. 2000
 </xref>). It is reasonably assumed that drugs effect on the 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> could be reproduced on such parasitic nematodes (
