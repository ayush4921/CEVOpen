<p>Approximately 100 L4 larvae of the required strain of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> in a suspension of 50 μL were added to each of the 24 wells. The amount of 1 mL of each serial concentration (0.2, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 and 2.0 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of the required extract was added to the larvae in the wells with three replicates for each concentration. Larvae were treated with 0.02 μg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> of ivermectin with three replicates served as a positive control whereas those in three wells treated with M9 solution served as negative control. The setup was incubated at 20°C; counting of motile larvae after 24 h and 48 h was done under an inverted microscope. Three independent experiment with both methanol and aqueous extract on each strain of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> was carried out and the average results were recorded. The percentage of worm motility (%WM) was calculated using the formula of
