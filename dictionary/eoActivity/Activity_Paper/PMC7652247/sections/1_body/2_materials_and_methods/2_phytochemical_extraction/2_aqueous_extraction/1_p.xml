<p>The aqueous extraction was carried out by soaking 50 g of the dry powdered sample in 250 mL of distilled water in a beaker (1:5 w/v). The setup was kept for 5 days at room temperature in the range between 25°C–28°C. The supernatant was filtered using Whatman no.1 filter paper before it was evaporated to dryness in an oven at 45°C for 1 week to obtain the dry extract. The dry extract was stored at 4°C in a labeled sterile glass vial before use (
