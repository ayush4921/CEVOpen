<p>This assay was aimed at determining the total tannins and total phenolics content of aqueous and methanol extracts of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic>. Total tannins content was determined by Folin-Denis spectrometric method as described by 
 <xref rid="b23-tlsr-31-3-145" ref-type="bibr">Oliveira 
  <italic>et al</italic>. (2009)
 </xref>. A solution of 1 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> concentration of the desired extract of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> was prepared by dissolving in 50% (v/v) methanol. Exactly 20 μL of the extract and tannic acid (standard) of serial concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were separately mixed with 100 μL of 25% Folin-Denis reagent and kept for 3–5 min. 80 μl of Na
 <sub>2</sub>Co
 <sub>3</sub> was added and the setup in 96 well plates was incubated in darkness for 1 hr. Calibration curve of absorbance values against the varying concentration of the tannic acid standard was plotted and the regression equation (y = ax + b) was obtained with the aid of Microsoft Excel Software version 2016. The tannins content of the samples was finally calculated in Tannic Acid Equivalent (TAE mg
 <sup>−1</sup>). The same procedure was used for determination of total phenolic content. However, Gallic acid with the concentrations of (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3.3.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was used as standard instead of tannic acid and Folin-Ciocalteau reagents were used instead of Folin- Denis reagent. Phenolic content was calculated in mg Gallic Acid Equivalence (GAE mg
 <sup>−1</sup>).
