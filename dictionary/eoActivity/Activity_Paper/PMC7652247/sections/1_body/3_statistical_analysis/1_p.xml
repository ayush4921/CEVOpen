<p>The data were presented as the mean ± SE and computed using Microsoft® Excel 2016 software. Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS
 <sup>®</sup> version 24. Kolmogorov-Smirnov was used to investigate the normality of data. The percentage motility inhibitory efficacy among different concentrations of the extracts and the negative control was compared using one-way ANOVA. The post hoc statistical significance used was least square difference (LSD) and the difference between the means was considered significant at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Probit analysis was applied to calculate the inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>). The efficacies of aqueous and methanol extracts were compared using paired sample 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.
