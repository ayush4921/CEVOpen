<p>The results revealed increased in the efficacy of both methanol and aqueous extracts as the concentrations of extracts and time increased (

 <sup>−1</sup> at 24 h. This is indicated by the highest larval motility of 91.8% (8.2% inhibited) and 81.4% (18.6% inhibited) recorded in the aqueous and methanol extracts respectively against
