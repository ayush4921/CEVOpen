<p>This work was aimed at investigating the efficacy of aqueous and methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> against the motility of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> Bristol N2 and 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316. The high percentage larval motility in the negative control throughout the assay coupled with the variation in the percentage larval motility among the different concentrations of the extracts was a clear indication that the diluent used in the preparation of the extract solution did not interfere with the anthelmintic properties of the extracts.
