<p>Presently, there are scarce scientific records on the anthelmintic activity of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> extracts against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Results in this report suggested that the potential use of the 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> plant extract as an alternative for the treatment of nematode resistant worm (
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316). 
 <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> DA1316 is an ivermectin resistant strain. Incubation with the extract not only effect the motility of the worms but also killed them 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> after 24 h and 48 h treatment. Significant difference occurred in the larvicidal efficacy between the positive control (ivermectin) and all the treatment with the various concentrations of both methanol and aqueous extracts at 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316. The methanol extract of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> was effective against the larval motility of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> Bristol N2 and 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 after 48 h. The same phenotypes were observed for 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> N2 treated with ivermectin compared to 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 that treated with the plant extracts. Both strains tested were paralysed and were inhibited with both treatments.
