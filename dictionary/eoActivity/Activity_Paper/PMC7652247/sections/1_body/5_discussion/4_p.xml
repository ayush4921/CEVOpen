<p>The anthelmintic activity of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> observed in this study is similar to the anthelmintic activites of extracts from plants such as crude extracts of 
 <italic>Kaya senegalensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Annona senegalensis</italic> and 
 <italic>Annogeisus leiocarpus</italic> which were reported to be ovicidal and larvicidal against the adult of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> (

 </xref> also reported strong anthelimintic activity exhibited by ellagic acid and gentistic acid from 
 <italic>Anogeissus leiocarpus</italic> against 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> DA1316 among other commercial drugs resistant strains of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> tested.

 </xref> also reported effective anthelmintic activity of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Psidium guajava</italic> againts the motility of levamisole resistant strain of 
 <italic>C. elegans</italic> CB193. The effectiveness of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> also has been reported against several strains of bacteria in previous study (
 <xref rid="b25-tlsr-31-3-145" ref-type="bibr">Phaiphan 
  <italic>et al</italic>. 2014
 </xref>). The antibacterial potential was tested by disc diffusion method against seven strains of bacteria, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> sp. BCC 5357, 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> ATCC 33019, 
 <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> ATCC 17802, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> ATCC 14028, 
 <italic>Salmonella enteritidis</italic> ATCC 13076 and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> BCC 30506. In that study, the extract of 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> leaves were inhibited the Gram-positive strains more than the Gramnegative strains.

 </xref> reported that 
 <italic>C. siamea</italic> could be useful as antimicrobial, antibacterial, anticancer among several other medicinal values. It has been used in Asia and other tropical countries as medicinal herbs against ringworm, anthelmintic and anti-rheumatic (
