 <italic>M. viridis</italic> has a higher antioxidant activity (IC50 = 80.45 ± 1.86 μg/mL) compared to 
 <italic>M. pulegium (</italic>IC50 = 20.17 ± 1.88 mg/mL) [

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This statement highlights the value of 
 <italic>M. viridis</italic> as an antioxidant plant. Aljaiash et al., 2018 demonstrated that drying 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> plants at 50 °C is recommended to enhance the antioxidant activity of its essential oil. The antioxidant activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> is concentration-dependent and it is attributed to its oxygenated sesquiterpenes [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The plant essential oil showed higher antioxidant activities with DPPH and β-carotene method than with the reductive potential method. Gamma irradiation of 
 <italic>M. pulegium</italic> doesn't affect the antioxidant potency of its essential oil up to a dose of 30 kGy of irradiation [
