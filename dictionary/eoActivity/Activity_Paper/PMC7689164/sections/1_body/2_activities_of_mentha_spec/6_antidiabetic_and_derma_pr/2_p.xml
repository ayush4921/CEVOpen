<p id="p0080">In vitro inhibition of enzymes involved in degradation of carbohydrates shows that 
 <italic>M. viridis</italic> essential oil exhibits important inhibitory effect against α-Amylase (IC50 = 101.72 ± 1.86 μg/mL) and α-Glucosidase (IC50 = 86.93 ± 2.43 μg/mL) [

 <italic>M. viridis</italic> essential oil due to inhibition of the enzymes tyrosinase (IC50 = 55.13 ± 1.01 μg/mL) and elastase (IC50 = 114.24 ± 1.22 μg/mL).
