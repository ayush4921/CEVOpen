<p>The current research is the first quantitative study comprising of 150 plant species used in traditional ethnomedicines (TEMs) in rural mountainous area of Samahni, District Bhimber of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. The study is very innovative as it is first quantitative ethnomedicinal research work conducted on prevalently used plants in TEMs in the study area. These ethnomedicinal findings are compared with previous research works conducted in District Bhimber of Azad Kashmir [

As medicinal plants reported here are first time properly documented and authenticated using quantitative statistical tools and many of these wild plants are first time reported here in this study as medicinal species. The key importance of this research is that it has different recipes with mode of use determined by RPL, ROP and ICF which contains famous folklore phytotherapeutics

In this study, the plants species with high RPL and FL values might be recommended for further phytochemical and ethnopharmacological research to discover novel drugs and produce allopathic drugs at industrial level by using pharmaceutical research protocols to cope with emerging resistant pathogenic microbes for safe and better health of human beings. Future conservation work for rare medicinal plants species of the area is urgent need of time.
