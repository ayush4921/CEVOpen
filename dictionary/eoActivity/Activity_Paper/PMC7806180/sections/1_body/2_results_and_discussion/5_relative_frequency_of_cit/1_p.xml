<p>The relative frequency of citation (RFC) and use value index (UVI) tools were applied to explore and determine the medicinal potential of plants and their potential for future pharmacological research and drug development. RFC confirmed the medicinal importance and acceptability of MPs with frequency of citations in the study area to cure various diseases. The RFC of medicinal plants species of the study area ranged from 0.22 to 0.95 (
 <xref rid="pone.0243151.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The highest RFC (0.95) was found for 
 <italic>Acacia modesta</italic> Wall., followed by 
 <italic>Boerhavia procumbens</italic> Banks ex. Roxb. (RFC = 0.87), 
 <italic>Berberis lycium</italic> Royle. (RFC = 0.85), 
 <italic>Ficus auriculata</italic> Lour. (RFC = 0.83), 
 <italic>Carissa opaca</italic> Stapf ex. Haines. (RFC = 0.80) and 
 <italic>Calotropis procera</italic> (Aiton) Dryand (RFC = 0.75). The use value index (UVI) was calculated to find the relative importance of plants and their families in the local communities. The highest UVI was found for 
 <italic>Moringa oleifera</italic> Lam. (1.38 value), followed by 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum armatum</italic> DC. (1.25), 
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> (L.) Dunal. (1.24), 
 <italic>Withania coolgulans</italic> L. (1.16), 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> L. (1.13), 
 <italic>Terminalia belerica</italic> (Gaertn) Roxb. (1.03) and 
 <italic>Justicia adhatoda</italic> L. (1.00), respectively.
