<p>In this study ethnomedicinal and ethnobotanical information of 150 local plants from Samahni valley of District Bhimber of AJK was collected from 200 local informants who consisted of two types (i) 110 traditional herbal therapists (THP) and 90 indigenous people (IP) from different villages and local markets. The demographic information was fractionated into different categories which are presented 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0243151.g003">Fig 3</xref>. In the survey, it was found that mostly male informants have more knowledge of TEMs than female respondents. The reason of this difference may be due the fact that male can easily learn education of TEMs from ancestors and also male are more friendly in dissemination of traditional ethnomedicinal knowledge (TEK) about the local plants than female practitioners. Secondly, females of the rural areas were reluctant and shy in information sharing due to conventional family cultural and religious customs of the area [

The indigenous people (IP) who comprises of various subgroups such as farmers, midwives, teachers, house-wives and shepherds also depicted good amount of TEK but have restricted approach for proper identification of wild MPs of the area as per scientific criterion; however they knew all or maximum local names of the plants. They use MPs not only at their own homes as food phytonyms and tonics but also sale to herbal doctors and local markets traders to earn money. It was seen that THPs with experience of 10–15 years had highest (33%) TEMs knowledge, followed by experience group of 15–20 years (16.6%). It was found that illiterate people had more information of TEMs because they follow traditional cultural rituals more prevalently with great passion and belief than educated inhabitants [

A common trend was seen that with rise of education level, there was decline in TEK and use of TEMs that may be due to fact that literate people prefer to use allopathic medicines because they can afford to buy these medicines and prefer prompt relief from infirmities. It was also found that old people have more information about the MPs and TEMs than young community because they spent long time with their ancestors and used TEMs for disease cure [
