<p>In the research, quantitative ethnobotanical (EB) and ethnomedicinal (EM) data was collected through questionnaire process, tabulated in matrix form and analysed through statistical tools following methodology of previous ethnobotanists (Cook, 1995; Amjad

The authenticity, replicability and reliability of collected EB and EM information were rechecked by using the following microstatistical tools like: “informant consensus factor” (ICF), “fidelity level” (FL), “relative importance of plant” (RIP), “use value index” (UVI), “relatvie frequency of citation” (RFC), “relative popularity level” (RPL) and “rank order of priority” (ROP) following the procedures previous researchers like Ishtiaq
