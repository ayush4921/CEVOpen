<p>The current study confirms that TEMs obtained from plants are major source of medication used by rural and mountainous communities of the Samahni area of AJK, Pakistan. The local people hitherto are dependent on “green or botanic drugs” obtained from wild flora of the area. Although allopathic medicines are available in nearby District headquarters but still majority of the people prefer to use TEMs to cure different infirmities because indigenous people consider that botanic drugs are easy to collect and prepare, cheap, nontoxic and have better synergistic impact for treatment of chronic and acute diseases. This research work will provide the foundation linkage among rural dwellers, local herbalists and scientific researchers because it may lead towards discovering of neo-medicines through dedicated procedures and conservation of biocultural heritage by documentation. Following recommendations are suggested with future perspectives: (i) to document and preserve traditional ethnomedicines of the area as booklet form and analyze their dose optimization using latest protocols, (ii) to do further ethnopharmacological research on plants with high RPL, RFC and ROP to discover novel drugs (iii) to conserve rare and threatened medicinal plants of the area by using dedicated approaches involving concerned departments and indigenous people of the area, (iv) to provide practice measures for sustainable utilization of wild natural resources of the study and (v) to optimize and recommend herbal medicines to cure neo-emerging Covid-19 causing massive loss of lives around the globe. This and similar type of ethnomedicinal studies will make a pathway for discovering of novel drugs for mitigation and eradication of such fatal pandemic of Covid-19 through public message and track-path for future researchers.</p>
