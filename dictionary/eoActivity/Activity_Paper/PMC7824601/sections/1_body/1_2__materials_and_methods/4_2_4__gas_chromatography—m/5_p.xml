<p>For quantification purposes, four independent replicates of each sample were submitted to silylation procedure and each one injected in duplicate. The internal standard method was applied and the amount of metabolites present was achieved from the calibration curves obtained with the most closed pure standard compounds available or its TMS derivatives (if they have hydroxy groups). All the injected samples and standards solutions contain a fixed quantity of internal standard (tetracosane). The calibration curves were obtained by injection of at least six different concentrations (5 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> to 1.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and the detection and quantification limits (LOD and LOQ, respectively) were determined from the parameters of the calibration curves represented in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00087-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (LOD = 3 standard deviation/slope and LOQ = 10 standard deviation/slope). Values of correlation coefficients confirmed linearity of the calibration plots (
 <xref rid="foods-10-00087-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The concentrations of the standards were chosen in order to guarantee the quantification of each compound in the samples by intrapolation in the calibration curve. The results were expressed in mg of compound/g of extract, as mean values ± standard deviation (MV ± SD) of four independent analyses.
