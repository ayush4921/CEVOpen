<p>For the extraction in 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, the amount of plant was determined on a precision scale, RADWAG WLC 6/A2, with a precision of 0.1 g. In the process, 100 mL of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane for each 10 g of the plant was used. In 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00087-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the weights of plant powder and the amount of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane are listed. The plant parts were put into an Erlenmeyer flask, a magnetic stirrer was added, and the flasks were placed on a stirring plate. The 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane was added, see volume in 
 <xref rid="foods-10-00087-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, and the stirring was started at a speed of 600 rpm. Because some compounds can decompose under the light influence, the flasks were covered with aluminum foil in advance.
