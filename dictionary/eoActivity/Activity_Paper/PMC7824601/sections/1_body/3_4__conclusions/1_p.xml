<p>The 
 <italic>A. quercifolia</italic> rhizomes and leaves GC-MS profiles were established and revealed the plant nutritional value. Almost all the compounds herein reported were found for the first time in the species. The leaves richness in PUFA should be highlighted not only because it attests to their nutritional value but also will incentive its use in Timorese cuisine. The rhizomes richness in terpenoids should also be emphasized, particularly the cycloartane derivatives, compounds involved in phytosterols’ biosynthesis, which validate this plant’s use of rhizome to incentive the production of milk by young moms. The hopanoid derivatives herein revealed for the first time in this species, although common in ferns, may differentiate the species.
