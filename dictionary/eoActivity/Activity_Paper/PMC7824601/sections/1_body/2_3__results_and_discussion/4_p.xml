<p>Leaves extract showed more diversity in the chemical families present and their representativity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00087-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The major chemical family in its lipophilic extract, representing 78.3% of the identified compounds, was the carboxylic acids and derivatives. In addition, among the identified compounds, palmitic, linolenic, and linoleic acids were the ones found in the highest amount, respectively 237.27 ± 0.59 mg/g dry leaves, 253.71 ± 0.93 mg/g dry leaves, and 153.81 ± 0.11 mg/g dry leaves (

 <italic>n</italic>-tritetracontane found in significant quantities (131.3 ± 0.64 mg/g dry leaves). The remaining chemical families represent 0.2% and 2.5% of the rhizome and leaves’ identified compounds, respectively (
