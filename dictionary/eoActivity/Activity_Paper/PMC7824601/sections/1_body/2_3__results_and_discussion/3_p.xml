 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="foods-10-00087-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The rhizome chemical profile was dominated by hop-16-ene (166.45 ± 0.53 mg/g dry rhizome) and β-sitosterol (50.76 ± 0.11 mg/g dry rhizome). The second major chemical family identified in this plant part lipophilic extract was carboxylic acids and derivatives, summing a total of 19.8% of the identified compounds (
