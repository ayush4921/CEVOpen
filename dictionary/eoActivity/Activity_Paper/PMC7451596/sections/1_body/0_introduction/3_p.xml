Chemotherapy drugs, like rifampicin and isoniazid, are used to treat infectious TB diseases and are the first line of defence against this disease. Other chemical-based drugs include ethambutol and pyrazinamide, which have adverse effects. Failure to adhere to treatment through the irregular and noncontinuous use of medication results in bacterial resistance. As a result, a patient may be at risk of developing multidrug-resistant TB within a year of treatment. TB drugs with high side effects and low activity include amikacin, capreomycin, streptomycin and fluoroquinolones (

Approximately 4% of patients with TB worldwide are suffering from MDR-TB strains that resist standard first-line TB drugs; XDR-TB occurs when bacterial strains are resistant to all first-line and second-level TB drugs (
