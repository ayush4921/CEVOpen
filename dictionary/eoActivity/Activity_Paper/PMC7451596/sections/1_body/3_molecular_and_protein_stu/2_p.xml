<p id="p0535">This review included all of the microbial genetic content of genomics studies based on genome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to reveal potential specific active targets for antigen discovery and support the production of known antibacterial agents and new vaccine strains. The first TB study was carried out on the MTB H37Rv strain. This study showed the attribution of specific functions (âˆ¼40% of 4000 genes). Once information was available for active genes, the exact target drug was determined on the basis of its proposed metabolic production pathway (
