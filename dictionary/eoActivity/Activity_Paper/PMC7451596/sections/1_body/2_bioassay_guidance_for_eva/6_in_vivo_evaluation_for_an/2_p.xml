<p id="p0530">The final drug candidate for clinical evaluations must be tested at different dosages that are well tolerated in humans by using 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models with mycobacterial infections. Mice are exposed to virulent mycobacterial strains via aerosol; this exposure route leads to a low level of MTB accumulation in lung tissues (

 <xref rid="b0705" ref-type="bibr">Pauli et al., 2005</xref>). After the cellular growth of tubercule bacilli and host immune response, therapy steps are applied through two phases: the rapid multiplication phase (up to 1 month) and the latent phase, which may last for several months (
