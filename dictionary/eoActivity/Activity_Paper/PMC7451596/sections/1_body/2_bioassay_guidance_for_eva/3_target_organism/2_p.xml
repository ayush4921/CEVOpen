<p id="p0505">In trials for discovering new anti-TB drugs, visible results are obtained by using the actual pathogenic agent MTB. MTB H37Rv (ATCC 27294) is the ideal target organism that is the main source of drug sensitivity in clinical sample isolates. Chemical molecules do not need to check initially when MDR-TB strains are used because these strains exhibit resistance to many drugs on the basis of a simple mechanism that is similar to the effusion pump mechanisms of several bacteria. However, genetic mutation gives rise to resistance to new bioactive compounds with novel mechanisms of action that are starkly different from the action mechanisms of currently used anti-TB drugs (

Given the virulence factors of the pathogenic MTB H37Rv strain, it should be carefully processed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory with specific safety requirements for workers and researchers. Most natural product researchers opt for an avirulent surrogate strain, such as

 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG (ATCC 35743) (
