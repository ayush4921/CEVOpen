<p id="p0510">The disc-and-well diffusion assay is a common method used for the evaluation of different antimicrobial agents. The capability of a natural resource to inhibit bacterial growth at an unknown concentration is screened on the basis of the length of a concentration gradient; however, this approach is insufficiently quantitative for the estimation of natural extracts and products or new crude materials. The size of the inhibition zone is a sign of microbial susceptibility or resistance to well-characterised antibiotics and can be used to calculate the mean diffusion rate of an active compound and the ratio of microbial growth (

On aqueous agar, the faster diffusion rate of polar compounds than that of nonpolar compounds with identical molecular weights results in the formation of small inhibition zones and the wrong impression of weak product activity. Furthermore, active polar compounds with low molecular weight may diffuse to equilibrium before the growth of slow-growing mycobacterial colonies. In this case, a zone of inhibition is absent because the concentration of the compound is below the minimum inhibitory concentration at equilibrium (
