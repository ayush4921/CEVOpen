<p id="p0525">The efficacies of plant natural extracts against many microorganisms and mycobacterial organisms can be profiled by using 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> models. Isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients suffering from tubercular disease are an actual 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> model. The evaluation of natural compound extracts can be improved when performed on samples collected from patients with different severities of disease infection induced by various mycobacterial strains (MDR-TB or XDR-TB). Animal models provide a different immune pathological situation. For example, animal cells infected with mycobacterial strains from patients produce nitric oxide compounds that are different from those produced by noninfected animal cells (

 <italic>ex vivo</italic> bioassays based on PMBCs for testing novel anti-TB material are more knowledge-based and less expensive than 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models (
