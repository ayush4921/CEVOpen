 <italic>T. sipthorpii</italic> exerts activity against four strains of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with the MIC of 12.5–100 μg/ml and the petroleum ether fractions exhibited MIC values of 12.5 and 50 μg/ml against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and H37Ra, respectively. The ethyl acetate fractions showed activity against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and H37Ra with MIC of 12.5 μg/ml. The anti-TB properties could depend on the high content of phenolic compounds such as rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid were investigated. The essential oil extracts of 
 <italic>T. vulgaris</italic> exhibited strong activity against clinical isolate 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and H37Rv stander strain at MIC value ≤40 μg/ml. Carvacol compound is consider important source from thyme oil will lead to the penetration and distraction cell membrane of bacteria. 
 <italic>U. glabra</italic> Hudson &amp; 
 <italic>U. dioica</italic> L. ethanol extraction and fraction by petroleum ether exhibited MIC value at 50 μg/ml against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra. From 
 <italic>U. barbata</italic> (L.) Mott. usnic acid was isolated as major compound have been screening with exhibited MIC value at 12.5 µg/ml against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. Alkaloid major compound fraction of 
 <italic>V. album</italic> L by chloroform and jervine isolated bioactive compound showed MICs value 50 and 25 μg/ml respectively, against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv strain. Thus, the bioactive compound extracts of these plant species may be potentially useful against TB and are potential sources of new anti-TB drugs.
