 <italic>M. juliana</italic> exhibits activity against four strains of 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> with the MIC of 12.5–100 μg/ml and the fractions by ethyl acetate showed activity against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv and H37Ra with MIC of 100 and 50 μg/ml respectively, depended on the quaintity of phenolic compound such as rosmarinic acid, chlorogenic acid, rutin hydrate and caffeic acid were investigated as active compound. P-cymene, thymoquinone and 1,5-decadiene have been isolated from 
 <italic>N. sativa</italic> seeds at concentrations of 45.26%, 35.35% and 9.9%, respectively. The oil extracts of these compounds exhibit activity against H37Rv with the MIC of 15 μl/ml. Anti-TB activity is attributed to the bioactive compound thymoquinone, which has numerous biological activities (

 <italic>P. brutia</italic> Ten. ethanol extraction and fraction by petroleum ether exhibited MIC value at 50 μg/ml against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra. Trans-caryophyllene, β-phellandrene and α-pinene have been identified as bioactive compounds with anti-TB activities from the flower oils and leaf and young stem extracts of 
 <italic>P. odorata</italic> with MIC &gt; 1.5 μg/ml at the dose of 100 μl/ml 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 300 μl/ ml 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Anti-TB activity can be attributed to the high content of terpene compounds, such as α-pinene (38.160%) (
