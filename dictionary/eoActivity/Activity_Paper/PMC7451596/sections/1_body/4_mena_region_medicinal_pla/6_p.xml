<p id="p0560">The oil extracts of 
 <italic>B. papyrifera</italic> (Del) Hochst olibanum contained octyl acetate, octyl formate, verticilla-4(20), 7,11-triene and diterpenes exhibit activity against H37Rv with the MIC of 15 μl/ml. This activity may be attributed to octyl acetate (37.26%) and diterpene constituents (20%) given that different diterpenes extracted from various plants exert activity against MTB by acting as an efflux pump inhibitor (

 <italic>C. majus</italic> L. by petroleum ether and chloroform have inhibited growth at 50 μg/ml MIC against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Ra. Essential oils and fractions containing citral b, citral a and β-pinene from 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> leaves show anti-TB activity with the MIC of 15 μl/ml. α-Verbenol (20%), transpincarveol, trans- p-menthe-2,8-dien-ol and d-limonene have been isolated from the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. nervatus</italic> inflorescences and presented activity against MTB strains with the MIC of 15 μl/ml. The active compounds isolated from 
 <italic>C. proximus</italic> leaves are piperitone, elemol, 4-carene and β-eudesmol. The essential oils of this plant showed anti-MTB activity with the MIC of 15 μl/ml. All essential oils obtained from the genus 
 <italic>Cymbopogon</italic> have clear antitubercular activity because they contain terpenoids, which likely disrupt the lipid layers and permeability of the microbial plasma membrane (
