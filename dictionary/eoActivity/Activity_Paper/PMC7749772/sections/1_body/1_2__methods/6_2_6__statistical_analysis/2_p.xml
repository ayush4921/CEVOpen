<p>Continuous variables are presented as mean ± SD. Within-group comparisons were conducted to determine any differences in the mean values of each variable between baseline and the two consecutive follow-up visits; a repeated measures ANOVA, with the least significant difference (LSD) test, was applied. For between-group comparisons, mean changes from baseline were compared using Student's
