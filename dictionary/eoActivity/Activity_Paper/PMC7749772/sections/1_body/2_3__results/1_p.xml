<p>From February 2016 to July 2016, a total of 349 patients were screened for eligibility and 200 underwent randomization, 100 of whom were allocated to each arm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Predominant reasons for screening failure were that the patient did not meet the inclusion criteria (115 patients, 77.2%) and that the patient had abnormal laboratory results (31 patients, 20.8%). The mean age of the enrolled patients was 61.1 ± 6.1 years; 85.5% were women and 86% had osteoarthritis in both knees. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients were comparable between the two groups (
