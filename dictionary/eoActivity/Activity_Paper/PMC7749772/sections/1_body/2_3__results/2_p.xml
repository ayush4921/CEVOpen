<p>With regard to the primary endpoint, the mean change in VAS pain was not statistically significantly different between the two groups, and THF-6 (1,500 mg/day) was found to be noninferior to diclofenac (75 mg/day) in both the MITT and PP analyses. The upper limit of the two-sided 95% CI for the comparison between the THF-6 group and the diclofenac group was within the prespecified margin of 10 mm for noninferiority (
