<p>None of the mean changes in any of the efficacy outcome measures differed statistically significantly between the two groups (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Significant improvements in all efficacy parameters among patients receiving THF-6 as well as those receiving oral diclofenac were observed by the end of Week 2, and significant improvements continued to be seen at the end of Week 4 (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">S2</xref>). There were 42 responders (50%) at the end of the four-week treatment with THF-6 compared to 40 (44%) with oral diclofenac (MITT analysis: 42/84 vs. 40/91,
