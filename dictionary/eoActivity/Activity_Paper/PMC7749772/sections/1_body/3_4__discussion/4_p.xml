<p>Even though the precise mechanism of THF-6's action has not yet been elucidated, the herbal constituents in the formulation have been shown individually to possess several pharmacological activities, perceivably contributing to the beneficial effects of THF-6 in the treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. Previous comprehensive literature reviews of 
 <italic>C. rotundus</italic> have found that the plant extracts have a broad range of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antiarthritic, and antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. 
 <italic>P. nigrum</italic> also exhibits various pharmacological activities, for example, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antiarthritic, and antioxidant activities, in both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal experiments [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. asper</italic> contains a number of bioactive compounds which possess anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The crude extracts and isolated compounds of 
 <italic>T. cordifolia</italic> have a wide range of pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiarthritic, and analgesic properties [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] as does 
 <italic>A. procera</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that the favorable outcomes following THF-6 administration in this trial might be attributable to the combined and possibly synergistic pharmacological activities of the several herbal ingredients in the formulation. Further research is warranted to ascertain the mechanisms of THF-6's action as well as understanding the molecular basis of its effects in symptomatic relief of osteoarthritic knee pain.
