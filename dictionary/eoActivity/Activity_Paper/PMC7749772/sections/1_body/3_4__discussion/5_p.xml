<p>In this trial, the overall safety profiles of both pharmacological interventions were more or less the same. Around one-fourth of the patients in each group experienced gastrointestinal adverse events following drug administration. Dyspepsia was the most common adverse event in both groups and its frequency did not differ between the groups. Nine patients in the THF-6 group discontinued treatment early due to gastrointestinal adverse consequences, as did six patients in the diclofenac group. These findings are not surprising given that similar gastrointestinal tolerability problems with oral diclofenac, particularly dyspepsia, have been regularly observed in other clinical trials assessing the safety and tolerability of oral NSAIDs [
