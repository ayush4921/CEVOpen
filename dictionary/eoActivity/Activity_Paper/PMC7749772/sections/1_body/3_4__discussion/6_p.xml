<p>There were limitations to this trial. First and foremost, there was no placebo comparison in the trial where a subjective outcome measure was used as a primary endpoint. In the context where standard therapy is widely used to treat a condition, a placebo comparison might not be possible due primarily to ethical reasons [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In such a context, noninferiority design could be applied to compare the intervention under investigation with another active treatment provided that the reference treatment's efficacy is well established [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as is the case for oral diclofenac [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This is of particular relevance in the present trial where the target groups had baseline knee pain of moderate-to-severe intensity. To minimize the risk of bias in the assessment of subjective outcomes, this trial assessed knee symptoms using several different measures to help ensure a comprehensive evaluation and also included a 10-step SCT measure which is less subject to contextual effects [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It should also be acknowledged that the MITT approach may be prone to attrition bias associated with the exclusion of some patients from the analysis [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Notwithstanding, it does not necessarily bias trial results [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In noninferiority trials, a PP analysis typically yields a more conservative estimate of treatment effects; therefore, the MITT approach is less likely to have a significant impact on estimated treatment benefits especially when both PP and MITT analyses consistently support noninferiority, as is the case of the present study [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Lastly, it is notable that the trial length of four weeks may not be long enough to determine long-term adverse outcomes of THF-6, including cardiovascular complications [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. On the basis of the evidence currently available, this trial does not guarantee the safety of long-term use of THF-6.
