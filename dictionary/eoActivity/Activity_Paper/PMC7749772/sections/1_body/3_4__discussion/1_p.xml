<p>In this randomized-controlled trial, THF-6 offered the potential to achieve analgesic efficacy with acceptable safety profiles in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the knee. In both the MITT and PP analyses, the upper limit of 95% CIs of MD in VAS pain was within the predefined noninferiority margin of 10 mm. This allowed us to conclude that THF-6 was noninferior to oral diclofenac (75 mg/day) in terms of knee pain relief. Oral administration of THF-6 also resulted in significant improvement, comparable to oral diclofenac, across several outcome measures. As THF-6 and oral diclofenac displayed comparable efficacy and safety, it seems appropriate to consider THF-6 an alternative for the treatment of moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the knee.</p>
