<p>The present clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of THF-6 versus oral diclofenac for the short-term treatment of symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. In clinical practice, pain relief medications, including oral NSAIDs, are typically prescribed on an as-needed basis for a short duration due to safety concerns [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Most randomized-controlled trials evaluating the effects of pharmacological interventions, especially oral NSAIDs, often last only a few weeks with only a small number of trials going beyond four weeks of treatment [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, the present trial design, with a treatment duration of four weeks, can be considered appropriate for determining the effects of THF-6 in symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee.
