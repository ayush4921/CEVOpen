<p>With respect to osteoarthritic knee pain of moderate-to-severe intensity, this trial demonstrated that THF-6 was comparable to oral diclofenac in relieving pain symptoms. An average reduction of around 26 mm on a 100 mm VAS pain scale with THF-6 treatment can be considered a clinically important improvement [
