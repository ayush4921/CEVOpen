  <p>Transmission electron micrographs represent the ultrastructural features of liver tissues of rats from each experimental group. (a) Control group showed numerous mitochondria (M)â€”mitochondria were spherical and round-shaped, depending on the location within the cell; clumps of glycogen surrounded (Gy), adipocytes (A), lysosome (L), and dense granulated cytoplasm were seen in the control group. (b, c) DEN-treated group tissues showing few mitochondria (M), and some of them are losing their shape (DM) and swollen mitochondria (SM), presence of glycogen clump (Gy), and broken SER. (c) Nucleus (N) with initial stage of chromatin disintegration (Nc) and few mitochondria (M), and some of them are losing their shape (DM), presence of glycogen clump (Gy), well-developed SER-ER tubule, few lysosomes (Ly), and presence of few peroxisomes (P). (d) DEN plus 6-gingerol-treated group tissues showed the presence of numerous small mitochondria (M); most of the mitochondria are spherical or round normal shaped, with dense granulated cytoplasm (C), presence of glycogen clump (Gy), and presence of lysosome (Ly).</p>
