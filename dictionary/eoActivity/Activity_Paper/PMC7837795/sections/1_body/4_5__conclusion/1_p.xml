<p>In conclusion, the findings of the present study demonstrate that DEN induces oxidative stress and hepatocellular changes in the liver, and 6-gingerol has a significant hepatoprotective effect against DEN-induced liver damage in rats through attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation. Further, our results confirm that 6-gingerol reduces or prevents hepatic damage and enhances the recovery from liver injury induced by DEN. Based on the findings, it can be suggested that the hepatoprotective action of 6-gingerol might be mediated through its antioxidant nature and anti-inflammatory action. Thus, intake of 6-gingerol may have beneficial effects in treating liver diseases.</p>
