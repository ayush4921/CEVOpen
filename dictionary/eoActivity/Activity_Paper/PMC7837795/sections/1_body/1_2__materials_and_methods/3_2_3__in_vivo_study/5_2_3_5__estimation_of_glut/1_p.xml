<p>Liver tissues obtained from each group of rats were homogenized in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid phosphate buffer saline. The homogenates were centrifuged at 15000 Ã— 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes at low temperature. The supernatants were collected for the measurement of antioxidant enzymes including glutathione level (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities. The antioxidant enzymes were measured by a colorimetric method using commercial kits (Abcam, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
