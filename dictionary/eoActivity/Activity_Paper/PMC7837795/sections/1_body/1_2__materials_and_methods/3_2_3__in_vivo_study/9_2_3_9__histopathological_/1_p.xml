<p>The liver tissues were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated in graded alcohol, cleared in xylene, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned to a thickness of 5 
 <italic>μ</italic>m. The sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E staining) for histopathological studies. Finally, H&amp;E-stained liver sections were examined using a Leica DM5000B microscope (Leica, Heidelberg, Germany), and subsequently, photographs were captured. The results were interpreted and scored as 0: no injury; 1: mild injury; 2: moderate injury; and 3: severe injury.
