<p>Ultrastructural changes in the liver tissues were examined by electron microscope [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Concisely, liver tissues were collected and were immediately fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde buffered to pH 7.2 with phosphate buffer, and the tissues were postfixed in 1% osmic acid for 70 min. Subsequently, the samples were dehydrated by graded alcohol and were embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were prepared using an Ultramicrotome (Leica UCT, Germany). These ultrathin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The ultramicrostructures of hepatocytes were examined under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Digital images were captured with an integrated CCD camera.
