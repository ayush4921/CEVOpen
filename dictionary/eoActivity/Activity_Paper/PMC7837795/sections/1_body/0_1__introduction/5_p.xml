<p>DEN is an N-nitroso-alkyl compound and is a well-known hepatotoxin [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The parenteral or oral administration of DEN has been already observed to cause severe liver damage in experimental animals. DEN has been found in different food items such as cheese, soybean, cured meat, salted, and dried fish. In addition, DEN has been detected in tobacco smoke and baby bottle nipples. Humans are thus at potential risk of DEN exposure. Consequently, it becomes very necessary to search for effective and therapeutic medicines for hepatoprotection and management of liver diseases [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents have been recommended to be beneficial in the management of liver diseases [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, the use of natural products that have the potential to protect from oxidative stress and inflammation can be considered as an important strategy in ameliorating hepatotoxicity.
