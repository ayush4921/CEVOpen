<p>The elevated levels of liver function enzymes in the serum are associated with hepatocellular damage because damage in the liver cell plasma membrane results in the release of these enzymes into circulation [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. ALT and AST are basically found in the hepatic cells, and their leakage is correlated to cellular damage. Therefore, serum levels of ALT and AST can be considered as the most sensitive indicators of hepatocyte injury [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that DEN administration (50 mg/kg b.w.) developed severe liver injury in rats that was characterized by a significant increase in serum enzyme activity of AST, ALT, and ALP. The results had showed that administration of 6-gingerol considerably inhibited DEN-induced elevation of serum ALT, ALP, and AST levels, indicating that 6-gingerol protected the liver from the damaging effects of DEN hepatotoxin, which was well supported by our histological findings.
