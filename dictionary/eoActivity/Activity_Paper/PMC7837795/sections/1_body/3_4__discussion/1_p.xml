<p>The present study investigated the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and potential hepatoprotective activity of 6-gingerol through 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. Several factors which are involved in the pathogenesis of liver include oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation [
