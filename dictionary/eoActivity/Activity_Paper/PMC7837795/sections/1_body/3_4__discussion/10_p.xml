<p>In the pathological process of liver injury, several inflammatory cytokines are meaningfully upregulated including TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, which facilitate inflammation and repair in physiological conditions [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In the current study, it was noticed that the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> expression was significantly high in the DEN-treated group, whereas the expression was notably decreased by the treatment of rats with 6-gingerol. Thus, our findings suggest that 6-gingerol exhibits hepatoprotective activity due to its anti-inflammation potential. These findings are consistent with the previous study on hepatoprotective activity of other medicinal plants. The expression of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was evaluated in the group receiving berberine alone and was found to be similar to the control. On contrary, a strong TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> expression was reported in rats receiving CCl
 <sub>4</sub> only [
