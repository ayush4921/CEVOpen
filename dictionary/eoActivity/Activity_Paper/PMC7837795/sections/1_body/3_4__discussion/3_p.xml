<p>Further, our results were in accordance with previous findings of some investigators who reported that treatment of 6-gingerol and silymarin had significant hepatoprotective effect against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity as indicated by the decrease in serum levels of liver marker enzymes including AST, ALT, and ALP [
