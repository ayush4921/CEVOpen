<p>Our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data has demonstrated that 6-gingerol extract possesses significant anti-inflammatory potential. Further, we confirmed the anti-inflammatory actions of 6-gingerol using an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study. Thus, the results obtained from the antiproteinase activity assay are in accordance to our findings from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, and 6-gingerol has been exhibited to possess powerful anti-inflammatory action practically identical to the reference anti-inflammatory drug. Inhibition of proteinase action and inflammation may be contributed by its strong antioxidant potential. Thus, our data propose that significant antioxidant activity of 6-gingerol might be responsible for its anti-inflammatory activity, and administration of 6-gingerol can be suggested to contain some considerable protective effect against DEN-induced liver damage.
