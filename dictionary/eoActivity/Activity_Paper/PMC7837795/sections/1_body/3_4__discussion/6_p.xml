<p>Recent studies have revealed that inflammation is generally implicated in the liver diseases ranging from the initial to the late stage [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and is a common pathophysiological response to liver injury. Remarkably, the overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines results in the elevation of ROS and, hence, oxidative stress, causing cell damage [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Keeping in mind this fact, it can be suggested that any antioxidant compound with anti-inflammatory activity can be used as a drug therapy in the management of liver damage. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines are documented to be produced in a large amount which has been considered to be an important hallmark of the pathogenic conditions including hepatic inflammation and injury. Carcinogens and toxins have been reported to cause tissue injury that significantly increases the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Various types of proinflammatory markers like TNF-alpha and IL-6 have been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases. Interleukin 6 (IL-6), quickly produced in response to different infections and tissue injuries, attributes response to host defense through the stimulation of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune reactions [

 <italic>κ</italic>B) is activated that results in the production of various inflammatory factors including IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. IL-6 and TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> are considered as proinflammatory markers and are useful for the identification of low-grade inflammation associated with visceral adiposity [
