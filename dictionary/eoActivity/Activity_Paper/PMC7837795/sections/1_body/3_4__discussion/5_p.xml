<p>Endogenous antioxidative enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) protect the liver against oxidative damage [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] because they convert ROS into stable molecules such as water and O
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. SOD is an important part of the antioxidant enzyme that encounters the harmful effects of ROS [

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Ginger and its active compound 6-gingerol have been documented to possess significant antioxidant property, and such activities have been reported to play a considerable role in the activation of antioxidation protective cascades. Further, this activity is attributed to the reduction of the liver damage through lowering of hepatic marker enzymes. Our findings from the DPPH assay confirmed the strong antioxidant nature of 6-gingerol. Thus, our result indicates that high antioxidant capacities of 6-gingerol might contribute to its therapeutic potential since it shows that its free radical scavenging ability may offer protection from oxidative damage caused by free ROS. The current study revealed that DEN administration caused a significant decrease in concentration of antioxidant enzymes including GSH, SOD, and GST in the livers of rats as compared to the control group. On the other hand, pretreatment of the rats with 6-gingerol before DEN administration significantly increased the activities of hepatic GSH, SOD, and GST activities. Thus, these observations provided evidences that 6-gingerol has the potential to protect liver damage induced by oxidative stress through enhancing activities of various antioxidant enzymes.
