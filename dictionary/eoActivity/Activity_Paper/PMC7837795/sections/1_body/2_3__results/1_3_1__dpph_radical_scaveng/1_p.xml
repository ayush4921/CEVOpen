<p>The DPPH assay is a significant method used to determine the antioxidant activity of various substances. In this assay, the antioxidant molecule provides an electron to DPPH and it gets reduced and generates yellow-colored diphenyl-picryl hydrazine. The reduction of DPPH by antioxidants can be measured by recording the decrease in absorbance at 517 nm. Our findings show that 6-gingerol has an excellent free radical scavenging activity, and this activity was found to be highest at 600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. The strong free radical scavenging activity of 6-gingerol indicates its potent antioxidant nature. The results of DPPH free radical scavenging activity assay are shown in
