<p>Proteinases are enzymes that are known to be implicated in arthritic reactions. Antiproteinase activity of natural products can be linked with controlling inflammatory disorders because of its potential to offer protection from proteinase-induced tissue damage. The data suggest that 6-gingerol possesses a considerable antiproteinase activity, and the antiproteinase activity of 6-gingerol was found to increase in a concentration-dependent manner, and 6-gingerol at 600 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml showed maximum antiproteinase activity. However, reference drug “diclofenac sodium” exhibited maximum inhibition at 200
