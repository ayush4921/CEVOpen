<p>During inflammation and arthritis, proteins are significantly denatured. Thus, a protein denaturation inhibition assay could be very useful for investigating the anti-inflammatory potential of any natural product. It is considered that the agents having protective potential against protein denaturation would be used in anti-inflammatory drug development [
