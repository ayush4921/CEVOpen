<p>Liver tissues of the control group rats showed normal architecture of hepatocytes such as clear cellular boundary, rounded and centrally located nuclear membrane, central lobular vein, and sinusoids with no dilation or congestion (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). In addition, hepatic damage was found to be reduced in rats having coadministration of 6-gingerol with DEN treatment, and the histological changes like infiltration of inflammatory cells, blood vessel dilation, and edema were decreased (
