<p>The fiber deposition was found to be almost 20% of the Sirius red positive in the liver tissue of rats exposed to DEN alone as compared to the control group which showed less than 5% of Sirius red positive. Besides, collagen fibers were considerably lower in 6-gingerol-treated rats (almost 10%) than those rats exposed to DEN alone. Based in these findings, it is revealed that 6-gingerol efficiently decreased the fiber deposition in the liver tissues (
