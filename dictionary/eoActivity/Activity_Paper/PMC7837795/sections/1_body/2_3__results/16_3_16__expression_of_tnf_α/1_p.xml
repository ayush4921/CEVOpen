<p>TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> protein expression was analyzed in experimental groups through immunohistochemical staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>). A total of five fields from each section were selected, 100 cells from each area were counted, and the mean percentage positivity was calculated. The expression of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was considered positive if more than 5% of cells showed positivity, and less than 5% positivity was taken as the negative case. The percentage of IHC staining intensity of cytoplasmic TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was considered mild when positive staining is &lt;20% and moderate when expression of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> was 25 to 50%, and when positive staining was more than 50%, it was considered as a strong positive. The significantly increased expression of the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> protein was noticed in rats treated with DEN only. Moreover, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> protein expression was significantly decreased in rats administrated with both 6-gingerol and DEN. However, the TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> expression in the treatment group receiving 6-gingerol alone was similar to the control group. The expression pattern of TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> among different treatment groups was statistically significant.
