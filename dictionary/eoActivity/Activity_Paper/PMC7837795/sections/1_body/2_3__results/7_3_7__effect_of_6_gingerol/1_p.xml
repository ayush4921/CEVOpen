<p>Hepatotoxicity and liver damage are commonly linked with marked elevation in the levels of ALT, AST, and ALP enzymes. In our study, DEN administration rats developed severe hepatotoxicity as reflected by a significant increase in AST, ALT, and ALP levels (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) as compared to the control group. The level of these enzymes significantly decreased (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) towards normal levels in rats that received 6-gingerol plus DEN when compared to the DEN-treated group (

Moreover, significant reduction in the concentration of total protein and albumin was seen in the DEN-treated group. The pretreatment with 6-gingerol significantly increased the concentrations of the proteins in the serum (
