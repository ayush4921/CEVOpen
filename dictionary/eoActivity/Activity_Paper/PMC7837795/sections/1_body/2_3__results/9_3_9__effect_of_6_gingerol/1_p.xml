<p>Our findings show that there was a significant decrease in the glutathione level (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) concentrations due to DEN administration as compared to the control group. Treatment with 6-gingerol prior to DEN administration significantly increased the hepatic GSH, SOD, and GST activities as compared to the DEN-treated group (
