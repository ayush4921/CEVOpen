<p>The antioxidant capacity of 6-gingerol was evaluated by FRAP assay, and ascorbic acid was used as the standard. Total antioxidant capacity is linked with reduction of Fe
 <sup>+3</sup> to Fe
 <sup>+2</sup> by 6-gingerol. The ascorbic acid solution (50-250 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) conformed to Beer's Law at 700 nm with a regression coefficient (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>) = 0.9938. The plot has a slope (
 <italic>m</italic>) = 0.0034 and intercept = 0.0258. The equation of standard curve is 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.0034
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0258. FRAP value of 6-gingerol was found to be 35.75 ± 0.0769 
 <italic>μ</italic>g ascorbic acid/100 mg dry weight of extract. The reducing power of 6-gingerol in terms of absorbance was found to be increased in a concentration-dependent manner (
