<p>Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide after cardiovascular disease, and a major threat to human health. Coumarins are a class of natural compounds widely found in a variety of plant families, including Umbelliferae, Compositae, Leguminosae, Rutaceae, mulberry, mignonette, and thyme (

According to the different substituents, coumarins can be divided into five classes: simple coumarins, pyranocoumarins, furocoumarins, dicoumarin, and isocoumarin (

By modifying the structure of coumarin and introducing functional groups, researchers have synthesized more complex and diverse coumarin derivatives with more application value and more performance. In recent years, coumarin and its derivatives have shown an extremely wide and inestimable potential in the field of anti-tumor therapy. Their anti-tumor mechanisms are very diverse, including inhibiting carbonic anhydrase (CA), targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, inhibiting multiple drug resistance (MDR), and inducing apoptosis, etc. In this review, the anti-tumor mechanisms and the research progress of coumarins have been emphasized in recent years.
