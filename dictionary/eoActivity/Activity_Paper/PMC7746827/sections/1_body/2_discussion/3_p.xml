<p>On the whole, numerous 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments proved coumarins are indeed a kind of potential new antitumor drugs, which have selective cytotoxicity and diverse anti-tumor mechanisms (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 1</bold>
 </xref>), but there are still problems that most of these studies are not in-depth or to explore the relationship between mechanisms, lack of 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments results in its unknown of security and drug metabolism 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, and low solubility in water limits its bioavailability, however, we believe that the modifications based on the structure of coumarin can solve these problems in the near future. We still have high hopes for coumarin compounds, because the structure of coumarin determines its many biological pharmacological activities, and the heterocyclic structure of coumarin is easy to bind to a variety of target proteins. The 2H-chromen-2-one ring can interact with different biological antigens because of its aromatic, planar, and lipophilic. In addition, the lactone group of coumarin enables the molecule to form strong polar bonds, such as hydrogen bonds and acetylated protein targets (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Researchers may be able to link the antitumor mechanisms, water solubility with structure and group, by modifying the structure to produce coumarin derivatives with higher selectivity, less side effects, and higher bioavailability. We look forward to more studies on the anti-tumor mechanisms of coumarins, especially 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments and preclinical studies, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties of coumarins, so as to accelerate the development of coumarins as new anti-tumor drugs and provide a new strategy for clinical cancer treatment.
