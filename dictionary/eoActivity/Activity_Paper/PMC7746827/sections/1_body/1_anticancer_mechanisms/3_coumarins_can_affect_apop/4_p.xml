<p>When combined with Akt inhibitor MK2206, isofraxidin had a synergistic effect on liver cancer cells, significantly decreasing the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and increasing the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, including caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition, caspase-3, -8, -9, and PARP in SKM-1 were significantly activated by TCHD. The single-stranded DNA bind to the overacted PARP and break it to poly(ADP-ribose), which destroys mitochondria and releases apoptosis-inducing factor (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) synthesized three series of coumarin hybrids by hybridizing 8-methoxy coumarin with three bioactive moieties, chalcone 2a-c, acrylohydrazide 4a-c, and pyridine 6a-b and 7a-b. These coumadin hybrids can up-regulate the expression of caspase-3 proteins in HCC cell lines and caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins in leukemia cell lines, and down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 and the up-regulation of Bax protein expression levels in HCC and leukemia cell lines.
