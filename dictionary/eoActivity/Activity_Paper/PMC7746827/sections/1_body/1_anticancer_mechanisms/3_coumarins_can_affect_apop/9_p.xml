<p>Han (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) synthesized a series of shikonin derivatives and evaluated their anti-human cervical cancer activity. Among them, PMMB232 showed the best anti-proliferative activity, and the IC50 value was 3.25 ± 0.35 μM. PMMB232 induced apoptosis by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential in human cervical cancer cells. PMMB232 also dose-dependently reduced the expression level of PARP and promoted the PARP cleavage.
