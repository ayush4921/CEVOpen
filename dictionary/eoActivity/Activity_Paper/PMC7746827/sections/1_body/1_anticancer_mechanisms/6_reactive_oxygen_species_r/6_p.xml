<p>Copper is found to be elevated in several types of cancer and involved in cancer growth, angiogenesis and metastasis, which has made it a potential target for developing anticancer therapeutics. Saman synthesized a coumarin-based copper chelator, di(2-picolyl)amine-3(bromoacetyl)coumarin hybrid molecule (ligand-L), and tested the anticancer activity of ligand-L in rat model of diethylnitrosamine induced hepatocellular carcinoma, including 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> suggested that ligand-L(25 μM) interacts with cellular copper and generates ROS which causes oxidative DNA damage and cell death of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments, ligand-L(250 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> body weight) significantly suppressed the progression of diethylnitrosamine -induced liver cancer by producing copper-ligand-L and thereby produces ROS, and showed not toxic to normal rat liver tissue. The 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> findings revealed that ligand-L shows a chemopreventive effect as it decreased levels of serum liver markers and alpha fetoprotein, and improved liver architecture (
