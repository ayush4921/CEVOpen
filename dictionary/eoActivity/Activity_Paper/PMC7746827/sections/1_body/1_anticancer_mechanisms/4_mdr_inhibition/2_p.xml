<p>Baghdadi (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) isolated six kinds of coumarin compounds (mansorin-A, mansorin-B, mansorin-C, mansorins-I, mansorin-II, and mansorin-III) from the heartwood of Mansonia gagei family Sterculariaceae, and detected the potential anticancer activities of these compounds against breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and liver cancer cells. Mansorin-II and mansorin-III showed the best inhibitory effects to these cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from 0.74 µM to 36 µM and 3.95 to 35.3 µM, respectively. In addition, mansorin-II can enhance the anticancer effect of taxol. This synergistic effect may be related to interfering with the efflux activity of P-gp pumps.
