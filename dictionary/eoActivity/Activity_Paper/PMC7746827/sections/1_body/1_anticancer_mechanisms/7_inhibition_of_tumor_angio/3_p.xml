<p>da Cruz evaluated the toxicity and antitumor mechanism of 7-isopentenyloxycoumarin (UMB-07) on Ehrlich ascites carcinoma model. The results showed that the LD50 value of UMB-07 was about 1000 mg/kg, and at the concentration of 50 mg/kg, UMB-07 had significant anti-tumor activity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that UMB-07 was a good candidate anti-tumor drug worthy of further study.Â The main antitumor mechanism of UMB-07 is the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis by reducing chemokine CCL2, and CCL2 is important to tumor neovascularization by inducing increased VEGF in tumor microenvironment. However, this coumarin also induced gastrointestinal toxicity and produced a reduction on nutrient absorption, which caused a reduction in the weight of animals and an increase on feed intake (
