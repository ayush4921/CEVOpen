<p>A series of coumarin derivatives incorporating different functional groups were synthesized and tested for their antiproliferative activity against breast cancer and prostate cancer cells. They all revealed more cytotoxic activity on breast cancer cells than the reference standard staurosporine (IC50 = 8.81 µM) with the IC50 values ranged from 1.24 to 8.68 µM. Eman further explored the antitumor mechanism of 2-(4-methyl-2-oxo-2H-chromen-7-yloxy)-N’-benzylacetohydrazide(4a), which is the most cytotoxic of all. 4a targeted VEGFR-2 and reduced its activity, thereby inhibiting tumor angiogenesis. 4a also induced preG1 apoptosis and prevented cell growth in G2/M phase and activated caspase-9. However, none of these derivatives showed significant cytotoxic activity on prostate cancer cells (
