<p>CA is a zinc-containing metal enzyme, catalyzing reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, maintaining pH inside and outside the cell, and transmembrane transport of ions, etc., and affecting a variety of metabolic activities (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). There are 16 different CA subtypes at least, among which CA I and CA II belong to a cytoplasmic enzyme and CA IX and CA XII belong to transmembrane protease. Tumor cells and their microenvironment are often hypoxic and increased glycolysis to meet increased metabolic needs, leading to a large accumulation of lactic acid. The expression of CA IX and CA XII in tumor cells is strongly induced by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF). The two types of carbonic anhydrase can catalyze the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide, convert it into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions, and expel hydrogen ions out of the cells to make the tumor cells maintain a slightly intracellular alkalinity and an extracellular acidity, which is conducive to the growth and spread of primary tumors and the development of drug resistance, leads to the formation of metastases (
