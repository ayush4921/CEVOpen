<p>In addition, Ferraroni (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) synthesized a series of Coumarins and corresponding 2-thioxocoumarines and tested their inhibitory activities to human carbonic anhydrase CA I, CA II, CA IX, and CA XII, and found that 7-[(1-Phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy]-2H-chromen-2-one (15) and 7-[(1-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy]-2H-chromene-2-thione (16) was the most effective and the selective inhibitors of CA IX and CA XII, with the Kis are comparable to or slightly lower than the standard sulfonamide AAZ. To explore the inhibitory mechanism of 2-thioxocoumarin to CA, Ferraroni (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) examined the X-ray crystal structure of 6-hydroxy-2-thioxocoumarin which bound to CA II and found that the inhibitory mechanism of 2-thioxocoumarin is quite different from other coumarins, which work as zinc binders or occlusion of the active site entrance, anchor to the metal-ion-coordinated water/hydroxide ion, or bind to outside of the active sites, then hydrolyzed by CA, finally form the corresponding 2- hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. However, the X-ray crystal structure of CA II- thioxocoumarin adducts showed that the exo-sulfur atom is anchored to the zinc-coordinated water molecule, whereas the scaffold establishing favorable contacts with the amino acid residues from the active sites.
