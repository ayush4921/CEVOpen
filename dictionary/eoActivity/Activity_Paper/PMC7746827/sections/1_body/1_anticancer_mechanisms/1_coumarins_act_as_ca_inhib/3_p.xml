<p>Some 1-aryl and 2-aryl-substituted Coumarin derivatives showed selective inhibitory activities to CA IX and CA XII (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Angapelly (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) synthesized a series of 4-sulfamoylphenyl/sulfocoumarin benzamides and evaluated their inhibitory effects on five subtypes of CA. They found that all these sulfocoumarin compounds are weak or invalid inhibitors for CA I and CA II, but can effectively inhibit tumor-related CA IX and CA XII in the high nanomolar to micromolar ranges.
