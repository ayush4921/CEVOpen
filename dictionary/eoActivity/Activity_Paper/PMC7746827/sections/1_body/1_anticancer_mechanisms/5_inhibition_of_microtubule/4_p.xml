<p>Dahong tested the anti-proliferative activity of Ferulin C against breast cancer cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, the furan coumarin core of Ferulin C is in contact with β-tubulin through colchicine binding sites, thereby inhibiting tubulin aggregation. Ferulin C could markedly suppress the tubulin polymerization with IC50 of 9.2 μM and Colchicine (IC50 = 1.8 μM) was used as the reference compound. Further research suggested that Ferulin C only affected the structure of microtubules and had not effect on the expression of tubulin. Ferulin C induced microtubule instability, and subsequently activated p21 and inhibited PAK1. In breast cancer cells, elevated expression of PAK1 indicated poor survival and p21 was associated with better survival. Ferulin C induced G1/S cell cycle arrest 
 <italic>via</italic> p21Cip1/Waf1-CDK2 signaling pathway. Dahong established a breast cancer cells xenograft model and evaluate antitumor activity of Ferulin C (low dose, 25 mg/kg; median dose, 50 mg/kg; high dose, 100 mg/kg) 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Ferulin C could significantly inhibit the growth of xenograft breast cancer cells and the antitumor mechanism was significantly consistent with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (
