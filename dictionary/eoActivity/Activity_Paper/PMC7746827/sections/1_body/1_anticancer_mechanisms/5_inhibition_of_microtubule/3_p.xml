<p>Zhu synthesized a class of 4-substituted coumarin H6 that has a strong ability to inhibit tumor cell proliferation with the IC50 range between 7 and 47 nM, and it also has a significant ability to inhibit tumor growth in paclitaxel-resistant tumor models. The mechanism is related to target colchicine binding site of Î²-tubulin. H6 is a powerful microtubule inhibitor. In order to solve its hydrophobicity limitation, Zhu prepared H6/MPEG2kPCL2k micelles by a simple thin-film hydration method, which significantly improve its solubility, reduce its toxicity and extend the half-life of the drug without affecting the anti-cancer property of this derivative (
