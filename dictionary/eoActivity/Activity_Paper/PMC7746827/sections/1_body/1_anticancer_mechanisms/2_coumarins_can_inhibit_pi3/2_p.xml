<p>Wang (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) synthesized 15 kinds of benzylsulfone coumarin derivatives (5a-5o) and found that 3-[(4-fluorobenzyl)sulfonyl]-6-nitro-2h-chromen-2-one (5h) and 6-bromo-3-[(4-fluorobenzyl)sulfonyl] -2h-chromen-2-one (5m) exibited the strongest inhibitory activities against PI3K, with inhibition rates of 50.3% and 50.8% at 20 μM respectively 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. In addition, 5h and 5m had broad-spectrum anti-tumor activities, with the IC50 values for 5 tumor cell lines (Hela, HepG2, H1299, hct-116, and McF-7) ranging from (18.1-32.6) μM and (29.3-42.1) μM, respectively. Moreover, 5h and 5m can appropriately embedded into the active sites of PI3Kα and PI3Kβ, and interact with important residues.
