<p>Dahong (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) isolated Ferulin C, a natural sesquiterpene coumarin, from Ferula ferulaeoides, and tested its anti-proliferative activity against breast cancer cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, by decreasing the expression and nuclear localization of p-AKTSer473, Ferulin C (20Î¼M) significantly inhibited the expression and phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream member mTOR, thus inducing autophagy of tumor cells.
