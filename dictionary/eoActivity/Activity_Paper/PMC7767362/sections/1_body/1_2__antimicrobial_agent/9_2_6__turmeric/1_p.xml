<p>Turmeric (
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>) is one of the herbal medicines used traditionally. It belongs to the 
 <italic>Zingiberaceae</italic> family. Due to the existence of curcumin (a polyphenolic compound), the extracts of turmeric have shown antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Therefore, the phenolic compound of curcumin is responsible for its antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B48-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The phytochemical structures in turmeric include vitamin C, cineole, tumerone, borneol, zingiberene, d-sabinene, and d-phellandrene. Many types of chemical compounds are found in turmeric including sesquiterpene Ketones, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpene alcohols (e.g., zingeberene). Fresh turmeric contains zingiberene, while the most significant curcuminoid presented in turmeric is curcumin. Previous literature has reported that turmeric has an antimicrobial (antibacterial and antifungal) effect [

 <xref rid="B142-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Curcumin is known for its inhibitory action on microorganisms such as 
 <italic>E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [

 <xref rid="B143-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. In numerous literature works, turmeric’s extracts have been shown to have strong antioxidant properties. The main active compound of turmeric (curcumin) shows strong radical scavenger activity. It can scavenge RNS (reactive nitrogen species) and ROS such as superoxide radicals, alkoxy radicals, peroxyl radicals, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, peroxynitrite, hydroxyl radicals, and nitricoxide by three active sites through the electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction [

 <xref rid="B145-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Curcumin also shows indirect antioxidant properties through a reduction process of numerous cytoprotective proteins including catalase, γ-glutamylcysteine ligase, glutathione S transferase, glutathione reductase, heme oxygenase 1, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase [

 <xref rid="B147-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Treatment with turmeric can reduce plasma malondialdehyde with increased glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase activity, and plasma albumin levels [
 <xref rid="B148-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. The aqueous and ethanol extracts of turmeric show significant antioxidant characteristics through the increase in antioxidant enzymes, scavenging different free radicals, and inhibiting lipid peroxidation [
 <xref rid="B149-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. Some in vivo studies on rats have demonstrated that turmeric inhibits hydrogen peroxide in cells by preventing lipid peroxidation [

 <xref rid="B151-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The different extracts of turmeric, such as chloroform, 
 <italic>n</italic>-butanol, ethyl acetate, and 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane, show strong antioxidant characteristics. Analyses have revealed a high correlation between the scavenging ability and the phenolic contents of these extracts [
 <xref rid="B152-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Furthermore, the ethanolic extract shows high antiradical activity in rats through increased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase [
 <xref rid="B153-antioxidants-09-01309" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. The research shows antiviral activity of this plant against HIV virus [
