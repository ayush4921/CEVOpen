<p>The sterilization process was carried out by collecting the nodal segments of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> from the healthy mother plants. The explants were placed under running tap water with an additional commercial detergent for 30 min to remove the soil debris and contaminants. Further sterilization of explants was conducted with 50% commercial bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) and shaken for 20 min. The explants were rinsed three times with sterile distilled water to remove all the disinfectants. Finally, the aseptic explants were excised into approximate sizes of 1 Â± 0.5 cm for the experiments (
