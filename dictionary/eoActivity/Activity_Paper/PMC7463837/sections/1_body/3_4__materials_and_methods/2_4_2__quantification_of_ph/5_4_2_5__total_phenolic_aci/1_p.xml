<p>The total phenolic acid content was conducted according to the method described by Singleton and Rossi [
 <xref rid="B45-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Briefly, 0.5 mL of extract, 4.5 mL of distilled water and 0.5 mL of Folin-Ciocalteu reagent were added and mixed thoroughly using a vortex machine. After 5 min, 5 mL of 7% sodium carbonate was added. The final volume of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 12.5 mL by the addition of 2 mL of distilled water. The reaction mixture was incubated for 90 min at room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 750 nm. The total phenolic acids content was calculated by a constructed standard curve of absorbance against different concentrations of gallic acid. The total phenolic acid content was expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent per gram dry weight of the sample (mg GAE/g DW).
