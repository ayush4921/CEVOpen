<p>The iron (II) chelating activity was carried out according to the method explained by Prieto et al. [
 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Briefly, 400 µL of the extract was mixed with 50 µL of 2 mM ferrous chloride. The reaction mixture was initiated by adding 200 µL of 5 mM of ferrozine and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured at 562 nm and the percentage of the iron (II) chelating activity was calculated by Chelating (%) = (1 − A562 Sample/A562 Control) × 100.
