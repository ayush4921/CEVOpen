<p>The total flavonoids content was determined using an aluminum chloride colorimetric method explained by Marinova et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. A total of 0.5 mL of extract was added into a test tube that contained 2 mL of distilled water. Then, 150 µL of 5% sodium nitrite was added and the mixture was incubated for 5 min. After the incubation, 150 µL of 10% aluminum chloride was added to the mixture. At the sixth minute, 1 mL of 1 M sodium hydroxide and 1.2 mL of distilled water were added and the mixture was incubated for 90 min at room temperature. The absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer at 510 nm. The standard curve of absorbance against different concentrations of rutin was constructed and the total flavonoids content of the extract was expressed as mg rutin equivalent per gram dry weight (mg RE/g DW).
