<p>The ABTS scavenging activity was conducted according to the method by Re et al. [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Prior to the experiment, 7 mM of ABTS stock was mixed with 2.45 mM potassium persulphate with a ratio of 1:1 and incubated for 16 h in the dark at room temperature. After the incubation, the ABTS+ solution was diluted with methanol and the absorbance was adjusted to 0.700 Â± 0.05 at 734 nm. Then, 0.1 mL of extract was mixed with 0.9 mL of diluted ABTS+. The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature and the absorbance was taken at 734 nm. The standard curve of absorbance against different concentrations of trolox was constructed and the ABTS value was expressed as mg trolox equivalent per gram dry weight (mg TE/g DW).
