<p>The superoxide anion radical scavenging activity is based on the reduction in nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) in the presence of nicotamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and phenazine methosulphate (PMS). Briefly, 0.25 mL of 0.3 mM of NBT, 0.25 mL of 0.936 mM of NADH, 0.5 mL of extract and 0.5 mL of 16 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) were mixed. The reaction was initiated by adding 0.25 mL of 0.12 mM PMS and incubated for 5 min at a temperature of 25 °C. The control was prepared without the addition of extract. The absorbance was measured at 560 nm and the percentage of inhibition was calculated by Inhibition (%) = (1 − A560 Sample/A560 Control) × 100 [
