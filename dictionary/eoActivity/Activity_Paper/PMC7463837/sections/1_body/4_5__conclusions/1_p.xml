<p>In the present study, different plant growth factors, including plant growth regulators, basal medium strength and sucrose concentration, were used to determine the most suitable formulation for a plant tissue culture of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic>. The study reported that the full-strength MS basal medium supplemented with 12 µM BAP and 30 g/L sucrose exhibited the best result in terms of a high percentage of shoot regeneration, number of shoots, length of shoots, number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves. In the next experiment, the phenolics content and antioxidant activities were quantified using 25 and 100 °C temperatures. The study found that tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 100 °C was more prominent by exhibiting higher total polyphenols (2.77 mg GAE/g DW), total phenolic acids (4.29 mg GAE/g DW), total flavonoids (21.76 mg RE/g DW), DPPH free radical scavenging activity (3.20 mg TE/g DW), ABTS scavenging activity (1.50 mg TE/g DW), FRAP assay (9.76 mg TE/g DW) and superoxide anion radical scavenging activity (53.74% inhibition). Meanwhile, the highest iron (II) chelating activity was recorded from conventionally propagated leaves extracted at 25 °C with 69.24% inhibition. Based on the results obtained, 100 °C was found to be the most suitable extraction temperature for the dried tissue-cultured leaves of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic>. This study successfully established a protocol for the propagation of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> via a plant tissue culture study. Besides that, this present study also proved that tissue-cultured plants were able to produce high phenolic contents and antioxidant activities. Hence, these findings may contribute to the production of raw materials of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> to fulfill the demand in the pharmaceutical industry.
