<p>In the present study, the propagation technique (tissue culture and conventional propagation) and the effects of aqueous temperatures (25 and 100 °C) on the extraction of phenolics contents and antioxidant activities were studied. Based on the total polyphenols, total phenolic acids and total flavonoids contents measured, tissue-cultured leaves significantly produced higher values on all the parameters under study compared to the conventionally propagated leaves. The extractions at 100 °C recorded a higher amount of total polyphenols, total phenolic acids and total flavonoids from both sources of leaves compared to extractions at 25 °C. Pandey et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] conducted a study on 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>, comparing the leaves of the tissue-cultured plant and conventionally propagated mother plants. They found that the leaves of tissue-cultured plants significantly produced higher total phenolics, flavonoids and tannins contents than the leaves of the mother plant. In another study comparing the field-grown and tissue-cultured plants of 
 <italic>Lavandula angustifolia</italic> var., Ellagance Blue, Blue River and Munstead found that tissue-cultured plants of all three varieties exhibited a higher total polyphenols content compared to field-grown plants [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported a similar finding on mother and tissue-cultured plants of 
 <italic>Nardostachys jatamansi</italic> extracted with different extraction solvents including methanol, acetone, chloroform, acetonitrile and water. Their results showed that the leaves of tissue-cultured plants significantly produced higher total phenolics, flavonoids, alkaloids and tannins contents in all the extraction solvents tested. The variations in phenolics content could be due to different extraction processes such as different extraction temperatures and different sources of plants. The concentration of secondary metabolites in plants could be affected by hormonal contents as well as endogenous physiological changes in the plants. According to Umebese and Falana [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the accumulation of the phenolics content is generally low when plants are grown under nonstress conditions. The accumulation of phenolics increases when plants are exposed to stress conditions.
