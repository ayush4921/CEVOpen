<p>In this present study, the optimum basal medium formulation by the alteration of plant growth regulators, basal medium strength and sucrose concentration for the in vitro propagation of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> were established. In plant tissue culture, plant growth regulators are one of the most important factors affecting the growth of explants. In a single node culture of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic>, the shoot induction was affected by the application of cytokinin in the culture medium. The synthesis of cytokinin in plants becomes limited due to injury when plant parts are excised into smaller sizes [

In the present study, 12 ÂµM BAP was more favorable than other cytokinins in the initial stage of the shoot induction of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic>. A study on 
 <italic>Justicia gendarussa</italic> (Acanthaceae) showed that the supplementation of BAP in an MS basal medium exhibited the highest percentage of shoot induction, number of shoots and shoot length, compared to a basal medium supplemented with kinetin and thidiazuron (TDZ) [

 <italic>Andrographis paniculate</italic>, which belong to the same family as 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> and 
 <italic>J. gendarussa</italic>, also recorded that the application of BAP was able to produce a higher percentage of shoot regeneration and number of shoots [
