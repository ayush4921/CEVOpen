<p>The results in the present study on the phenolics content and antioxidant activities recorded that aqueous temperature of 100 °C was more prominent in producing a higher phenolic content and antioxidant activities compared to the aqueous temperature of 25 °C. The results showed that the coefficient of diffusion and phenolic contents solubility increased as the aqueous temperature was increased. An increased solubility of phenolic contents by a higher temperature favors the release of bound phenolics in samples with cellular constituents of the plant cell breakdown which leads to an increase in the cell membrane permeability [
