<p>Generally, natural products are the most preferred source of antioxidants in disease prevention than synthetic antioxidants due to them having few side effects. The demand for the raw material of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> has led to the over-harvesting of the wild species which has significantly reduced their availability in nature [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-09-01030" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence, a biotechnological approach in the propagation of the plant through an in vitro technique is perceived as an alternative method for the large-scale production of the raw materials in a shorter time. Plant growth regulators, the basal medium strength and sucrose concentration largely influence the success of an in vitro technique for plant propagation. Through this technique, the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities are also known to be affected. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of plant growth regulators, basal medium strength and sucrose concentrations of in vitro culture of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> with the aim of optimizing the basal medium for the mass propagation of plants. The study also was conducted to analyze the phenolic contents and antioxidant activities between the leaves of tissue-cultured and conventionally propagated 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> as affected by different aqueous extraction temperatures.
