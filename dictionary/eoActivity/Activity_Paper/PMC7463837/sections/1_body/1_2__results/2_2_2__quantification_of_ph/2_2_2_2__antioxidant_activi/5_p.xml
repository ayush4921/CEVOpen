<p>Antioxidants, besides acting as scavengers of free radicals, also act as chelators of metal ions such as copper (II) and iron (II). In contrast with other antioxidant activities, the highest was recorded from the tissue-cultured leaf extracts. The highest iron (II) chelating activity was produced from the conventionally propagated leaf extracts. Based on the results in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t007" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref>, the highest percentage for the iron (II) chelating activity was significantly exhibited from the conventionally propagated leaves extracted at 25 °C with 69.24% inhibition. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference between the tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 25 and 100 °C and the conventionally propagated leaves extracted at 100 °C, with the iron (II) chelating activity recorded at 54.33, 53.50 and 51.33% inhibition, respectively.
