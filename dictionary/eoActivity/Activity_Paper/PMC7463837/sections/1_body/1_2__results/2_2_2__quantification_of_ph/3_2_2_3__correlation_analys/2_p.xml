<p>The results show that all variables, except the iron (II) chelating activity, were positively correlated. The variables for the total polyphenols, phenolic acids, flavonoids, DPPH free radical scavenging activity, FRAP assay and ABTS scavenging activity exhibited a high correlation between the variables measured with 
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.70. For the superoxide anion radical scavenging activity, a significant correlation was recorded against all variables except the DPPH free radical scavenging activity and ABTS scavenging activity. Meanwhile, the iron (II) chelating activity showed a nonsignificant correlation against all variables except the superoxide anion radical scavenging activity. Pearsonâ€™s correlation analyses confirmed that the phenolics contents in the 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> leaf extracts acted as good scavenging agents but not as a chelating agents.
