<p>Based on 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>, the FRAP value recorded in the tissue-cultured leaf extract was significantly higher than the conventionally propagated leaf extract. The FRAP value recorded was significantly affected by both factors (sources of leaves and aqueous temperature). The highest FRAP value from tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 100 째C was 9.76 mg TE/g DW. The second highest FRAP value from tissue-cultured leaves extracted at 25 째C was 7.13 mg TE/g DW. The conventionally propagated leaves extracted at 100 째C recorded a higher FRAP value with 5.31 mg TE/g DW compared to the 25 째C extraction, which had a value of 4.27 mg TE/g DW.
