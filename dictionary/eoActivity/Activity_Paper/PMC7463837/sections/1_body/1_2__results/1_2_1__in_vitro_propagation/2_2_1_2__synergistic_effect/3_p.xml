<p>Synergistic effects between cytokinins and auxins also affected the number of leaves and fresh weight of leaves. The control treatment recorded the highest number of leaves (7.34 leaves) and fresh weight of leaves (21.57 mg), while the lowest was recorded from the treatment medium supplemented with 8 µM IBA with 0.89 leaves and 1.33 mg fresh weight of leaves. The addition of auxins in the basal medium of culture is known to be widely used for the induction of either the roots or callus. In the present study, the formation of callus was observed in all treatments including the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01030-f001">Figure 1</xref>d). The treatment with 8 µM IBA accumulated the highest amount of callus with 69.00 mg. The lowest amount of callus was observed in the control treatment with 10.00 mg, implying that endogenous auxin had stimulated callus formation. Hence, the addition of exogenous auxin in the basal medium facilitated the formation of callus. The formation of callus at the base of the explants could have absorbed nutrients from the medium causing an interruption of nutrient absorption and stunting the growth of explants. In addition, root induction was also inhibited due to an excessive amount of callus formation.
