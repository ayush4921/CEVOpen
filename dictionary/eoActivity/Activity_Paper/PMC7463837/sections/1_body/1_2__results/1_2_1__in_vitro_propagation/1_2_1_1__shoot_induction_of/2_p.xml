<p>The number and length of shoots of 
 <italic>C. nutans</italic> were significantly affected by the inclusion of various concentrations of cytokinins in the culture medium. The highest number of shoots was produced in treatment with 8 µM kinetin, with a total of 1.57 shoots. The longest shoot was recorded from a medium supplemented with 12 µM BAP, with a length of 2.29 cm. Compared with all other treatments, only the treatment with 12 µM BAP was able to produce a shoot length of more than 2.00 cm. In the measured parameters, MS0 produced the lowest number of shoots (1.00 shoot) and the shortest shoot length (1.41 cm). In terms of yield production, the highest number and fresh weight of leaves were recorded from a treatment with 12 µM BAP yielding 4.78 leaves and 16.00 mg, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-01030-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). The fresh weight of leaves for the MS basal medium supplemented with various other concentrations of BAP increased gradually until the 12 µM BAP treatment. The fresh weight of leaves decreased two-fold in the 16 µM BAP concentration. A similar trend was also observed for the MS basal medium supplemented with various concentrations of kinetin. The fresh weight of leaves gradually increased until it reached a peak at 12 µM kinetin before dropping off.
