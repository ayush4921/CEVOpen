<p>Based on the results in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01030-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, the explants were able to achieve 100% shoot regeneration for sucrose concentrations of 20 to 35 g/L. A sucrose concentration higher than 35 g/L resulted in a decrease in the percentage of shoot regeneration. The lowest shoot regeneration was obtained from the highest sucrose concentration (50 g/L) with 33.33% regeneration. The highest number of shoots was recorded from sucrose concentrations of 30 and 35 g/L (1.67 shoots). However, the concentration of 30 g/L significantly produced the longest shoot (3.23 cm). The maximum number of leaves (8.0 leaves) was obtained from a treatment with 25 g/L sucrose. However, the number of leaves produced from the treatment was not significantly different from the treatment at 30 g/L (7.33 leaves). The highest number of leaves did not reflect the fresh weight of leaves obtained. The highest fresh weight of leaves was recorded from the treatment of 30 g/L sucrose, with a weight of 21.67 mg. Meanwhile, sucrose at a concentration of 25 g/L recorded a fresh weight of 14.67 mg. Although the sucrose concentration of 25 g/L recorded the highest number of leaves, the leaves produced were smaller than that of the sucrose concentration at 30 g/L. Among all the sucrose concentrations tested, the concentration of 50 g/L was least preferred in terms of the percentage of shoot regeneration (33.33%), number of shoots (0.33 shoots), length of shoots (1.18 cm), number of leaves (0.90 leaves) and fresh weight of leaves (0.68 mg).
