 <italic>Dorema ammoniacum</italic> commonly known as “Ushaq” or “Vasha” is one of the most important industrial and medicinal plants of Iran which has been used in ethnobotanical since ancient times. It is endangered due to superfluous and unsustainable harvesting methods [

 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. 
 <italic>Dorema glabrum</italic> is another endangered species that grows in loamy or rocky slopes of Nakhichevan, Autonomous Republic- Azerbaijan, Armenia and Iran [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The plant has immense applications as an herbal remedy or food additive in these regions. Over harvesting from wild populations and destructive collecting methods, are considered as serious threats that often lead to disappearance of these taxa, and must be avoided. There is an urgent need for conservation priorities and management strategies for all taxa assigned to a threat category through seed and gene banking, and planting in botanical gardens. Otherwise, we will lose these natural treasures within the next few decades.
