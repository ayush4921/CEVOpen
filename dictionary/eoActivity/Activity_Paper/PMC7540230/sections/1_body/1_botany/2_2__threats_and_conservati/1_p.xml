<p>The genus 
 <italic>Dorema</italic>, contains monocarpic perennial species, so that only once produces flowers during the life cycle and only reproduces through seeds. These plants are potentially endangered and vulnerable taxa [
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Some of these taxa such as 
 <italic>D. aucheri</italic> are narrow-range endemics which occur only in a few specialized niches. 
 <italic>D. aucheri</italic> is considered as a unique endemic species which is intensively collected. Overexploitation of this plant has caused a significant decrease in its population in the area [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, some others are sub-endemics with threatened species including 
 <italic>D. ammoniacum</italic>, and 
 <italic>D. kopetdaghense</italic>. Today, 
 <italic>D. kopetdaghense</italic> is also considered as endangered in the IUCN Red List of threatened Species [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It has been used in traditional medicine from ancient times [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].
