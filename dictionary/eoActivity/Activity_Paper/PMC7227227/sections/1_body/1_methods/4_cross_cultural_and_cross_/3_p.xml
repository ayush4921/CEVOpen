<p id="Par26">The dichotomy between Pathan and non-Pathan peoples has been an important trajectory in the cultural history of Pakistan. Pashto speaking people are referred to as 
 <italic>Pathans</italic> in Pakistan, while they are mainly known also as 
 <italic>Pashtuns</italic> or 
 <italic>Afghans</italic> in the international literature. Pashto has been classified as an Eastern Iranian language which, according to MacKenzie [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], derived from the Aryan family of languages that “divided into its distinct Indian and Iranian branches more than three millennia ago.” In Pakistan, Pashto is spoken in the North Western districts. It is also spoken in Northeastern Baluchistan, and in Punjab it is still spoken in border areas of Mianwali and Attock. Additionally, the whole tribal area between Pakistan and Afghanistan is Pashto-speaking. Pashto is also one of the two most used official languages of Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, the Pashto-speaking area is in the East, South, and Southwest [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The traditional life style of Pathans is encapsulated in 
 <italic>Pakhtunwali</italic>, an orally transmitted customary code that includes vengeance (
 <italic>Badal</italic>), hospitality (
 <italic>Melmastia</italic>), and forgiveness (
 <italic>Nanawati</italic>), which has been remarkably described by the Norwegian anthropologist Fredrick Barth (1928-2016) [
