<p id="Par25">To compile the data systematically, an MS Excel spreadsheet was used in which the botanical names of plants, botanical families, parts used, mode of preparation and administration, and disease treated were recorded. The scientific names of the reported taxa were updated using The Plant List database [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Data was arranged in tabulated form. To deal with possible gaps in the selected ethnoveterinary studies, a separate table (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]) was created, presenting information about the local names of plants, voucher specimen numbers, description of the study area, language, and typology of the study participants in the selected studies. For cross-cultural and cross-regional analysis of reported medicinal taxa and their uses, the extracted data was tabulated, sorted, and organized in MS Excel, and then the results were displayed using Venn diagrams.
