<p id="Par53">Cross-cultural comparative assessment indicated that approximately only one-third (134 plants; 28.3%) of the 474 medicinal plants were commonly used by both Pathans and non-Pathans (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Moreover, we considered the medicinal plants quoted by both Pathans and non-Pathans for further comparison in terms of their 
 <italic>use reports</italic> and we found 101 (8%), out of 1205 total, which were shared by both groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This figure demonstrates that veterinary plants which are used by both groups are prepared and used in very different ways. The small overlap of the aforementioned use reports may suggest that detailed practices and experiences of local communities with their plants are largely divergent. The pattern of the above results might be also related to the epidemiological issues which cannot be ignored as every region has particular socio-environmental conditions which may affect the prevalence of specific animal diseases leading to certain medicinal plant uses instead of others.
