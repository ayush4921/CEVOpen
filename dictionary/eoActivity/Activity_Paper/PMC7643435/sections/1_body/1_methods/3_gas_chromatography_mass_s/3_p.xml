<p id="Par26">The final identification of the major compounds was done on the comparative chromatographic analysis of standard samples under similar conditions as described above. However, identification of several compounds was tentative due to non availability of their standards. Each compound present in CKEO was quantified approximately on the basis of its relative peak area obtained after GC/MS analysis. The GC/MS analyses were performed three times and mean values of relative peak areas were presented.</p>
