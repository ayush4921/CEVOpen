 <italic>E. coli</italic> was found to be highly susceptible to CKEO with MBC of 20 μg/mL. The essential oil from 
 <italic>C. nardus</italic> inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at much lower MIC (0.488 μg/mL) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Bassole et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] reported antimicrobial activity of EO of 
 <italic>C. citratus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. giganteus.</italic> Their MICs ranged between 2.1–80 mg/mL against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli, P. aeruginosa,</italic> and 
 <italic>S. typhimurium.</italic> Adinarayana et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] also observed growth inhibition of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> with the use 
 <italic>C. flexuosus</italic> EO at a MIC of 250.5 μg/mL and 257.3 μg/mL respectively. Against 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> he reported MIC 294.5 μg/mL, which was higher than the present study. Sonboli et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], reported the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of 
 <italic>C. oliveri</italic> with MIC of 3.75 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL against 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. albicans,</italic> respectively. Results suggested a high variation in antimicrobial activity of different species of the same genus might be due to the change in oil composition of the same/different species belonging to the different eco-geographical regions.
