<p id="Par34">Bacterial cells were grown up to mid-logarithmic phase as described above in antimicrobial assay and treated with MIC values of test compounds (CKEO/streptomycin alone and their combination). After the treatment of 
 <italic>E. coli,</italic> the protein content in the extracellular medium was examined through colorimetric assay using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. The 96 well plate was kept in BOD set at 37 °C for 30 min, and absorbance was checked at 562 nm using a microtiter plate reader. The standard calibration curve was prepared using the bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein solutions (0–2 mg/mL) and used for calculating the protein content present in bacterial cell-extracellular medium with and without exposure of test compounds.
