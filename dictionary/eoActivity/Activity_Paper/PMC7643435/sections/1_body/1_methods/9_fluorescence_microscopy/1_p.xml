<p id="Par33">To assess the effect of EO/antibiotic alone and in combination on bacterial membrane integrity, the double dye staining method was employed using DAPI (4′, 6 diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochlorides) and PI (propidium iodide) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. DAPI is a cell-permeable dye, which binds with A-T base pairs of double-stranded DNA and allows for powerful fluorescence signals, whereas PI is cell impermeable and only penetrates dead cells. The 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown up to mid-logarithmic phase and treated with streptomycin/EO alone and in their combination (at the 2x-MIC concentration) for 2 h at 37 °C. They were centrifuged at 5000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was removed. Pelleted cells were washed with sterile PBS solution then incubated with DAPI (10 μg/mL) and PI (5 μg/mL) respectively for 15–15 min at 0 °C in dark. After the dye treatment, cells were washed with phosphate buffer to remove excess stain. The cells without any antimicrobial agents were designated as control. Treated cells were observed under inverted microscope and their images were captured with the attached digital camera (Olympus Imaging Corp., Centre Valley, PA, USA).
