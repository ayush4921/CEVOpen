<p>The fresh leaves of 
 <italic>A. trifoliatus</italic> were collected from Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Guangzhou, China, N23.1459, E113.3498). The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C refrigerator until use at Key Laboratory for Crops Genetic Improvement of Guangdong in Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences (specimen code LC2020). Total genomic DNA was extracted using plant genomic DNA kit (Omega, Norcross, GA) and then constructed DNA library with average insert size 350-bp using VAHTS Universal DNA Library Prep Kit (Vazyme ND606-01, Nanjing, China). Finally, the library was sequenced on the Novaseq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) following as recommended by the manufacturer. The sequence was assembled by the GetOrganelle (Jin et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and annotated with the Geseq (Tillich et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) using the cp annotation of 
 <italic>Fatsia japonica</italic> (NC_027685) as a reference. Then, the chloroplast genome sequence was submitted to GenBank with the accession number MT754220.
