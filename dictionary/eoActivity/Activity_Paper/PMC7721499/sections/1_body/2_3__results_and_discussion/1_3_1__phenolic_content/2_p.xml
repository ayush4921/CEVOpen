<p>In this study, we used Amberlite to improve the content of phenolic compounds in separating fractions. Our results confirm the efficacy of this type of column to achieve enrich fraction from waste water. For instance, our results showed phenolic content (phenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin) of the fraction (after loading on column) was amplified considerably compared with waste water (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Using the XAD-7 Amberlite in the extraction process as the stationary phase would be able to separate nonpolar compounds from the extract and increase the concentrations of phenolic compounds. These results are consistent with the data of the previous study, which explains that this type of column increases the phenolic content of 
 <italic>Berberis integerrima</italic> fraction. It can be related to the capacity of this column to interact with nonpolar/moderate polar phenolic compounds with intense hydrogen bonds between the ester groups on the column surfaces and hydroxyl groups of these compounds.
