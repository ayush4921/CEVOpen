<p>In cytotoxicity assay, HepG2 cells were exposing to different concentrations of fraction for 24 and 48 h. There is significant toxicity at a concentration of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml and higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in this cell line. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of fraction for 24 h and 48 h incubation were 248.145 ± 35.56 and 227.14 ± 16.51 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml, respectively. Wedler et al. reported that rose oil distillation waste water had dose-dependent antiproliferative activity on HaCaT cells. The reported IC
