<p>In this study, the polyphenol-rich fraction was isolated from 
 <italic>R. damascena</italic> waste waters by Amberlite column as the stationary phase. The phenolic compound content and antioxidant activity of byproduct is compared before and after using the column to realize the efficacy of these types of column to concentrate active compounds. Furthermore, XO inhibition and protective effects against DNA damage induced by H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> on isolated human lymphocytes of the fraction were measured to determine the biological activity of separated fraction.
