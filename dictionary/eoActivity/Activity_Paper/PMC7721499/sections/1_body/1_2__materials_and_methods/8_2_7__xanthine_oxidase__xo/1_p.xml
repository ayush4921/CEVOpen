<p>The inhibition effects of the sample on XO activity were done according to the kit protocol. (Xanthine oxidase activity kit, Sigma-Aldrich). The xanthine oxidase activity of the sample and vitamin C at 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml concentration were measured. XO inhibitory activity was evaluated by the following formula:
