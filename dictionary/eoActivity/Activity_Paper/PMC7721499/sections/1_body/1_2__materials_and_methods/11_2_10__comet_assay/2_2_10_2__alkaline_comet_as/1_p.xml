<p>The alkaline comet assay was performed according to the guidelines of Singh et al. with some modifications [

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>M) simultaneously (20 min in the dark at 4°C) to inhibit DNA repair followed by the induced oxidative DNA damage. H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution in PBS was used as a positive control. The cells were harvested and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and then washed with PBS. The cell pellets were mixed with 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of low melting point agarose (0.75% w/v), then spread on a microscopic slide precoated with normal melting agarose (1%), covered with a coverslip, and kept for 10 min at 4°C. After removing the coverslips, the slides were immersed in freshly prepared cold lysing solution (2.5 M NaCl, 100 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>EDTA, 10 mM tris, 1% (v/v) triton X-100, 10% DMSO, pH 10.0) at 4°C for at least 2 h. The slides were presoaked in freshly prepared alkaline electrophoresis buffer for 30 min. Electrophoresis was carried out (45 min at 4°C). All procedural steps were performed under yellow light conditions to minimize additional DNA damage. Then, slides were placed vertically in a neutralizing tank and washed with a neutralizing solution (0.4 m tris HCl buffer, pH 7.5). Lastly, the slides were stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) (20 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) dispensed directly onto the slides and covered with a coverslip. The slides were studied by a fluorescent microscope (Olympus-BX61). All experiments were performed at least three times. For each slide, 50 selected cells were analyzed with CometScore software.
