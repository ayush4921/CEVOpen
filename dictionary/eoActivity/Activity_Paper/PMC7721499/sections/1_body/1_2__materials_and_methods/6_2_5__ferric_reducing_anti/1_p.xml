<p>The FRAP reagent contains TPTZ solution (2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine) (10 mM in HCl), FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (20 mM in H
 <sub>2</sub>O), and acetate buffer (300 mM, pH = 3.6). The fresh mixture was prepared and incubated at 37°C (10 min). Subsequently, 180 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of FRAP reagent and 20 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each sample were mixed. Finally, the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at 593 nm after incubation at 37°C for 10 min. The concentration ranges of samples and standard were 12.5–3200 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml. Results were reported as IC
 <sub>50</sub> [
