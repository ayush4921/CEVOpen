<p id="Par10">Recent studies conducted in Georgia (Sakartvelo) reveal a noteworthy ethnobotanical knowledge of people living in various regions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the book “Ethnobotany of the Caucasus” presents detailed information on about culturally salient 130 plant species currently and historically noted in the South Caucasus (Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan) [

However, apart from a number of ethnobotanical studies published in certain parts of the Western Lesser Caucasus region, little ethnobotanical knowledge has yet been systematically documented in the mountains around Turkey-Georgia border. For instance in Turkey, two general surveys conducted in some parts of Artvin province report the medicinal ethnobotany of 20 plant species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Folk knowledge of 18 medicinal plant species were reported around the Göle and Çıldır districts of Ardahan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. On the Georgian side, medicinal folk knowledge of at least 27 rare and endangered medicinal plants were recorded for the Samtskhe-Javakheti region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, around 40 medicinal plant species were listed in a systematic ethnobotanical study in Samtskhe-Javakheti region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A study of folk usage of medicinal plants in Adjara reported knowledge relating to 194 plant taxa [
