<p id="Par30">Thirdly, the medicinally valuable plants were quantified and compared in function of most salient plant families, genera, species, as well as their plant parts, medicinal use, preparation, and application methods across the border. The following indices were used to evaluate the relative cultural significance, versatility of species and consensus on medicinal use and knowledge on the both sides of the border.

   <p id="Par31">The Cultural Importance index (CI): A widely used index in ethnobotanical studies (e.g., [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]), it is known to produce reliable results in assessing the relative cultural significance of each plant species while comparing different regions with different participant numbers [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. This is known to be effective not only in presenting the spread of use (number of participants) but also to highlight the diversity of uses (versatility) for certain plant species in cross-cultural ethnobotanical studies [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].
