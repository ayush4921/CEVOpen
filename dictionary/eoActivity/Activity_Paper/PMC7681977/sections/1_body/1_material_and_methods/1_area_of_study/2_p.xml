<p id="Par16">Between 1300 BCE and 580 ADE, the area fell within the kingdoms of Colchis, Diauehi, and Iberia. The region witnessed various wars, migrations, and deportations and several kingdoms, empires, principalities, and countries succeeded until the current day. The variety of ethnolinguistic groups inhabiting the area include Turks, Georgians, Armenians, Kurds, Azeris, Laz people, Hemshins, and Russians, with small-scale agriculture and relatively large-scale livestock farming as the main economic activities. Nearly all participants in this study were transhumant, maintaining an agro-pastoral way of life. Highland pastures, referred to as “
 <italic>yayla</italic>” in Turkey, are known as “
 <italic>mta</italic>” and/or “ialagi” (iala) in Georgia. People move to their summer pastures at the end of May, where for 3 to 5 months they live mainly in wooden houses, some living in dry stone dwellings or even in tents.
