<p id="Par21">The research team was composed of three or four people. The first (female) and second (male) authors were always involved in the interviews, with a translator—either male or female. Throughout the study, the first author was always the principal interviewer. In Turkey, the interviews were conducted directly in the Turkish language, while in Georgia, interviews were in Georgian, Russian, or Turkish. The majority of the interviews in Georgia were performed with the help of translators who spoke Georgian, Russian, and English, either as a mother tongue or as a second language. Interviews were later translated into English. Two weeks before the fieldwork, the translators were provided with information and terminology relevant to the research. Information relating to the purpose of the study was given to all participants and their free, prior informed consent—for interviewing, recording, photographing, and/or publishing their knowledge—obtained orally from each at the beginning of their interviews. All interviews conformed to the International Society of Ethnobiology’s Code of Ethics [
