<p id="Par23">Initially, participants were asked to discuss points about wild plants that immediately came to mind (~ 15 min). Then they were shown fresh plants and asked to identify the vernacular names and usage of the plants (~ 45 min). Depending on the weather and participants’ willingness, a “walk around the house” was undertaken to observe wild plants in the proximity (~ 15 min). To confirm previous information and to gain further learning about various plants, participants were shown an illustrated plant catalog, including 400 plant species from the flora of the region (~ 45 min.). Certain participants were visited a second time to complete the first interview or to confirm information.</p>
