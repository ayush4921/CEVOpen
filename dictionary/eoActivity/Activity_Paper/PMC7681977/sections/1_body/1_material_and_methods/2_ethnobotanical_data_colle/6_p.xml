<p id="Par22">A snowball technique was used to find participants who held significant traditional knowledge regarding wild plants and their usage. The majority of the participants were elderly transhumant people. Each was interviewed individually, for an average of 2 h, with semi-structured questionnaires. Usually, the person’s relatives and neighbors also contributed to the interview. The first author took notes directly in a notebook during all interviews. Depending on participants’ wishes, audio or video recordings were made of the interviews. Information about plants collected from the wild was documented, specifically with data regarding (1) their folk names in different languages and dialects, (2) collection time and place, (3) parts used for medicinal purposes, (4) processes of preparation and administration, and (5) source of the plant knowledge. In addition, observations were made and photos taken in byres, cellars, and other relevant places whenever possible so as to document unmentioned uses and also observe living ethnobotanical practices.</p>
