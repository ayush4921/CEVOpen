<p id="Par79">The results of this study indicate that, due to combinations of high plant diversity, multicultural and multi-linguistic nature of the study area, the richness of traditional plant wisdom, unique knowledge, and depth of botanical understanding of people are reflected in the number of plant species they know, with their diverse folk plant names as well as methods of harvesting, preparing, and using these plants. Thus, this study area still maintains clear medicinal knowledge and practices regarding wild plants. Indeed, more than half of the distinct ethnomedicinal usage of wild plants documented in this study have not been reported in the Caucasus literature before. The majority of this plant knowledge is still present, partly in use or at least harbored in memories. However, especially in Turkey, many of the reported uses are no longer implemented in practice, only remaining in the memory of elders who still maintain their traditional agro-pastoral transhumant lifestyles.</p>
