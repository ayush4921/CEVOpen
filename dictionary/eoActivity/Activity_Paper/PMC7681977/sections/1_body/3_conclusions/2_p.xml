<p id="Par80">What is striking is the fact that, despite environmental and floral similarity, common historical/cultural contact, and similar livelihood strategies, at the present time, shared ethnomedicinal knowledge/use across the border is unexpectedly low, forming less than 10% of the reported ethnomedicinal use incidences. It seems that patterns of medicinal knowledge in the study area are connected with multiple cultural factors, in particular ethnolinguistic diversity, cultural background, and access to multilingual written folk and scientific literature. These factors are shown to be variable among species. Due to its complex nature, while a generalized definite conclusion cannot be drawn, access to multilingual literary sources seems to be one of the most relevant driving forces to account for the medical plant knowledge patterns in the study area. To better understand the underlying factors and driving reasons for the shared and separate plant knowledge among different communities on both sides of this international border, future studies should consider cultural diversity (language, ethnicity), socio-economic conditions, as well as the political histories of each community. Restricting the comparison unit to a single plant genus, with structured questions may provide a more rigorous approach to the evaluation of patterns and dynamics of ethnobotanical knowledge. Most importantly, to identify factors that shape medicinal plant knowledge in such a multicultural area, strong collaboration between local people, botanists, ethnologists, ecologists, pharmacologists, linguists, anthropologists, and sociologists is essential for future research in the field of ethnobotany.</p>
