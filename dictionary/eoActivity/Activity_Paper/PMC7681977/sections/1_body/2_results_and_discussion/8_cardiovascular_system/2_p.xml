<p id="Par66">In Turkey, 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> spp., in particular, 
 <italic>R. canina</italic> (4 UR) and 
 <italic>R. spinosissima</italic> (7 UR), are the most important species used against hemorrhoids. Fruits of 
 <italic>R. canina</italic> and roots of 
 <italic>R. spinosissima</italic> (occasionally their fruits) are widely known/used for hemorrhoids by participants in Turkey. A review related to plants used to treat hemorrhoids identified 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> as most frequently used species in Turkey, while 
 <italic>Rosa spinosissima</italic> (syn. 
 <italic>R. pimpinellifolia</italic>) was mentioned in only one study conducted in Erzurum in 1999â€“2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] in which only fruits, not roots, were reported to be used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Later research did report the use of roots [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and several other studies mentioned the use of fruits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The use of fruits and/or roots together to treat hemorrhoids was also reported as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However, in this particular fieldwork in Georgia, among 
 <italic>Rosa</italic> spp., only 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> (2 UR) was mentioned for hemorrhoids. Furthermore, neither 
 <italic>R. spinosissima</italic> nor 
 <italic>R. canina</italic> was mentioned for hemorrhoids in the sources from Georgia, Azerbaijan, or Armenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. 
 <italic>Gentiana</italic> spp. (9 UR) are widely recorded second species in Turkey for hemorrhoids.
