 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> reflects similarities and differences seen between information reported in this study and reports from 26 main literature sources related to folk knowledge of medicinal plants from the Caucasus Ecoregion, mainly North-Eastern and Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey and Georgia, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, including literature from Soviet period. Of this study’s 817 distinct species-use combinations based on medicinal sub-categories (asthma, ulcer, wound healing, etc.), only 275 of them are similar with those in the above mentioned literature reports. This means that around 66% of this study’s use reports (as a species-medicinal subcategory combination) have not been mentioned specifically in these items of literature. Even, when comparisons are based on medicinal use categories, out of 490 species use combinations, only 276 of them are similar and around 44% of these use reports also have not been mentioned in these literature sources.
