<p id="Par56">As stated previously, skin ailments are the most important category in Turkey (CI 2.61, FIC 0.76) comprising 29% of URs, while being the second category in Georgia (CI 3.62, FIC 0.73), with 19% of the URs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Fifty-six percent of the URs mentioned by participants in Turkey are related to wound and boil. While Plantago major is the most important plant for boil treatment, 
 <italic>Picea orientalis and</italic> Plantago major are the most important plants for wound healing in both countries. Plantago major leaves specifically is used for boils either macerated or plastered on skin after warming on stove in the study area. The use of Plantago major for boils and wounds was also frequently cited in the literature [

 <italic>Picea</italic> resin, beeswax, butter and olive oil. Such healing properties of

 <italic>Urtica dioica and Anthemis</italic> spp. are commonly reported species to treat hair care complaints by participants from both countries. A bath with water decoction of aerial parts of
