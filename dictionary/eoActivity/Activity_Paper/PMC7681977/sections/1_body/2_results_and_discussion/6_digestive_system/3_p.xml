<p id="Par60">The other commonly mentioned digestive-related problems and plants are Sambucus ebulus used for constipation and, 
 <italic>Anthemis</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Quercus petrea</italic> species used to cure tooth ailments. Interestingly, only 
 <italic>Quercus petrea</italic> has no mentions in Turkey. Among the applications, gargling a water decoction of the outer bark of Quercus petraea is commonly known for treating toothache in Georgia. There is not any reports of medicinal usage of 
 <italic>Quercus</italic> species in previous studies conducted in the Turkish part of the Caucasus or even in the ethnomedicinal review for East Anatolia [

Thus, its unique medicinal use knowledge recorded in Georgia might be attributed to cultural background as well as to the remedies written in the literature, especially in ancient traditional medical books. Indeed, when participants were asked about the origin of their ethnomedicinal knowledge, although most in Georgia referred to their elders’ knowledge as a primary source, some also acknowledged their primary school education and others recalled Russian botanists who had conducted research in the region. Furthermore, several referred to the fifteenth century Georgian book “Karabadini,” which had formerly been known as “Ustsoro Karabadini,” the first almanac of medicinal remedies and medicinal knowledge, written by Kananeli Karaba in the tenth century. A further source of knowledge mentioned was the “Turmanidze family,” an acknowledged traditional Georgian medical family. Some also made a reference to Russian medicinal plant guidebooks and web pages. In contrast, no similar examples was mentioned by participants in Turkey, whose sole source of plant knowledge was their elders and people around. They also complained about lack of scientifically sound medicinal plant sources in Turkish. Georgian participants’ multilingualism enabled them to access a diverse range of literature related to medicinal plants that could account to some degree for the resulting variation in people’s ethnomedicinal knowledge across this border.
