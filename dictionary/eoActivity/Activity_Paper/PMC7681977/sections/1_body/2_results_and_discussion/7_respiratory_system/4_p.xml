 <italic>Helichrysum rubicundum</italic> aerial parts with flowers, for cough and throat complains, is one of the most mentioned remedy (10 UR) only in Turkey. Its use in respiratory disease was scarcely mentioned in the cited literature in Turkey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. A water decoction of 
 <italic>Rosa spinosissima</italic> root, mainly for cough and bronchitis, is another common remedy in Turkey. Furthermore, a water decoction of its fruits was given for cough which had also been reported from Turkey before [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Water decoction of roots is also mentioned to cure influenza, which has also been reported in this and other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Interestingly, for Georgia and other neighboring countries, no use-reports were found to be specified for

 <italic>R. pimpinellifolia</italic>) or 
 <italic>Helichrysum rubicundum</italic> for these respiratory disorders.
