<p id="Par48">Plantaginaceae is the second most important family in Turkey and fourth in Georgia. Their CI vlaues are close to each other (1.51 in Georgia; 1.26 in Turkey). 
 <italic>Plantago</italic> spp. (
 <italic>P. major and P</italic>. 
 <italic>lancelolata</italic>) are in the first place within the top 15 culturally salient genera in both countries. Indeed, 
 <italic>Plantago major</italic> is one of the most frequently reported medicinal species in cited literature (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In addition, the third family in Georgia, Lamiaceae CI, is significantly greater than that in Turkey, being 1.69 and 0.62 respectively. Even the most reported genera in both countries are the same (
 <italic>Mentha</italic> and 
 <italic>Origanum</italic>); 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> with CI of 0.56 in Georgia and 0.19 in Turkey is a sign of significant differences between the two countries. Actually, 
 <italic>Mentha</italic> is a widely known, reported, and used plant species as a food additive in the study area, in Turkey. Therefore, its low medicinal CI value could be related to its less known specific medicinal properties. Same reason might be relevant for Polygonaceae and Ericaceae families which are not represented in CI index of top ten families in Turkey. 
 <italic>Polygonum</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Rumex</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Vaccinium</italic> spp. are not consumed specifically as medicine but mainly known as food in Turkey.
