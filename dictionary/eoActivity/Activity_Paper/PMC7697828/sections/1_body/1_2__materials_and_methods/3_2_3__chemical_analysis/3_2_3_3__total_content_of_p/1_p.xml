<p>The analyses (Arnov’s method) was performed in accordance with Polish Pharmacopeia 6th ed. [
 <xref rid="B43-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A total of 1 g of air-dry, grounded herb was extracted twice with portions of 25 mL of distilled water (a total of 50 mL), with shaking for 30 min each time at room temperature (a total of 1 h). Collected extract was filled to 50 mL with distilled water. A total of 1 mL of extract was mixed with 5 mL of distilled water, 1 mL 0.5 M HCl, 1 mL of Arnov reagent (10 g of sodium molybdate and 10 g of sodium nitrite dissolved in 100 mL of distilled water) and 1 mL 1 M NaOH and subsequently completed to 10 mL with distilled water. The absorbance of both basic (with extract) and comparison (without extract) solutions were measured at 490 nm. The total phenolic acid content was recalculated and given as caffeic acid equivalent (g × 100 g
 <sup>−1</sup> DW).
