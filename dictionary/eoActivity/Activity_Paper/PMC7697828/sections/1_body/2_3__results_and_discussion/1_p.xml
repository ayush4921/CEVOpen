<p>Investigated subspecies differed in both morphological and chemical traits (

 <xref rid="foods-09-01671-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Common oregano was characterized by erect type of growth and ligneous, slightly hairy stems. The color of stems was dark green and red, while petals were pink. The plant height was at a level of 36.11 cm. In turn, Greek oregano was distinguished by semi-erect type of growth, and green, slightly ligneous but hairy stems. This subspecies was characterized by white color of petals. Greek oregano plants grown in Poland were about 10 cm lower than common oregano plants. The foliage density was described as medium (in common oregano) and dense (in Greek oregano). The branching density was sparse in both subspecies. Number of shoots per plant achieved values 27.59 in the case of common oregano, and 22.77 in Greek oregano. The number of internodes per shoot was similar in both subspecies (8.44; 7.60, respectively) (

 <xref rid="B49-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, it should be underlined that each subspecies is very variable itself and its morphological features strongly depend on the population/accession origin. For instance, common oregano plant’s height ranged from 18 to 59 cm [
 <xref rid="B46-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], while Greek oregano—from 67.8 to 79.9 cm [
 <xref rid="B49-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Observed phenotypical plasticity may be related to allogamous way of this plant’s reproduction as well as its heterozygous character. Traits such as type of growth habit, lignification degree as well as branching and foliar density can be important from the practical viewpoint, since they affect the yield of herb and enable its mechanical harvest [
 <xref rid="B17-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, the fresh and dry weight of common oregano herb was slightly higher (63.81; 16.71 g × plant
 <sup>−1</sup>) in comparison to Greek oregano (49.17; 13.28 g × plant
 <sup>−1</sup>) (
 <xref rid="foods-09-01671-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Such results may be related to high temperature requirements of Greek oregano resulting from its Mediterranean origin. Taking into consideration the possible response of this subspecies to climatic parameters, its cultivation under covers may be effective. Results obtained by Kosakowska et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-foods-09-01671" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that Greek oregano plants cultivated under foil were distinguished by almost twice the mass of the herb when compared to those grown without covers. In general, Greek oregano cultivation is widely presented in literature, however the majority of these data concerns warm climate zones [
