<p>Phytochemical studies performed on different 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species have demonstrated the occurrence of several classes of primary and secondary metabolites. A literature survey revealed that the genus 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> is a rich source of diterpenoids [

 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], flavonoids [

 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], phenolic compounds, triterpenoids [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], iridoid glycosides, lignans, steroids, alkaloids, polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], volatile, non-volatile and aromatic compounds, lipids, carbohydrates, minerals, vitamins, and others. About 150 secondary metabolites have been reported from all previous classes in the genus. Among these compounds, diterpenoids have been considered as useful taxonomic markers and the major active components of 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species. In the following section (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00132-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), we will summarize the reported natural products isolated from each species. Out of 44 species presented in the genus, only 19 species have been phytochemically explored. Therefore, the genus still holds more than half of its species unseen by researchers.
