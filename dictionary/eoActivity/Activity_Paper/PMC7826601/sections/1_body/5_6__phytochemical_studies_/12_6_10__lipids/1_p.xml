<p>In plants, lipids play especially important roles as signaling and energy storage compounds [

 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> species by some researchers [

 <bold>147</bold>), eicos -11-enoic (
 <bold>148</bold>), and eicosa-9,11-dienoic acids (

 <italic>L. occultifloris</italic> [

 <italic>L. inebrians</italic> were investigated by Yuldasheva et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and the findings showed that seeds have a very high percentage of oil content, a large fraction of unsaturated ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids.
