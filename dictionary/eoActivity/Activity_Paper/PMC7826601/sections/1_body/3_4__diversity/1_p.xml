<p>The genus 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> is mostly distributed on dry slopes, in valleys, and deserts from Iran to Mongolia, Russia (south Siberia), northwest China, north Pakistan [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and has a distributional center in Tianshan Mountains and Central Asia. The results of the studies of Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed that the Tianshan Mountains, especially the western Ili-Kirghizia Tianshan, as well as Sunggar and Kaschgar, were the ancestral area. The ancestral biome was mainly in the montane steppe zone of valley and slope at altitudes of 1700 ± 2700 m above sea level, and the montane desert zone of foothill and front-hill at 800 ± 1700 m. The main center of diversity lies in Central Asia. According to Tskervanik [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-10-00132" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], in world flora, there are 44 species that can be distinguished in 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic>. According to the taxonomy of this author, 34 species grow in the territory of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States).
