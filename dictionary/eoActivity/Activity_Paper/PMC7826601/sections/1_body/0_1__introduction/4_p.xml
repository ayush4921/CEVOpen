<p>Previous chemical instigations on the genus are limited due to the fact that many species are classified endangered, and the collection of these plants is not easy. However, this effort on the chemical profiling of the plants belonging to the genus led to the isolation and characterization of many diterpenes, flavonoids, iridoids, triterpenes, and polysaccharides. The diterpene lagochiline and its derivatives are among the promising hemostatic agents [
