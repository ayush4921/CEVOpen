<p>We conclude that the genus 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> is a good source of phytochemical diversity. This genus is native to Central, South-Central, and Eastern Asia and is mainly distributed in arid and semiarid regions of China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and endemic to the Asian mountains. The obtained results demonstrated that not even the well-studied species of 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> had been exhaustively investigated for secondary metabolites, and it should certainly be worthwhile to explore them for new bioactive molecules further. Some species of 
 <italic>Lagochilus</italic> are rare in nature and endangered. Due to the rapid economic development of regions, climate change, over-collection by people, and continuing resource exploitation, some species in this genus face severe threats, and serious efforts are needed to save and protect rare and endangered species from overharvesting and extinction. Efforts should, therefore, be made to cultivate and naturalize the economically relevant species.
