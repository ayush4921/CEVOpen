<p id="Par44">According to Kwon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2013</xref>), five phlorotannins of the edible brown algae 
 <italic>Ecklonia cava</italic> Kjellman competitively inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV spike protein to sialic acids at a concentration of less than 36.6 μM. Two phlorotannins caused the inhibition of SARS-CoV RNA and SARS-CoV protein synthesis in late stages, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 12.2 ± 2.8 and 14.6 ± 1.3 μM, respectively (Kwon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2013</xref>). The results suggest that compounds isolated from 
 <italic>E. cava</italic> have strong antiviral activity and may be developed into natural therapeutic drugs against SARS-CoV infection (Kwon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2013</xref>). A commercially available 
 <italic>E. cava</italic> extract, Seapolynol™, was approved as a new dietary ingredient (NDI) by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2008 (FDA-1995-S-0039-0176) (Lee et al.,
