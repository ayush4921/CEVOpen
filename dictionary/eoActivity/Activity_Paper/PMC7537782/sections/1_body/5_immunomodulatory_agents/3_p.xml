 <italic>Stephania tetrandra</italic> S.Moore, namely cepharanthine (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>). After the cells were infected with HCoV-OC43, each compound (5 μM) was added to the wells, and cytokine mRNA was qantified by real-time qRT-PCR. Compound treatment following virus infection reduced the mRNA expression levels of IFN-α1 by almost 20-fold at 4 days post infection, and about 100-fold reduction for IFN-β1 at 3 days post infection (Kim et al.
