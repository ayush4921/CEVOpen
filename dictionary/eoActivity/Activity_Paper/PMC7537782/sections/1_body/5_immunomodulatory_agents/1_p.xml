<p id="Par42">Coronavirus infection in humans is characterized by uncontrolled replication of the virus and a prominent pro-inflammatory response (Wong and Yuen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2008</xref>). Still, in the management of coronavirus disease, the role of immunomodulators to decrease excessive inflammation remains elusive (Wong and Yuen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2008</xref>). The immunomodulatory compounds tomentins A–E (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2013</xref>). These tomentins could be useful in allaying the multisystem inflammatory syndrome, also known as the cytokine storm, seen in many COVID-19 patients.
