<p id="Par53">The papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) encoded by SARS-CoV cleaves the viral replicase polyprotein. Since this enzymatic activity is important for viral infection, PL
 <sup>pro</sup> is a target of interest in the development of antiviral therapies. Nine diarylheptanoids from the bark of 
 <italic>Alnus japonica</italic> (Thunb.) Steud. were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> (Park et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2012a</xref>). Hirsutenone was found to be the most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.1 ± 0.3 μM).
