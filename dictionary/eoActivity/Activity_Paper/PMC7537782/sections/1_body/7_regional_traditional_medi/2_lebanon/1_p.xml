<p id="Par52">In Lebanon, the oil of 
 <italic>Laurus nobilis</italic> Cav. exerted remarkable activity against SARS-CoV with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 120 μg/ml and a selectivity index of 4.16 (Loizzo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2008</xref>). An ornamental tree and a member of the Cupressaceae family, 
 <italic>Cupressus sempervirens</italic> L. contains flavonoid derivatives, diterpenes, catechins and flavonolic oligomers, proanthocyanidins, phenolic acids, fatty acids, and essential oils (Orhan and Tumen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2015</xref>). The essential oil of 
 <italic>C. sempervirens</italic> had a mild inhibitory outcome on SARS-CoV activity (700 ± 2.3 μg/ml) (Orhan and Tumen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2015</xref>; Loizzo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2008</xref>). Volatile oils are potential agents for treatment of SARS-CoV (Pasdaran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2016</xref>). An ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Thymus vulgaris</italic> Sm. found in Lebanon inhibits SARS-CoV (Bekut et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Lebanese essential oils have also been evaluated for their inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by visually scoring the virus-induced cytopathogenic effect post infection.
