 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). On 1 May 2020, remdesivir was granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. An inhibitor of the enzyme RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) involved in HCoV replication, the drug reduced mortality from 11 to 8% and duration of symptoms from 15 to 11 days. However, in comparison with the placebo, remdesivir’s reduction of patient mortality was not significantly different.
