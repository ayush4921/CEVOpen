<p id="Par13">To prevent author bias, this review was carried out using a comprehensive and systematic data mining approach similar to that used by Chinsembu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>). To obtain pertinent literature, the key words “SARS” and “medicinal plants” were concomitantly searched in Google Scholar, Elsevier’s pay-to-view service Science Direct, Scopus, Scielo, and PubMed Central, the US National Library of Medicine’s digital archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature. Literature sources included peer-reviewed journal articles and refereed books. Medicinal plants, mushrooms, algae, and sponges with anti-SARS activity were included. Wherever possible, active compounds and anti-SARS profiles mainly half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) and effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) were recorded. Inclusion criteria included plants, fungi, and marine organisms, namely algae and sponges. Exclusion criteria included animal products. Countries reported in the review were those where primary data were collected; hence, geographical scope was not deliberately selected. The International Plant Names Index (
