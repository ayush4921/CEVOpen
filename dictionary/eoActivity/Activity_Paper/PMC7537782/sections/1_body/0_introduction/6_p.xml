 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>) reported that SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as 2019-nCoV, the causative pathogen of COVID-19, had rapidly spread across China and around the world, causing an outbreak of acute infectious pneumonia. The spread of SARS-CoV-2, a new highly contagious and lethal strain of HCoVs, has now caused a global pandemic (Remuzzi and Remuzzi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2020</xref>). In the morning of 7 September 2020, Johns Hopkins University reported that there were over 26,994,442 total confirmed cases and 880,994 deaths globally; over 6,189,488 cases and 187,541 deaths were in the United States of America (USA). COVID-19 has spread more rapidly due to increased global travel and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in every environment (Vellingiri et al.
