<p id="Par65">Taken together, these developments signify that many countries should carefully evaluate the efficacy and safety of natural antimalarial agents for the possible treatment of COVID-19. Rich in flavonoids such as acacetin, genkwanin, and 7-methoxyacacetin, leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Artemisia afra</italic> Jacq., a common antimalarial remedy in Kenya, Rwanda, and Zambia (Chinsembu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>), should be carefully evaluated in COVID-19 patients. The need for medicinal plants and other natural products to treat COVID-19 patients is urgent especially in Africa where health systems grapple with high caseloads of HIV/AIDS and malaria in addition to being heavily under-resourced in terms of funding and staff. Overall, plants with antiplasmodial (Chinsembu

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>), should also be evaluated for anti-COVID-19 function. High-throughput screening of these plants should be conducted, and computational techniques can quicken the process.
