<p id="Par63">Comparative genomics lends credence to the repurposing of current anti-SARS natural products for the treatment of COVID-19. This is because the genome sequence of SARS-CoV is very similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 (Tahir ul Qamar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2020</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of whole genomes reveals that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.7% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2020a</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2020a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">b</xref>). Compared with SARS-CoV, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2 share sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively (Zhou et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2020a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">b</xref>). The virion of SARS-CoV-2 consists of a similar structure as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 as its cellular receptor to enter host cells (Zhou et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2020a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">b</xref>). The chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) of SARS-CoV is conserved and shares 99.02% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (Tahir ul Qamar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2020</xref>). These comparative genomic similarities signify one epic biomedical prospect: if medicinal plants used against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are carefully repurposed, they could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. In this new normality, natural products should become part of the COVID-19 survival kit.
