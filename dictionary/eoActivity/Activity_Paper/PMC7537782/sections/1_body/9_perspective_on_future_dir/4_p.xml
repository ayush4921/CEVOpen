<p id="Par64">In the absence of an effective and safe drug that inhibits SARS-CoV-2, the use of antimalarial plants and synthetic drugs has gained traction in the treatment of COVID-19. The notion that antimalarial plants in the genus 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> L. can be repurposed to prevent and treat COVID-19 has often been associated with experimental data that chloroquine inhibits the replication of viruses. Chloroquine inhibits chikungunya virus replication in Vero A cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 7 μM, IC
 <sub>90</sub> 15 μM, selectivity index = 37.14) in a dose-dependent manner. Chloroquine, whose chemical structure mimics nucleoside analogues, has 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2020a</xref>). An antimalarial drug known since 1934, chloroquine blocks HIV-1 and HCoVs at a very early stage; it also inhibits the replication of MERS-CoV in a dose-dependent mode (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3 μM) (de Wilde et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>). Chloroquine exerts antiviral as well as immunomodulatory properties. Chloroquine (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.13 μM against SARS-CoV-2) blocks viral infection by increasing the endosomal pH required for viral fusion (Vellingiri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2020</xref>). A 9-aminoquinoline, chloroquine inhibits SARS-CoV replication and downregulates IFN-γ and TNF-α production in mice (Prinsloo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2018</xref>). In the first half of 2020, clinical trials (NCT04261517 and NCT04307693) of hydroxychloroquine treatment for COVID-19 were underway in China (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2020b</xref>). The World Health Organization announced it would resume its halted randomized controlled trials to find out whether hydroxychloroquine was able to prevent COVID-19. This was after the 
 <italic>Lancet</italic> on 4 June 2020, due to concerns with respect to the veracity of the data and analyses, retracted an influential article which had earlier reported that hydroxychloroquine increased the mortality of COVID-19 patients. On 15 June 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration revoked the emergence use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients after reports that the drug increases the risk of cardiovascular side effects including cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrest.
