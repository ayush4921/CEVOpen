<p id="Par69">An examination of the research publications on anti-SARS natural products cited in this review shows that about 8 out of 10 are authored by the Chinese. Since the Chinese represent about 80% of all research efforts and publications on anti-SARS natural products, there is 80% chance that the next big discovery of novel natural products to treat COVID-19 will be from TCM. China is the world leader in research and development for innovative anti-SARS agents from natural products. By all intents and purposes, the first well-researched and clinically proven herbal remedy for COVID-19 will most likely be discovered and developed in China.</p>
