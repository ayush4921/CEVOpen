<p id="Par29">In oriental herbal medicine, the bark of cinnamon plant 
 <italic>Cinnamomum cassia</italic> (L.) J. Presl has been used as a spice, infusion, and prime component of herbal remedies for common cold, gastrointestinal infections, cancer, chronic cardiovascular disease, and gynecological disorders. Zhuang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2009</xref>) found that cinnamon bark extract has anti-RNA viral effects. The cinnamon extract inhibited wild-type SARS-CoV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 43 μM; and the proposed mechanism of action for cinnamon bark extract was blocking cell entry via endocytosis (Polansky and Lori 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2020</xref>). Whereas the antiviral, anti-bacterial, and anti-cancer effects were attributable to essential oils such as cinnamaldehyde (
 <bold>11</bold>), the anti-inflammatory actions of cinnamon water extract were due to the presence of polyphenols such as flavonoids and tannins. Molecular docking studies show that 
 <bold>11</bold> may block the attachment of SARC-CoV-2, though detailed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies are required to confirm its efficacy (Asif et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>11</bold> had the lowest electronegativity value among the phytochemicals with a score of − 4.34; binding affinity in kilocalorie per mole was − 5 (Asif et al.
