<p id="Par18">Some viruses such as Ebola and SARS-COV use cathepsins, a family of proteases, to infect host cells (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2006</xref>). Inhibitors of cathepsin L prevent entry of SARS-CoV into target cells (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2005</xref>). Unfortunately, many cathepsin inhibitors are non-selective (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2016</xref>). Leupeptin (
 <bold>1</bold>), also known as 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-leucyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-leucyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-argininal, is protease inhibitor produced by actinomycetes and isolated from a strain of 
 <italic>Streptomyces exfoliatus</italic> (Waksman and Curtis) Waksman and Henrici, which can inhibit cysteine, serine, and threonine peptidases. Simmons et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2005</xref>) showed that inhibitors of proteases such as leupeptin act as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV entry into host cells. SARS-CoV spike protein-driven virus-cell fusion is inhibited by 
 <bold>1</bold> (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2011</xref>), which exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV infection (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2011</xref>) (IC
 <sub>95</sub> 15.2 μM). This inhibition is the result of an absolute requirement in cell lines for endosomal processing of the SARS-CoV spike protein by cathepsin L during entry into the target cell (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2011</xref>). The oligopeptide antipain (
 <bold>2</bold>), an inhibitor of trypsin and papain, isolated from actinomycetes inhibited SARS-COV entry into host cells (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2005</xref>).
