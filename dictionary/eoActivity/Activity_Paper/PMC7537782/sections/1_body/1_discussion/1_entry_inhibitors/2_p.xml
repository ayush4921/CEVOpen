 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) suggested that it was feasible to develop SARS-CoV fusion inhibitors analogous to enfuvirtide, a linear 36-amino acid synthetic peptide marketed under the trade name Fuzeon, an approved anti-HIV drug that inhibits the entry of the virus into cells. SARS-CoV entry inhibitors fall into several categories. The first group consists of inhibitors that bind to the ACE2 receptor, the second class comprises entry inhibitors that bind to the virus and prevent it from interacting with its receptors, and the third set of inhibitors can obstruct the conformational changes thus thwarting SARS-CoV fusion with the target cells (Keyaerts et al.
