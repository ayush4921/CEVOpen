<p id="Par14">The spike protein, a type I membrane-bound protein, is essential for SARS-CoV attachment to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In general, SARS-CoV entry starts with the attachment of the virus to its specific receptor ACE2 on the host cell surface (Keyaerts et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007</xref>). Binding of ACE2 then induces the viral envelope protein to undergo conformational changes that mediate fusion between SARS-CoV and host cell membranes. The spike protein is responsible for these two steps in the coronavirus entry process (Keyaerts et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007</xref>). A member of the C-type lectin superfamily, dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM-grabbing non-intergrin (DC-SIGN), a molecule designated as CD209, binds to surface proteins of SARS-CoV, consequently facilitating viral entry (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2015</xref>). SARS-CoV spike protein contains a number of 
 <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation sites that modulate binding to the DC-SIGN receptor on DC (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2007</xref>). SARS-CoV binding to DC-SIGN is required for DC infection and target cell 
 <italic>trans</italic>-infection. DC-SIGN plays an important role in mediating DC adhesion and internalization of SARS-CoV.
