<p id="Par72">Data in this review show two recurring motifs. The first one is that the search for herbal remedies against COVID-19 is more intense in China than in any other part of the world. The second is that most putative anti-SARS-CoV-2 remedies contain active compounds that inhibit HCoVs at the cellular and molecular levels. Since structure dictates function, many of these compounds inhibit SARS-CoV replication because their chemical structures mimic nucleoside analogues. While many of the natural products possess anti-SARS-CoV properties, their extracts and active compounds should be evaluated for human cytotoxicity and dosage. Putative anti-SARS-CoV-2 extracts and active compounds should be rigorously tested in animal and randomized placebo clinical trials.</p>
