<p id="Par59">Case reports, case series, controlled observational studies, and randomized clinical trials provided compelling data that TCM had beneficial effects in the treatment or prevention of SARS (Lau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2005</xref>). For example, the rate of fatality in Hong Kong and Singapore was approximately 18%, while the rate for Beijing was initially more than 52% until the 5th May 2003 when it decreased to 4%, and then to 1% after 20th May 2003 (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>). The dramatic reduction in fatality in Beijing was associated with the use of TCM as a supplement to conventional therapy (Chen and Nakamura 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2004</xref>). Lau et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2005</xref>) reported that during the SARS outbreak of 2002/2003, 1063 volunteers including 926 hospital workers and 37 laboratory technicians working in high-risk virus laboratories used TCM, namely Sang Ju Yin plus Yu Ping Feng San. Compared with the 0.4% of infection in the placebo group, none of the TCM users was infected. In a controlled clinical study, Hsu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2006b</xref>) reported that supplementary treatment with TCM resulted in marked relief of symptoms and truncated the disease course. The clinical benefits of TCM were supported by laboratory studies especially for the use of glycyrrhizin (
 <bold>5</bold>), baicalin (
 <bold>10</bold>), and MOL376, an inhibitor of cathepsin L that could become a lead compound for SARS therapy (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>).
