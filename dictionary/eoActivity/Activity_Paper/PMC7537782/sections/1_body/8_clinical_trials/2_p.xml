<p id="Par58">Chen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>) urged that randomized placebo control trials should assess the efficacy of intravenous baicalin (
 <bold>10</bold>) for the treatment of SARS especially in developing countries where such formulations were available and affordable. In a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled trial, quercetin supplementation in doses of 500 and 1000 mg/day for 12 weeks significantly increased plasma quercetin levels with no reported side effects, but neither decreased total number of upper respiratory tract infection sick days nor reduced symptomatology in all subjects (Heinz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>). Liu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2012</xref>) reviewed 12 randomized controlled trials and one quasi-randomized controlled trial where 12 herbal remedies were administered on 640 SARS patients.
