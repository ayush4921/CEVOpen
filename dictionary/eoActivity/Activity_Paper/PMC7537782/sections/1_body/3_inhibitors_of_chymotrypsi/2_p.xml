 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> Fortune root extracts were frequently used as a remedy during the 2002/2003 SARS outbreak in China. A water extract of 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> had anti-SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity (Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2005</xref>). The root extract of 
 <italic>I. indigotica</italic> contains indigo, indirubin, indican (indoxyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside), β-sitosterol, γ-sitosterol, and sinigrin 
 <bold>(18</bold>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> in the cell-free assays was 115 μM for β-sitosterol, 121 μM for sinigrin, and 300 μM for indigo. The cell-based assay indicated that the antioxidant sinigrin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 217 μM) was more efficient in blocking the cleavage processing of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> than indigo (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 752 μM) and β-sitosterol (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1210 μM) (Lin et al.
