<p>A 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> oil-in-water NE was prepared from an aqueous COR-Ex using ultrasonication. The COR-NE was characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and field-emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM). At initial preparation, DLS analysis indicated that the droplet size was 87.0 ± 2.1 nm, the PDI value was 0.089 ± 0.023, and the zeta potential was −26.20 ± 2. The small droplet size, low PDI, and stable zeta potential highlighted the excellent stability of the NE. The stability of the NE was evaluated under different temperatures and storage conditions. However, after 90 days, stability was checked at different temperatures conditions (4, 25, and 60 °C) where 4 °C storage conditions do not affect the materials’ stability. The NE displayed good antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay (IC50 = 3.94 ± 0.14 mg/mL) and inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria. The results of the in vitro cytotoxicity and anti-inflammation assays suggested that the NE was not toxic to RAW 264.7 and HaCaT cells at up to 100 µL/mL. The COR-NE also had strong anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells at 50 µL/mL, as confirmed by inhibition of NO release and qPCR analysis of genes expressions related to inflammation. The COR-NE appeared to suppress the inflammation by reducing the expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, NF-κB, and IKKα mRNAs expressions. Moreover, 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> nanoemulsion can be a better option for future nano drug for biomedical applications.
