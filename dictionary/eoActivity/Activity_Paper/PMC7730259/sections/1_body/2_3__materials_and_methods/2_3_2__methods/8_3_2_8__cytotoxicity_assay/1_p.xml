<p>The in vitro cytotoxicity was performed as described previously with minor modifications [
 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The RAW 264.7 and HaCaT (skin keratinocyte) cell lines (both obtained from KCLB, Seoul, Korea) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM; Gibco-BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) with 10% FBS and 1% 
 <italic>penicillin/streptomycin</italic> (WElGENE Inc, Daegu, Korea) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and 95% air. The cells were seeded into 96 well plates at 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. The COR-NE and extract (0, 10, 25, 50, 75, or 100 µg/mL each) was added and the cells incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 20 µL of a 5 mg/mL MTT solution (3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2 H tetrazolium bromide in PBS (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA) was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. Viable cells converted the MTT solution to purple-colored formazan, and the insoluble formazan was dissolved by adding 100 µL of DMSO to each well and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (Bio-Tek, Instruments, Inc, Winooski, VT, USA).
