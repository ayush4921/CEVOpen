<p>The antimicrobial activity of the COR-NE was assessed using the disk diffusion method. The pathogenic microorganisms 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> were grown on Muller Hinton agar (MHA) plates. In this assay, 100 µL of log-phase bacterial cultures grown overnight were spread evenly onto the MHA plate. The COR-NE was impregnated onto new paper disks, and standard 
 <italic>Neomycin</italic> antibiotic disks were used as the positive control. The disks were placed onto the surface of MHA plates for a 24-h incubation period at 37 °C. After incubation, the zone of inhibition was measured and compared with control drug.
