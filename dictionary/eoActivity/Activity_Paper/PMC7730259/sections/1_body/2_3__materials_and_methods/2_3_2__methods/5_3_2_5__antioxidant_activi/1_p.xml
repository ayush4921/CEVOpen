<p>The antioxidant activities of the COR-NE and free COR-Ex were determined using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. Gallic acid was used as a positive control. For the assay, 160 μL of a 0.1 mM methanolic solution of DPPH was added to 40 μL of COR-NE or COR-Ex (2−20 μg/mL). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and the absorbance measured at 517 nm using a Synergy™ 2 multimode reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Vinooski, VT, USA). The inhibition percentage was calculated using the following formula:
 <disp-formula>[Absorbance of sample−Absorbance of Control/absorbance of control] × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula>
