<p>The RAW 264.7 cells were pretreated with the COR-NE and COR-Ex for 1 h, and then, LPS (1 µg/mL) was added and the cells were incubated for 24 h, as above. Total RNA was collected using a TRIzol Reagent Kit (Invitrogen Company, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Total RNA (2000 ng) was reverse transcribed with reversed transcriptase and an oligo (dt) primer for cDNA (AccuPower RT PreMix, Bioneer Co., Daejeon, South Korea). The reaction was performed at 42 °C for 60 min, followed by heating to 94 °C for 5 min. Then, 1 μL of the cDNA mixture was used for PCR amplification using AccuPower Hot Start PCR PreMix (Bioneer Co., Daejeon, Korea) as described previously. The primer sequence is provided in 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05733-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The PCR products were separated using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide and, finally, detected by UV illumination. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), a housekeeping gene, was used as the control. All experiments were performed triplicate.
