<p>An LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell line was used to measure production of pro-inflammatory nitric oxide (NO). Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 1 × 104 cells/well. The cells were pretreated for 1 h with various concentrations of the prepared 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> NE, and the cells were then stimulated with 1 µg/mL LPS (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). After 24 h incubation, the supernatant was collected, and NO production was determined using a colorimetric Griess reaction, for which 100 mL of premixed Griess reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was added to an equal volume of supernatant and incubated for 10 min and DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan into the colored solution. The absorbance of each sample was measured at 450 nm using a multimode microplate reader.
