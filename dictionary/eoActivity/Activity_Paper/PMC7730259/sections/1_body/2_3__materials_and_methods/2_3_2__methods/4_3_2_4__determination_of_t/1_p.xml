<p>The COR-NE was optimized in various conditions such as the temperatures and pH (3–7). The optimal storage condition was determined after storing the NE at various temperatures (4, 25, and 60 °C) for 3 months. After each treatment, the droplet size and zeta potential were measured to assess the stability of the NEs. </p>
