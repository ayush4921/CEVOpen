<p>The DPPH assay is based upon inhibition of free radical formation due to the reaction of the stable DPPH radical with an anti-oxidant compound that donates hydrogen to reduce the DPPH. The color changes from violet to yellow due to inhibition of DPPH free radicals is measured at 517 nm. Mostly the phenolic compound is responsible for antioxidant activity that contains (â€“OH) free radicals [
