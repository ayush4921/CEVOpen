<p>Both hydrophilic (free sugars, organic acids, and phenolic acids) and lipophilic (fatty acids and tocopherols) compounds have antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiproliferative properties [
 <xref rid="B33-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The composition of hydrophilic (phenolic acid and free sugar) and lipophilic (fatty acid and tocopherols) components responsible for antioxidant activity is virtually all related to the polysaccharide extracts of the mushroom. The antioxidant activity of the COR-NE and extract were evaluated, and the NE showed greater antioxidant activity than the free extract. The total antioxidant capacity of the COR-NE and extract as assessed in the DPPH radical scavenging assay were about 78.01% and 69.3%, respectively. The total antioxidant activity of the positive control ascorbic acid (5 mg/mL) was about 97.23% as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05733-f004">Figure 4</xref>. The antioxidant capacity of the NE was greater than that of the non-capsulated extract, likely because nano encapsulation not only prevented degradation of the COR-Ex but also preserved its antioxidant activity. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of the COR-Ex and NE as determined by linear regression were about 3.94 ± 0.14 and 2.96 ± 0.10 mg/mL, respectively. Therefore, we postulated that the antioxidant activity of the COR-NE was due to the higher amount of encapsulated

 <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> and 
 <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> have been reported [

 <xref rid="B35-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] but this is the first time a COR-NE has been reported to be a better source of antioxidants than an aqueous extract of
