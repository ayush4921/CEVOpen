<p>The PDI value indicates the monodispersity of the nanoformulation. Generally, PDI values less than 0.250 are consistent with monodispersed emulsions [
 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In this study, PDI values below 0.2 for the NEs demonstrated the uniformity of all the formulations. A zeta potential value of ±20 is considered sufficiently stable to make a protective energy barrier between the droplet due to coalescence, and also a negative zeta potential value was found due to using nonionic surfactant in the formulation [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. At high zeta potential value, there is ability of resisting coalescence, and at low zeta potential value, the attraction exceeds repulsion and breakdowns the dispersion and flocculates it [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-05733" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. So, high zeta potential gives stable nanoemulsion and low zeta potential value tends nanoemulsion to coagulate. In this study, the zeta potential for the
