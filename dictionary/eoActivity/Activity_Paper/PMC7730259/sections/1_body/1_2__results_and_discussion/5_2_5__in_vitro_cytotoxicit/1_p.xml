<p>The cytotoxicity of the COR-NE was analyzed using murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) and human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell lines. We had treated the normal cell lines with COR-NE samples to assess the cytotoxic effects on normal cells to ensure their safety in human applications. The cytotoxicity of the nanoemulsion (10~100 µL concentrations for 48 h) was assessed using the (3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2 H tetrazolium bromide (MTT assay). The COR-NE was nontoxic in both cell lines. Almost 80% of the cells survived exposure to the COR-NE at up to 100 µL/mL, as shown in
