<p>The influence of various inflammatory mediators, including NO production and signaling mechanisms, is correlated with many diseases linked to inflammation. The current study assessed effects of the synthesized NE on the viability of the RAW 264.6 cell line and in NO release assays. The results highlighted that neither the 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> NE nor the free extract had any significant toxicity to human cell line at concentration up to 100 µg/mL. Nevertheless, the NE significantly inhibited LPS-induced NO production, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05733-f006">Figure 6</xref>. This inhibition of NO production may have been due to greater entrapment of cordycepin [

 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> O/W NE as a potential candidate for the future treatment of inflammatory diseases. Pro-inflammatory cytokines have a significant impact on the inflammatory response. The pro-inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced macrophages were measured using an ELISA. To assess the anti-inflammatory effects of the COR-NE, the gene expression of cytokines was measured in an LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cell model by qPCR analysis. The RAW cells were incubated with 25 and 50 µg/mL or without the LPS; however, at a concentration of 1 µg/mL, LPS was used as inducer for 24 h. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05733-f006">Figure 6</xref> presents the results of the q-PCR analyses indicating that the COR-NE significantly suppressed inflammation by reducing the expression of mRNA for IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, iNOS, NF-κB, and IKKα. These results suggest that the COR-NE may suppress inflammation by nitric oxide inhibition and downregulation of the mRNA expression.
