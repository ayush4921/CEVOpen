 <p id="Par82">JKA has written papers on adverse drug reactions in peer-reviewed journals and has received royalties from textbooks that he has edited or co-edited; he has often acted as an expert witness in cases involving adverse drug reactions, including opioids, most often in Coronersâ€™ courts. DS has authored signals published on drug bulletins, as abstracts or posters, and received funding for doctoral studies from UMC. Part of the material expected to be reviewed has been published in peer-reviewed journals, drug bulletins, and abstracts or posters by other researchers presently or formerly belonging to this foundation. IJO has no competing interests.</p>
