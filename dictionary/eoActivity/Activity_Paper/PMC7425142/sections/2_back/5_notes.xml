 <p>This protocol is part of Daniele Sartori’s DPhil in Evidence-Based Medicine, at the University of Oxford (Nuffield Departments of Primary Care and of Continuing Education), UK. The DPhil is fully funded by UMC. UMC has suggested some aspects, such as capturing the motivations that justify putative causal associations between medicinal products and adverse events. UMC manages part of the data that will be used to conduct this study, namely VigiBase, and the archives of the Signal Document. The Conflict of Interest section reiterates Daniele Sartori’s involvement in analysing this part of the data and writing of the resulting manuscripts.</p>
