<p id="Par15">An important component of detection of signals of ADRs is clinical judgment of the data. The Bradford-Hill viewpoints or guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and other structured methods of causality assessment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] have typically guided clinical judgments in pharmacovigilance, but their intrinsic subjectivity has yielded low interrater agreement across independent assessors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Though some methods have a higher interrater agreement than others, there appears to be no consensus on which ought to be the gold standard [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Consequently, regulators’ clinical judgments about features of reports of ADRs have occasionally been criticized by healthcare workers or their professional associations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It has been reported that difficulties in assessing causality result in delays in the withdrawal of medicinal products from the market when fatal adverse events are attributed to their use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, the time intervals before signals of ADRs appear and regulatory actions follow are determined by the availability of information about the ADRs at the time of product launch; in fact, these intervals were shorter when ADRs were present in a sample of the Food and Drug Administration’s “drug label” at launch (e.g. severe liver injury with telithromycin or suicidal behaviour with varenicline) and longer when ADRs were absent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Other accounts report that it may take 2–12 years for drug-induced harms to be communicated to healthcare workers after marketing authorization of a medicinal product [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These studies have computed the difference between dates of communication of signals and launch dates to measure the time-to-signal, while databases of reports of ADRs, such as VigiBase, could estimate this interval and account for unpublished records.
