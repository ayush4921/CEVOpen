<p id="Par73">To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this would be the first study to systematically chart the evidence in support of signals and draw international comparisons of its levels using a standardized framework. Previous characterizations of the evidence underpinning “initial safety signals” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have focussed, for example, on Drug Safety Communications published by the US Food and Drug Administration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These postings concern “important drug safety issue(s)” with “potential to alter the benefit–risk analysis for a drug in such a way as to affect decisions about prescribing or taking the drug” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The agency’s website, however, also lists “potential signals of serious risks” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], that concerns “about an excess of adverse events compared to what would be expected to be associated with a product’s use” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. This indicates that resorting to a pre-established set of webpages may result in the omission of relevant records and may misrepresent the activities of those regulatory agencies who refer to “signal” using different expressions. The time from the first report of an ADR to the communication of a related signal will also be quantified and compared across different healthcare settings, accounting for unpublished reports of ADRs available in VigiBase—the largest database of this kind. The findings from this review will underscore research questions for future reviews.
