<p id="Par75">We anticipate that when abstracts do not transparently report methods, we may discard relevant records. In fact, there are no guidelines for reporting signals or SDRs. Furthermore, our exclusion criteria may result in the omission of eligible records: considering as eligible only records whose findings are described as “signals” is an approach that is insensitive to the use of other expressions (e.g. “safety risk”). In principle, contact with original authors would disambiguate those cases in which other expressions have been used, but might render such a broad review infeasible. In the case of contact with regulatory agencies, however, we may ascertain whether communications of, for example, “safety concerns” or “important safety concerns” were considered signals, as long as they reply to our queries. It is possible that we may not receive replies.</p>
