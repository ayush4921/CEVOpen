<p id="Par76">Furthermore, some publications may use discontinued terminologies to describe ADRs, such as the Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms, which have not been officially reconciled with MedDRA. This may introduce discrepancies in coding terms across terminologies. This is less likely to occur for medicinal products, as WHO-DD are quite comprehensive. However, WHO-DD are insensitive to vaccines; for example, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine would be coded to “influenza vaccine”. We therefore plan to make this clear in the limitations of the resulting publication. Finally, as concerns the time to signal, the date of entry in VigiBase may be later than the date of receipt of a report to a national pharmacovigilance centre, which may underestimate the time to signal. Between the occurrence of an ADR and the date of entry in VigiBase, there may be a gap ranging from months to several years, thus exaggerating the time to signal. In the interest of transparency, we shall report both dates for each retrieved signal. Also, ADRs may have never been reported to VigiBase in association with some medicinal products, which would impede calculations of the time to signal.</p>
