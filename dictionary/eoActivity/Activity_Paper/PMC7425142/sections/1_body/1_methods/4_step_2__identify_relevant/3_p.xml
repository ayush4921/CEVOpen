<p id="Par33">We shall search MEDLINE (via PubMed, 1946–present), EMBASE (1974–present), PsycINFO (1806–present), and Web of Science (indexes SCI-EXPANDED, CPCI-S, 1945–present) for signals published by organizations involved in pharmacovigilance and/or independent research groups (e.g. regional pharmacovigilance centres or academic departments) and pharmaceutical companies. We shall use Web of Science to perform backward citation screening; if we cannot use Web of Science, we will use Google Scholar.</p>
