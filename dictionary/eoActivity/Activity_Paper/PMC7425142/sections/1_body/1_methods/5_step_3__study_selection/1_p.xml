<p id="Par41">Since one of our goals is to better understand the evidence underpinning signals, we want to be as comprehensive as possible, while being able to remove irrelevant publications. Thus, we will not constrain by study design, language, or specific population: primary or secondary research using qualitative or quantitative methods will be eligible. We shall consider as eligible a priori disproportionality analyses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], as these are exclusive to the detection of associations between medicinal products and ADRs.
