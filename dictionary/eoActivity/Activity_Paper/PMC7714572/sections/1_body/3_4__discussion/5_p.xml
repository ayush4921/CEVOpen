<p>The low concentration of GSH in diabetic control suggests a depletion of this antioxidant species [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The nitrite rate was high in the diabetic control group probably due to streptozotocin that reacts through the nitric oxide pathway to induce 
 <italic>β</italic>-cells cytotoxicity effects [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The daily plant intake for 15 days significantly restored the catalase activity, GSH, and nitrite levels testifying the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> as seen in in vitro study. This antioxidant capacity of the extract could be assigned to its ability to scavenge free radicals or to provide a H
 <sup>+</sup> proton or an electron to the oxidant molecules, preventing devastating effects of diabetes in treated groups [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Likewise, these antioxidant properties might also due to the presence of lycophene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-carotene, phenolics, and flavonoids which are potent antioxidant species identified in the leaf of 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In addition, corilagin, an amorphous tannin, detected in the plant extract possesses antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Histological study of the pancreas revealed a significant reduction in the size of Langerhans islet in the diabetic control group probably due to the oxidative reaction and cytotoxic effects of streptozotocin. The size of islets was significantly increased in the treated group suggesting that 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> extract could regenerate pancreatic 
 <italic>β</italic>-cell, thus increasing the production of insulin, and may justify the hypoglycemic effect recorded in these groups.
