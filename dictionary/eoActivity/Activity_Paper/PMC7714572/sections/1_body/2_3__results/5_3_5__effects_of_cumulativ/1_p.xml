Compared to their initial value (day 1), it was observed a significant decrease in blood glucose levels by 47.97%, 57.93%, and 62.22%, respectively, at the dose of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. The decrease was gradual and significant from day 11. The plant extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg brought back the glycemia towards the normal value. Metformin administration at the dose of 200 mg/kg induced the decrease of blood glucose level by 70.52%.
