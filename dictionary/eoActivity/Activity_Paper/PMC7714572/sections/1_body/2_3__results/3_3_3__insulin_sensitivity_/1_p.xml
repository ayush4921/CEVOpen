<p>Fourteen days after the diabetes induction, insulin resistance was evaluated prior the beginning of the treatment. The administration of insulin to nicotinamide-/streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats failed to decrease the blood glucose levels (data not shown). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"> Figure 1</xref> shows the level of insulin index (

 <sub>iTT</sub> by 53.90% (
