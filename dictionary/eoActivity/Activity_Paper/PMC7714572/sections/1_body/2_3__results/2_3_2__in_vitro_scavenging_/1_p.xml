 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> indicates the radical scavenging activities of 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> on DPPH and ABTS. The results show that 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> expresses better antioxidant activities compared to the control. The plant extract showed greater DPPH scavenging than vitamin C and its capacity to catch ABTS is closed to the ascorbic acid. By contrary, the extract exhibited poor NO scavenging effect than the known standard. Concerning the capacity of 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> to prevent the reduction of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe
 <sup>2+</sup>, it appears that the plant extract was able to inhibit the transformation of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> to Fe 
 <sup>2+</sup> but lesser than hydroxylamine used as the standard.
