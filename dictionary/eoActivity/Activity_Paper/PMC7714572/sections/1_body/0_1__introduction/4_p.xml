<p>Recent studies showed that the majority of plasma antioxidants are depleted in diabetic state [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Traditional medicine systems generally assume that synergy effects of all ingredients of the plants will bring about maximum therapeutic [

 <italic>Bridelia atroviridis MÃ¼ll. Arg.</italic> (Euphorbiaceae) is used by local population to manage various ailments including diabetes, malaria, and venereal diseases. 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> methanolic leaves and stem bark extracts possess antifungal activity, and the decoction from its bark is used as purgative, diuretic, and aphrodisiac remedy [

 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> on diabetes [
