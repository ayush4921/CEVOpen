<p>At the beginning and the end of the treatment, the insulin tolerance test was performed to evaluate the insulin sensitivity. A dose of 0.15 IU/kg of semislow insulin was injected subcutaneously to diabetic rats prior to a 12 h nonhydrated fasting as described by Patarrão et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with slight modifications. The glycemia was measured after insulin injection (
 <italic>t</italic> = 0 min) and then successively after 15, 30, and 60 min insulin injection. The slope of the linear decline in plasma glucose (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>ITT</sub>) was calculated according to the following formula: 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>ITT</sub> = (0.693/
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>1/2</sub>) × 100 [

 <sub>1/2</sub> represents the half life of plasmatic glucose.
