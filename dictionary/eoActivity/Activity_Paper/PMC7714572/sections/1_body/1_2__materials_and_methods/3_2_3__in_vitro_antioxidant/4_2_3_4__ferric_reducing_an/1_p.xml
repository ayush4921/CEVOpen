<p>The ferric reducing power was determined by the Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> transformation in the presence of the extract [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> was monitored by measuring the formation of orthophenanthroline at 505 nm. The extract (1000 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was twofold serially diluted with ethanol. 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the diluted extract was mixed with 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of ferric chloride solution. After 15 min of incubation in the dark at room temperature, 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of orthophenanthroline was added to obtain final extract concentrations ranging from 250 to 1.9531 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL (250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.625, 7.8125, 3.9062, and 1.9531 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL). Hydroxylamine (NH
 <sub>2</sub>OH) was used as positive control, and the optical densities were measured at 505 nm; each assay was done in triplicate. The Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>-reducing capacity (RC in %) was calculated, the reduction percentages were plotted against the logarithmic values of concentration of test samples, and a linear regression curve was established in order to calculate the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), which is the concentration of sample necessary to reduce 50% the total free Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> in Fe
 <sup>2+</sup> radical.
