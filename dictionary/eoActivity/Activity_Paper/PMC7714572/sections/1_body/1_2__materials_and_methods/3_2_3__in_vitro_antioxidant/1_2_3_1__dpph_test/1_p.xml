<p>This test was performed as described by Aadil and collaborators [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The radical scavenging activities of the plant extract were evaluated spectrophotometrically using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical. When DPPH reacts with an antioxidant compound, which can donate hydrogen, it is reduced. The color change was measured at wave length, 517 nm under UV/Visible light spectrophotometer. 50 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of the diluted extract (1000

 <italic>μ</italic>L of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) ethanol solution and then diluted twofold serially resulting to a final extract concentrations range from 250 to 1.9531 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. After 1 hour of incubation in the dark at room temperature, the optical densities were measured. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) was used as control. The radical scavenging activity fifty (RSA
