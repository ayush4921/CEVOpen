<p>The radical scavenging activities of crude extract were evaluated spectrophotometrically using the 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic) acid (ABTS) free radical as described by Aadil and collaborators [

 <italic>μ</italic>L of the diluted extract was mixed with 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic) acid (ABTS) solution, giving a final extract concentration range of 250–1.9531 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) was used as control and after 1 h incubation in the dark at room temperature; the optical densities were measured at 734 nm. The radical scavenging activity fifty (RSA
