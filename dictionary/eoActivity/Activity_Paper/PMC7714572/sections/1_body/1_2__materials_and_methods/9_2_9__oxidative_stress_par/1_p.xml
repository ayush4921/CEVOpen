<p>The pancreas is the central organ involved in the pathogenesis of both type I and type II diabetes. To evaluate the oxidative stress balance in this organ, a part of the organ was homogenate in Tris HCL buffer (10%) and some markers of oxidative stress such as the rate of reduced glutathione and nitrites, and the activity of catalase enzyme were evaluated. Histomorphometry study of the remaining part of pancreas was performed after haematoxylin/eosin stain. The area of pancreatic islet was measured using software of area measurement (Image J. version 1.3).</p>
