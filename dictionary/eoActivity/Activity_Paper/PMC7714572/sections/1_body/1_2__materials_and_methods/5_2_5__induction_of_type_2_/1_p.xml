<p>Type II diabetes was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of 110 mg/kg of nicotinamide 15 min prior intravenous (penile vein) injection of 55 mg/kg streptozotocin in 0.9% of sodium chloride solution [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], animals with glycemia between 126 and 300 mg/dL were considered as diabetic, and then they were subjected to the insulin resistance test. Diabetic animals were divided into 5 groups of 5 animals each and treated as follows: one group treated with distilled water (10 mL/kg) named diabetic control, another group consisted to metformin 200 mg/kg treated with metformin (200 mg/kg), and three test groups that received the hydroethanolic bark extract of 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> at the respective dose of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg. To these different groups, one normal control group was made up of healthy rats, and receiving distilled water was added. Animals were orally treated for 15 days during which fasting blood glucose levels was recorded every five days from the tail's blood drop, using a glucometer (Accucheck Active). At the end of the treatment, animals were sacrificed under anaesthesia using ketamin (30 mg/kg) and diazepam (10 mg/kg). Blood sample of each animal was collected into EDTA tubes and dry tubes. The pancreas was harvested for oxidative stress and histomorphometry analysis.
