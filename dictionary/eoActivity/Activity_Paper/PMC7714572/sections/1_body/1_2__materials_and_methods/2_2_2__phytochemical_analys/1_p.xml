<p>The extract was screened for detection of different chemical families according to the standardized methods described by Odebiyi and Sofowora [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and also by Gul et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, phenolic compounds were detected using the ferrocyanide reaction; triterpenes and sterols were revealed by their reactivity with anhydrous acetate and sulphuric acid. Alkaloids were detected using Mayer's reagent, whereas the presence of saponins was revealed based on their foaming property. Tannins and flavonoids were revealed using ferric chloride and hydrochloric acid, respectively. Anthraquinones were detected in extract by the chloroform/petroleum system.
