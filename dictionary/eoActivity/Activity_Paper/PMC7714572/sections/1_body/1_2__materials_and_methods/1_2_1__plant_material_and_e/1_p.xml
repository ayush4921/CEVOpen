 <italic>Bridelia atroviridis</italic> barks were harvested at Mbalmayo in December 2018. The plant was authenticated by Mr. Ngansop Eric, a botanist at the National Herbarium, Yaoundé (Cameroon), in comparison with the specimen voucher N35241/HNC Cam. The barks were air-dried in the shade and pulverized into powder. A kilogram of powder from 
 <italic>B. atroviridis</italic> was soaked in 5 L of hydroethanolic solvent mixture (30% water and 70% ethanol; v/v) for 72 hours with regular agitation. Then, the mixture was filtered with Whatman paper No. 3, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness using a rotatory evaporator (Buchi Rota vapor, Switzerland) at a temperature of 45°C. The residual water was removed by ventilation under a hood (Burdinola ST 1800) giving a powdered crude extract.
