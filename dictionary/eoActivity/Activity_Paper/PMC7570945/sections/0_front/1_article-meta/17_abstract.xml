 <p>This ethnobotanical survey was carried out in Caspoggio (Valmalenco, SO, Italy) with the purpose of investigating the traditional uses of medicinal plants. Moreover, a bibliographic research meant to validate or refute the uses, focusing on the potentially responsible compounds, was performed. Fifty-nine species, attributable to 30 families (Asteraceae, Pinaceae, Malvaceae, and Lamiaceae the most cited), were mentioned. 
  <italic>Arnica montana</italic>, anti-inflammatory for traumas and musculoskeletal pains; 
  <italic>Pinus mugo</italic>, expectorant; 
  <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic>, anti-inflammatory and soothing; 
  <italic>Achillea moschata</italic>, digestive. The compounds, responsible for the therapeutic activities, are often polyphenols and terpenoids: helenanin in 
  <italic>A. montana</italic>, α-pinene, δ-3-carene, and limonene in 
  <italic>P. mugo</italic>, gossypin and malvin in 
  <italic>M. sylvestris</italic>, luteolin and apigenin in 
  <italic>A. moschata</italic>. Scientific evidence for at least one of the traditional activities described was found for 50 species but only in 26 out of 196 works consulted, it is possible to make a comparison between investigated extracts and traditional preparations. This study is thus a stimulus to new phytochemical investigations, mimicking as much as possible the traditional preparations. This work is part of the European Interreg Italy-Switzerland B-ICE project, aimed at creating a management model for the ongoing climate change and searching for new sources of territory valorization as attractions for tourists.
