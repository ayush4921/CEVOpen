<p>Informants’ consensus on medicinal uses was calculated for each species with the Fidelity Level index (FL) reported by Friedman in 1986 [
 <xref rid="B203-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>]. It was calculated as follows: 
 <disp-formula>Fl = Np/N × 100
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where Np is the number of informants who reported the use of a species to treat a particular ailment, and N is the total number of informants who mentioned the plant for any other disease.
