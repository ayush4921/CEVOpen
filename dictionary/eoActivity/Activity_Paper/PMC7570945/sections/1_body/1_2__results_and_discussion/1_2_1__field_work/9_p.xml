<p>Veterinary uses include 46 citations (2.8 % of the total citations), pertaining to 15 species, reported by 20 informants (1.5% of all the informants). The amount of knowledgeable informants is rather small when compared to the 127 informants citing medicinal plants in the same community but comparable to what reported in the other studies conducted in neighboring areas ([
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). We can hypothesize that ethno-veterinary knowledge in the study area was once higher, but due to changing socioeconomic and cultural values is currently disappearing, and only survives in the minds of a few informants. On the other hand, the breeders prefer to vaccinate and to treat their animals with synthetic products rather than rely on traditional herbal remedies. Four species (
 <italic>Carlina acaulis</italic>, 
 <italic>Crocus vernus, Nepeta cataria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rumex acetosa</italic>) have only a veterinary use while the other 11 have both animal and human medicinal uses. Veterinary categories are based on the type of animals treated. The data acquired underline that eight plant species are used in cattle, four in ‘other veterinary’ (that includes alpacas, cats, and dogs), four are inserted in remedies for which the animal is not specified. Finally, one species is used in the treatment of pigs. The most cited uses are 
 <italic>Carduus nutans</italic> and 
 <italic>Carlina acaulis</italic> flowers administered as food for improving milk quality (eight citations, each), an infusion of 
 <italic>Gentiana lutea</italic> roots to stimulate digestion in cows (five citations) and an infusion of 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> flowers as anti-inflammatory for the eyes (five citations). It is important to point out that 13 of the cited veterinary uses have not been previously reported for Italy (
