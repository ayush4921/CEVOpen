<p>The Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) calculated for each disease category ranged from 0.65 to 1.00. As a rule, ICF values resulted to be high for uses reported by many informants, confirming that people agree on plants to be used in the treatment of common diseases. The highest values were recorded for early infancy ailments (ICF = 1.00), followed by musculoskeletal system diseases (0.96), respiratory tract infections (0.94), digestive tract disorders, and skin diseases and traumas (0.91); the lowest values for gynecological disorders, obstetric and puerperal problems (0.65). Some of the highest agreement levels were recorded for ailments reported as the most widespread for alpine communities ([

 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]). All these values were higher than those observed by Vitalini et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] (ICF ranging from 0.60 to 0.88) and Cornara et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (0.38–0.83) but very similar to those reported by Dei Cas et al. [
 <xref rid="B3-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (0.80–0.92) and Vitalini et al. [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (0.67–0.96). According to Heinrich et al. [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04144" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], informants’ consensus could be useful in selecting plants for pharmacological investigations. For this purpose, we identified the species with the highest agreement among the informants (FI) in each of the categories as a further helpful piece of information. For this analysis, we included the taxa cited at least five times for a given use. The species with the highest agreement in the musculoskeletal systems diseases were 
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> (FI = 100%; 19 citations), 
 <italic>Arnica montana</italic> (92.9%; 92), 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> (85.7%; 24), 
 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> (40.5; 15), and 
 <italic>Pinus mugo</italic> (26.9%; 24). For respiratory tract infections, the species with the highest FI were 
 <italic>Crataegus monogyna</italic> (100%; 5) and 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> (100%; 89), 
 <italic>Sambucus nigra</italic> (91.7%; 11), and 
 <italic>Thymus</italic> spp. (82.7%; 43). For digestive tract disorders: 
 <italic>Achillea moschata</italic> (92.5%; 86), 
 <italic>Gentiana lutea</italic> (89.2; 33), and 
 <italic>Artemisia genepi</italic> (84.6; 11). For skin diseases and traumas: 
 <italic>Chelidonium majus</italic> (100%; 9), 
 <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> (80.9%; 17), 
 <italic>Larix decidua</italic> (66.7%; 10), and 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> (46.4%; 13). Based both on the FI values and the number of citations, other important uses in the local pharmacopoeia were 
 <italic>Matricaria chamomilla</italic> as sedative and hypnotic (97.9%; 47), against abdominal pain (41.6%; 20) and as eyes anti-inflammatory (31.2%; 15), 
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic> to promote circulation (83.3%; 10) and to promote eyesight/eyes health (75%; 9), 
 <italic>Rosa canina</italic> as laxative and to promote digestion (75%; 9) and as depurative (66.7%; 8), 
 <italic>Malva sylvestris</italic> for treating stomachache and to promote digestion (52.4%; 33) as generic anti-inflammatory (46%; 29), and for oropharyngeal affections (22.2%; 14), 
 <italic>Plantago major</italic> for treating skin traumas (50%; 10).
