<p>The traditional use of the reported plants is considered ‘still relevant’ in 96.6% of citations, ‘uncertain’ in 2.9%, and ‘past’ in 0.2%. Though in most cases these remedies are persistent nowadays, locals are aware of the declining number of individuals of some of the species. They report that the presence of the cited plants in the past was ‘very frequent’ in 88.7% of the cases and ‘quite frequent’ in 11.1%, while nowadays is ‘very frequent’ in 60.3% and ‘quite frequent’ in 36.0%. As way of example, the presence of 
 <italic>Achillea moschata</italic>, 
 <italic>Arnica montana</italic>, 
 <italic>Artemisia genipi</italic>, and 
 <italic>Gentiana lutea</italic> shifted from ‘very frequent’ in the past, to ‘quite frequent’ today. The last three have actually been in the list of endangered species at least since 2013, year of publication of the updated Red List of Italian Flora (Lista Rossa della Flora Italiana). Many a surveyed local people know about how harder and harder is to find 
 <italic>A. moschata</italic> and 
 <italic>A. genipi</italic> today due to the retreat of perennial snow and glaciers, which forces these two species to grow at higher altitudes, and to the indiscriminate collection by non-experts who, tearing their roots, jeopardize the balance of their communities.
