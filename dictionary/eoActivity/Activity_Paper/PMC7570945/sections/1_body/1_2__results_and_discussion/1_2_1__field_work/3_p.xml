<p>The most frequently reported method of preparation is infusion (736 citations; 44% of the total citations), both for internal and external administration (oral use 71%, compress 18%, washing 5%, footbath 1.5%, other 4.5%) followed by other preparation (e.g., the plant applied raw as poultice, exudate etc.; 376 citations; 23% of the total citations), syrup (228; 14% of the total citations), and oleolite (122; 7% of the total citations). Infusion from flowers or leaves is one of the most common methods of preparation in phytomedical practice as it is very easy to prepare and allows the extraction of a high quantity of bioactive metabolites. During our fieldwork, it was possible to acquire precious information concerning other preparations of the traditional remedies, through direct observation of the informants. As way of example, we mention the expectorant ‘syrup’, made through maceration in sugar of green pinecones of 
 <italic>P. mugo</italic> kept in glass jars under the sun for 60 days, or the dandelion ‘honey’, soothing in case of sore throat, obtained after boiling the inflorescences in water and lemon juice, then covering them with sugar (

 <italic>Achillea millefolium</italic> for stomachache and menstrual pains, when prepared with more than three flowers or drunk for more than 3 days in a row).
