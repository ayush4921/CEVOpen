<p>A bibliographic research was performed to find a possible match between the traditional uses and the information reported in the scientific literature about the chemical composition and the pharmaceutical activity of the cited species. A total of 196 scientific papers were identified. For 84.7% of the reported species, we found scientific studies that could validate their medicinal use. However, for some species (i.e., 
 <italic>Vaccinium myrtillus</italic> and 
 <italic>Valeriana officinalis</italic>) we found conflicting evidence. Species with a higher number of citations, number of informants, and number of use categories in this research have more often been subjected to scientific studies (Spearmanâ€™s Test: 0.456, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; 0.443, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005; 0.481, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). However, most of the medicinal species cited in Caspoggio have seldom been studied.
