Krast, commonly known as &#x0201c;Lingzhi&#x0201d; in Chinese, is a medicinal mushroom that is rich in biologically active substances. Polysaccharides and triterpenoids are the two major components responsible for the bioactivity of this fungus. In the present study, the ultrasonic-assisted co-extraction (UACE) of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> was optimized using response surface methodology with a desirability function, with the equal importance for the two components. Following single factor experiments, the optimal conditions were determine as ultrasonic power of 210 W, extraction temperature of 80C, ratio of liquid to solid of 50 mL/g, and 100 min extraction time, using aqueous ethanol (50%, v/v) as the extracting solvent. Under the optimal conditions, the extraction yields of polysaccharides and triterpenoids reached 0.63% and 0.38%, respectively. On the basis of the scavenging capacity of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and evaluation of reducing power, the antioxidant capacities of the polysaccharides obtained by optimal UACE process were higher than those of polysaccharides extracted using traditional hot water extraction, whereas the triterpenoid-rich extracts showed antioxidant activities similar to those obtained using the ethanol maceration method. The present study is the first report on the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic>. The developed UACE process could be useful in preparation of a polysaccharide- and triterpenoid-rich ingredient that holds great promise for application in the <italic>Ganoderma</italic> industry.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ningde Normal University (CN)</institution></funding-source><award-id>2018ZDK01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5548-5613</contrib-id><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shengrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Bureau of Science and Technology of Ningde(CN)</institution></funding-source><award-id>20190013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5548-5613</contrib-id><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shengrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The research was supported by the Key Cultivating Program (No. 2018ZDK01) of Ningde Normal University and Ningde Science and Technology Plan Project (20190013).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="3"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec033">Supporting Information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec033">Supporting Information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> (Fr.) Krast belonging to the family of Polyporaceae, commonly known as &#x0201c;Lingzhi&#x0201d; in Chinese and &#x0201c;Reishi&#x0201d; in Japanese, is one of the most highly prized medicinal mushrooms. Its fruiting bodies have been used as a folklore remedy to treat various illnesses and promote longevity for thousands of years in many oriental countries like China and Korea [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In recent years, there has been a growing worldwide interest in utilizing <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> in the biomedical industry due to its pharmacological properties. Currently, a variety of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> products such as slices, tea, capsules, tablets, and drinks are available on the market, and commonly consumed in many parts of the world [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p><italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> in the form of fruiting bodies, mycelium, and spores contains a broad range of bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, triterpenoids, phenols, steroids, lectin, amino acids, nucleosides, and nucleotides [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among these, the polysaccharides and triterpenoids are receiving special attention from researchers in the field of biomedicine. Several polysaccharides such as &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-glucans and glycoprotein are generally recognized as having the most noticeable biological activity such as antitumor, antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects among various <italic>Ganoderma</italic> polysaccharides [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The triterpenoids from this fungus exhibit structural diversity, and many of them such as ganoderic acids Me and T (a kind of highly oxygenated lanostane-type triterpenoids) have been proven to have potent antitumor activity [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In this context, much effort has been paid to the polysaccharides and triterpenoids of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic>, including extraction techniques [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], their pharmacological activities and mechanisms of action [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and fermentative production [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Polysaccharides are generally prepared by traditional hot water extraction due to its easy operation and low instrument input [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it also has many shortcomings such as low extraction yield and long extraction duration, as well as requirement of high temperature [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To overcome these problems, a variety of novel techniques, including pressurized liquid extraction [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and hydrothermal extraction [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], have been developed in extracting <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> polysaccharides. For the extraction of triterpenoids, maceration as a conventional method is adopted widely using organic solvents as an extraction solvent [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A novel technique of microwave irradiation was shown to be effective for the extraction of triterpenoids from this fungus [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, the simultaneous extraction of multiple biologically active components from plants has become increasingly popular in order to improve extraction efficacy and reduce the number of extraction steps [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, there have been no available reports on the simultaneous extraction of multiple objective constituents from mushrooms to date. Most of previous studies pertaining to the extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> have mainly focused on the extraction yield of one or the other [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hence, the significant loss of either polysaccharides or triterpenoids occurred during the extraction, and this would lead to a waste of resources. To our knowledge, the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids in <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> has not yet been reported to date. In the present study, to better utilize <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic>, ultrasound technology was examined for the co-extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids, and an optimization study is essential.</p><p>Response surface methodology (RSM), a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques, is widely used for optimizing complex processes [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The major advantage of RSM is the reduced number of experimental trials needed to evaluate multiple parameters and their interactions. RSM has been employed for optimizing the extraction of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> polysaccharides and ganoderic acids [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and triterpenoids from the medicinal fungus <italic>Sanghuangporus sanghuang</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In some optimization studies, multiple desirable response variables are commonly required. As desirability functions can transform two or more responses with different relative importances into a single objective function; thus, it is a desirable approach for the optimization of a multiple-response process [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It was used in tandem with statistical experimental designs for optimization of fermentation conditions [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and extraction processes [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the ultrasonic-assisted co-extraction (UACE) of polysaccharides and triterpenoids was evaluated using ultrasound technology as an attempt to better utilize <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic>. The extraction parameters were optimized using RSM with a desirability function by setting the equal importance for the two components. Furthermore, to provide a scientific basis for better utilization of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from the optimal UACE, their in vitro antioxidant activities were investigated and compared with those of polysaccharides and triterpenoids obtained using conventional extraction approaches. The UACE process developed here could be economically useful and convenient in the preparation of a polysaccharide- and triterpenoid-rich ingredient that holds great promise for the <italic>Ganoderma</italic> industry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>The dried <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> was obtained from a local pharmacy (Kang-Bai-Jia Medical Chain Store, Fujian, China). 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ursolic acid, ferric chloride, and trichloroacetic acid were products of Sigma-Aldrich Co.

These two yields were lower than those obtained with conventional processes (polysaccharide yield of 1.52% by HWE and triterpenoid yield of 0.59% by ethanol maceration). The obtained polysaccharide yield was also lower than that observed in the ultrasonic study done by Ma et al [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], where a yield of 2.87% was reported, and that of Kan et al [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which showed 2.44% of polysaccharide yield. The low polysaccharide yield in this study may be largely due to its low solubility in aqueous ethanol, despite the use of ultrasound in the extraction. Regarding triterpenoids, the extraction yield was lower than that of the reported yield (0.97%) using microwave irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A reasonable explanation is that the solubility of some low polarity or non-polar triterpenoid compounds in this mushroom may be low in the extracting solvent.</p><p>Extraction processes influencing the bioactivity of extracts have been reported widely [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For fungal polysaccharides, a large number of factors, including their chemical components, molecular mass, structure, and conformation, can remarkably affect their antioxidant activities [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the present study, the polysaccharides obtained by optimized UACE showed a higher antioxidant activity than that of polysaccharides obtained by the HWE method. Ultrasonic treatment in the extraction leading to the increase in antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides of longan fruit pericarp was also demonstrated, and the underlying mechanism has been attributed to the degradation of high molecular weight polysaccharides and further changes in chemical structure caused by acoustic cavitation effects [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides from common mullein (<italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic> L.) flowers was also shown to be enhanced by ultrasound in the extraction [<xref rid="pone.0244749.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We therefore postulated that the degradation of polysaccharides by the action of ultrasound and a higher portion of low-molecular-weight polysaccharides extracted from the matrice may be responsible for the higher antioxidant activity. The difference in the polysaccharide purity between the two extracted polysaccharides may also be a factor.</p><p>The triterpenoids of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> are related to its many important biological activities. In the present study, based on the DPPH radical scavenging activity and evaluation of reducing power, the antioxidant activity of triterpenoid-rich extracts of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> obtained under optimized UACE process did not alter by ultrasonic treatment in the process when compared with those obtained using the conventional ethanol maceration method. This may be because the triterpenoids have a relatively simple and stable chemical structure compared with the high-molecular-weight polysaccharides. Therefore, the ultrasonic conditions applied in this work did not lead to a significant detrimental effect on their chemical properties and therefore bioactivity. However, further studies would be needed to investigate the change in patterns of extracted triterpenoids of <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> during the extraction by ultrasound.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, the simultaneous and efficient extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from the medicinal fungus <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> was achieved with ultrasonic extraction technology. The optimized extraction conditions by RSM with a desirability function were determined as: ultrasonic power of 210 W, extraction temperature of 80C, liquid/solid ratio of 50 mL/g, and extraction time of 100 min. On the basis of the scavenging capacity of DPPH and evaluation of reducing power, the antioxidant activity of the extracted polysaccharides by ultrasonic action in optimal UACE process was significantly enhanced, while the triterpenoid-rich extracts demonstrated unchanged activity. The present study is the first report on the application of ultrasound for the simultaneous extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from <italic>G</italic>. <italic>lucidum</italic> in a convenient extraction process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0244749.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p>Standard curves for estimation of polysaccharides (A) and triterpenoids (B) used in this work.

</p><p>PONE-D-20-24854</p><p>Desirability function approach for optimization of ultrasound-assisted extraction of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from Ganoderma lucidum and evaluation of their in vitro antioxidant capacities</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. Liu,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>It is rather out of the point to determine the antioxidant activity of a mix of compounds, particularly using only DPPH assay as noted by Reviewer #3. I can suggest the authors to isolate dominant polysaccharides and triterpenes and to further test their antioxidant activities employing multiple common assays in order to match the theme of the main manuscript title. One of the possibilities can be to shift the manuscript theme to the extraction methodology solely (as proposed by Reviewer #3), which, in the other hand, would decrease the manuscript informativeness. The Discussion section must deepened as per reviewers' suggestions. Language should be considerably revised in order to increase readability and overall presentation clarity.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Nov 12 2020 11:59PM.

The paper is interesting but need major revision.</p><p>&#x0fffd; The MS title is not appropriate and need revision.</p><p>&#x0fffd; The abstract is generalized. Incorporate your significant data into the abstract.</p><p>&#x0fffd; In introduction, the extraction procedures are focused rather than the importance of Ganoderma constituents and their ability to cure various ailments.</p><p>&#x0fffd; In materials and method section, references are missing in subsections. Add pertinent references to the methods adopted.</p><p>&#x0fffd; In results section, the authors have added methods too, which needs to be shifted to the relevant section. For instance line 265-268.</p><p>&#x0fffd; The discussion is very shallow and needs major input.</p><p>&#x0fffd; The linguistic quality of the MS is very poor (for instance line 237). Edit the MS drastically for grammatical mistakes and typos.</p><p>&#x0fffd; I would suggest the authors to make a graphical model incorporating all information presented in the paper.</p><p>&#x0fffd; The authors may add the recent relevant reference, Ryua DH, JY Cho, NB Sadiq, JC Kim, BY Lee, M Hamayun et al. (2020) Optimization of antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities and ganoderic acid content of differentially dried Ganoderma lucidum using response surface methodology. Food Chemistry, 335: 127645</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The simultaneous recovery of polysaccharides and triterpenoids were reported by the authors using ultrasound-assisted extraction. The authors first performed one factor at a time experiment in order to determine the domain of the experimental design and optimised the influence of four significant variables (ultrasonic power, temperature, liquid/solid ratio, and extraction time). The introduction of the manuscript is well prepared and follows the theme of the article. A good methodology was established, the authors provide a clear rationale for each experiment conducted and the results are discussed thoroughly. Discussions are very well reported, and the authors focused on comparing their finding with previous reports. The figures are self-explanatory, clear, and easy to understand. However, I provided a few suggestions and recommend the acceptance of this paper in PLOSONE.</p><p>1. Please rephrase line 30-33 in the abstract for more clarity</p><p>2. Line 45: Include the classificator of Ganoderma lucidum mushroom for the first time (Karst.)</p><p>3. Line 37-38: "the triterpenoids showed antioxidant activities similar to those isolated using the ethanol maceration" This sentence is not correct because the authors performed only extraction. Hence, it should be corrected as "the triterpenoid rich extract showed antioxidant activities similar to those obtained using ethanol maceration.</p><p>4. Rephrase line 76</p><p>5. Line 208-210: The quantification of triterpenes should be better explained. Dis the authors used a standard (Ursolic acid for example). If yes, then the results should be expressed in the equivalent of the standard</p><p>6. In its current state, the manuscript has some grammatical errors and instances of badly constructed sentences. Please check the manuscript and refine the language carefully.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;This study describes a methodology for simultaneously extracting polysaccharides and triterpenes.</p><p>However, the goals of bioactivity differ greatly between polysaccharides and triterpenes.

Revised portion are marked in red in the paper. Point-by-point responses to these comments are showed below in this letter.</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>Shi-Zhong Zheng, Wei-Rui Zhang, Sheng-Rong Liu</p><p>Reviewer 1#: Some doubts, suggestions and recommendation</p><p>Comment 1: The manuscript describes the antioxidant capacity of polysaccharides and triterpenoids obtained from Ganoderma lucidum, using ultrasonic-assisted co-extraction (UACE) and response surface methodology (RSM). The paper is interesting but need major revision.</p><p>Response: Thanks. We have carefully and extensively revised the manuscript.</p><p>Comment 2: The manuscript title is not appropriate and need revision.</p><p>Response: Accept. It has been revised.</p><p>Comment 3: The abstract is generalized. Incorporate your significant data into the abstract.</p><p>Response: Thanks. The abstract has been carefully revised as suggested, and the quality was greatly improved. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 4: In introduction, the extraction procedures are focused rather than the importance of Ganoderma constituents and their ability to cure various ailments.</p><p>Response: Thanks. Some abundant description has been deleted, and the focus has been paid to the extraction techniques and optimization. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 5: In materials and method section, references are missing in subsections. Add pertinent references to the methods adopted.</p><p>Response: Accept. Several related references have been cited in the revised manuscript. </p><p>Comment 6: In results section, the authors have added methods too, which needs to be shifted to the relevant section. For instance line 265-268.</p><p>Response: Accept. The extraction conditions were deleted in Results section, and described in Materials and methods section. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 7: The discussion is very shallow and needs major input.</p><p>Response: Thanks. We have carefully revised this section, and more in-depth explanation has been provided. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 8: The linguistic quality of the MS is very poor (for instance line 237). Edit the manuscript drastically for grammatical mistakes and typos.</p><p>Response: Thanks.

We has revised it for clarity.</p><p>Comment 2: Line 45: Include the classificatory of Ganoderma lucidum mushroom for the first time (Karst.)</p><p>Response: Accept. It has been described. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 3: Line 37-38: &#x0201c;the triterpenoids showed antioxidant activities similar to those isolated using the ethanol maceration" This sentence is not correct because the authors performed only extraction. Hence, it should be corrected as&#x0201d; the triterpenoid-rich extract showed antioxidant activities similar to those obtained using ethanol maceration.</p><p>Response: Thanks. It has been revised as suggested.</p><p>Comment 4: Rephrase line 76: &#x0201c;For extraction of triterpenoids of G. lucidum, maceration using organic extracting solvents such as ethanol is often used&#x0201d;.</p><p>Response: Accept. It has been rephrased. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 5: Line 208-210: The quantification of triterpenes should be better explained. Did the authors use a standard (ursolic acid for example). If yes, then the results should be expressed in the equivalent of the standard.</p><p>Response: Accept. We used D-glucose as the standard for polysaccharides measurement, and ursolic acid as the standard for the measurement of triterpenoids. The results were expressed in the equivalent of the standard. There information have been described in the manuscript.</p><p>Comment 6: In its current state, the manuscript has some grammatical errors and instances of badly constructed sentences. Please check the manuscript and refine the language carefully.</p><p>Response: Thanks. We have carefully checked the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer 3#: Some doubts, suggestions and recommendation</p><p>Comment 1: This study describes a methodology for simultaneously extracting polysaccharides and triterpenes. However, the goals of bioactivity differ greatly between polysaccharides and triterpenes. For example, there are many types of triterpenes, and each triterpene has a unique bioactivity. Isn&#x02019;t each activity weakened by simultaneous extraction?</p><p>Response: Thanks. We are very sorry that the separation of individual triterpenoids was not carried out, and the activity of each triterpene was not investigated in this study.</p><p>Comment 2: In this study, the author describes the usefulness of simultaneous extraction, but I think it is not enough to confirm with DPPH alone. If you have a reason, please state why you expressed the bioactivity only with the DPPH result.</p><p>Response: Thanks. For a systematic comparison, we have performed additional experiments on the reducing power of the extracts, and the results have been provided in the manuscript. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 3: In some cases, I suggest removing the DPPH results and changing to a paper with only extraction methods.</p><p>Response: Thanks. We provided additional results on the antioxidant assay, and the results on the antioxidant assay were present in the manuscript. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 4: Page 3, Line 62: Please add a description of GA-MT and GA-T</p><p>Response: Accept. It has been added.</p><p>Comment 5: Page 5 Materials and Methods: Particle size after sample grinding should be specified.</p><p>Response: Accept. The particle size was specified in the revision.</p><p>Comment 6: Page 6, L119-L147: The description of the extraction method is redundant. Please correct it to a concise description.</p><p>Response: Accept. We have shortened it. See in the revision.</p><p>Comment 7: Figures: I can&#x02019;t consider the data because the figure doesn&#x02019;t have a legend.</p><p>Response: Accept. Legends have been provided.
