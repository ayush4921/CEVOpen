<p>Comment 1: This study describes a methodology for simultaneously extracting polysaccharides and triterpenes. However, the goals of bioactivity differ greatly between polysaccharides and triterpenes. For example, there are many types of triterpenes, and each triterpene has a unique bioactivity. Isnâ€™t each activity weakened by simultaneous extraction?</p>
