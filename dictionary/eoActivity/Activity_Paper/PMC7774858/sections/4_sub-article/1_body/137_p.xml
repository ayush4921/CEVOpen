<p>24. Line 170-174 of page 8, “The G. lucidum fine powder (1 g) was extracted in 150 mL flasks with varying temperatures (40 to 90�C), ethanol concentrations (20% to 80%), ultrasonic power (70 to 245 W), ratios of liquid to solid (10 to 60 mL/g), extraction times (30 to 180 min), and number of extractions (1 to 4)” was revised as “The G. lucidum fine powder (1 g) was extracted in 150 mL flasks with aqueous ethanol. The optimum extraction temperature was first determined by varying temperature from 40 to 90�C under other conditions: 40% ethanol, ultrasonic power 140 W, liquid/solid ratio 40 mL/g, extraction time 60 min, and number of extractions 1. Then, the optimum values of ethanol concentration (20%−80%), ultrasonic power (70−245 W), ratios of liquid to solid (10−60 mL/g), extraction time (30−180 min), and number of extractions (1−4) were determined sequently using determined optimal values in the extraction”.</p>
