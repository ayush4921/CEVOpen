<p>42. Line 226 of page 10, “Briefly, 2 mL sample at varying concentrations (0.1−0.5 mg/mL) was mixed with 2 mL potassium phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6), then incubated at 50�C for 20 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 2 mL trichloroacetic acid solution (10%, w/v). Then, the reaction solution (2 mL) was mixed with 0.4 mL ferric chloride (0.1%, w/v) and distilled water (2 mL), and the absorbance was measured at 700 nm against a blank after 10 min” was inserted.</p>
