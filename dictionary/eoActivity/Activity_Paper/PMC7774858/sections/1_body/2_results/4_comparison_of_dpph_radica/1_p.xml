 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g003">Fig 3A</xref> shows that the DPPH scavenging activity of polysaccharides obtained by optimized UACE and HWE showed a dosage-dependent manner, and the activity of the polysaccharides obtained by optimal UACE was higher than that of HWE in the tested concentration range. At 0.2 mg/mL, the scavenging rate of the polysaccharides from the optimized UACE was 22.16%, higher than that (16.24%) of the HWE polysaccharides. Regardless of extraction methods, the DPPH scavenging rates of polysaccharides obtained were considerably lower than that of BHT at the same concentration. The results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g003">Fig 3B</xref> indicated that there were no significant differences in the DDPH radical scavenging activity between the triterpenoid-rich extracts obtained by the optimized UACE process and the maceration method at all tested concentrations, and the activity of the two triterpenoid-rich extracts was strongly dependent on their concentration.
