<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, the polysaccharide yield increased with extraction time, until it reached the maximum value (0.44%) when extraction time was 90 min. With further extended time, the yield decreased. Triterpenoid yield increased from 0.11% to 0.35% as extraction time was increased from 30 to 120 min, and then it started to decrease. Regarding the combined performance, the 
 <italic>D</italic> value increased first and reached a maximum value (0.23) when the extraction time was 90 min, and then decreased with time. An extraction time of 90 min was therefore considered desirable in subsequent studies.
