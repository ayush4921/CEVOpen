 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g001">Fig 1C</xref> shows that the optimal ultrasonic power inputs for extraction of polysaccharides versus triterpenoids were opposite: maximum yield for polysaccharides was 0.54% at the lowest studied ultrasonic power (70 W), whereas the highest yield of triterpenoids, reaching 0.33%, was obtained when ultrasonic power applied was the highest at 245 W. As the ultrasonic power increased, the 
 <italic>D</italic> value rose and reached a peak value of 0.17 at 175 W. An ultrasonic power of 175 W was therefore desirable in the extraction.
