<p>The adequacy and reliability of the regression model was verified using three independent experiments in duplicate under the modified conditions. The experimental yield of polysaccharides was 0.63% and the triterpenoid yield reached 0.38%. The 
 <italic>D</italic> value was calculated to be 0.31, which was generally consistent with the predicted value of 0.33 given by the model. The verification experiment confirmed the precision and reliability of the model.
