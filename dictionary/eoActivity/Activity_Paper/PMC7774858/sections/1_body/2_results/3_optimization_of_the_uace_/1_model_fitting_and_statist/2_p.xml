<p>The data of statistical analysis on the fitted response surface quadratic model are listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The high model 
 <italic>F</italic>-value (4.46) and a low probability value (0.0042) indicated that the model was statistically significant. The low lack-of-fit 
 <italic>F</italic>-value (4.63) and its corresponding high 
 <italic>P</italic>-value (0.0765) indicated that the lack of fit was insignificant relative to the pure error and the model was reliable. The determination coefficient (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup>) of the regression model was 0.817, indicating that more than 81% of total variability in the response could be explained using this model. The signal-to-noise ratio was as high as 6.952, and therefore the model was considered fit and could be used to navigate the design space.
