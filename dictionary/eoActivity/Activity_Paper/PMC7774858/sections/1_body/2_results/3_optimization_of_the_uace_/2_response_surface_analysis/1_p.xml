<p>The graphical representation of response surface for Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0244749.e009">9</xref>) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The effect of ultrasonic power and extraction temperature on the 
 <italic>D</italic> value and their interactions are depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. The 
 <italic>D</italic> value increased as extraction temperature increased from 70 to approximately 80C, and then it started to decrease, but there was only a little change when varying ultrasonic power in the investigated range. The projection of the response surface indicated that there was no significant interaction between these two extraction variables. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0244749.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, a high 
 <italic>D</italic> value could be obtained by applying high levels of both ultrasonic power input and ratio of liquid to solid. When the liquid/solid ratio was low but ultrasonic power input was high, low 
 <italic>D</italic> values were readily observed, implying the poor performance of the extraction.
