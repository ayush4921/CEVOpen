 <italic>lucidum</italic> in the form of fruiting bodies, mycelium, and spores contains a broad range of bioactive compounds, including polysaccharides, triterpenoids, phenols, steroids, lectin, amino acids, nucleosides, and nucleotides [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among these, the polysaccharides and triterpenoids are receiving special attention from researchers in the field of biomedicine. Several polysaccharides such as Î²-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucans and glycoprotein are generally recognized as having the most noticeable biological activity such as antitumor, antioxidant and immunomodulatory effects among various 
 <italic>Ganoderma</italic> polysaccharides [

 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The triterpenoids from this fungus exhibit structural diversity, and many of them such as ganoderic acids Me and T (a kind of highly oxygenated lanostane-type triterpenoids) have been proven to have potent antitumor activity [
