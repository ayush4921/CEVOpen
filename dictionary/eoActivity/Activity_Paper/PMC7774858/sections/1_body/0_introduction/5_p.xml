<p>Response surface methodology (RSM), a collection of mathematical and statistical techniques, is widely used for optimizing complex processes [

 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The major advantage of RSM is the reduced number of experimental trials needed to evaluate multiple parameters and their interactions. RSM has been employed for optimizing the extraction of

As desirability functions can transform two or more responses with different relative importances into a single objective function; thus, it is a desirable approach for the optimization of a multiple-response process [
