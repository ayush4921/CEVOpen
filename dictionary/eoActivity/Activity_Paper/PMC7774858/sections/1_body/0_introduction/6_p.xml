<p>In the present study, the ultrasonic-assisted co-extraction (UACE) of polysaccharides and triterpenoids was evaluated using ultrasound technology as an attempt to better utilize

 <italic>lucidum</italic>. The extraction parameters were optimized using RSM with a desirability function by setting the equal importance for the two components. Furthermore, to provide a scientific basis for better utilization of polysaccharides and triterpenoids from the optimal UACE, their in vitro antioxidant activities were investigated and compared with those of polysaccharides and triterpenoids obtained using conventional extraction approaches. The UACE process developed here could be economically useful and convenient in the preparation of a polysaccharide- and triterpenoid-rich ingredient that holds great promise for the
