<p>In the present study, the extraction yields of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> polysaccharides and triterpenoids using the optimized UACE process were 0.63% and 0.38%, respectively. These two yields were lower than those obtained with conventional processes (polysaccharide yield of 1.52% by HWE and triterpenoid yield of 0.59% by ethanol maceration). The obtained polysaccharide yield was also lower than that observed in the ultrasonic study done by Ma et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], where a yield of 2.87% was reported, and that of Kan et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which showed 2.44% of polysaccharide yield. The low polysaccharide yield in this study may be largely due to its low solubility in aqueous ethanol, despite the use of ultrasound in the extraction. Regarding triterpenoids, the extraction yield was lower than that of the reported yield (0.97%) using microwave irradiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A reasonable explanation is that the solubility of some low polarity or non-polar triterpenoid compounds in this mushroom may be low in the extracting solvent.
