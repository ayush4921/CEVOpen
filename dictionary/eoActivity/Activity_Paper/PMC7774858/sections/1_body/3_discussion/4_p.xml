<p>The triterpenoids of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> are related to its many important biological activities. In the present study, based on the DPPH radical scavenging activity and evaluation of reducing power, the antioxidant activity of triterpenoid-rich extracts of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> obtained under optimized UACE process did not alter by ultrasonic treatment in the process when compared with those obtained using the conventional ethanol maceration method. This may be because the triterpenoids have a relatively simple and stable chemical structure compared with the high-molecular-weight polysaccharides. Therefore, the ultrasonic conditions applied in this work did not lead to a significant detrimental effect on their chemical properties and therefore bioactivity. However, further studies would be needed to investigate the change in patterns of extracted triterpenoids of 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> during the extraction by ultrasound.
