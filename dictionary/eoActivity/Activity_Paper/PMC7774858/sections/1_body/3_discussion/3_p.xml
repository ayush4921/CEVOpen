<p>Extraction processes influencing the bioactivity of extracts have been reported widely [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For fungal polysaccharides, a large number of factors, including their chemical components, molecular mass, structure, and conformation, can remarkably affect their antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the present study, the polysaccharides obtained by optimized UACE showed a higher antioxidant activity than that of polysaccharides obtained by the HWE method. Ultrasonic treatment in the extraction leading to the increase in antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides of longan fruit pericarp was also demonstrated, and the underlying mechanism has been attributed to the degradation of high molecular weight polysaccharides and further changes in chemical structure caused by acoustic cavitation effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides from common mullein (
 <italic>Verbascum thapsus</italic> L.) flowers was also shown to be enhanced by ultrasound in the extraction [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We therefore postulated that the degradation of polysaccharides by the action of ultrasound and a higher portion of low-molecular-weight polysaccharides extracted from the matrice may be responsible for the higher antioxidant activity. The difference in the polysaccharide purity between the two extracted polysaccharides may also be a factor.
