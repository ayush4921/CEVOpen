<p>The single-factor experiment was carried out to determine the preliminary range of the extraction variables. The 
 <italic>G</italic>. 
 <italic>lucidum</italic> fine powder (1 g) was extracted in 150 mL flasks with aqueous ethanol. The optimum extraction temperature was first determined by varying temperature from 40 to 90C under other conditions: 40% ethanol, ultrasonic power 140 W, liquid/solid ratio 40 mL/g, extraction time 60 min, and number of extractions 1. Then, the optimum values of ethanol concentration (20%−80%), ultrasonic power (70−245 W), ratios of liquid to solid (10−60 mL/g), extraction time (30−180 min), and number of extractions (1−4) were determined sequently using determined optimal values in the extraction. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate. The extraction yields of polysaccharides and triterpenoids were determined, and the 
 <italic>D</italic> values were calculated.
