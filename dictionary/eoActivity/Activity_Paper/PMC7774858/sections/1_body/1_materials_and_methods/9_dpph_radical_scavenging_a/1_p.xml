<p>DPPH radical scavenging activity was determined using a method as described previously by Blois [
 <xref rid="pone.0244749.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with some modifications. Two milliliters of 0.2 mM DPPH in ethanol was added to 2 mL sample at different polysaccharide or triterpenoid concentrations in the range of 0.1−0.5 mg/mL. After vortexing, the mixture was kept for 15 min in the dark at 30C. The absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (TU-1810, Beijing Puxi General Instrument Co. Ltd., China). Ethanol was used as the negative control instead of DPPH, as well as the blank. Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as a positive control. DPPH scavenging rate was calculated according to the following equation:
