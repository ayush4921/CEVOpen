<p>It is rather out of the point to determine the antioxidant activity of a mix of compounds, particularly using only DPPH assay as noted by Reviewer #3. I can suggest the authors to isolate dominant polysaccharides and triterpenes and to further test their antioxidant activities employing multiple common assays in order to match the theme of the main manuscript title. One of the possibilities can be to shift the manuscript theme to the extraction methodology solely (as proposed by Reviewer #3), which, in the other hand, would decrease the manuscript informativeness. The Discussion section must deepened as per reviewers' suggestions. Language should be considerably revised in order to increase readability and overall presentation clarity.</p>
