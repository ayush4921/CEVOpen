<p>Authors have addressed all the major concerns raised in the reviewers' reports. However, one sentence in the conclusion section fails to present the verity of the study: "The antioxidant activity of the polysaccharides was enhanced by ultrasound."(L480), which does not hold the true since it means that you have somehow extracted polysaccharides, measured their antiox activity, let out the ultrasound through them and, measured their antiox activity once again and, finally, compared the two values. Please elaborate this.</p>
