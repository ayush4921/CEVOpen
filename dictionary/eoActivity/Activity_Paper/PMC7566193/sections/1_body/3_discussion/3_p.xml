 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. possess high adaptive capability for surviving in many extreme environmental conditions and their incidence had been documented in diverse extreme habitats including frozen soils, deserts, oceans, Arctic and Antarctic regions (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">Zothanpuia et al., 2018</xref>). Studies in frozen soils, Arctic and Antarctic regions had revealed a great diversity of cultivable 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2016b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kamjam et al., 2019</xref>), while in marine and deserts, 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. had been reported as one of the dominant culturable genera (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Okoro et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Prieto-Davo et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates were isolated from near-root soils of the studied plant communities from an altitude of 2200 to 5130 m on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with variances in diversity on different sites. By contrast, four 
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> isolates and one potential novel genus just detected in 
 <italic>Salsola collina</italic> Pall of 2200 m (QLS27, QLS44), 
 <italic>Stipa glareosa</italic> PA Smirn of 2200 m (QLS96), 
 <italic>P. saudersiana</italic> Royle of 2800 m (QLS42) and 
 <italic>Arenaria kansuensis</italic> Maxim of 3800 m (QLS54) from the Laohu Ditch. This may be attributed to high dependency of the rare actinomycetes (
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> spp. and the potential new genus) upon their living conditions, with a relatively narrow ecological niche (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Horner-Devine et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, differences in the basic nutrients such as energy, carbon and nitrogen sources necessary for actinomycetes supplied by vegetation litter and/or plant root exudates, could cause variation in actinobacterial composition (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Rasche et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). For example, isolates with 98–100% 16S rDNA sequence identities to 28 species of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. were detected in 20 plant communities along different altitudes on the Tibetan Plateau. Compared to the frequent occurrence of members related to 
 <italic>S. cavourensis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. griseus</italic> in different plant communities at the increasing altitudes, quite a few 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates specifically occurred in near-root soils of diverse plant communities at varying altitudes. This finding implied that a high degree of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. diversity could adapt to the extreme alpine habitats and different plants may be selective to their root-associated 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adil et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Naylor et al., 2017</xref>). Noticeably, isolates with 99–100% 16S rDNA sequence identities to 
 <italic>S. chryseus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. rectiviolaceus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. bottropensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. cyaneofuscatus</italic> were detected in both of the studied geographically diverse cold environments. Furthermore, based on the same taxonomy according to the 16S rDNA sequences, the occurrence of some 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates in the studied extreme alpine habitats was observed in other extreme environments as well. For example, members related to 
 <italic>S. griseus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. rimosus</italic> had been isolated even from thermophilic environment (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Shivlata and Satyanarayana, 2015</xref>). Isolate ISP 5300 affiliated to 
 <italic>S. cavourensis</italic> had been reported as an alkaliphilic 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species by 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Mikami et al. (1982)</xref>. And two isolates M-169 and M-157 related to 
 <italic>S. cyaneofuscatus</italic> explored in deep-sea were found to produce novel antimicrobial and antitumor compounds (
