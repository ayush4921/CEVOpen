<p>The phenotypic properties of the isolates were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. From the Laohu Ditch, more than half of the 78 isolates produced catalase, lipase 2, urease, gelatinase, lipase 3 amylase. H
 <sub>2</sub>S, lipase 1, pigment and organic acid producing isolates accounted for 48.7, 44.9, 33.3, and 17.9% of the total isolates, respectively. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, H
 <sub>2</sub>S, organic acid, diffusible pigment and various extracellular enzymes producing isolates were widely distributed in the five altitudes, with diffusible pigment, urease, H
 <sub>2</sub>S, lipase 1, lipase 3 and protease producing isolates dominating at 2800 m, amylase and lipase 1 producing isolates predominant at 3350 m, organic acid producing isolates dominating at 4200 m. However, as displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref> the proportion of H
 <sub>2</sub>S, organic acid, diffusible pigment and extracellular enzymes producing isolates demonstrated great discrepancy in near-root soils of different plant communities. Catalase and urease producing isolates were distributed across 15 plant communities; lipase 2, protease producing isolates occurred in 14 plants; amylase, H
 <sub>2</sub>S, diffusible pigment producing isolates occurred in 13 plants, and lipase 1, lipase 3 in 12 plants, organic acid producing isolates only occurred in 10 plants. In addition, H
 <sub>2</sub>S, organic acid, diffusible pigment and various enzymes producing isolates frequently occurred in two medicinal plants,
