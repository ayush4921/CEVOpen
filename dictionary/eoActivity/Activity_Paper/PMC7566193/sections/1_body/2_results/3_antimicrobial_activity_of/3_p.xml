<p>In this study, the distinct phenotypic characters and antimicrobial activities were detected among isolates with identical 16S rDNA sequences as shown in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Though apparent division of the isolates to different clusters in accordance with the 16S rDNA sequences, there was just as much physiological variation among the isolates within the same clusters obtained from the same area, as among the isolates with identical 16S rDNA sequences but in disparate area, such as isolates with 99–100% 16S rDNA sequence identities to
