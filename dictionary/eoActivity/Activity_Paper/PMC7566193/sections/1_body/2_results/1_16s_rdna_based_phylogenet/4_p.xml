<p>As shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">–4</xref>, isolates with 99–100% 16S rDNA sequence similarity to 
 <italic>S. cavourensis</italic> widely distributed in different plant communities across five altitudes on the Laohu Ditch. While isolates with 99–100% 16S rDNA sequence identity to 
 <italic>S. griseus</italic> predominated among the isolates on the Gaize County area, constituting 32% of the total isolates. In addition, isolates with 99–100% 16S rDNA sequence identities to 
 <italic>S. rectiviolaceus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. chryseus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. cyaneofuscatus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. bottropensis</italic> occurred both in the Laohu Ditch and Gaize County area. However, variances of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates in the Laohu Ditch and Gaize County area were observed. For example, isolates with 99–100% 16S rDNA sequence identities to 
 <italic>S. specialis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptomyces goshikiensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptomyces aurantiacus</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptomyces nojiriensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Streptomyces purpureus</italic> only occurred at 2800, 3350, 3800, 4200, and 5130 m, respectively.
