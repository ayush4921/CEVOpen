<p>As the dominant isolates, a phylogenetic tree displaying the relationships between 73 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates in this study, and between them and their nearest relatives from GenBank, was also constructed as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. This allowed the sorting of the sequences into two disparate groups, designed as Groups I and II. In Group I, the single isolate QLS81 from near-root soil of 
 <italic>Potentilla saudersiana</italic> Royle at 2800 m, a putatively new species of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. to be furtherly confirmed by DNA-DNA pairing value, formed a distinct branch with the highest 16S rDNA sequence similarity of 99% to the type strain of 
 <italic>Streptomyces specialis</italic>. Strikingly, it can produce substantial diffusible black pigment which biological significances needed to be furtherly explored (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In Group II, 52 out of the 72 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> isolates formed relatively distinct phyletic lines with their 16S rDNA sequences showing 99 to 100% similarities to their type strains obtained from the GenBank database. Interestingly, 42 isolates amongst the 52 isolates were sorted into ten clusters, with most of the isolates originating from the same plant assigned to the same cluster. Cluster 1 consisted of 10 isolates showing 99–100% similarity to the sequence of 
 <italic>Streptomyces cavourensis</italic>. One isolate was obtained from 
 <italic>Ceratoides latens</italic> Reveal &amp; N.H. Holmgren at 2200 m, four (QLS40, QLS67, QLS84, and QLS87) from 
 <italic>Astragalus licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. at 2800 m, the other two (QLS02 and QLS09) from 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. at 4200 m, one (QLS85) from 
 <italic>Androsace umbellata</italic> (Lour.) Merr. at 3800 m, and two (QLS18 and QLS22) from 
 <italic>Leontopodium leontopodoides</italic> Beauverd and 
 <italic>Potentilla fruticosa</italic> L. at 3350 m, respectively. Four isolates in Cluster 2 showing 99–100% identity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces anulatus</italic>, were found in 
 <italic>Salsola collina</italic> Pall at 2200 m (QLS04), 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. at 2800 m (QLS31), 
 <italic>P. fruticosa</italic> L. at 3350 m (QLS13) and 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. at 4200 m (QLS29). Cluster 3 consisting of 5 isolates displaying 99–100% identity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces microflavus</italic> could be divided into two sub-clusters. Two isolates, QLS03 and QLS08 from 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. at 4200 m, with brown pigmented aerial mycelium and brown diffusible pigment, respectively, formed a distinct sub-clade; While isolates QLS16 from 
 <italic>Arenaria kansuensis</italic> Maxim at 3800 m, QLS17 from 
 <italic>Saussurea japonica</italic> Kuntze at 3350 m, QLS19 from 
 <italic>Poa annua</italic> L. at 3800 m producing pale yellow, deep yellow and labile yellow diffusible pigments, respectively, formed another sub-clade. Cluster 4 contained 3 isolates from 
 <italic>Saussurea japonica</italic> Kuntze at 3350 m showing 99–100% similarity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces cyaneofuscatus</italic>. And 3 isolates in Cluster 5 showing 99% identity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces aureus</italic> were isolated from 
 <italic>Rhodiola quadrifida</italic> Fisch. &amp; C.A. Mey at 3350 m. Cluster 6 containing three isolates showing 99–100% similarity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces chryseus</italic> were obtained from 
 <italic>R. quadrifida</italic> Fisch. &amp; C.A. Mey at 3350 m. Two isolates in Cluster 7, QLS62, and QLS68 from 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. at 4200, 2800 m, respectively, demonstrated 99% similarity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces enissocaesilis</italic>. Cluster 8 consisted of 4 isolates (QLS10, QLS82, QLS74, and QLS24), obtained from 
 <italic>Ceratoides latens</italic> Reveal &amp; N.H. Holmgren at 2200 m, 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. at 2800 m, 
 <italic>R. quadrifida</italic> Fisch. &amp; C.A. Mey at 3350 m and 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. at 4200 m, respectively, showing 99–100% identity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces agglomeratus</italic>. And Cluster 9 consisted of 5 isolates showing 99–100% identity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces durmitorensis</italic>, isolated from 
 <italic>P. saudersiana</italic> Royle (QLS33) and 
 <italic>A. licentianus</italic> Hand.-Mazz. (QLS45, QLS50, QLS76, and QLS77) at 2800 m. Cluster 10 contained three isolates from 
 <italic>Ceratoides latens</italic> Reveal &amp; N.H. Holmgren (QLS11, QLS80) and 
 <italic>Stipa glareosa</italic> PA Smirn (QLS37) at 2200 m.
