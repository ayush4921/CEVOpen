<p>Seventy eight actinomycetes with representative phenotypes were recovered from the Laohu Ditch, and the 16S rDNA sequencing revealed that the predominant genus was 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> (73 isolates), followed by 
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> (4 isolates), and one isolate with only 92% sequence similarity to its nearest match 
 <italic>Micromonospora saelicesensis</italic> from the GenBank database, indicating that it may be a potential novel isolate at genus level. The phylogenetic tree demonstrating the relationship between the genera 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. (randomly selected representative sequences of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp.), 
 <italic>Nocardia</italic> spp., and 
 <italic>Micromonospora</italic> spp. was presented on
