<p>From the Gaize County area, fifty isolates with typical colony morphologies were obtained and they all pertained to 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> spp. according to the 16S rDNA sequencing. The phylogenetic tree exhibiting the relationships between the fifty isolates, and between them and their closest relatives, was presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, isolate QZGYFj1 from 
 <italic>Stipa capillata</italic> L. at 5018 m, solely formed a distinct phyletic branch, although it demonstrated 98% sequence similarity to its nearest match 
 <italic>Streptomyces rimosus</italic>, indicating that it may be a potential new isolate. Isolate QZGYEb4 from 
 <italic>Stipa purpurea</italic> Griseb. at 5020 m, showing 99% identity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces rectiviolaceus</italic>, formed relatively phylogenetically distinct clade. While isolate QZGYEd3 solely formed relatively distinct phyletic line. The 47 remaining isolates were assigned to seven clusters. Cluster I contained 16 isolates distributing in 
 <italic>S. capillata</italic> L. at 5018 m, 
 <italic>Carex moocroftii</italic> Falc. ex Boott at 5056 m, 
 <italic>Kobresia pygmaea</italic> C.B. Clarke at 5100 m and 
 <italic>Dracocephalum heterophyllum</italic> Benth at 5130 m, exhibiting 99–100% similarity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces griseus</italic>. Cluster II containing four isolates at 5056 m demonstrated 99–100% identity to 
 <italic>S. cyaneofuscatus</italic>. Cluster III consisted of 5 isolates distributing at 5020, 5018, 5100, and 5130 m, showing 99–100% identity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces bottropensis</italic>. Cluster IV consisted of three isolates QZGYEb5, QZGYEb2 and QZGYEc1, with isolates QZGYEc1 at 5130 m and QZGYEb2 at 5018 m forming a subclade. And three isolates in Cluster V displayed 99% similarity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces subrutilus</italic>, with QZGYFe2 and QZGYEf1 at 5056 m and QZGYFc8 at 5130 m. Cluster VI contained eight isolates, with four isolates, QZGYFd1 and QZGYFc5 at 5130 m, QZGYFa1 and QZGYFb3 at 5020 m forming a sub-cluster, while another four isolates clustering together showing 99–100% similarity to 
 <italic>Streptomyces phaeochromogenes</italic>. And eight isolates in Cluster VII distributed at 5020, 5056, and 5130 m, with 3 isolates forming a sub-cluster and the other 5 clustering together demonstrating 99–100% identity to 
 <italic>S. chryseus</italic>.
