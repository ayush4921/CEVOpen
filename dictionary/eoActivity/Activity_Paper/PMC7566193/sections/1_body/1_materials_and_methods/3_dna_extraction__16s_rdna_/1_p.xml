<p>Total DNA were extracted from subcultures as described by 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Orsini and Romano-Spica (2001)</xref> with minor adjustment. Briefly, fresh biomass (around 50 mg) was suspended in 1 mL washing solution [50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.7, 25 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)]. After centrifuging at 12,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min, the biomass was resuspended in 100 μl lysis solution (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, 3% SDS, 1.2% PVP) and heated in a microwave oven at 700 W for 45 s, then added 400 μl preheated (65°C) extraction solution (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3 M sodium acetate, 1.2% PVP). The DNA pellet was phenol−chloroform extracted, precipitated in isopropyl alcohol, washed with 70% ethanol, air-dried at room temperature then resuspended in deionized distilled water for use. The universal bacterial primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1504R (5′-TTAAGGATGGTGATGCCGCA-3′) were used for amplification of 16S rDNA sequences, and the PCR amplication was performed as follows: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 56°C for annealing and 2 min at 72°C for extension, and a final extension for 8 min at 72°C. The PCR products were confirmed by electrophoresis in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide in TAE buffer, then sent to purify and cycle sequencing using an ABI3100 automated sequencer at Beijing Sangon Biotech (Beijing, China).
