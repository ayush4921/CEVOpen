<p>Nine reference compounds, including mangiferin, nigricin, germanaism B, irisolidone-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside, iristectorigenin B, tectoridin, irisolidone, irigenin, and 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,5′-tetramethoxyisoflavone were previously isolated from the rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> and 
 <italic>I. pseudacorus</italic>. The compounds were obtained by column chromatography (silica gel), identified spectroscopically and their purity was determined using UV, IR, and HPLC-MS methods. HPLC grade methanol and acetonitrile were used for the HPLC analysis. Gallic acid, and caffeic acid (purity ≥ 98.0%) (Sigma-Aldrich GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland), and HPLC grade glacial acetic acid (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland) were used in the experiments. Other solvents and chemicals were of analytical grade.
