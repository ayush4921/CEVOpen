<p>Separation of the samples’ components was carried out with the ACQUITY H-class UPLC system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (50 × 2.1 mm, particle size 1.7 µm) (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Gradient elution was performed with 0.1% formic acid water solution (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), the flow rate at 0.5 mL/min. The following proportions of the solvent system were applied using a linear gradient profile B: Initial 5%, 3 min. 30%, 7 min. 50%, 7 to 8 min. 95%, 15 to 16 min. 5%. Xevo TQD triple quadrupole mass spectrometer detector (Waters) was used to obtain MS/MS data. Positive electrospray ionization was applied with the following settings: Capillary voltage was 1.5 kV, source temperature was 150 °C, desolvation temperature was 350 °C, with a desolvation gas flow 650 l/h, cone gas flow was 25 l/h. Collision energy and cone voltage were optimized for each compound separately. Collision energy varied in the range from 6eV to 20 eV and cone voltage was selected from 8 V to 38 V.</p>
