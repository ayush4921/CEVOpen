<p>The air-dried materials were ground to a fine powder using a laboratory mill. The powdered materials of 
 <italic>Iris</italic> rhizomes (0.1 g, 60 mesh) were weighed into a volumetric flask, and methanol (10 mL) was used for extraction. The flask was placed in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature (20 ± 2 °C) for 30 min. The solutions were filtered through a membrane filter (0.45 μm) into vials made of glass. An aliquot of 20 μL was injected twice into the HPLC system for analysis. The reference compounds were used to prepare the standard solutions at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL in methanol and were used for calibration. The samples were stored at 4 °C before use.
