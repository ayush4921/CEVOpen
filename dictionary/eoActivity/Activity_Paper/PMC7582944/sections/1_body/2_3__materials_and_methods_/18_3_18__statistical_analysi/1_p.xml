<p>The processing of HPLC data was carried out using the LabSolutions Analysis Data System (Shimadzu). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison using Prism v.5.04 (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA, chemical composition), by Dunnet’s test (GraphPad Prism 6.0, GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA, anti-allergic assay), or Student’s t-test (SigmaPlot, Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA, anti-inflammatory assay). Values with 
 <italic>p</italic>-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The results were expressed as means ± SD (chemical analysis) or S.E.M (anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and antioxidant assays) values of at least three independent measurements unless otherwise specified. Two definitions were carried out in the chemical analysis.
