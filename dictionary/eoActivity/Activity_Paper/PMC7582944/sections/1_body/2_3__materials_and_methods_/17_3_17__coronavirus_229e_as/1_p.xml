<p>The protective effects of the samples against human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229) was determined based on the previously described method [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The Huh7 cells line (human liver carcinoma cell line) was obtained from Dr. Rei-Lin Kuo (Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan). The cells were infected with nine times the Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of each coronavirus 229E in the presence or absence of the compounds or vehicle. After incubation at 33 Â°C for 6 days, the surviving cells were then stained with MTT (3-[4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide). The percentage of surviving cells was then calculated.
