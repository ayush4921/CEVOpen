<p>The separation of phenolic compounds was carried out using an ACE C
 <sub>18</sub> column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5.0 μm; Zorbax Eclipse Plus, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The flow rate of elution was 1 mL/min. The solvent system comprised solvent A (0.1% acetic acid in water) and solvent B (acetonitrile). An ultrasonic bath was used for degassing, then all solvents were filtered using a filter with a 0.22 μm membrane. A linear gradient program was applied: 0–8 min, 5–15% B; 8–30 min, 15–20% B; 30–48 min, 20–40% B; 48–58 min, 40–50% B; 58–65 min, 50%; 65–66 min, 50–95% B. The temperature of the column was constant at 25 °C. The injection volume of the sample solution was adjusted at 20 μL. The chromatograms were recorded at 269 nm (
