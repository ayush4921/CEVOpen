<p>The identification of the compounds 
 <bold>1</bold>â€“
 <bold>11</bold> was achieved by HPLC analysis. The retention time (Rt), UV, MS/MS spectra of the peaks in the samples were compared with those of the authentic reference compounds. The purity of the compounds was evaluated by a diode array detector coupled with the HPLC system. The UV spectra of each peak were compared with those of the authentic reference compounds and/or by assessment of the MS/MS spectra.
