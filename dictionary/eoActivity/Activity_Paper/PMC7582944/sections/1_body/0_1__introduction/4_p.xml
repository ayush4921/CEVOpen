<p>The global distribution of 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. along with their potent biological activities have encouraged many research groups to study their metabolic profiles. Several reports have discussed the isolation and purification of new isoflavones from 
 <italic>Iris</italic> rhizomes [

Scientists had to purify the new compounds using tedious chromatographic techniques and to identify the structures of the compounds using several spectroscopic techniques. These techniques are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and use excessive amounts of solvents [
