<p>The retention times and fragmentation pattern of the investigated compounds [M − H]
 <sup>−</sup> in the negative mode (MS
 <sup>n</sup> spectra) were compared with the spectra of the standards. Eleven peaks were thus identified, including gallic acid (
 <bold>1</bold>), mangiferin (
 <bold>2</bold>), caffeic acid (
 <bold>3</bold>), tectoridin (
 <bold>4</bold>), germanaism B (or nigricin 4′-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside) (
 <bold>5</bold>), irisolidone-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-
 <italic>β</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside (
 <bold>6</bold>), iristectorigenin B (
 <bold>7</bold>), nigricin (or irisolone) (
 <bold>8</bold>), irigenin (
 <bold>9</bold>), 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,5′-tetramethoxyisoflavone (
 <bold>10</bold>), and irisolidone (
 <bold>11</bold>). All these polyphenolic compounds were qualitatively and quantitatively determined in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. pallida, I. hungaric</italic>a, and 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic>. For 
 <italic>I. sibirica</italic>, only six constituents were identified, including five isoflavonoids (
 <bold>4, 5</bold>, 
 <bold>7</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, and 
 <bold>9</bold>), mangiferin (
 <bold>2</bold>), and caffeic acid (
 <bold>3</bold>). These compounds were detected in the studied 
 <italic>I.</italic> species for the first time. The chromatograms of all reference standards were recorded at 269 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04588-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The sum of all major peaks area accounted for more than 90% of the total peak area in all chromatograms. The highest content of phenolic compounds was detected in the extracts of 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> and 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes compared with other tested 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. (
