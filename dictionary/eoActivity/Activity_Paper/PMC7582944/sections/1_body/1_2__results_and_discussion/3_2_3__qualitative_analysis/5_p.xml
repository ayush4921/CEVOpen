<p>Mangiferin is the most widespread C-glycosylxanthone in 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It was identified in 47 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. and subspecies, whereas its isomer isomangiferin was detected in 41 species [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Mangiferin possesses a chemotaxonomic value for 
 <italic>Iris</italic> plants on the tribe, subgenus, section, and series levels. The Irideae and Tigrideae tribes may be distinguished from other Iridaceae tribes by the presence of mangiferin. In general, isoflavones were detected as the major components and could be considered as chemotaxonomic markers for these 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp.
