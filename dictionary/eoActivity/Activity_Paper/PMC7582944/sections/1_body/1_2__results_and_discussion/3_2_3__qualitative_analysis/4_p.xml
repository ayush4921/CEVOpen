<p>In a previous report, tectoridin was identified in 
 <italic>I. crocea</italic> and 
 <italic>I. tectorum</italic> rhizomes by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS [
 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The presence of mangiferin and irigenin in 
 <italic>I. germanica</italic> rhizomes was also demonstrated by the same authors. Also, isoflavonoids such as mangiferin, tectoridin, tectorigenin, irigenin, iristectorin A, iristectorin B, iridinirisflorentin, dichotomitin, and irilone were identified in the rhizomes of 
 <italic>I. dichotoma</italic> grown in China [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, the quantitative analysis of these compounds was never carried out. In the current investigation, gallic acid was only identified in 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> and 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes, while caffeic acid was observed in all analyzed samples.
