<p>To the best of our knowledge, there was no previous report on the qualitative and quantitative determination of isoflavones such as iristectorigenin B, germanaism B, irisolidone-D-glucoside, its aglycone, nigricin, and 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,5′-tetramethoxyisoflavone in 
 <italic>Iris</italic> raw materials. In a previous study, 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,5′-tetramethoxyisoflavone (
 <bold>10</bold>), a new natural compound, was isolated from 
 <italic>I. pseudacorus</italic> [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In the current study, this compound was also identified in the other 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. Its amount varied from 1.056 ± 0.002 mg/g in 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic>, 0.457 ± 0.003 mg/g in 
 <italic>I. pallida</italic> to the highest amount (1.512 ± 0.013 mg/g) in 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic>. Caffeic acid (
 <bold>3</bold>) was found in all species with the amount ranging from 0.227 to 1.515 mg/g, and the highest content was detected in 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes.
