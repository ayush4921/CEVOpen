<p>Studies on 
 <italic>I. pallida</italic> from Ukraine indicated that it does not contain a high quantity of phenolic compounds compared with other species. According to the published data [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], this species contains isoflavones irigenin, iristectorigenin A, nigricin, nigricanin, irisflorentin, iriskumaonin methyl ether, irilone, iriflogenin, and 
 <italic>cis</italic>- and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-α-irone. In the current investigation, high amounts of irigenin (
 <bold>9</bold>) (3.199 ± 0.034 mg/g) and tectoridin (
 <bold>4</bold>) (1.642 ± 0.023 mg/g) were detected. According to our knowledge, tectoridin, germanaism B, irisolidone-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucoside, iristectorigenin B, irisolidone, and 5,6-dihydroxy-7,8,3′,5′-tetramethoxyisoflavone, were identified for the first time in 
 <italic>I. pallida</italic> by HPLC analysis.
