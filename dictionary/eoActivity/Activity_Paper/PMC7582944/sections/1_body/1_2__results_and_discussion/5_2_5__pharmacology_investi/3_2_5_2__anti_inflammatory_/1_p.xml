<p>The respiratory burst and degranulation of neutrophils are important processes in the maintenance of human health, but they need careful regulation to prevent the development of chronic and auto-immune diseases. Superoxide is a major radical produced by neutrophils and its excessive amount contributes to several acute and chronic diseases, including lung injury, sepsis, or arthritis [

 <italic>Iris</italic> extracts on superoxide anion generation and elastase release triggered by fMLF in CB-primed human neutrophils. The results revealed that the water extracts of 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> and 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes showed anti-inflammatory potential and inhibited superoxide anion generation at 10 Î¼g/mL by 41.0% and 45.7%, respectively (

 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes showed enhancing effects on elastase release by human neutrophils and thus may have immune-promoting effects related to degranulation. The observed effects of 
 <italic>Iris</italic> water extracts may be correlated to the abundant isoflavone content.
