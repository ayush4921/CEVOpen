<p>Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a nuclear transcription factor usually activated in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS). NRF2 increases the antioxidant capability of all cells in response to stress, thus its activation is beneficial for health. It is also known that the level of NRF2 indicates the antioxidant capacity of the cells and its increase is linked with the enhanced ability to scavenge radicals [
