<p>The HPLC-ABTS co-elution system represents a convenient method to analyze the antioxidant components in the plant crude extract [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The radical scavenging activities, which were expressed as Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), varied among the 
 <italic>Iris</italic> rhizomes water and ethanol extracts (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04588-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>I. variegata</italic> water extracts was the lowest (TEAC 2.92 ± 0.07 µmol/g) (

 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> showed a potent antioxidant capacity for the water extract (TEAC 23.11 ± 0.90 µmol/g) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04588-f004">Figure 4</xref>b), and the ethanol extract showed the highest total antioxidant capacity (TEAC 50.32 ± 1.09 µmol/g) (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-04588-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The extracts possessed antioxidant activity due to the presence of gallic acid, mangiferin, and caffeic acid. This can be explained by the fact that phenolic compounds are potent antioxidants [

 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] due to their high redox potential allowing them to become hydrogen donors and singlet oxygen quenchers [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-04588" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The established antioxidant activity of the extracts was correlated with the content of the identified compounds. The higher the content of mangiferin, caffeic acid, and gallic acid, the higher the antioxidant activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04588-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Higher amounts of mangiferin in 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> together with gallic acid in the ethanolic extract accounted for more potent antioxidant capacity of the plant extract in comparison with water extracts. The obtained results were in good agreement with the previous studies [
