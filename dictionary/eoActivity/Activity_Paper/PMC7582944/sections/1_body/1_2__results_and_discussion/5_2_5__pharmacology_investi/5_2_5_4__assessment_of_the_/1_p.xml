<p>The incidence of allergic diseases is dramatically increasing and the search for new drugs from natural sources is of great importance. We used a degranulation assay to evaluate the anti-allergic effect of 
 <italic>Iris</italic> sp. To ascertain non-false positive effects of the samples that could be caused by the inhibition of cell viability, all samples were evaluated for toxicity against RBL-2H3 (rat basophilic leukemia cells) using MTT viability assay. The samples were found to be nontoxic (viability was over 96% compared with the control) at 100 μg/mL (

 <italic>β</italic>-hexosaminidase release detection assay) induced either by calcium ionophore (A23187) or antigen (anti-DNP IgE plus DNP-BSA). Calcium ionophore serves as a direct activator by facilitating calcium influx into the cell, while antigen mimics the physiological conditions of IgE-antigen complex binding to the FcεRI receptor on the mast cell membrane [

 <italic>I. variegata</italic> rhizomes (100 μg/mL) inhibited the degranulation of mast cells stimulated by A23187 or antigen with 38.3% and 27.0%, respectively, and the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>I. hungarica</italic> rhizomes (100 μg/mL) 22.0% and 46.7%, respectively (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04588-t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>). Dexamethasone, a positive control, inhibited A23187- or antigen-induced 
 <italic>β</italic>-hexosaminidase release by 65.7% and 66.3%, respectively.
