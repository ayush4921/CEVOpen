<p>Triterpenes and steroids are common secondary metabolites in plants. Now, nine compounds with clear structure have been isolated from TDG. The major compounds include 6’-O-benzoyldaucosterol (57), daucosterol (58), β-sitosterol (59), taraxerone (60), taraxerol (61), ergosterol (62), α-amyrin (63), oleanolic acid (64) (
