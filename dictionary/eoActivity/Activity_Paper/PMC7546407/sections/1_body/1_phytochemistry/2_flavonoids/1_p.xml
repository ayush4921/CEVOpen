<p>Flavonoids and their glycosides are considered to be one of the most abundant chemical constituents of TDG, with a lot of research results. At present, most of the studies are mainly focused on the roots of the medicinal part of TDG, while the studies on the aerial part are less. At the same time, some studies have found that the aerial part of TDG contains many active substances, which have functions such as anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, and so on. In addition, some researchers also measure the total flavone content of different batches of TDG, and they determine the total flavone content in the range of 0.18–0.66% (
