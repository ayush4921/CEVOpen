 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">Yang (2008)</xref> utilize bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced animal models of immune liver injury in mice to study the protective effect of TDG on immune liver injury, and detected the changes of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum, as well as the lipid peroxidation products malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver tissues. The transformations of the above indicators prove that the liver injury is alleviated to some extent. Moreover, in some studies, both total amino acids and polysaccharide components in TDG exert certain protective effects on acute liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>) in mice (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). However, these experiments are unable to elucidate the molecular mechanism of hepatoprotective effect of TDG. The treatments of TDG given to rats with chronic liver injury induced by CCl
 <sub>4</sub> reduce the levels of ALT, AST, and total bilirubin (T-Bili) in blood serum. Apart from that, the administration of TDG also decreases the expression levels of total protein (TP), albumin (ALB) as well as numerical value of A/G. These finding suggest that TDG has a good protective effect on the liver. Laminin (LN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) are considered as the indicators of liver fibrosis, with their changes reflecting the degree of liver lesions. TDG could notably inhibit the abnormal increase of HA and LN, revealing that TDG possesses a remarkable anti-fibrosis effect (

The superfine particles of TDG obtained through a novel superfine particle processing technique, and the results show that the superfine particles of TDG hinder the up-regulation of ALT and AST levels, reduce MDA levels, and decrease the expression of Bax and caspase-3 proteins. Moreover, the superfine particles of TDG enhances SOD activity and apparently improves histopathological lesions. These investigations suggest that the hepatoprotective effects of SPRT are likely connected to the free radical scavenging effect (

A preliminary exploration is carried out in hepato-protective effects of TDG, which is commonly used by treating of hepatitis and liver fibrosis in the clinic, but little is known about the therapeutic material basis and related mechanism of action.
