 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2016)</xref> confirm that the flavonoids from TDG (10–160 μg/ml) can reduce the excretion of pro-inflammatory factors and increase the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines in LPS induced cell inflammation model, and find that the flavonoids from TDG can reverse the up-regulation of TLR4, MD-2, MyD88, and TLR4/MD-2 complex expression, so as to affect photosynthesis and activity of TLR4/MD-2 mediated NF JB and JNK pathway. Similar researches have shown that the flavonoids from TDG ameliorates inflammation through JNK, p38, and Nrf2 pathways, inhibits oxidative stress reactions caused by morphological (both cell and nucleus) changes and inflammation. In addition, the flavonoids from TDG has good biological properties in anti-inflammatory, cytoprotective, and anti-aging active (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al. (2019)</xref> establish a ConA-induced mouse hepatitis model to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of total flavonoids in TDG, taking bifendate as a positive control, which turns out that pretreatment with total flavonoids from TDG can reduce the serum levels of ALT and AST, pro-infammatory (IL-17 and IL-6) in serum and the proportions of Th17 cells in spleen. In the meantime, pretreatment with total flavonoids from TDG could increase the percentage of Treg cells in spleen and the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, IL-10 in serum. Furthermore, Foxp3 and RORγt are liver-specific transcription factors, respectively, an essential transcription factor in the development of Treg cells or Th17 cells. The experimental results show that the expression of Foxp3 increases while that of RORγt decreases. The effect is mediated by regulating Treg/Th17 immune homeostasis. However, some of these results did not design

In addition to total flavonoids from TDG, the polysaccharide from the root have been confirmed as the main active components of the antipyretic and anti-inflammatory of TDG. The results show that the polysaccharide has a strong antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effect through the experiments of different animal models, but the mechanism of its action is not clear (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al.

 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2018a)</xref> isolate alkaloids from the aerial part of TDG for the first time, three of which have good anti-inflammatory activity. Besides, the results demonstrate that the crude extract of aerial part of TDG attenuate the phosphorylation of three major MAPKs (JNK, ERK, and p38), whereas S-(-)-trolline inhibits only the activity of ERK-MAPK, thereby inhibiting induction of inflammatory cytokines or mediators such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
