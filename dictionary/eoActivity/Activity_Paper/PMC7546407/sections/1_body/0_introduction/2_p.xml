 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">Ye, 2011</xref>). TDG is basically divided into purple rattan TDG and green rattan TDG. The former is purple brown near the root, while the latter is in blue white and does not grow in combination with the dimension of 27.3

 </xref>). In contrast, green rattan TDG is widely distributed with a higher yield, while the purple rattan TDG has the better medicinal value. Its section is white, one or more connected, beaded. The best harvest period is the winter solstice (

Wild species often grow in the shade of valley forest and cliff, mostly scattered in Zhejiang province, Fujian province, Guangxi province, Guangdong province, Jiangxi province, Sichuan province, Chongqing province, Hunan province, Guizhou province, and other provinces, sensitive to cold climate. When the temperature drops to 10°C in winter, the growth will be stagnant and appears to be drought resistant and cannot accumulate water (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Wei, 2018</xref>). The stem and branches are slender, longitudinally ribbed, glabrous, or sparsely pilose. Compound leaves are palmate, usually foliolating with three blades. There are spiny sparse teeth on the edge. Flowers are small in the color between yellow and green, inflorescence axillary, as well as being closed like umbrellas. The fruit is red globose when it ripens. The tuber root is spindle-shaped, elliptical, or oval, and with tan brown but smooth surface. Its section is white, single or multiple, and connected with each other, presenting bead shape (

The microscopic characteristics show that the vessels are mostly marginal pits in addition to rare calcium oxalate cluster crystals existed or scattered in mucus cells. Moreover, some contain calcium oxalate needle crystals with bundles or scattered forms. Besides, the slender fibers exist in single or bundles with many oval and quasi round starch grains. Furthermore, different producing areas may affect the appearance, size, and microscopic characters of TDG. For instance, the tubers of TDG from Zhejiang province are small with a smooth surface and the white color of cross-section; while the tubers from Guangxi are larger, with wrinkled epidermis and pink color of cross-section. In addition, the vascular bundles of TDG from Guangxi are arranged in a radial pattern, while those in Zhejiang province are arranged in the shape of “&gt; &lt;“ (
