<p>Finally, researches in the future should be developed through some new technologies, such as proteomics, metabolomics, analytical methods, and so on, to clarify the potential mechanism of TDG pharmacological activity and promote the clinical therapeutics. Few studies have been conducted on the adverse effects or toxicity of different extracts and its active ingredients, so a basic research on this aspect should be taken into consideration. Mostly, research on pharmacological effects has focused on the cellular level, so appropriate animal models are required for more 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. The studies in the future should place more emphasis on systematically investigating the pharmacological mechanism of TDG, as well as the establishment of a comprehensive quality standard of TDG, so as to better promote the development and utilization of the medicinal value and clinical application of TDG.
