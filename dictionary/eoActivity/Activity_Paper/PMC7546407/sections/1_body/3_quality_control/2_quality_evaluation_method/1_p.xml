<p>As is known to all, the quality of medicinal materials is closely combined with the content of active ingredients, which affects the medicinal effect of medicinal materials. TDG is a kind of Chinese herbal medicine that is commonly used among the people. On the other hand, due to its wide distribution and multiple aliases, it is easy to mix the herbs with similar appearance and similar efficacy in the application process. Therefore, the quality control evaluation standard of TDG must be established. The quality control over traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) generally includes shape identification, geographical origin identification, and determination of characteristic component contents. The methods ordinarily used for quality control of TCM include morphological, microscopic, and thinner chromatography (TLC), DNA based technologies, the chemical fingerprint analysis, etc. 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. (2018)</xref> study the identification (character, microscopy, chemical reaction), inspection (moisture, total ash, heavy metals, and harmful elements), ethanol-soluble extract, and several active ingredients of TDG from Zhejiang province with the relevant methods in the China Pharmacopoeia (2015 Edition). The results of 12 batches of samples show that the total flavonoids, total polysaccharides, and total amino acids range from 0.18 to 0.66%, 21.59 to 61.76%, and 0.93 to 3.68%. And the water content, total ash content and alcohol soluble extract are 7.6~14.3%, 2.2~5.7%, and 12.4~22.6%, respectively, while the heavy metals and harmful elements such as lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury, and copper cannot exceed the standards of the pharmacopoeia. On this basis, some researchers identify and determine acid insoluble ash, alcohol soluble extract and other inspection items for different regions of TDG, providing scientific foundation for the future development of TDG and preparations (
