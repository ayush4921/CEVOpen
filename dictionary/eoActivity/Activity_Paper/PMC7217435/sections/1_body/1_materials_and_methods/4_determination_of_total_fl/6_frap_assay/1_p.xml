<p>The FRAP reagent, which was made up with 10 mM TPTZ in 40 mM HCl solution and 20 mM FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> in 250 mL acetate buffer, pH 3.6. 50 μL Extracts were mixed with the 1.5 mL FRAP reagent for 4 mins. The optical density of the mixture was recorded at 593 nm. The FRAP reagent was mixed with 50 μL distilled water as part of the control group. The experiments were performed in triplicate with similar results (RSD &lt; 5.0%). The FRAP assay was used in this study as detailed in [
