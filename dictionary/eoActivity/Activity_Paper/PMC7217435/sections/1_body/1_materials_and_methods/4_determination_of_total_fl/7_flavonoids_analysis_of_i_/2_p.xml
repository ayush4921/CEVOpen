<p>The gradient condition was 0–15 min at 15–45% A, 15–25 min at 45–55% A, and 25–35 min at 55–90% A. The column temperature was set at 25°C, the flow rate was kept at 0.4 mL/min, and the injection volume was 10 μL. Both the auxiliary and nebulizer gases consisted of nitrogen with a flow rate of 10 L/min. The MS analysis was performed in both positive and negative scan modes under the following operation parameters: the nebulizer pressure was set at 45 psi, the dry gas temperature was set at 350°C, and the voltage was set at 160 V. Full scan data acquisition and dependent scan event data acquisition were performed from m/z 100–1200.</p>
