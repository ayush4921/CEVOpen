<p>Effects of various ecological factors on the secondary metabolite profile have also been observed in angiospermae [
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a similar impact of ecological factors on the flavonoids found in the same species. The lower flavonoid content of aquatic ferns was attributed to specific environmental factors, which typically require no need to produce flavonoids in self-defense. 
 <italic>Pilularia globulifera</italic>, a marsileaceous fern, was previously reported to accumulate quercetin and kaempferol glycosides [
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which was similar to the content found within 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. An aquatic macrophyte, 
 <italic>Stratiotes aloides</italic>, accumulated luteolin and chrysoeriol glycosides [
 <xref rid="pone.0232185.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], which were different from 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>sinensis</italic>. Thus, it was speculated that the phytogroup was also influencing factors on the secondary metabolite profile, in addition to the ecological factors.
