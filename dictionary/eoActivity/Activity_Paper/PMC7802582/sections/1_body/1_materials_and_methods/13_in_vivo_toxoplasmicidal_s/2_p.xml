<p>For in vivo determination of anti‐
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> activity, 60 female Balb/c mice between 4 and 6 weeks of age were used. The animals received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> RH (2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> tachyzoites) and then divided into 6 groups of 10 mice (Ebrahimzadeh et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). After inoculation, batch treatment was immediately started and continued for 5 days at regular 24‐hr intervals as follows: essential oil (200, 100, and 50 mg/kg‐1/day‐1), pyrimethamine (25 mg/kg‐1/day‐1), PBS (negative control), and sulfadiazine (500 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> day
 <sup>−1</sup>) (positive control). Regular daily monitoring of the mice was carried out throughout the experiment. Unusual observations and deaths of the mice were recorded. To avoid side effects of the drugs used, the experiment was preceded by a preliminary study in which Balb/c mice were given the same dose of drugs. No clinically significant toxicity or mortality was observed.
