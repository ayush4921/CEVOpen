<p>Cytotoxicity assays showed that 
 <italic>D. kotschy</italic> was not cytotoxic to Vero cells. This result is consistent with that obtained in a previous study (Sharif et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) with ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Tinospora crispa</italic>. Furthermore, 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> protected mice with acute toxoplasmosis from death to a certain extent and increased the survival in mice in vivo. In a study conducted by Pillai et al., the essential oil of Nutmeg (
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> Houtt) showed strong anti‐
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> activity beside low toxicity against a normal cell line (Pillai et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn32021-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Our results showed that 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> is active against tachyzoites of 
 <italic>T. gondii</italic> in vitro, and the tachizoitocidal effects of essential oil were significantly better than control. There was a significant difference between essential oil of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> and control groups in all exposure times.
