<p>The mice were observed daily, with observations recorded 14 days after treatment. From the fourth‐day postinfection, progressive mortality was recorded in the infected, untreated groups. By the sixth day, all mice were carried in this batch. In the group of infected mice. Mice treated with 50, 100, and 200 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> day
 <sup>−1</sup> of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil, the mice started to die on the 8th, 8th, and 12th day after treatment, respectively. Mice of sulfadiazine groups (positive group) began to die on the sixth day until the seventh day. Mice of pyrimethamine groups started to die on the seventh day until the ninth day, and the mice of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil groups began to die on the eighth day until the fourteenth day. A significant difference in the survival time between all treatment subgroups was observed. The treatment with 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil (200 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> day
 <sup>−1</sup>) leads to better results in mice survival than treatment with 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil (50 and 100 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> day
 <sup>−1</sup>). Mice in the treatment groups of 
 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil (50, 100, and 200 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> day
 <sup>−1</sup>) showed a statistically higher survival rate compared to untreated infected control (

 <italic>D. kotschyi</italic> essential oil (50, 100, and 200 mg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> day
 <sup>−1</sup>) groups with positive control (
