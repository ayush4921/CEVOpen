<p id="Par13">A qualitative test revealed 9 cyclic diester unsaturated PAs in butterbur leaves sprouting near well G2 in April 2019: jacobine, jacobine N-oxide, monocrotaline, monocrotaline N-oxide, senecionine, senecionine N-oxide, senecivernine, senecivernine N-oxide and senkirkine (hereafter referred to as type 1 PAs). Subsequent quantitative analyses of matured butterbur leaves and rhizomes sampled near wells G2 and G3 on the dates listed in Table 2 of the supplementary material (SM) revealed the same PA compositions with concentrations provided in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, monocrotaline and monocrotaline N-oxide have not been reported in 
 <italic>Petasites</italic> sp. before.
