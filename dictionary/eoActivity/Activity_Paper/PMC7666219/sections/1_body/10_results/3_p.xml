<p id="Par14">A total of 21 PAs were detected in the stream water and in the seepage water of wells G2 and G3. They comprised all the type 1 PAs, together with lower concentrations of 12 unsaturated PAs that were not detected in the butterbur (hereafter referred to as type 2 PAs). Type 2 PAs comprised cyclic diesters (erucifoline, retrorsine, retrorsine N-oxide, seneciphylline), open chain diesters (echimidine, echimidine-N-oxide, lasiocarpine) and monoesters (europine, europine N-oxide, heliotrine, intermedine, intermedine N-oxide). The concentrations of individual type 1 PAs measured in the stream water and in the seepage water in wells G2 and G3 are presented in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. No PAs were detected in the deep groundwater, in seepage waters of the control wells G1 and G4, or in blank water sampled as the field controls.
