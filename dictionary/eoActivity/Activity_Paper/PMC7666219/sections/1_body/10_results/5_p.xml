<p id="Par16">The base stream flow (sampling events No. 1, 6 and 7 (Table 2 of the SM)) had average total PA concentrations in the surface water monitoring site from 49 to 91 ng/L (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Intense rapid rain between sampling events No. 1 and 2 (13 mm recorded by the Danish Meteorological Institute) resulted in a tenfold increase in the total PA concentration, implying simple and quick toxin washoff and release from the plants or the soil. The segmentation of the stream into stagnant water patches due to summer drought conditions (sampling event No. 4) resulted in PA concentrations approximately 3 times higher than at the base flow.
