<p id="Par12">A site with a channelized surface water stream and a system of groundwater abstraction wells was selected in eastern Denmark (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The shores of the stream and the land surface surrounding two of the wells (G2 and G3) were infested with butterbur. Every well consisted of a vertical pipe providing access to deep groundwater (estimated water level of approximately 60 m depth) and a surrounding casing supported by concrete rings that naturally filled with seepage water from the soil (observed water level 2.2–3.0 m depth) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The waters from different depths are not mixed and the deep groundwater is pumped for municipal water supply.
