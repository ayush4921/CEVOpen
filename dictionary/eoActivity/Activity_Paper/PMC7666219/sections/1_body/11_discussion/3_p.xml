<p id="Par21">According to the recommended maximum daily intake of 23.7 ng/kg body weight of unsaturated PAs, daily intake of 2 L of well water with a PA concentration of 233 ng/L, or 2 L of surface water with 523 ng/L corresponds to 30% and 60% of the maximum allowable intake for a 70 kg healthy human. The stream and shallow well waters reported in this study caused no harm to human health only because these waters were not utilized for drinking. The analysed exploited deep groundwater contained no PAs because this water was pumped from beneath impermeable geological layers with no contact with leachates from the butterbur. However, the groundwater pipes immersed in contaminated seepage water (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C) pose a potential risk to groundwater. Poorly drilled or maintained deep groundwater wells are subject to the downward transmission of water carrying microbiological and hazardous anthropogenic contaminants
