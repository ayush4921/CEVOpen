<p id="Par26">Stream water was sampled over a 4-month period from maturation to decay of adjacently growing butterbur. To identify any PA washoff effects, stream sampling events occurred during base flow conditions, shortly after intense precipitation and during drought conditions. In addition, groundwater and seepage water inside groundwater wells were sampled from two wells with adjacently growing butterbur and two wells without. The three water types, the leaves and the rhizomes of the plant were analysed. The concentrations of individual and total PAs were examined and compared.</p>
