<p id="Par11">We hypothesize that PAs can naturally leach from butterbur into water and make it unsafe to drink. The stability of PAs and frequently reported cases of groundwater contamination by structurally similar caffeine imply that PAs can leach into groundwater. Since there are no regulations that require PA monitoring, these and other toxic alkaloids may be overlooked as emerging environmental contaminants. In order to test the hypothesis we measured the content of 21 PAs in a stream, seepage and ground water over a period of four months in a butterbur affected catchment system.</p>
