<p id="Par6">Heterocyclic rings and ample hydrogen bonds determine alkaloid stability and contribute to their high water solubility. The polarity and persistence of alkaloids make them compatible with persistent and mobile organic compounds (PMOCs). PMOCs are emerging contaminants that are rarely detected in the environment due to the lack of available analytical techniques
