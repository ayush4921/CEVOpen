<p>To evaluate the ethnopharmacological importance of each plant species and the degree of agreement among informants some ethnobotanical indices were calculated. The informant consensus factor (Fic) was used to highlight medicinal plants of particular cultural relevance and the degree of agreement of informants about each category of ailments. The different ailments and diseases were classified into 14 categories (see 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00759-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and a Fic value for each category was calculated. The results showed that fever category had the greatest agreement (0.49), followed by gastrointestinal and dermatological categories (0.29). Intermediate agreement among informants was recorded for metabolic, oral/dental/ENT (0.28) and musculoskeletal (0.21) categories, while the others had a Fic lower than 0.20 (
