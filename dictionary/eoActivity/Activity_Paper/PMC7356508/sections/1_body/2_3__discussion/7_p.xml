<p>Although mixing medicinal plants and minerals—like black salt, “chuna” (limestone powder) iron, copper, “silajeet” (

 <xref rid="B50-plants-09-00759" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], in our survey we found some original recipes. For example, pieces of copper were added to the bark of 
 <italic>Ficus semicordata</italic> to make a preparation for treating bloody diarrhea. Another special combination of plants and mineral powder was used by Newar healers against many diseases such as fever, joint pain and others. These plants included aerial parts from 
 <italic>Centella asiatica</italic>, 
 <italic>Tagetes patula</italic>, 
 <italic>Mentha spicata, Oxalis corniculata</italic>, 
 <italic>Drymaria cordata</italic> and 
 <italic>Artemisia indica</italic>, seeds of 
 <italic>Oroxylum indicum</italic>, dry shoots of 
 <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, and wood of 
 <italic>Picrasma quassioides</italic> Notably, 
 <italic>P. quassioides</italic> is not present in any of the previous studies on the ethnobotany of the Tamang people. Its wood contains quassinoids with anticancer and antimalarial activity [
