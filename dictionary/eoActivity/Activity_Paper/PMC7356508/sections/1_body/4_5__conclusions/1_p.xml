<p>The present study shows that the ethnic community, living in rural areas of the Kavrepalanchok District, still retains a rich traditional knowledge of medicinal plants which are an important source for primary health care. In fact, although some allopathic medicines are available in government “health posts”, most indigenous peoples rely on traditional local healers and shamans for their primary health care needs. Despite the close relationship with wilderness in this area, we have observed that this heritage is at risk. Young people are generally attracted to urban and Western lifestyles, and sometimes do not fully understand the value of traditional knowledge. Our data could be of help to the people of the rural municipalities of this area in order to plan bioconservation strategies. A recent example in the Temal region concerns an endemic species of handicraft interest,
