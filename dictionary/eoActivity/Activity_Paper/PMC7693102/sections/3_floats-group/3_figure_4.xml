  <p>Summary of signaling pathways affected by ursonic acid (UNA). UNA induces apoptosis through the mediation of the mitochondria pathway in MGC-803 gastric cancer cells. On the other hand, UNA exerts antimetastatic effects via inhibition of ERKâ€“CREB signaling. This regulation results in the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, and attenuation of invasion of A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells. UNA also negatively regulates the ERK-c-fos signaling pathway, leading to the inhibition of MMP-1 and possible suppression of skin aging.</p>
