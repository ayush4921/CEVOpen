  <p>Antiprotozan and other therapeutic effects of ursonic acid (UNA). UNA has the potential to treat various human diseases. UNA shows antiprotozoan effects in 
   <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic>, 
   <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, 
   <italic>Acanthamoeba Castellanii Neff</italic>, 
   <italic>Acanthamoeba Griffini</italic>, 
   <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis,</italic> and 
   <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. UNA also has the possibility of improving hyperglycemia via inhibition of α-glycosidase and glycogen phosphorylase and stimulation of glucose transporter type 4. UNA also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, such as reduction of nitric oxide, and inhibits rat paw edema. In addition, antiblood-coagulating effects of UNA are also reported. UNA is predicted to strongly bind with nsp15, indicating that UNA may inhibit the metabolism of SARS-CoV-2. UNA also exerts inhibitory effects in herpes simplex type I and II and Epstein–Barr viruses. Moreover, antioxidant activities of UNA are documented. Other bioactivities, including inhibition of human carboxylesterase 1 and biofilm formation of 
   <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> are also reported.
