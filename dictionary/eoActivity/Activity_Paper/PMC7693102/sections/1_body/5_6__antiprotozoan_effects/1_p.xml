<p>UNA also has the potential to treat various human diseases other than cancer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-01505-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Protozoa are composed of a wide range of unicellular living organisms, and there are diverse types of protozoa which can infect humans through various ways of transmission, such as direct, human-to-human, and fecal–oral routes [
 <xref rid="B61-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Major human diseases caused by protozoa are malaria, African trypanosomiasis, Chagas’ disease, leishmaniasis, and other intestinal protozoal diseases, such as amoebic dysentery and toxoplasmosis [
 <xref rid="B61-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Protozoan-related diseases account for substantial morbidity and mortality, affecting 500 million of people worldwide [
 <xref rid="B62-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. It is more worrying that these parasites can develop resistance to existing antiprotozoan drugs through mutations of several proteins [
 <xref rid="B61-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Hence, discovery of novel molecules is required to overcome this problem. It is known that plants possess a wide range of phytochemicals with antiprotozoan activities, indicating that there is the possibility of development of novel antiprotozoan agents [
 <xref rid="B63-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Among them, ULA is reported to possess inhibitory activities against infection by protozoa [
 <xref rid="B64-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Several studies highlighted that UNA showed inhibitory effects in parasitic protozoa as well. UNA has the potential to display inhibitory effects against 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, a protozoan that causes the tropical disease leishmaniasis [
 <xref rid="B65-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. UNA selectively repressed the proteinase activity of cathepsin L of 
 <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> through a partially noncompetitive inhibition [
 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. UNA demonstrated IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 3.78 µM, superior to the effect exerted by ULA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 8.1 µM) [
 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B66-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It was also reported that UNA exerted trypanocidal activity against epimastigotes of 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, a parasitic protozoan known to cause Chagas’ disease [
 <xref rid="B41-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A minimum lethal concentration of UNA in 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> was 50 µM, while the concentration of ULA was 100 µM. UNA also exhibited amoebicidal activities against 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba Castellanii Neff</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 34.9 µM) and 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba Griffini</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 11.1 µM), which can cause 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> keratitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis [
 <xref rid="B67-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. This study was notable in that there was low cytotoxicity of UNA in J774.A1 murine macrophages (IC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt; 100 µM) compared to ULA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 17.7 µM) and the antiseptic agent chlorhexidine (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.4 µM), indicating the possibility of UNA to selectively suppresses 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> spp. without affecting mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="B67-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, UNA was shown to exert an in vitro suppressive effect in 
 <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis,</italic> which is responsible for trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease (55% inhibition at a dose of 100 µM) [
 <xref rid="B68-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, UNA showed an antimalarial effect against a chloroquine-resistant strain of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> in a micromolar dosage (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 41 µM), which was slightly more active than the effect from ULA (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 53 µM) [
 <xref rid="B69-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. It is noteworthy that UNA exhibited suppressive effects in different types of parasitic protozoa, exhibiting IC
 <sub>50</sub> values with micromolar concentrations.
