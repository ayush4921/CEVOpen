<p>In conclusion, UNA, a phytochemical from medicinal herbs, has therapeutic potentials that are similar to, or stronger than, ULA in some aspects. In particular, UNA showed strong potential anticancer, antiproliferative, and antiprotozoan effects. However, in contrast to ULA, scientific studies regarding UNAâ€™s therapeutic activities are still lacking. Since most assays concerning UNA were conducted in vitro, additional in vivo experiments may be required to confirm these potential pharmaceutical effects. Moreover, detailed studies to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms are needed to help understanding of activities exerted by UNA. Further analyses and applications may facilitate the possibility of UNA being developed in new medications to treat various human diseases.</p>
