<p>While the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of ULA are well understood, as documented in various scientific studies and reviews, those of UNA are relatively less studied and elucidated. Although ULA and UNA seem quite similar in terms of chemical structure, they are definitely distinct compounds and can exert different biological activities. In this review, we focus on the sanative effects and related cellular mechanisms of UNA. With a comparison between UNA and ULA, we attempt to emphasize the pharmaceutical potential of UNA as a novel drug candidate.</p>
