<p>Results from previous publications demonstrated that UNA could be a strong drug candidate to treat human diseases. However, there is a limitation in that most of experiments regarding UNA were preliminary and lacked profound assays, while the pharmaceutical effects of ULA were observed from various in vivo tests and its complex mechanisms of action were well explained [
 <xref rid="B19-biomolecules-10-01505" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since there are diverse types of cancer cells suppressed by UNA, in vivo experiments using tumor xenograft animal models would be helpful to confirm these anticancer effects. Furthermore, analyses of cellular events, such as metastatic abilities, apoptosis, protein expression, and transcriptional expression, may be studied to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms of UNA. As UNA could attenuate enzymatic activities of some proteins, such as Î±-glucosidase, cathepsin L of 
 <italic>Leishmania Mexicana,</italic> and hCE1, studies of the interactions between UNA and various proteins may facilitate understanding of the pharmacodynamics of UNA as a drug candidate. Other attempts, including molecular modifications and cotreatment with other well-known compounds, may be conducted to enhance the bioactivities of UNA.
