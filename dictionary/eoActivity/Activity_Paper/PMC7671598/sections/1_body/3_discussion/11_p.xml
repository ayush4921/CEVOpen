<p>In light of our study, we can say that OT has a better cytostatic effect on HeLa cells than DAT. However, from the knowledge gained about the impact of DATPP on the kinetics of PDHC, we conclude that improving accessibility to the cells by the use of alternative transporters can improve the cytostatic effect of DATPP.</p>
