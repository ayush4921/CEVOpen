<p>Despite the strong inhibitory properties of DATPP in relation to PDHC, OTPP proved to be a stronger inhibitor of the growth of HeLa cells. The medium used in this study was carefully chosen to minimise the exogenous source of thiamine and to prove the impact of the chosen thiamine antivitamins independently. The results showed that the most effective as a cytotoxic compound was OT and its pyrophosphate. The reason for the lower sensitivity of cells to DAT may be the inability to transport the compound. Assuming, that thiamine and its derivatives are transported by the same proteins, lack of effectiveness of DATPP as a cytotoxic compound may result from several mechanisms.</p>
