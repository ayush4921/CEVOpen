<p>The impact of OT on eukaryotic cells was studied on mammals (
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo)</italic> as well as on yeast. Analysis of the amount of cells of 
 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells showed that OT reduced the total amount of cells

 </xref>. Research done on mice showed the impact of the OT on the Ehrlich’s tumour
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>35</sup>
 </xref>, and this observation was similar to the findings of our research. Data on the impact on fibroblasts showed no differences between the viability of cells with increasing concentrations of OT after 24 and 48 h

 </xref>. Our research was maintained for approximately 4 days, what may play a role in the viability of cells. These suggest that fibroblasts are less sensitive than HeLa cells to OT treatment. Research done on MIA PaCa-2 cells in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions showed that after exposure of cells to OT, their RNA content was reduced by about 45%, as well as the total amount of DNA (decreased by 20%)

 <sup>−7</sup> × 5 µM OT, respectively

 </xref>. Moreover, proteomic studies on MIA PaCa-2 cells after exposure to OT showed that the amount of transketolase in cells was lower compared to the control group

 </xref>. In addition, their data

 </xref> showed that the inhibition of transketolase by OT may have a wider impact on the cancer cells (such as activation of the apoptosis pathway). Our experiment done on HeLa cells confirmed the inhibitory properties of OT as well as OTPP.
