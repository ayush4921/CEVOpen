To our knowledge, no study has been performed analysing the impact of DATPP on PDHC isolated from mammals, but based on previously mentioned data, we can assume that a similar reaction may be observed on TPP-dependent enzymes from mammals. The results obtained by us for the PDHC from porcine heart (
 <italic>K
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> = 26 nM for OTPP) showed that the inhibitory potential of DATPP is lower than in case of microorganisms’ TPP-dependent enzymes, but it is still high. In contrast to the method used by Mann et al.

 </xref> which involved the inactivation of the enzyme in time under the influence of different DATPP concentrations, we used a kinetic method based on measuring the degree of PDHC inhibition in the presence of an increasing concentration of TPP at a constant concentration of DATPP (0.01 μM) added together with coenzyme and involving standard preincubation with the enzyme before starting the reaction of the substrate.
