<p>The first part of the experiment was focussed on comparing the effects of OTPP and DATPP on the kinetic properties of PDHC. For this purpose, the enzyme was isolated from porcine heart according to the procedure desribed by Stanley and Perham

 </xref>. Briefly, porcine tissue was homogenised in a Teflon homogeniser for 3 min with 0.15 M KCl on ice (tissue to solution ratio 1:5). To isolate mitochondria, the cell homogenate was centrifuged for 7 min. at 600 × g, and then the obtained supernatant was centrifuged again for 10 min at 10,000 × g. To purify mitochondria, the pellet was resuspended three times with 0.3 M sucrose and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Finally, mitochondria were suspended with 0.025 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5), in a 1:1 ratio. For the disintegration of mitochondria, the suspension was frozen in liquid N
 <sub>2</sub> and thawed three times and then centrifuged for 40 min. 40,000× g. For PDHC precipitation supernatant was mixed with polyethylene glycol up to 36% and centrifuged 40 min at 40,000 × g. The precipitate was resuspended with 0.025 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and used for enzymological studies.
