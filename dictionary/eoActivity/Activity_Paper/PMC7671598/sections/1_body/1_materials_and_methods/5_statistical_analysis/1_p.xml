<p>The results were statistically analysed using the Shapiro–Wilk 
 <italic>W</italic>-test to identify normal distribution and Levene 
 <italic>L</italic>-test for verifying if the variances were homoscedastic. In the case of the normal distribution of data and homoscedastic variances, the 
 <italic>t</italic>-Student test was used to compare the mean values, while in the case of nonnormal distribution of data, nonparametric test (
 <italic>U</italic>-Mann–Whitney test) was used.
