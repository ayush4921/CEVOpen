<p>The impact of the chosen thiamine analogues was evaluated by analysing the metabolic activity of cells by the MTT test, using Lambda E MWG AG BIOTECH plate reader. For assessing the number of live/dead cells as well as live/dead cells with division into early and late apoptosis Muse™ Count and Viability and Muse™ Annexin V &amp; Dead Cell kits were used, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To define those parameters of cells, Merck Millipore Muse™ Cell Analyser (0500–3115) was used.</p>
