<p>To evaluate the impact of the tested antivitamins on an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell model, HeLa cells were incubated in a CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator (37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, 95% humidity). Three independent experiments were performed for statistical calculations. All the cultures were maintained in MEM199 medium, with 10% foetal bovine serum and antibiotics (penicillin 50 U/ml, streptomycin 50 µg/ml). Control cultures (without antivitamins) and experimental variants (with thiamine analogues OT, OTPP and DATPP, at a concentration of 0.005 − 0.02%) were grown until the control variant reached confluence (approximately 3–4 days).
