<p>Based on the limited data available on the inhibitory properties of DAT in relation to some TPP-dependent enzymes isolated from microorganisms, it can be assumed that this antimetabolite should have similar properties in other organisms and other TPP-dependent enzymes like PDHC from mammals. The above assumption allows us to hypothesising that DAT, by inhibiting TPP-dependent enzymes, will reduce the rate of cell growth 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and limit cell viability. In this work, we decided to test the above hypothesis by comparing the effects of the well-known thiamine antivitamin OT with the properties of DAT against the PDHC isolated from the porcine heart. In addition, we compared the effects of the above-mentioned thiamine antivitamins on HeLa cancer cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. The obtained results will provide the basis for assessing the cytostatic properties of DAT against cancer cells.
