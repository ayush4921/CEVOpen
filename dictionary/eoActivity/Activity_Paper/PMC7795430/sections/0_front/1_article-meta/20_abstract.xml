  <italic>Allium</italic> species are well known plants distributed throughout the world, and they contain various bioactive components with different biological activities including anti-cancer effects. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of 
  <italic>Allium senescens</italic> L. (A.S.) extract on cell survival and IL-2-mediated inflammation in human T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) Jurkat cells. Our results showed that A.S. extract induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of Jurkat cells with no significant cytotoxicity in the normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A.S. extract induced ROS generation through the activation of MAPK p38 phosphorylation. It also inhibited IL-2 mRNA expression and NF-ÎºB signaling mediated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and phytohemagglutinin. Combined treatment with A.S. extract and axitinib/dovitinib exerted enhanced inhibitory effects on T-ALL cell growth and IL-2 production. These results provide novel information on the potential use of A.S. extract as a therapeutic herbal agent for the treatment and prevention of T-ALL.
