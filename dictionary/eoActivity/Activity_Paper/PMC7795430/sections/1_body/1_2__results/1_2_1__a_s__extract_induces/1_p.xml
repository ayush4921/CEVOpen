<p>To determine the optimal concentration of A.S. extract for the cytotoxicity analysis, we conducted cell viability assay in normal PBMCs and T-ALL Jurkat cells. A.S. extract did not show significant cytotoxicity in PBMCs, but Jurkat cell proliferation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00035-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, the A.S.-extract-treated group showed a dose-dependent increase in Annexin V- and 7-AAD-positive apoptotic cells. In addition, A.S. extract activated cleavages of caspase-3 and the downstream substrate, PARP-1, in the nucleus (
