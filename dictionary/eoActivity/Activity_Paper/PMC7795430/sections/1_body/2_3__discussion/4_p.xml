<p>In this study, we observed the effect of inhibiting cell growth even at a low concentration, and observed that strong synergistic effects appeared when an anticancer substance such as abitinib were co-treated at a low concentration. Though technical errors in the CCK assay were possible, such a small number of seeding cells (10,000/well), the biological effects of the unknown component of A.S. extracts may be considerable. For example, we observed that low-concentration A.S. treatment decreased IL-2 mRNA expression in PMA/PHA-stimulated T-ALL Jurkat cells.</p>
