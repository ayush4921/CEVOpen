<p>This study has the following limitations. It is difficult to consider the major substances due to lack of information on the components of A.S. extract, which may explain cytotoxicity and biological effects at low concentration. In addition, we could not determine whether A.S. extract is effective for all T-ALLs, though it effectively exhibited cytotoxicity in Jurkat cells. Though many problems have been experienced by in vitro and in vivo studies, many studies have been conducted on the development of new drugs with natural products and various anticancer drugs have been developed from natural products, including paclitaxel, vinblastine, vincristine, rohitukine, and etoposide [
