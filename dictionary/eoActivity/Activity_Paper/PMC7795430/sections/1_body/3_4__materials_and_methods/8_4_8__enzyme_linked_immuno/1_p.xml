<p>Jurkat cells (1.0 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) were seeded on 24-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were treated with PMA (50 ng/mL) plus PHA (1 μg/mL), and with A.S. extract alone or combined with axitinib or dovitinib in culture media (5% FBS). After an additional 24 h of incubation, the level of IL-2 in the supernatants was measured using human IL-2 ELISA kits following the manufacturer’s instructions.
