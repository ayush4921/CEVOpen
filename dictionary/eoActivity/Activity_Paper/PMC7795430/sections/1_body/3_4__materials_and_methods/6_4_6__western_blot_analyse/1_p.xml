<p>Total cell lysates were prepared using Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After SDS-PAGE and the transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, incubation with primary and secondary antibodies for specific protein detection were done and protein was visualized using the Luminata
 <sup>TM</sup> Forte Western HRP Substrate (Merck Millipore). Visualized band intensities were measured using Chemidocâ„¢ (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Actin was used as the loading control. Experiments were performed in triplicate. The detected bands were quantified based on the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), and the relative ratio between each sample and loading controls is presented in the figures.
