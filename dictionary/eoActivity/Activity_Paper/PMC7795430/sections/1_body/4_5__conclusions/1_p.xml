<p>In this study, we demonstrated the biological activity of A.S. extract on cell proliferation, oxidative stress, and NF-ÎºB signaling-mediated IL-2 expression in T-ALL cells. Although this study was in vitro, the results may provide important information for the development of A.S.-extract-based treatment for leukemia. Furthermore, additional studies including the active compound identification and anticancer effects with animal models will be needed to develop an A.S.-extract-based antileukemic drug.</p>
