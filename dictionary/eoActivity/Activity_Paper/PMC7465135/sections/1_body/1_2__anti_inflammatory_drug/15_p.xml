<p>Since a large proportion of NSAIDs available on the market have significant undesirable effects, the need for new anti-inflammatory drugs contributes to the advancement of research for newer, safer, effective molecules with fewer side effects and from vegetal sources. Therefore, it can be observed that a significant number of substances of vegetal origin form part of the therapeutic arsenal of modern medicine. It is important to emphasize that due to the existence of a large number of species available for research, the success of the development of new naturally occurring anti-inflammatory drugs depends fundamentally on a multidisciplinary effort in the discovery of new leading molecules.</p>
