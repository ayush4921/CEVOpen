<p>Thus, the scientific community has focused its efforts on the search for selective COX-2 inhibitors, with lower adverse side effects, since highly selective COX-2 inhibitors are required for the treatment of inflammatory diseases [

 <sup>®</sup>), followed by rofecoxib (Vioxx
 <sup>®</sup>). In a short time, the coxibs (celecoxib and rofecoxib) have achieved wide dissemination [
