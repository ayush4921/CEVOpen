<p>Thus, in flavonoids, ring A is formed via acetate, while B results from the shikimate route and the three carbon atoms, which link ring A to B, derived from phenylpyruvate. Flavonoids can occur as aglycone or glycosides (a glucose molecule attached to the aromatic ring). The compounds belonging to this class are subdivided into subclasses: chalcones, dihydrochalcones, aurone, flavones, flavonols, dihydroflavonoids, flavanones, flavanol, flavandiol, anthocyanidins, isoflavonoids, bioflavonoids, and proanthocyanins. Chalcones are precursors to many derivatives of flavonoids, found throughout the plant kingdom, such as flavonones, and these, in turn, can then give rise to many other flavonoids, such as, for example, flavones, flavonols, anthocyanidins, and catechins. Other compounds can be formed by changes in hydroxylation, methylation, glycosylation, and dimethyl allylation in the two aromatic rings [
