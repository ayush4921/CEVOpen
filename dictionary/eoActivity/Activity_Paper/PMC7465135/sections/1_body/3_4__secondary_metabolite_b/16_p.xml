<p>There are three routes of biosynthesis of hydrolyzabletannins: in the first route, the addition of galloyl groups to 1,2,3,4,6-pentagaloyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose is used, through 
 <italic>m</italic>-depisidic bonds. In the second route, two neighboring gallic acid molecules (1,2,3,4,6-pentagaloyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose) condense, and then this compound (monomer) can bind to others, forming dimers, trimers, and oligomers. Condensed tannins or proanthocyanidins are polymers of flavan-3-ol and/or flavan-3,4-diol (leukocyanidins), products of shikimate metabolism and acetate pathway (as seen in flavonoids). Dihydroflavonols are reduced to leucoanthocyanidins, which in turn give rise to catechins, which suffer a reduction in C4. Proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) are probably caused by a condensation reaction between leucoanthocyanidins and catechins [
