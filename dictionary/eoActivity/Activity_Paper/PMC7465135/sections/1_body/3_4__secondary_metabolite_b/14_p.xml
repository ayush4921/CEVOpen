<p>Anthraquinones are also called anthracenedione, anthracene derivatives, or hydroxyanthracene derivatives. The biosynthesis of these compounds has shikimic acid and acetate, or just acetate as precursors, and in the first case, shikimic acid reacts with Î±-ketoglutaric acid, resulting from the deamination of acid glutamic or the citric acid cycle, producing o-succinylbenzoic acid, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid combines with mevalonic acid, giving rise to anthraquinone [
