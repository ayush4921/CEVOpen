<p>Besides, the cycloartenol tetracyclic ring system is a precursor to many plant sterols. Modifications and substitutions that occur lead to the formation of a wide variety of compounds of natural origin, which present several important biological activities such as, for example, sterols, steroidal saponins, cardioactive glycosides, bile acids, corticosteroids, and mammalian sex hormones. The differences in biological activities presented by these compounds, which contain the tetracyclic skeleton in common, are attributed to the functional groups linked to the steroid nucleus, and to the stereochemical variations of that nucleus [
