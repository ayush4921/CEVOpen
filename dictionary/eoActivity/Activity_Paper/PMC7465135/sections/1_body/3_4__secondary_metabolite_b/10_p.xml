<p>Phenylpropanoids are also derived from the route that begins with the formation of shikimic acid, giving rise to phenylalanine and tyrosine which, in turn, by the action of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonialyase, lose an ammonia molecule, resulting in the formation of cinnamic and 4-cumáric acids, respectively, and, through various reactions of reduction, oxidation, and cyclization give rise to several phenylpropanoids. Coumarins are derived from the metabolism of phenylalanine, one of its first precursors being 2-coumaric acid (orthohydroxy-cinnamic), which then undergoes lactonization of the side chain, giving rise to coumarin. Xanthones are heterocyclic phenolic compounds, which are based on the dibenzo-γ-pyrone nucleus. The biosynthesis of xanthones in higher plants is well determined, following the acetate-shikimate pathway. From two precursors, the formation of a common intermediate, a benzophenone, occurs with an aromatic ring originating from the shikimic acid route (B), which can characteristically contain hydroxyl groups in C5 and/or C7, and another from the malonyl-CoA route (THE) [
