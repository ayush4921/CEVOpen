<p>Acetyl-CoA is formed by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvic acid (glycolysis) and its derivatives are fatty acids and polyketides; in turn, three acetyl-CoA molecules constitute mevalonic acid and 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate originates from the combination of pyruvic acid and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (two intermediates of glycolysis); 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate, together with mevalonic acid, are precursors to several terpenoids and steroids [
