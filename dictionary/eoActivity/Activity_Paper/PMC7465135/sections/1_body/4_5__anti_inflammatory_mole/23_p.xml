<p>Lipid peroxidation is the process by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) attack the polyunsaturated fatty acids of the phospholipids of cell membranes, disintegrating them and allowing the entry of these species into intracellular structures. In this scenario, phospholipase that has been activated by toxic species disintegrates the phospholipids and this causes the release of unsaturated fatty acids. As in the formation of ROS, the processes of lipo peroxidation are not always harmful, since their products are significant in the cascade reaction from arachidonic acid and, therefore, in the inflammatory response. Research has shown that flavonoids inhibit lipid peroxidation, in vitro, in the initiation stage, due to its action as an antioxidant [
