 <xref rid="B128-molecules-25-03726" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Vascular events occur in the microcirculation, causing several modifications such as elevation of blood flow and capillary permeability, among others. These alterations are local effects of chemical mediators, which are plasma enzyme systems, cytokines, mast cell products, platelets, leukocytes, and products of arachidonic acid metabolism [

 <xref rid="B129-molecules-25-03726" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Thus, the inflammation events that underlie these manifestations are induced and regulated by a large number of chemical mediators, including kinins, eicosanoids, complement proteins, histamine, and monokines [
