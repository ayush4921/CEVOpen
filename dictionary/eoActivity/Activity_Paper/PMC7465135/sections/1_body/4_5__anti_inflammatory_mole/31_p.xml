<p>In contrast, COX-2 is not detectable in tissues under normal physiological conditions, but its expression increases considerably during inflammation or mitogenic stimulation [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-25-03726" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. COX-2, induced in inflammation by various stimuliâ€”such as cytokines, endotoxins, and growth, gives rise to prostaglandins, which contribute to the development of edema, flushing, fever, and hyperalgesia [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-03726" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thus, COX-2 is inducible or regulated by inflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin-1b, tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharide. This enzyme is associated with the production of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin that evoke peripheral and systemic inflammatory symptoms [
