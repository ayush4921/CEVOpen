 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>), hydroxyl (OH
 <sup>−</sup>), hydroperoxide (HO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>), nitric oxide (NO
 <sup>•</sup>), and nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub>2</sub>
 <sup>•</sup>). Among these, the hydroxyl radical is the most reactive in the induction of cellular lesions and hydrogen peroxide can cross the nuclear membrane and induce damage in the DNA molecule [
