<p>Another motivating scientific investigation related to drugs and medicines made from plants is their interaction with gut microbiota. Certain gut bacteria intensively metabolize drugs rich in the low-molecular-mass products of secondary metabolisms, such as tannins and anthocyanins. Metabolites derived from bacterial metabolization are small, bioavailable, and potentially bioactive metabolites. They also have potential modulatory effects on the gut microbiome, which is interesting to prevent metabolic disorders [
