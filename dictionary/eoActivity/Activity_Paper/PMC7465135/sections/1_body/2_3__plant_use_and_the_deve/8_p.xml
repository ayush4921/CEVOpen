<p>It is important to note that the extraction of plant materials is the first major step to test biological activities, presenting many advantages and some disadvantages compared to the isolation of pure active compounds [

When an entire extract is used, there is a good chance of synergism between active components that can be lost when each of these components is isolated. This synergism was discovered in several medicinal tests, including those for anti-inflammatory activity. On the contrary, the mixture of different compounds together may also lead to inhibitory effects, namely, that one component may reduce the biological activity of the other. In line with this assumption, some studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory activity of pure compounds (such as amentoflavone, pseudohypericin, and hyperforin) is higher than that of the extracts [
