 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Also, it has been true that pharmaceutical drugs may be therapeutic at one dose and toxic at another [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In order to ensure safety, there must be a study to show safety profiles of herbs claimed to be beneficial to humans and the animals before deciding to use them [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The selective uptake or accumulation of a particular xenobiotic in a specific tissue or cell, the inhibition of the normal export of a potentially toxic metabolite from a cell to the outside, and the activation of cellular receptors could lead to toxicity [
