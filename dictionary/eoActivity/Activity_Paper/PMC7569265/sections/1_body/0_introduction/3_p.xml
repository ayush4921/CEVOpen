<p id="par0010">Acute and sub-acute toxicity tests are routinely performed for the investigation of natural products or drugs. Acute toxicity test is the first step to determine the adverse effects of substances within 14 days of administration of single dose [

The starting dose could be the expected therapeutic level selected from one of the four fixed levels (5, 50, 300 and 2000 mg/kg body weight) of test agents for acute toxicity test. Ideally, the starting dose should be that which is most likely to produce mortality and other toxic effects in the dosed animals [
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, previous studies had administered extracts at 2000 and 5000 mg/kg dose for 28 days to determine sub-acute toxicity [
