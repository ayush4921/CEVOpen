 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The calculated red blood cell indices, that is, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) are used for diagnosis of anemia [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Hematological indices such as packed cell volume (PCV) and hemoglobin (HB) are associated with the total population of red blood cells (RBCs). MCV reflects the size of red blood cells; whereas the mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and MCHC are used mathematically to define the concentration of hemoglobin [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The packed cell volume (PCV) or hematocrit represents the percentage of RBCs of whole blood volume, which is clinically used to determine anemia [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These blood biomarkers help to determine toxicity in relation to dose and time-response [
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the considerations of platelet indices such as mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and a platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR) are also used to screen toxicity [
