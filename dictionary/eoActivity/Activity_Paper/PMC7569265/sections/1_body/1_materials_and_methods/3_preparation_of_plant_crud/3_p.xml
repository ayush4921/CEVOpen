<p id="par0040">The extracts were prepared using a procedure similar to that often used by traditional healer's or patients, with some minor modifications. The plant powders were soaked in hydro-ethanol (70 %), which was placed on a shaker for 72 h. The mixture was filtered through cotton/gauze, then through Whatman filter paper number 1 (pore size: 11 μm) to remove fine solid plant particles or insoluble constituents. The entire extracts were concentrated to dryness using a Rotary Evaporator by removing ethanol (EtOH) at 45 °C under reduced pressure. The distilled water extracts were concentrated using Lyophilizer machine. Then, the semi-solid concentrates poured into a glass Petri-plates and allowed to completely dry in water bath adjusted to 45 °C. The final dried extracts were collected and stored in labeled sterile bottles covered with tightly stopper and kept in Freezer on −20 °C until used in the experiments.</p>
