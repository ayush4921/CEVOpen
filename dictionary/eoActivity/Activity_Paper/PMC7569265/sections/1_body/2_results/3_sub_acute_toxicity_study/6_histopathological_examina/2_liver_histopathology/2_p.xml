<p id="par0155">Histopathological studies of liver demonstrated that the extract of 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> was toxic at given dose revealing focal periportal hepatitis (

 <italic>R. abyssinicus, A. aspera</italic> and 
 <italic>S. punctata</italic> extracts showed mild acute injury on liver tissues in the given dose 2000 mg/kg body weight in comparison with the control group(
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C). Indications of sub-acute toxicity in the liver, following exposure of rats to plant extracts were characterized microscopically by fine septa of extracellular matrix (chiefly collagen) that divided hepatocyte plates into small clusters of individual hepatocyte (
