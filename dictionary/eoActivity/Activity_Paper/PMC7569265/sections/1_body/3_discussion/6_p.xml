<p id="par0185">The extracts of 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus, A. aspera</italic> and 
 <italic>S. punctata</italic> showed normal glomeruli with slight necrosis of tubular cells. A previous study demonstrated the nephroprotective effects of 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extract [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] indicating the need for further evaluations of this plant extract. Because of the disruptions of blood flow through the liver and the failure of hepatocytes to come in contact with blood, there was profound hepatic dysfunction. The patches of tubular epithelial injuries observed in liver sections were an indication that 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> causes sub-acute toxicity. It was also reported that 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extract revealed congestions and cellular infiltrations in the liver and kidneys of rats at dose 1500 mg/kg b.w [
 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Although 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extract showed slight necrosis of renal tubular cells, previous studies demonstrated its nephroprotective effects [
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] indicating the need for further evaluations of the extract.
