<p id="par0170">A significant reduction in platelet count by administrations of 
 <italic>C. murale</italic>, 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. punctata</italic> extracts can be an indication of acute toxicity to the test rats. The reduction in Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) following 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> extract administration is also an indication that induces anemia. This may be supported by the fact that short-term exposure of erythrocytes to cytotoxic agents could result in a hemoglobin reduction [

 <italic>S. punctata</italic> essential oils revealed cytotoxicity and hemolytic properties of human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cell lines) [
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and erythrocytes [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], no toxic effects were detected in the present study, which used crude extracts of the plant's aerial parts.
