<p id="par0195">The findings of the present study demonstrated that hydro-ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic>, 
 <italic>S. punctata</italic>, 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. murale,</italic> and 
 <italic>A. pulcherrima</italic> did not cause mortality in experimental rats at dose 2000 mg/kg in sub-acute toxicity tests. However, 
 <italic>C. murale</italic> extract induced toxicity as supported by hematological and histological findings. The information obtained from this study can serve as a baseline for further pharmacological studies of these medicinal plants. Furthermore, chronic toxicity studies and phytochemical characterizations of 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic>, 
 <italic>S. punctata</italic>, and 
 <italic>R. abyssinicus</italic> extracts would be beneficial.
