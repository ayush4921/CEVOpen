 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> essential oil led to the conclusion that the remarkable chemical variability of oregano can be explained by the up-/down regulation of the metabolic biosynthetic pathways. This research substantiated the fact that chemotype composition is in direct correlation with the climatic factors, with plants from the Mediterranean climate presenting an active cymyl- and/or linalool pathway, while plants growing in areas characterized by Continental climate are poorer in monoterpenes and display a more active sabinyl-pathway [
