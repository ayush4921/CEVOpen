<p>The essential oil is the central type of oregano’s chemical constituents and has extensively been studied. As 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> is a variable species, there are also variations in the chemical composition [
 <xref rid="B23-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The volatile oil contains monoterpenes and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, as well as phenolic compounds [
 <xref rid="B14-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Terpenes such as thymol, carvacrol, 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-terpinene, and linalool are the main constituents (

 <xref rid="B24-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Investigation of 502 plants from 17 European countries led to the identification of three main 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> chemotypes, depending on the proportions of acyclic linalool/linalyl acetate, cymyl and sabinyl compounds [
