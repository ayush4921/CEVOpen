<p>OEO was encapsulated into chitosan-Tween 80 nanoparticles prepared via a two-step method, consisting in the formation of an oil-in-water emulsion, followed by ionic gelation. The OEO-loaded chitosan nanoparticles showed regular distribution, spherical shape, an average diameter ranging from 309.8 nm to 402.2 nm and the loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency in the range of 1.32–2.12% and 5.45–24.72%, respectively. By increasing the OEO content of chitosan-nanoparticles from 0.1 to 0.8 g/g chitosan, their loading capacity increased, whereas their encapsulation efficiency decreased. The in vitro release profile of OEO from chitosan-nanoparticles indicated an initial burst effect (at low OEO concentration) followed by a subsequent slower release (at higher OEO concentrations) and suggested their potential as controlled release nanosystems for OEO [
