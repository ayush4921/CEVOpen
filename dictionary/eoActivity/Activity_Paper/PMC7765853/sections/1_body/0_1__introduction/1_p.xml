 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L., commonly oregano, is one of the most renowned aromatic species, with a strong traditional background as a spice and medicinal plant, but also as a well-established source of valuable plant-based drugs in modern phytotherapy. This 
 <italic>Lamiaceae</italic> plant is native to Europe, the North of the African continent, and most of temperate Asia, but the hotspot of its diversity is situated in the Mediterranean region and predominantly in Turkey [

 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> is either wild-collected or cultivated, with Turkey being the most important supplier of Mediterranean oregano. However, the common name of “oregano” is employed for several other species of the genus (
 <italic>Origanum onites</italic> or Turkish oregano, 
 <italic>O. majorana</italic> or sweet marjoram, 
 <italic>O. minutiflorum</italic> or Spartan oregano, 
 <italic>O. syriacum</italic> var. 
 <italic>bevanii</italic> or Israeli oregano) or even belonging to other genus (
 <italic>Thymus, Satureja, Lippia, Coridothymus</italic>) [
