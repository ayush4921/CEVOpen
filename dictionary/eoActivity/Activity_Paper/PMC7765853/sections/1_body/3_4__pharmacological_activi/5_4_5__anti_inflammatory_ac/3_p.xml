<p>Laothaweerungsawat et al. tested a microemulsion of

 <italic>w/w</italic> OEO) on Raw 264.7 cells (murine macrophage cells). 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. was harvested from Chaing Mai, Thailand and HPLC assay attested carvacrol as a major component of OEO. The microemulsion was investigated for the irritation properties in comparison with nonencapsulated OEO using HET-CAM (hen egg test-chorioallantoic membrane) assay. ME initiated a lower irritation score (IS = 3.1 ± 0.10) than nonemulsified OEO (IS = 4.8 ± 0.02) (
