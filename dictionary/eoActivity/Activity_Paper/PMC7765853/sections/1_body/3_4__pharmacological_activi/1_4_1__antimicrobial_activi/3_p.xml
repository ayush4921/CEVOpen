<p>In a comprehensive study, Scandorieiro et al. described the synergistic and additive interactions of a two-drug combination of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> EO and green silver nanoparticles (bio-AgNP) produced by 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> against multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
 <italic>aureus</italic>, b-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing, Escherichia 
 <italic>coli</italic>, Escherichia 
 <italic>coli ESBL</italic> and Escherichia 
 <italic>coli KPC.</italic> In combination, OEO and bio-AgNP showed significantly lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values when compared with individual treatment (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), where the two compounds together resulted in synergistic or additive antibacterial potential. Besides, the combination of OEO and bio-AgNP led to a faster reduction of CFU/mL than in individual treatment with bio-AgNP. Moreover, scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed similar morphological alterations in non-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
 <italic>aureus</italic> cells exposed to three different treatments (OEO, bio-AgNP, and combination of the two), which appeared on cell surface blebbing after 6 h of treatment. Individual and combined treatments showed a reduction in cell density and a decrease in the exopolysaccharide matrix compared to untreated bacterial cells [
