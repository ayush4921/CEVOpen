<p>Lu M. et al. investigated the efficacy of a commercial 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. essential oil against multidrug-resistant (MDR) microbes such as methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, in a mouse model of burn injury. OEO also exhibited comparable antibacterial activities against built-up biofilms formed by the 13 bacterial strains, with total inactivation of the biofilms of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>MRSA</italic> at the concentrations of 1.0, and 0.4 mg/mL, respectively. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed ultrastructural damages in 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> cells. They displayed a severe spillage of intracellular substances resulted from the contraction of the cell membrane after exposure to OEO for 1 h at 0.56 mg/mL. Noteworthy, the treatment of burn infection in BALB/c mice with OEO using a dose of 5 or 10 mg/mL, was a success. [
