<p>The effectiveness of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. essential oil (OEO) against a wide range of pathogenic bacteria has been extensively studied. As it has been shown by an increased number of studies in the field, OEO represents an efficient alternative as an antimicrobial agent against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strain [

 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because essential oils are hydrophobic molecules, they have a greater permeability through the cell membrane and cause expansion of the cellular content. The death of the bacteria occurs by the drainage of crucial molecules and ions from the bacterial cell [
 <xref rid="B29-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The disinfectant and antibacterial properties of the OEO were attested for the first time in ancient Greece, where it was frequently utilized for treating bacterial skin and wound contaminations. It was also used as a food preservative [
 <xref rid="B30-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Carvacrol and thymol represent the two primary phenols, constituting almost 78–85% of the OEO and they are responsible for the plant’s antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="B31-ijms-21-09653" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The antibacterial activity of the OEO results from the high level of thymol which, according to Lambert et al. ties to membrane proteins and increases the permeability of the bacterial cell membrane [
