<p>Bioactive principles of OEO (purchased from Berjé USA) were evaluated for their apoptotic effects against human stomach cancer cell lines (AGS) by Balusamy et al. Antiproliferative property of the OEO in adenocarcinoma gastric cell line (AGS) was determined by MTT assay. After 48 h of incubation with OEO (5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 μg/mL), IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 13.4 μg/mL. The best antiproliferative activity of OEO was found to be 100 μg/mL, where almost 100% of cells were induced by cell damage by OEO treatment. Apoptosis detection of stomach cancer cell lines treated with OEO was performed by Hoechst and PI staining. Hoechst staining showed typical apoptosis characteristic of cancer cells treated with 10, 25, 50, and 100 μg/mL, including darkly stained nuclei, nuclei shrinkage, and DNA fragmentation, segregated bodies, the formation of apoptotic bodies in the inner surface of the nuclei. Moreover, detection of OEO induced apoptosis using propidium iodide staining indicated that cells treated with 25 μg/mL and 50 μg/mL of OEO reduced cell viability and cell. Moreover, they studied the molecular mechanism associated with the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis controlled by the B-cell lymphoma protein-2 (BCL-2) family members that stimulate pro-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX). BAX expression gradually increased at the concentration of 10 μg/mL OEO (2.37-fold) and reached its maximum transcript accumulation at 50 μg/mL of 4.32-fold, respectively [
