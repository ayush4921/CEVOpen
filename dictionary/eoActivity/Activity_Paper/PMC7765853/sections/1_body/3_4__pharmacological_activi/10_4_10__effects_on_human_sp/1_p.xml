<p>New data regarding the biological activities of 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. essential oil was reported by Mbaye et al. The research team studied the impact of oregano (harvested from Fes, Marocco) essential oil on sperm’s motility and vitality. The mobility was assessed by a Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis and the evaluation of sperm vitality was performed by eosin 2% staining and analyzed via optical microscopy. Following 5 min of incubation OEO (range of concentrations: 10
 <sup>−1</sup>, 10
 <sup>−2</sup>, 10
 <sup>−3</sup>, and 10
 <sup>−9</sup>) gave promising values of mobility and vitality (73 ± 0.07% respectively 74 ± 0.07%) suggesting that OEO can be a therapeutic agent in qualitative abnormalities of human sperm [
