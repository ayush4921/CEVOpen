<p>Mbaye et al. continued to study 
 <italic>Origanum vulgare</italic> L. essential oil (Fes, Marocco) on the advanced parameters of mobility and the integrity of the sperm DNA of 25 male infertile volunteers. The data obtained during experiments was the subject of a statistical study. The results of OEO (0.2% (
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) sterile agar solution) supplementation on the characteristic parameters of mobility and nuclear quality were obtained by the Student 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. The experiment has shown a significant stimulating effect on advanced mobility parameters: curvilinear velocity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), linear velocity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), mean path velocity (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and amplitude of displacement (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) [
