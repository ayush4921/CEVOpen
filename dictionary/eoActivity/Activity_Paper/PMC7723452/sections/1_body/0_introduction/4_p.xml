<p>An on-going and related project, the Meitheal Dúchas.ie Community Transcription project

This project, launched in 2016, invites users of the site to transcribe, on a voluntary basis, the stories that were collected as part of the Schools' Collection, from scanned images of each page of the collection, to written text (

Easy access to such a huge body of dynamic, diverse and evolving information via the Dúchas.ie website and the Meitheal Community Project, facilitates novel Irish ethnological research on the 1930’s to be conducted efficiently. As the Meitheal project is still on going, the level of transcription has increased since the writing of this paper. To date, there is only one study based on the Dúchas database, that addressed ethical considerations in publishing sensitive material from the collection (
