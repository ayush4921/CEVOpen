<p>Data after filtering by province is reflected in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8A</xref>. The graph depicts the variation of the number of normalized transcripts in each province. For example, there are significantly higher citations of garlic in Connaught and Ulster than the other part of the country. The data was subsequently filtered to the two counties Roscommon and Wexford (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>) as the “probes” for this study were based on the results from analysis of these two counties (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Shannon et al., 2018</xref>). Wexford shows a higher normalized number of citations than Roscommon in more plants, namely Dandelion, Dock, Nettle, and Comfrey. Of note, the order in which the seven plants rank in terms of the number of citations in the two counties is the same as that in the whole country and that established by the 2018 study (
