<p>Searching text using the toolbar on the homepage panel will generate results that are automatically sorted by “Schools,” “Stories,” “Transcripts,” and “Photographs” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3E</xref>). The number of results generated is also shown. For the purpose of the study, the functionality of the “Transcripts” was further explored as transcripts citing the relevant keyword, which can also be filtered by county using the left panel, are revealed here. After the search term has been inputted, e.g., “dandelion,” part of the scanned pages as well as details including the title, language, informant, age and excerpt of the retrieved transcripts are shown where available.
