<p>The maps depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref> reveal that there is a different extent of disparity between the amount of manuscripts from each county and the amount of manuscripts that have been transcribed through the Meitheal project and that include the top 10 plants listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, for most counties. For instance, notwithstanding that county Cork shows the greatest density of digitized manuscripts (darkest blue color in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), its total number of retrieved transcripts citing the top 10 plants, is in the mid-range in the country, where the converse is true for county Mayo with the greatest density of retrieved transcripts, i.e., darkest blue color in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>. On the other hand, a number of counties show comparable quantities, i.e., similar shade of blue, in both, the number of digitized manuscripts and retrieved manuscripts citing the top 10 plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4A,B</xref>).
