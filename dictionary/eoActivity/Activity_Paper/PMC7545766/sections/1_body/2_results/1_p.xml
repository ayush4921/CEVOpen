<p>The % alpha amylase inhibition of oils from 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1179551420963106">Figure 2</xref>. The % inhibition of oils from 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> at higher concentrations (5.0%,7.5% and 10%) were greater than 50%; 58.13 ± 1.09%, 69.80 ± 1.11%, 51.30% ± 0.04 and 55.45 ± 1.35%, 59.73 ± 1.12%, 65.21 ± 1.11% respectively. Acarbose at 7.5% and 10% had a percentage inhibition of 59.93 ± 0.15% and 68.90 ± 1.19% respectively. At these concentrations, the percentage inhibition for acarbose was not significantly different from 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> oil.
