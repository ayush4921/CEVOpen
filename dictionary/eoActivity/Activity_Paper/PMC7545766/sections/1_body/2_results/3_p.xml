<p>The Michealis-Menten plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1179551420963106">Figure 3</xref>) shows that the oils from 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> had decreased velocity at substrate concentration of 1 to 5 mg/ml when compared to the no inhibitor (no oil). The velocities of alpha amylase at various concentration, (when there was no inhibitor) was between 0.43 and 0.71 mM/min while that of 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> and 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> were between 0.32 and 0.46 mM/min and 0.32 to 0.48 mM/min respectively. The lineweaver-burk plot of both oils and that of the no inhibitor (no oil) were at the same point that is, their Vmax was the same but the Km of the 2 oils increased when compared to the Km when no inhibitor was present as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1179551420963106">Figure 4</xref>. The values of the kinetic parameters obtained from the Lineweaver-Burk plot are shown in 
 <xref rid="table2-1179551420963106" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The Vmax for 
 <italic>A. sativum</italic> oil, 
 <italic>A. cepa</italic> oil and the no inhibitor are 0.71 mM/min while their Km are 2.0 mg/ml, 1.8 mg/ml and 0.67mg/ml respectively.
