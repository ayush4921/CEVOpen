<p>MassLynx V 4.1 was employed for the analysis of the chemical constituents of Radix Scutellariae. The chemical composition was elucidated by the spectral information obtained from secondary ion mass spectrometry, which was cross-referenced with the retention time, mass-to-charge ratio, molecular weight, structural formula and elemental composition of known ingredients in Radix Scutellariae. Based on the VIP results, the different candidate ions observed in the Na
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> treatment groups and the control group were tentatively identified. When taking the identification of baicalin as an example, in positive mode, the ion (RT = 4.92 min and [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> = 447.12) detected in the Na

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>-treated sample was calculated to be C
 <sub>21</sub>H
 <sub>19</sub>O
 <sub>11</sub> based on the elemental composition, fractional isotope abundance, and Chemspider database information. The main MS/MS fragment ions of peak 9 were

 <xref rid="pone.0238927.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], a total of 25 chemical markers that were differentially expressed between the two Radix Scutellariae treatment groups was successfully identified, including 19 candidate ions in positive ion mode and 6 candidate ions in negative mode. Using Waters Masslynx software, we finally confirmed their identities with the MS/MS data. The UPLC-HDMS chromatograms of Scutellaria root (Radix Scutellariae) in positive ion mode and in negative ion mode are shown in
