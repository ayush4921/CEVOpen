 <italic>baicalensis</italic> was produced in varying proportions. Under ROS, the contents of free flavonoids with many phenolic hydroxyl groups and characteristically high antioxidant activities increased. The change in the proportion and activities of these compounds modified the ability of the plants to eliminate redundant ROS and maintain ROS equilibrium through the biosynthesis and conversion of flavonoids in a manner similar to that occurring in an intricate buffer solution; in addition, the complexity of the active compounds ensures that plants respond to changing environments as quickly and delicately as possible. Herbal medicines are often closely linked to the ecological significance of secondary metabolites, which perfectly explains the diversity and complexity of medicinal plant ingredients.
