<p>The secondary metabolites in plants are numerous; by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography, a total of 132 metabolites in

 <xref rid="pone.0238927.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], most of which were secondary metabolites. It has been proven that the proportion of secondary metabolites varies according to ever-changing environmental conditions [

It is known that the ingredients in herbal medicines are complex, so it is impossible to assess their value by only one or several secondary metabolites. These compounds are usually put into classes with similar structures, whose changes result in variations in their activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0238927.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Secondary metabolites are important for plants to adapt to adversity; the reason why plants contain so many, not few, secondary metabolites is unknown. Additionally, the connection between the secondary metabolites is also unknown.
