<p>Ultra-performance liquid chromatography: Chromatographic separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) consisting of a binary solvent system, a sample manager and a column compartment. The column used was a UPLC
 <sup>TM</sup> BEH C
 <sub>25</sub> column (100 mm× 2.1 mm 1.8 μm, Waters Corporation, Milford, USA). The column temperature was maintained at 40°C for all analyses, and the autosampler temperature was maintained at 10°C. The optimal mobile phase consisted of a linear gradient system of (A) 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile and (B) 0.1% formic acid in water: 0 to 1.5 min, 16 to 22% A; 1.5 to 5 min, 22 to 30% A; 5 to 9 min, 30 to 40% A; 9 to 12 min, 40 to 70% A; and 12 to 15 min, 70 to 100% A. The detection wavelengths were those used in a full ultraviolet wavelength scan from 190 to 400 nm. The flow rate was set to 0.4 mL/min. The injection volume was 3 μL. The detection of positive and negative ions was performed by the continuous flow of the analytes to the mass spectrometer. All the samples were kept at 4°C during the analysis.
