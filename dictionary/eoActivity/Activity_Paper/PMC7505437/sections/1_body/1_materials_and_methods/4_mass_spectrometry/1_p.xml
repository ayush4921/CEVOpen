<p>Positive ionization mode: The capillary voltage was 3.0 kV, the sampling cone voltage was 25 V, the extraction voltage was 4.0 V, the desolvation gas temperature was 350°C, the desolvation gas flow was 600 L/h, the source temperature was 110°C, and leucine enkephalin at a concentration of 0.2 ng/mL was used via a lock spray interface and introduced with a flow rate of 100 μL/min for monitoring in positive ionization mode ([M+H]+ = 556.2771) to ensure accuracy during the MS analysis. The lock spray frequency was set to 5 s, and scan averaging for the correction was performed every 0.02 s and 0.4 s. The scanning range was
