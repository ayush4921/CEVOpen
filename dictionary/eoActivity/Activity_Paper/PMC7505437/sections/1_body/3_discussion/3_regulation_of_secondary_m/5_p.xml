<p>In this paper, only the components with VIP values â‰¥2 were selected and regarded as the most significant differential chemical markers, and the biosynthesis pathway of 13 different components was summarized, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0238927.g006">Fig 6</xref>, according to the literature [
