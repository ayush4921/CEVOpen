    "This study was focused on extraction, radical scavenging activities, and chemical composition identification of total flavonoids in sunflower (<i>Helianthus annuus</i> L.) receptacles (TFSR). We investigated the optimal extract parameters of TFSR using response surface methodology. The highest yield of TFSR was 1.04% with the ethanol concentration 58%, the material-to-liquid ratio 1:20 (<i>v</i>/<i>w</i>), the extraction time 2.6 h, and the extraction temperature 67 °C. The results of radical scavenging activities showed that ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) was the strongest by using 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2, 2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzo thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and iron ion reducing analysis. The EAF had the highest flavonoids contents. Four fractions A, B, C and D were enrichment from EAF by polyamide resin. Fraction B had the highest flavonoids content. Thirteen chemical components of flavonoids in fraction B were first identified by Ultimate 3000 Nano LC System coupled to a Q Exactive HF benchtop Orbitrap mass spectrometer (UHPLC-HRMS/MS). Among of the thirteen chemical components, isoquercetin and daidzein were identified accurately by comparing with standard samples. Radical scavenging analysis showed that isoquercetin and EAF had strong activities. Therefore, sunflower receptacles can be used as a source of natural flavonoids. TFSR as a natural radical scavenger has potential applications in pharmaceutical industry."
