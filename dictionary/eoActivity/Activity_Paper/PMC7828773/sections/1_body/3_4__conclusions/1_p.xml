<p>This study was the first systematic study on the chemical components and potential radical scavenging activities of TFSR. The optimal extraction yield of TFSR was 1.04% with the ethanol concentration 58%, the material-to-liquid ratio 1:20 (

The crude extracts of TFSR were suspended into water and distribution by increasing polarities (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol), the EAF had the highest total flavonoids contents (191.95 mg RTE/g DW). Polyamide resin had a good enrichment effect on flavonoids in EAF was proved, the flavonoids content of fraction B had increased to 363.30 mg RTE/g DW. Therefore, fraction B was selected for component identification, thirteen chemical compounds of flavonoids were identified by UHPLC-HRMS/MS. The components of isoquercetin and daidzein were identified accurately. In vitro radical scavenging activities analysis showed that EAF and isoquercetin had high potential antioxidant activity. In summary, TFSR as a natural radical scavenger has potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry.
