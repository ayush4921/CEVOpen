<p>The contents of flavonoids were determined by aluminum nitrate colorimetry using rutin as standard [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-26-00403" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A standard solution was prepared using a rutin solution (0–60 μg/mL). Each extract (1 mL) was mixed with NaNO
 <sub>2</sub> (0.3 mL, 5%). After 6 min, AlCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.3 mL, 10%) and NaOH (2 mL, 1 M/L) were added to the mixture. Finally, the mixture was adjusted to 10 mL with 30% ethanol. After 15 min, the absorbance was read at 510 nm. The extraction yield of TFSR was listed as mg of rutin equivalent per gram of sunflower receptacles powder. The contents of TFSR were presented in milligram rutin equivalent per gram of dry weight extract (mg RTE/g DW) [
