<p>Polyamide resin has a good enrichment effect on flavonoids. Thus, polyamide resin was selected to further enrich flavonoids from EAF [

 <xref rid="B29-molecules-26-00403" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The polyamide resin was pretreated and added to the chromatography column (glass column diameter, 3.2 cm; height, 40 cm; filling height, 25 cm). EAF sample (2 g) was dissolved in 10 mL of ethanol, mixed with 10 g polyamide resin, and dried in a blast dryer at 60 °C. The dried mixture was spread flat on top of the polyamide column. The elution solvent was a water–ethanol system (0%, 30%, 70%, and 95% ethanol). The elution volume of each ethanol concentration were 3BV (column volume), the elution speed was 1 BV/h, and the elution time were 3 h. The eluate was concentrated by vacuum distillation at 60 °C, 0.8 MPa for 3–4 h. The freeze dryer was used for further drying (the freeze-drying parameters: −52 °C, 0.052 mbar), after 36 h, the dry material was obtained and marked as A, B, C, D. The contents of flavonoids in A, B, C, D were measured.
