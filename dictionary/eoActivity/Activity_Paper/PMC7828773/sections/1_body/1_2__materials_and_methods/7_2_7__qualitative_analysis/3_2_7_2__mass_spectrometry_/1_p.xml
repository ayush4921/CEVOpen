 <italic>z</italic> 150–2000. The detection method was full mass scan with data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry (dd-MS2). The resolution was 70,000 in full mass scan and 17,500 in dd-MS2. The ion spray needle voltage was 3.8 kV (positive). The capillary temperature was 300 °C. The collision gas was high-purity argon (purity ≥ 99.999%). The sheath gases were nitrogen (purity ≥ 99.999%) and 40 Arb, and the auxiliary gas was nitrogen (purity ≥ 99.999%; heater temperature was 350 °C. Data acquisition time was 30.0 min.
