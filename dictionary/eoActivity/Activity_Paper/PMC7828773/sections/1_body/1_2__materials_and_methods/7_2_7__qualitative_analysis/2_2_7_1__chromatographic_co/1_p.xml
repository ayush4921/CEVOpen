<p>RP-C18 column (150 × 210 mm, 1.8 μm; Welch) was used in this study. The mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (A) and 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile (B). The gradient elution was performed as follows: 0–5 min, 98% A; 5–10 min, 98% A → 50% A; 10–15 min, 50% A → 20% A; 15–20 min, 20% A → 5% A; 20–25 min, 5% A → 5% A; 25–30 min and 5% A → 98% A. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. The autosampler temperature was 10.0 °C, the column temperature was 35 °C. Injection needle height was 2.00 mm, and injection volume was 10 µL [
