<p>In recent years, many methods had been used to estimate the radical scavenging capacity of natural products. The commonly assays involved DPPH, ABTS, iron ion reducing ability, hydroxyl radicals, bleaching of Î²-carotene, cupric ion reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), metal chelation, protection against cellular oxidative damage and so on [
