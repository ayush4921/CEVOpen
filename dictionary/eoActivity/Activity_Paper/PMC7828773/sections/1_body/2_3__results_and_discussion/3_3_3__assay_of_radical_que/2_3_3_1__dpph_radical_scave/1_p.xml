<p>The free radical scavenging activities of the different extraction fractions from sunflower receptacles were determined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00403-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The free radical scavenging activities of all samples under the concentration gradient of 0â€“625 ug/mL were positively correlated and in the order: EAF &gt; nBUF &gt; WAF &gt; PEF. Among all samples, EAF and isoquercetin showed higher free radical scavenging activity. The free-radical scavenging ability of PEF and daidzein were very weak and did not increased as PEF concentration increased.
