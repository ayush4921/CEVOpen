<p>The radical scavenging activities of different extract fractions of TFSR were measured in this study. DPPH and ABTS tests are rapid assays that can provide rapid assessment of the radical scavenging ability of phytochemicals in an extract reacting respectively by H-atom transfer and electron transfer with potential antioxidants. Iron ion reducing assay evaluate the reducing ability of an extract which might confirm the presence of potential antioxidants [

 <xref rid="B39-molecules-26-00403" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Free radical scavenging activities mean that TFSR have potential applications in anti-aging and anti-inflammatory. Therefore, it was necessary to further study the antioxidant activity of the isoquercetin, daidzein and extraction fractions.
