<p>The optimal extraction process was adjusted, according to the actual situations: the ethanol concentration was 58%, the material-to-liquid ratio was 1:20 (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>w</italic>), the extraction time was 2.6 h, and the extraction temperature was 67 °C. With this condition, three repetitive experiments were performed, and the yield of TSFR was highest as 1.04 ± 0.01% (RSD = 0.01%). The optimization extraction yield was very close to the model’s prediction, which meant that this model had good practical significance.
