<p>The response surface and contour lines of the interaction of A (extraction time), B (ethanol concentration), C (material-to-liquid ratio), and D (extraction temperature) were shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00403-f001">Figure 1</xref>. The contour plots of various factors can reflect the interaction influence on the response value. Extraction temperature and ethanol concentration had the greatest influence on the extraction yield of TFSR. The contour plots of ethanol concentration and extraction time, ethanol concentration and material-to-liquid ratio, ethanol concentration and extraction temperature were oval, which indicated that the interactions were obvious.
