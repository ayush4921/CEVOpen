<p>The optimal extraction conditions for TFSR were obtained by regression model. The yield of TFSR was 1.08% with the optimal extraction conditions as followed: the ethanol concentration was 57.63%, the material-to-liquid ratio was 1:20.35 (

For the concentration of ethanol: the changes of extraction yield due to changes of the polarity of the extractant. When the ethanol content was about 60%, the extraction yield of flavonoids reached the highest, and then as the concentration of ethanol increased, the extraction yield of flavonoids decreased. For extraction temperature: the movement of molecules increased with the increased of temperature, so the solubility of flavonoids increased with the increased of temperature, but too high temperature destroyed the structure of heat-sensitive flavonoids [
