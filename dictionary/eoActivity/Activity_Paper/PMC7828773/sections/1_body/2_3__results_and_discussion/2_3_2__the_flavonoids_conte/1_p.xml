<p>It was the first time to systematically investigate the total flavonoids contents of sunflower receptacles. In this study, crude extracts of 58% ethanol were partitioned into four extracts by using different solutions (petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, water) to further enrich the flavonoids contents. As listed in 
 <xref rid="molecules-26-00403-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, it was showed clearly that the EAF had the highest contents of flavonoids, which implied that ethyl acetate was the best extraction solvent to enrich flavonoid compounds from the crude extracts.
