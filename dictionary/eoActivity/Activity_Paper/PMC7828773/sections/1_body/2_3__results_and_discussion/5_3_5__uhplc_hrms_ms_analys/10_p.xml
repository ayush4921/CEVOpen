<p>The formation process of compound 
 <bold>7</bold> can be inferred in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00403-f006">Figure 6</xref>. Compound 
 <bold>7</bold> eluted at 11.825 min had the precursor ion [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> at

 <italic>z</italic> 331.0809. The [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> ion eliminated 15 Da (CH

 <italic>z</italic> 119.04902 (C
 <sub>8</sub>H
 <sub>7</sub>O [M]
 <sup>+</sup>) was 211 Da (C

 <sub>7</sub>O
 <sub>6</sub>) less than that of the parent ion. Moreover, diagnostic fragment ions at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 121.02834 were generated by the fragmentation of precursor ion cleaved at position C. The fragment ions of compound 
 <bold>7</bold> were compared with the reported data, the diagnostic ion at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 316.05637 [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-26-00403" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, the compound 
 <bold>7</bold> was identified as cirsiliol.
