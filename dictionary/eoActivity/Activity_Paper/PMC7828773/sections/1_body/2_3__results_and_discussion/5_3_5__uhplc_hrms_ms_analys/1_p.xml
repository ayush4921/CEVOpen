<p>The possible molecular formulas were deduced from high-resolution mass spectrometry information. Thirty-one compounds of flavonoids had best matched in database. The compounds with mass error value of less than 2 ppm were selected and then analyzed by the fragmentation rules of the compounds. Finally, a total of 13 compounds were identified. These compounds have not been reported in sunflower receptacles until now, the retention time and mass spectrum information of the 13 compounds were shown in
