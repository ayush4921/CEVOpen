<p>The skeleton structure of flavonoids is C6-C3-C6. The C3 chain of compound 
 <bold>4</bold> was cleaved at position A (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-26-00403-f006">Figure 6</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>4</bold> (daidzein) belongs to isoflavones, compound 
 <bold>6</bold> (5-O-Methylgenistein) also is an isoflavone. Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> and compound 
 <bold>4</bold> were cleaved at the same position of the C3 chain. The fragments of daidzein provided a basis for the fragmentâ€™s analysis of compound 
 <bold>6</bold>. The cross-conjugated system of flavone and the non-cross-conjugated system of isoflavones have an impact on the stability of the C3 chain. The C3 chain of daidzein and isoquercetin were cleaved, the cleavage position has universality and particularity. In addition, the substitution patterns on the C6 rings lead to different types of produce ions and the intensity of relative abundances [
