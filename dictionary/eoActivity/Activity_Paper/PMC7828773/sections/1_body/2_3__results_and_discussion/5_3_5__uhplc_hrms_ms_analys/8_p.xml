<p>The peak of compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was observed at 9.669 min in the extracted ion chromatogram. Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> had a quasi-molecular ion [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 493.13382 (C
 <sub>30</sub>H
 <sub>48</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>). Major fragment ions, such as 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 151.03864 (C
 <sub>8</sub>H
 <sub>7</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> [M]
 <sup>+</sup>) and 79.05429 (C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>7</sub> [M]
 <sup>+</sup>), were observed in the secondary spectrum. The formation process was presumed as follows: the mother ion was reduced by 310 (C
 <sub>14</sub>H
 <sub>14</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>) and 31 Da (CH
 <sub>3</sub>O) compared with the fragment at 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 151.03864. [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> ion eliminated 282 (C
 <sub>12</sub>H
 <sub>12</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>), 36 (2H
 <sub>2</sub>O), 17 (OH), and 44 Da (CO
 <sub>2</sub>) to produce 
 <italic>m</italic>/
 <italic>z</italic> 79.05429. Therefore, compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was preliminarily identified as tricin 5-O-Î²-D-glucoside.
