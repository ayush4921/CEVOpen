<p>According to the chromatographic conditions of the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-molecules-26-00403">Appendix A</xref>, the existence of daidzein was further confirmed by compared with standard sample (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-26-00403">Supplementary Material</xref>). In the chromatogram, the peaks of component B and standard sample both appeared at RT = 6.67. In the mass spectrum,
