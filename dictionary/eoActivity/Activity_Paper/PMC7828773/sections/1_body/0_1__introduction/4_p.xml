<p>In previous studies, four flavonoids were identified from flowers of sunflower, including hymenoxin, sudaehitin, hispidulin and pectolinarigenin [

The chemical compounds of sunflower receptacles may be the material basis of its biological activities, so it is meaningful to identify the chemical composition of sunflower receptacles.
