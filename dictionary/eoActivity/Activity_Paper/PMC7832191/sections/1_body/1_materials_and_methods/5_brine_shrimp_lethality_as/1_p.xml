<p>Brine shrimp lethality assay was a preliminary toxicity investigation. Ten shrimps per vial were added. Extract plants at 10, 100, and 1000 ug/ml were prepared on filtered paper. After 24 h, the number surviving were recorded and determined percentage LC
 <sub>50</sub> from the graph. LC
 <sub>50</sub> value lower than 1000 ug/ml is considered Toxic.[
