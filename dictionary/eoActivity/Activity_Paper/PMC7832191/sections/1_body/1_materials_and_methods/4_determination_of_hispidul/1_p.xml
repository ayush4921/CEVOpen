<p>High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was used for the determination of hispidulin in MH by comparing it with the standards of hispidulin. The stock solution of hispidulin and MH was freshly prepared at 1 mg/mL in methanol and aqueous, respectively. HPLC analysis was performed using Dionex Ultimate 3000, equipped with an auto sample, a column oven, and DAD detector. The separation was performed with Acclaim C18 (3 μm × 4.6 mm × 150 mm) using aqueous and acetonitrile as mobile phases. The flow rate was 0.6 ml/min. The column temperature was set at 35°C, and then injection volume was 1.5 and 10 μl of hispidulin and MH, respectively. The detection wavelength was determined at 280 nm.</p>
