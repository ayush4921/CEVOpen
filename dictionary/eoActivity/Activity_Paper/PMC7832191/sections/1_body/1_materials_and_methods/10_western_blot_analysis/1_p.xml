<p>The 50 μg proteins were electrophoresed to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transferred to a Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membraneand blocked with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were then incubated overnight with anti Sirt1 (1:1000) and anti synaptophysin (1:1000). Thereafter, the membranes were probed with anti rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000). Finally, the HRP substrate was used to incubate the membrane and then detected with an X ray film. The ImageJ®software was used for analyzing the densitometry.</p>
