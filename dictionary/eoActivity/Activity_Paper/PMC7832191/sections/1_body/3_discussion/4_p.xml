<p>To confirm the indirect effect in scavenging of ROS by MH, the Sirt 1 was then evaluated. In this study we found that the both of MH and hispidulin treatment showed the significantly increased of Sirt 1 expression (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) that correlated with the decline of ROS.Consequently, we suggested that the reduction of ROS in aging neurons by MH and hispidulin might be by both direct and indirect free radical scavengers. Moreover, Sirt-1 was also recorded as the cellular senescence inhibitor. Hence, we then evaluated the number of senescence cells in MH treatment whether involved with Sirt-1 expression or not. The result showed that MH treatment in SK-N-SH treated with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> markedly decreased of SA-β-gal-positive cells (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, the high concentration of MH has slightly better effect in the reduction of SA-β-gal-positive cells than hispidulin. We suggested that hispidulin in MH plays a pivotal role in the induction of Sirt-1, but the inhibition of senescence by MH might cause by hispidulin and other polyphenol.[
