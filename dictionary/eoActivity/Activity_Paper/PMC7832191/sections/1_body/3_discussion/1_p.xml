<p>Brine shrimp lethality was used for investigation the preliminary cytotoxicity of MH extract. The result revealed that MH extract was nontoxic. The qualitative phytochemical analyses of extract showed the flavonoids, terpenoids, phenolic, cardiac glycosides, and carbohydrate. The obtained results are in concordance with reported previously.[

 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The result revealed that MH extract had high phenolic content and exhibited potential in scavenging free radical, the observed result agreed with previous studies.[
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] One active ingredient of MH flower is hispidulin which is one of the polyphenols that has the ability in the scavenging of free radical-induced brain diseases.[
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Hispidulin was used as a positive control to compare the potential in antiaging with MH extract. From the results, the qualitative analysis demonstrated that MH extract was found to be less hispidulin. The results were related to the previous studies in 1986, which found hispidulin from the flowers of MH.[
