<p>Recently, studies found that MH treatment has high potency in the promotion of cell viability in dose-dependent manner in H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated SK-N-SH cells. Interestingly, the results showed that MH treatment also caused reduction of apoptotic cell number (

 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-treated SK-N-SH cells might be by hispidulin and other active ingredients such as flavonoid that has a high number of studies on anti-apoptosis in neuronal tissue.[
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] We found that the MH could alleviate ROS production in SK-N-SH cell-treated with H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> in a dose-dependent manner (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Otherwise, the highest concentration of MH has similarly effect comparing to hispidulin treatment, so the reduction of ROS by MH treatment might be by the hispidulin effect.
