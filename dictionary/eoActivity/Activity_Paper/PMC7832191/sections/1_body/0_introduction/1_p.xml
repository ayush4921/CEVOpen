<p>Cellular senescence or aging is the cellular response implicated with various pathological conditions such as heart disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD).[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Previous reports demonstrated that the aging process in brain tissue of AD was commonly found in several cell types such as neuron, glia cells, and brain endothelial cells before leading the cell stress, dysfunction, and death in finally.[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The pathological hallmark in aging neuron was primarily mediated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that caused protein degradation, intracellular antioxidant defense imbalance, and lipid peroxidation prior encourage various negative responses such as inflammation.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Simultaneously, the inflammatory response in neuronal cells also suppressed sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog)-1 (Sirt-1), the mediator of cellular defense system and cell division, before underwent senescence and death.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Moreover, the reduction of Sirt-1 also promoted the overactivation of senescence-associated β-galactosidase enzyme (SA-β-gal) and telomerase enzyme leading telomere shortening and then the cells become aging.[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Afterward, the cell death response or apoptosis will activate by firstly modulated the cleavage caspase-3 that caused cellular deformation and then affected to neuronal function, especially decreasing both of pre- and postsynaptic protein such as synaptophysin.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The degradation of synaptic protein was mainly by monoamine oxidase and acetylcholinesterase (AchE) that caused AD progression.[
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Several studies were showed that the reduction of AchE activity in neuronal tissue plays a key role in the reversing of synaptic protein degradation in the AD model.[
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Therefore, the reduction of aging-induced negative response in neurons might be helpful for promoting of AD or brain disease recovery.
