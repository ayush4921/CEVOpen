 <italic>Millingtonia hortensis</italic> (MH) belongs to family Bignoniaceae. The common name in English is “Indian cork tree” or “tree jasmine” and commonly known in Thai as “Peep.”[
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In Thai traditional, the flower of MH has an efficacy for curing disease, especially in respiratory system disease such as asthma, sinusitis, cholagogue, and tonic.[
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Moreover, it has high antioxidant component such as flavonoid and hispidulin which were recorded in the reduction of negative response-induced cellular dysfunction and death in brain tissue.[
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Nevertheless, its effect has not been understood in aging neuronal cells. Based on the above data, we speculated that MH would reduce cell stress, senescence, death, and synaptic plasticity impairment on aging neuron. To investigate this hypothesis, the SK-N-SH cells were triggered by H
