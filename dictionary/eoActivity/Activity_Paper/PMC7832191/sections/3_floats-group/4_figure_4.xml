   <italic>Millingtonia hortensis</italic> promoted cell survival and inhibited apoptosis in H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> treated SK-N-SH cells. The SK-N-SH cells were prior treated with H
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>2</sub> for 4 h and then discard the media and replaced with 
   <italic>Millingtonia hortensis</italic> or His treatment for 24 h. The cell viability was analyzed by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and the number of apoptotic cells was investigated by flow cytometry. The values present the mean Â± standard error of the mean from 3 independent experiments. **
