   <italic>Millingtonia hortensis</italic> reversed H2O2-impaired synaptic plasticity in SK-N-SH cells. The SK-N-SH cells were prior treated with H2O2 for 4 h and then discard the media and replaced with 
   <italic>Millingtonia hortensis</italic> or this treatment for 24 h. The activity of AChE in the cells was determined by AChE assay (a). The expression protein of synaptophysin (b) was determined by western blot analysis. The values present the mean Â± standard error of the mean from three independent experiments. ***
