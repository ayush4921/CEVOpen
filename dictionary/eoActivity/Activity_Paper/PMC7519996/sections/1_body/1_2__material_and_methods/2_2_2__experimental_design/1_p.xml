<p>The rats were randomly divided into five groups (
 <italic>N</italic> = 6 per group). After one week of acclimation to laboratory conditions, for three consecutive weeks and once daily, the animals were administered with either physiological solution (NaCl 0.9% in a volume of 0.5 ml/100 g, i.p.) (the normotensive control group) or L-NAME (25 mg/kg in a volume of 0.5 ml/100 g, i.p.) (hypertensive-like groups). The latter groups concomitantly received either the physiological solution in a volume of 0.5 ml/100 g (i.p.) (the hypertensive control group), the antihypertensive drug captopril (20 mg/kg, in a volume of 1 mL/100 g, p.o.) (the positive control group), or a dose of the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> (100 or 200 mg/kg in a volume of 1 mL/100 g, p.o.) (test groups). The body weight was measured every two days.
