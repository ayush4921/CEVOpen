<p>Moreover, treatment with either 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> extract or captopril also prevented hypertension-associated affections of organs typically observed in L-NAME-induced hypertensive animals, including kidney affection as indicated by the prevention of increases in creatinine and serum urea [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and liver affection, as indicated by the mitigation of the elevation of transaminase activity in the blood [

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, hypertension can lead to abnormalities in cardiac structure [

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this study, a significant increase in the relative weight of the left ventricle was observed in L-NAME-induced hypertensive control rats, but not in animals concomitantly treated with either captopril or the extract of 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic>, further suggesting that 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> stem bark has antihypertensive properties. On the same hand, unlike in animals concomitantly treated with either captopril or the extract, increases in the magnitude of the QRS complex and in the duration of the QT and QRS intervals were observed in hypertensive control rats. In a previous report, L-NAME-treated rats displayed increases in RR interval and in the duration of the P wave, as well as an elevation in ST-segment, resulting in bradycardia [
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our findings are in agreement with this report, as prolongation of QT interval may indicate ventricular arrhythmia and QRS interval lengthening a slowing down of the frequency of heart contractions [
