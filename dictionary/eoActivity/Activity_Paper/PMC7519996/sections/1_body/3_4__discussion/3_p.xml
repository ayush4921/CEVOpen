<p>The histopathological findings confirmed the biochemical and the electrophysiological observations. Histopathological changes typically observed in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats, such as increased monocyte and platelet adhesion, thickening of the vascular wall, aggregation of inflammatory cells in organs [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], were less marked or absent in animals treated with either 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> extract or captopril. Altogether, these findings suggest that 
 <italic>A. digitata</italic> extract has antihypertensive properties in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats.
