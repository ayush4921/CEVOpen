<p>Beyond the pathogenesis, the management of hypertension without marked undesired effects and consequently with high patient adherence is challenging [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Novel therapeutics are direly needed in the field, and medicinal plants are a potential source. 
 <italic>Adansonia digitata</italic> L. (“African baobab”) is a medicinal plant of the order of Malvales (the Bombaceae family), which is commonly used by African traditional healers for the management of cardiovascular disorders [

 <italic>A. digitata</italic> is a big iconic and culturally significant tree found in savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa, which is popularly nicknamed as “the small pharmacy tree” due to its numerous uses in folk medicine [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The plant was reported anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimalarial, and antimicrobial properties [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An alkaloid isolated from the stem bark and termed as “adansonine” was reported to account at least partly for antimalarial [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, despite the traditional use against cardiovascular diseases, data are lacking on the effects of the plant on hypertension, a major driver of these diseases.
