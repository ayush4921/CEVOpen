<p>Nonetheless, it is well-established that oxidative stress contributes to the development of hypertension through nitric oxide (NO) deficiency [

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The vascular endothelial cells' product NO is a potent vasodilator with important roles in the growth and resistance of blood vessels [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. NO synthase inhibitors induce endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress by decreasing NO activity. Subchronic administration of laboratory rodents with NO synthase inhibitors, such as N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), results in chronic hypertension [
