  <italic>Determination of flavonoids content.</italic>
 </bold> The amount of flavonoids present in the extract was determined using the aluminium chloride (AlCl 
 <sub>3</sub>) colorimetric assay, as described by Majouli

 </sup>. A mixture of 0.5 mL of extract was added to an equal volume of 2% AlCl 
 <sub>3</sub> solution. The mixture was incubated for 10 min and vigorously shaken, after which the absorbance was measured at 420 nm. Varying concentrations of the standard (quercetin) were also prepared with the same method. All samples were analysed in triplicates. Flavonoid content was expressed as milligrams of quercetin equivalent per gram (mg QE/g) with the standard curve: y = 2.9422x - 0.4438, R 
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.913
