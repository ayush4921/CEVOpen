 </sup>. A mixture was prepared by reacting 7 mM ABTS solution and 2.45 mM K 
 <sub>2</sub>S 
 <sub>2</sub>O8 (1:1), which was kept in the dark for 12 hours to produce a bluish green coloration. The solution was adjusted with methanol until an absorbance of 0.700 Â± 0.01 at 734 nm was obtained. 1mL of plant extract was allowed to react with 1 mL of the working solution and the absorbance was measured at 734 nm after 7 min. The ABTS scavenging capacity of the extracts were compared with that of BHT and rutin and percentage inhibition was calculated as:
