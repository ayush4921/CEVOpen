 </sup>. Briefly, 0.3 mL of the extracts and standard (0.025-0.4 mg/mL) were measured into separate test tubes and each was dissolved in 3 mL of reagent solution (0.6 M sulfuric acid, 4 mM ammonium molybdate, and 28 mM sodium phosphate). The test tubes were incubated at 90Â°C in a water bath for 90 min, allowed to cool to room temperature and the absorbance was measured at 695 nm. Rutin and BHT were used as standards. The percentage inhibition (%TAC) was calculated as:
