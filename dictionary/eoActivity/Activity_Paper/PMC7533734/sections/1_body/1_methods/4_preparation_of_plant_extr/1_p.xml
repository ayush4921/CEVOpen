<p>Fresh 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves were oven dried at 40 
 <sup>0</sup>C and crushed to coarse powder. 100 g of the powdered plant material was extracted separately in 500 mL acetone, ethanol and water for 24 hours on an orbital shaker. An equal weight of the fresh leaves was immersed into 500 mL of hot water (80 
 <sup>0</sup>C) for 5 min to simulate home cooking and ground with a blender. The extracts were filtered under pressure using a Buchner funnel and Whatman filter paper (150 mm); the acetone and ethanol extracts were concentrated to dryness using a rotary evaporator while the aqueous extract and blanched sample were subjected to freeze drying. The extracts were thereafter stored at 4 
 <sup>0</sup>C until further analysis.
