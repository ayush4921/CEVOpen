<p>Firstly, sterile round bottom 96-well plates were filled with 100 µl of distilled water. 100 µl stock fractions of 50 mg/mL of plant extract and standard (Erythromycin) were then added into the first row. The fractions were serially diluted to make varying concentrations of the plant extracts (0.78125–12.5 mg/mL) and standard (0.0625–1 µg/mL) and then 50 µl of inoculums was added into the wells. Thereafter, 100 µl sterile nutrient broth culture medium plus 50 µl of the culture of each organism was added into each well and the inoculated micro plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. 1% DMSO was used as the negative control while 100 µl of inoculums only was used as the growth hormone. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 37˚C, and subsequently 40 µl of 0.4 mg/mL INT dye was added to each well. The plates were gently agitated and incubated for another 30 min. The MICs were then determined as the lowest concentrations at which there was no indication of colour change to pink (no bacterial growth). </p>
