  <italic>ABTS radical scavenging activity.</italic>
 </bold> The ABTS radical scavenging activities of the extracts and standards (BHT and rutin) are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>. The samples exhibited significant ABTS radical scavenging activities, which increased in a concentration dependent manner. Although the standards showed higher ABTS inhibitory potentials than the extracts, the highest inhibitory capacity of the extracts was observed in the ethanol and aqueous extracts. Based on the IC 
 <sub>50</sub> ( 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), ABTS scavenging activity of the samples was in the order: BHT &gt; rutin &gt; ethanol &amp; aqueous &gt; acetone &gt; blanched.
