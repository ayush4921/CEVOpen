 </bold> Antibacterial activity of erythromycin (standard) and extracts of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves are presented in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. While all Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria strains tested were resistant to the aqueous extract at all the concentrations tested, the blanched, acetone, and ethanol extracts showed considerable antibacterial activities with MICs ranging from 1.563-12.5 mg/mL. Ethanol extract showed the best antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>B. pumilus, S. epidermidis, S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, exhibiting a low MIC of (1.563 and 3.125 mg/mL). Generally speaking, the Gram-negative bacteria were observed to be more resistant against the extracts tested.
