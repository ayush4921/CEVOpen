<p>The total phenol, proanthocyanidin and flavonoid contents of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaf extracts are presented in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The highest phenol content was found in the ethanol extract (42.50 mg GAE/g), followed by the aqueous extract (34.24 mg GAE/g), blanched extract (21.42 mg GAE/g) and acetone extract (15.10 mg GAE/g). Ethanol extract (8402.1 mg QE/g) showed the highest proanthocyanidin content followed by acetone extract (4923 mg QE/g DW), blanched extract (928.6 mg QE/g) and aqueous extract (459 mg QE/g). The concentration of flavonoid was highest in the ethanol extract (235.79 mg QE/g), followed by acetone extract (230.52 mg QE/g), aqueous extract (154.95 mg QE/g) and blanched extract (109.24 mg QE/g). Quantitative determination of the alkaloid and saponin contents of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves also revealed low alkaloid content (5.59%) with considerable amount of saponin (23.33%).
