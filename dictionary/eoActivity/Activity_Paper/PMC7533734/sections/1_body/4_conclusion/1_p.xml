<p>Our results clearly indicated that the extraction of phenolic compounds and their antioxidant capacity is highly dependent on the solvent of extraction. The study also revealed that 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> aqueous, blanched and ethanol leaf extracts possess various levels and concentrations of phytochemical constituents, which may be essential for human health. A positive correlation between polyphenolic contents, antioxidant and antibacterial activities in extracts of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves was established, which indicates that certain phenolic compounds may be responsible for high antioxidant activity. It was also observed that the blanching process (at 80 
 <sup>0 </sup>C) significantly decreased polyphenolic content and antioxidant activities but increased antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>H. arborescens</italic> leaves. This study therefore agrees with its reported use in traditional medicine for the treatment of some bacterial infections and diseases.
