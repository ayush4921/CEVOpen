<p> A minor correction: The MIC of Ethanol extract against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>was 12.5 and this did not fall within the range of 1.563- 3.125 stated in the result. This, therefore, revealed an ethanol extract that had a weak antibacterial effect on 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The authors should take a look at this.
