<p>The results of the biochemical parameters analyzed such as urea, creatinine, and aminotransferases (ALAT and ASAT) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04528-f005">Figure 5</xref>. The results showed that the biochemical parameters of treated mice with a dose up to a maximum (2000 mg/kg body) were not directly affected when compared to the control mice (

In the current work, potential hepatotoxicity of the extract was assessed by measuring the enzymatic activities of aminotransferases (ALAT and ASAT). An abnormal increase in aminotransferase activities (ALAT and ASAT) could frequently refer to hepatotoxicity [
