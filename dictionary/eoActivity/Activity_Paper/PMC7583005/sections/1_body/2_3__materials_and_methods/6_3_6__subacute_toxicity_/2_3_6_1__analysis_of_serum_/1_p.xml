<p>Analysis of serum biochemistry was done at the end of the experiment. The collected blood from mice was transferred into tubes with anticoagulants for being centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. The plasma was recovered and stored in a freezer until further analysis. Aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALAT), Creatinine, and Urea, were measured. The measurement of biochemical parameters (ASAT, ALAT, urea, and creatinine) was carried out using a Hycel Lisa 300 automaton.</p>
