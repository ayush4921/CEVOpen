<p>Leaves of 
 <italic>W. frutescens. L</italic> were collected at the end of March 2019 from the region of Fez-Morocco. The identification of the studied plant was made by the botanist Amina Bari (Department, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University Faculty of Sciences Dhar El-Mahraz, Fez, Morocco) and the voucher specimens have been deposited in the herbarium of the faculty of sciences under the reference BPRN69. The leaves were rinsed and dried in the shade at 30 ± 2 °C. The dried leaves were crushed using an electric mixture. The resulting powder was extracted using hydro-ethanolic maceration constituted of 70% ethanol and 30% distilled water for 24 h at room temperature. Afterward, the mixture was filtered under reduced pressure using a rota-steamer. After filtration, the filtrate/extract was kept for further use.
