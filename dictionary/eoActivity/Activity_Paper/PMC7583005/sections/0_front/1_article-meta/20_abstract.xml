  <italic>Withania frutescens</italic> (
  <italic>W. frutescens</italic>) is a medicinal plant widely used to treat several diseases. This work aims to study phytochemical composition as well as acute and subacute toxicity of 
  <italic>W. frutescens</italic> hydroethanolic extract in mice. The phytochemical composition of 
  <italic>W. frutescens</italic> extract was performed using gas chromatographic analysis. Acute toxicity was studied in vivo with oral administration of single doses 400 mg/kg, 1000 mg/kg, and 2000 mg/kg for 14 days. Subacute toxicity was studied with the administration of repeated doses of 400 mg/kg/day and 2000 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Phytochemical analysis of 
  <italic>W. frutescens</italic> hydro-ethanolic extract confirmed the presence of interesting chemical compounds. Acute toxicity results showed no toxic symptoms in mice treated with an increasing dose up to a maximum of 2000 mg/kg. Alongside acute toxicity, subacute data showed no clinical symptoms nor biochemical or histological alteration in mice treated with an increasing dose up to a maximum of 2000 mg/kg compared to the control group (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). This study shows no toxic effects in animals treated with 
  <italic>W. frutescens</italic> extract, and, therefore, this plant can be considered safe in animals up to 2000 mg/kg under both acute and subacute toxicity conditions.
