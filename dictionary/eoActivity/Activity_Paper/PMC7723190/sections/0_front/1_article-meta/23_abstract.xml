 <p>Okra (
  <italic>Abelmoschus esculentus)</italic> has various bioactive components used for the treatment of different diseases such as gastritis and ulcers. This research aims to examine the anti‐inflammatory and anti‐ulcer attributes of okra extract against gastric lesions. Adult Sprague Dawley male albino rats were divided into five groups. The negative control (G1) received normal feed, positive control (G2) received ulcer‐inducing drug aspirin 150 mg/kg of body weight (b.w), G3 group received reference drug omeprazole 20 mg/kg of b.w, G4 group received okra extract 250 mg/kg of b.w, and G5 group received 500 mg/kg of b.w. Acute gastric damage was induced in G1, G2, G3, and G4 using aspirin 150 mg/kg of b.w, during 14‐day‐long efficacy trials after that all the animals were sacrificed. Anti‐ulcer parameters and histopathological analysis of stomachs were performed to evaluate the degree of recovery against tissue damage by the administration of okra extract. The obtained results indicated that the 500 mg/kg of b.w okra extract exerted a protective effect in aspirin‐induced gastric ulcers by significantly (
  <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) reducing ulcer score, ulcer area, total acidity, and gastric volume, and significantly (
  <italic>p </italic>&lt; .05) increasing gastric pH. Moreover, histopathological observation revealed that gastric mucosa was normal in G1, G3, G4, and G5; however, disruptions in the gastric epithelium were observed in G2. Congestion was observed in all groups except G1 and G5. Gastric pits and gastric glands were increased in size in G2 and G4. A higher concentration of okra extract (500 mg/kg of b.w) showed almost similar results when compared to the reference drug omeprazole.
