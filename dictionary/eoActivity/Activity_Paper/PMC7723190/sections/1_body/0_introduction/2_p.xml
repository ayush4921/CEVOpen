<p>Gastric ulcers are biological changes in the normal architecture of cells of the stomach wall that are caused by any erosion or disruption and get worse by persistent inflammation and oxidative stress. Although the basic mechanism is still under experimentation, it is considered that gastric ulcerations occur due to an imbalance between protective and damaging factors (Ardalani et al.,
