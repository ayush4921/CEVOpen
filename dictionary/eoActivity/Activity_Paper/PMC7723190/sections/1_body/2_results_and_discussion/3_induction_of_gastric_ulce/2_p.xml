<p>Aspirin, a nonsteroid anti‐inflammatory drug (NSAID) 150 mg/kg of body weight, was used to induce stomach ulcers in the present study. Cyclooxygenase 1 (COX‐1) present in stomach mucosa is responsible for the production of gastroprotective prostaglandins. Aspirin being a potent ulcerogenic drug inhibits the activity of COX‐1 resulting in the suppression of protective prostaglandins. Moreover, it decreases bicarbonate secretion and gastric mucosal blood flow making gastric mucosa more susceptible to gastric mucosal injury and ulceration (Voutilainen et al.,

It inhibits the H+/K+‐ATPase system and gastric mucosa carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Consequently, gastric acid production is reduced leading to reduced ulceration (Adefisayo et al.,
