<p>The gastric pH of stomach contents significantly (
 <italic>p</italic> ˂ 0.01) decreased after the induction of gastric ulcers. Gastric pH of G1 (2.33 ± 0.320) and G3 (2.31 ± 1.860) was nonsignificantly (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05) different from each other. Omeprazole improved stomach pH in G3 as compared to the positive control group G2 (1.31 ± 0.017). It correlates with the study of Bhajoni et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) who assessed the anti‐ulcer effect of aqueous extract of leaves of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> on gastric ulcer using gastric pH as a biomarker. Extract of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> helped in attenuating raised gastric pH due to aspirin, pyloric ligation, and cold‐restraint stress‐induced gastric ulcer and exhibited potential anti‐ulcer properties.
