<p>The lowest total acidity was observed in G3 than in other groups as presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. But this total acidity difference in G3 and G1 was nonsignificant (
 <italic>p </italic>&gt; .05). The highest total acidity was observed in positive control group G2 (542.53 ± 10.78), while the G4 (463.63 ± 2.68) and G5 (454.07 ± 4.31) were found nonsignificantly (
 <italic>p </italic>&gt; .05) different from each other. Similar findings were observed by Arumugam et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), who reported that total acidity increased after ulcer induction by the administration of ethanol and reduced after the anti‐ulceration effect of 
 <italic>Samanea saman (Jacq)</italic> merr bark. Bhajoni et al. (
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>) observed a significant reduction in total acidity after the treatment of ulcers with leaves of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic>. Gastrin hormone is released by G cells present in the gastric antrum. Gastrin acts on the enterochromaffin‐like cells in the gastric corpus to release histamine, which stimulates parietal cells to secrete acid. Parietal cells are also directly stimulated by gastrin and it also promotes the growth of parietal and enterochromaffin‐like cells (Calam &amp; Baron, 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>). Infection impairs the acid‐mediated inhibitory control responsible for gastrin and ultimately gastrin secretion is increased stimulating excessive acid secretion leading to ulceration (McColl et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). Increased production of gastric juice results in more gastric ulcers, acidity, ulcer scoring, ulcer area, and ulcer index and declined gastric pH. The gastric acid inhibiting ability of okra extract may be as a result of a direct action of lectins on cells involved in acid production. Lectins are the glycoproteins having the ability to recognize and bind carbohydrates (Bardocz et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>) are present in okra (Caluête et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). They can inhibit the uptake of aminopyrine by parietal cells (Healey et al.,
