Reduction in gastric volume by the consumption of omeprazole (3.10 ± 0.21 ml) and 500 mg/kg b.w of okra extract (3.69 ± 0.28 ml) was nonsignificantly different from each other. A study that was conducted to investigate the anti‐ulcer effect of newly formulated drug “ranitidine mucoadhesive hydrogel formulae” demonstrated the increase in gastric volume due to ulcer lesions. Drug‐administered rats showed a reduction in gastric volume after reduced gastric ulcers than the control group (Arumugam et al.,
