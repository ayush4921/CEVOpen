<p>The concentration of TPC in okra extract was found to be 141.37 ± 1.16 GAE/100 g (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This finding is comparable with the results reported that TPC was 142.48 ± 0.02 mg GAE/100 g and 10.75 ± 0.02 mg GAE/100 g in okra seeds and pulp, respectively (Khomsug et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). DPPH value in okra extract was 52.72 ± 0.80%. A study conducted to assess the free radical scavenging potential of total phenolic extract (TPE) of okra and its isolated phenolic compounds reported that the scavenging activity of TPE is 44.1%. This value is lower than the DPPH value recorded in the present study. This may be due to differences in variety, cultivation conditions, and environment (Hu et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Quercetin amount observed was 37 mg/100 g in okra extract. Arapitsas (
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>) reported that the amount of quercetin was 0.3 mg/g in okra skin. In the present research, amount of quercetin is slightly higher because the analysis was performed for whole okra fruit extract.
