<p>Ethanolic extract of okra was subjected to antioxidant analysis by assessing total phenolic content (TPC) with the Folin–Ciocalteu method (Manzoor et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>) and free radical scavenging activity through DPPH assay (Manzoor et al., 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Quantification of quercetin was done through high‐performance liquid chromatography by using column Shim‐Pack CLC‐ODS (C‐18), 25 cm 4.6 mm, 5 μm, and UV‐Vis detector. Gradient solvent system was used as the mobile phase: A (water:acetic acid; 94:6 pH = 2.27) and B (100% acetonitrile + water) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance was recorded at 280 nm (Careri et al.,
