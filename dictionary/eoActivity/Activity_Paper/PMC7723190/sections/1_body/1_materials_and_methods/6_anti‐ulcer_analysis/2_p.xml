<p>Rat stomachs were opened along the greater curvature, cleaned, and washed gently using normal saline water to remove blood clots and gastric content and examined by a 10X magnifier lens to assess ulcer formation. Gastric volume was determined by centrifugation of gastric juice for 10 min at 1000rpm, and then, the volume of supernatant was noted. Total acid and pH values were assessed using pH meter and titration method, respectively (Raju et al.,

 <sup>2</sup>), using a simple microscope (Wang et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Ulcer index was calculated by adding the total number of ulcers per stomach and the mean of the severity of ulcer per stomach (Laine &amp; Weinstein, 
 <xref rid="fsn31963-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">1988</xref>). Histopathological evaluation of gastric tissues was performed to see the recovery due to okra extract (Laine &amp; Weinstein,
