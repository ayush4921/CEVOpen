<p>The DPPH radical scavenging activity was assessed according to the literature [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. The test samples were prepared by 2-fold serial dilution method in ethanol, and their final concentrations were ranged from 0.625 to 40 mg/mL. Absorbance measurements of 50 µL of tested samples and 100 µL DPPH solutions (0.1 mg/mL) were read at 517 nm, after 25 min of incubation time in a dark place, at room temperature. Absorption of a blank sample containing the same amount of ethanol and DPPH solution was used as the negative control. The percentage inhibition of the DPPH radical by the samples was calculated according to the formula: Inhibition percentage (%) = [(

 <sub>Control</sub> − (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Sample</sub> − 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Blank</sub>))/
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Control</sub>] × 100, where 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Control</sub> is the absorption of the negative control, 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Sample</sub> is the absorption of the DPPH solution containing tested samples and 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Blank</sub> is the absorption of the sample solution without DPPH. All analyses were carried out in triplicate. The effective concentration of the sample required to scavenge DPPH radical by 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub> value) was calculated by SPSS.
