<p>Lipophilic extracts were obtained according to the method reported in the literature [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Fresh, oven-dried, and freeze-dried fruit bodies of black morel were cut into small parts (1.0 ± 0.5 cm) and transferred into the flask with freshly distilled petroleum ether (30–60 °C). The flasks were placed in a dark and shady place for one week at room temperature. The petroleum ether layers were separated and dried by anhydrous Na
