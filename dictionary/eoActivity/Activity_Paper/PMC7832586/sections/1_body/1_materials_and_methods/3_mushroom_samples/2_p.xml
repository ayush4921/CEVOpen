<p>Mature fruit bodies of black morel (
 <italic>M. importuna</italic>) were collected from planting base in Xindu district, Chengdu, China, and identified by ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS), combined with morphological characteristics. Oven drying was carried out in an electro-thermostatic blast oven (Yiheng Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). The cleaned fruit bodies were placed on a stainless steel bracket and then dried at 50 ± 2 °C until reaching a constant weight. The freeze-drying was carried out in a FreeZone 2.5 L freeze dryer (Labconco Corp., Kansas City, MO, USA). The cleaned fruit bodies were pre-frozen at −20 °C, and then dried under vacuum (&lt;0.12 mbar), at −50 °C, until reaching a constant weight. The dried black morels (
