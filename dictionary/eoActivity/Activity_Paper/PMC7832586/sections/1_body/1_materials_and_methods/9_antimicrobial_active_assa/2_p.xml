 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ATCC 25922), 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (ATCC 25923)
 <italic>, Bacillus subtilis</italic> (ATCC 6633), and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (ATCC 10231) were used for the evaluation of the antimicrobial activity. Antimicrobial activity assessments were performed in 96-well sterilized microplates using a microdilution method described previously [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The 18-h old bacterial cultures from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic> were added to LB broth medium (1 L water, 10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, and 10 g NaCl) to reach 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL, and the 4-day-old spores from 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> were added to PDB medium (potato extract 20%, glucose 2%) to reach 1 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> spores/mL. The test samples were dissolved in DMSO, and their final concentrations were ranged from 0.5 to 512 µg/mL, which were determined by 2-fold serial dilution method. The wells containing test strains and diluted samples were incubated at 37 °C (24 h) for bacteria and 28 °C (4 days) for fungi. The wells containing a culture suspension and DMSO were run as negative controls. Kanamycin (for bacteria) and nystatin (for fungi) were used as positive controls. All experiments were repeated twice. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration that produced complete growth inhibition of the tested microorganisms.
