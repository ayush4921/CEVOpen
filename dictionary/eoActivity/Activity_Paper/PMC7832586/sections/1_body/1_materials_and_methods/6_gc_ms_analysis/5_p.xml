<p>Mass spectrometry conditions were EI ionization mode, 70 eV, scan range 33–600 amu, and ion source temperature was 200 °C. Individual components were identified by matching their mass spectra with those of the spectrometer database (NIST08. LIB). For quantification purposes, the relative area (%) was used without the use of correction factors.</p>
