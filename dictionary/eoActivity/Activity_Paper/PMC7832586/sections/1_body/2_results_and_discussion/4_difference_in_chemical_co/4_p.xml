<p>1-Octen-3-ol, an alcohol with “mushroom-like” odor [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], was found to be the major component (34.4%) in fresh black morel (
 <italic>M. importuna</italic>). It was also found to be the major compound in freeze-dried black morel (68.61%). But, a sharp decrease of 1-octen-3-ol was found in the oven-dried sample (6.76%), which was associated with the loss of “mushroom-like” smell, and freeze-drying was proved to be more suitable for retaining morel smell.
