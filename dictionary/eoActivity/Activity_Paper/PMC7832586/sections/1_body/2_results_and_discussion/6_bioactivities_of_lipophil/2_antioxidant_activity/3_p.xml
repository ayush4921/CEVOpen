<p>In ABTS assay, all the lipophilic extracts showed moderate antioxidant activities (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 5.75 ∼ 9.73 mg/mL), compared with ascorbic acid (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.17 mg/mL), and the extracts of oven-dried black morel (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 5.75 mg/mL) was also more active than that of fresh (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 9.73 mg/mL) and freeze-dried (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 7.18 mg/mL) black morel, which was similar with DPPH assay. The major components of oven-dried black morel were steroids, which may be the cause for its better antioxidant activity.
