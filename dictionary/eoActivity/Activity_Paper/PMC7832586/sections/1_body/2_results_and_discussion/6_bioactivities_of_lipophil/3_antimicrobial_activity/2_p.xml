<p>The antimicrobial activity of lipophilic extracts of black morel was evaluated using the microdilution method in a 96-well plate against a set of microorganisms (Gram-positive bacteria: 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>B. subtilis</italic>; Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>; fungi:
