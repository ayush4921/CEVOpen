<p>Morels (species of 
 <italic>Morchella</italic> Dill. ex Pers.) are a traditional food source and medicinal mushrooms in the northern hemisphere, especially in Asia, Europe, and North America [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As a food source, the morel is considered a nutritious food of high nutritional values as fish or meat in Asia. As a medicinal mushroom, the morel is recorded as “sweet, cold and non-toxic, beneficial to the stomach, reducing phlegm and promoting the circulation of qi” in “Ben-Cao-Gang-Mu,” a Chinese outline treatise of medical herbs [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, morels are mainly harvested from the wild in China, India, Turkey, Mexico, and the USA [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. But, overharvesting of morels from the wild will cause the depletion of the wild resource. Excitingly, two species of 
 <italic>Morchella</italic> mushrooms (
 <italic>Morchella importuna</italic> and 
 <italic>M. sextelata</italic>) have been artificially cultivated in fields in China recently. Among the two, 
 <italic>M. importuna</italic> (black morel) has been widely cultivated and accounted for more than 95% of the total cultivated area of morels [
