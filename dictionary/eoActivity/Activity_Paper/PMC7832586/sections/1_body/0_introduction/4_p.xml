<p>In order to better understand the chemical profile of black morel (
 <italic>M. importuna</italic>) grown in China and the effect of drying method (oven and freeze) on chemical composition, aromas were studied by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), coupled with gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Meanwhile, lipophilic extracts were also prepared and analyzed by GC-MS, together with the evaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.
