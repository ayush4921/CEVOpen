  <italic>In vitro</italic> seed germination and protocorms formation were successfully established in traditionally used 
  <italic>Dendrobium longicornu</italic>. Fresh protocorms (178.34 g – 183.90 g) were produced on the elicitor of 
  <italic>Alternaria</italic> sp, 
  <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
  <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> supplemented MS-medium. Methanol extract of 
  <italic>D. longicornu</italic> protocorms has scavenged 94.31 % of DPPH radicals at 1000 μg/mL. Its 117.56 μg/mL concentration has scavenged 50 % DPPH radical (IC
  <sub>50</sub>). Similarly, it inhibits 25.39 % and 27.80 % HeLa and U251 cells at 500 μg/mL. The IC
  <sub>50</sub> was found as 350.06 μg/mL and 507.22 μg/mL for HeLa and U251 cells respectively. Further, it inhibited the growth of 
  <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
  <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
  <italic>E. cloacae</italic> with the zone of inhibition 4, 2 and 2 mm respectively. In conclusion, protocorms developed through 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> seeds culture have accumulated and synthesized bioactive secondary metabolites. Therefore, protocorms could be utilized to the isolation of compounds for formulation of herbal drugs without damaging natural populations.
