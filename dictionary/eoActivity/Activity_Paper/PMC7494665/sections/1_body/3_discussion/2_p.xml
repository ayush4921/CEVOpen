<p id="par0100">There are many nutrient medium and culture types that were successfully employed for the propagation of 
 <italic>Dendrobium</italic> species from various explants [
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. And such nutrient medium supplemented with additives of exogenous supply has played a significant contribution to the protocorms culture of 
 <italic>Dendrobium</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As a result, 
 <italic>Agaricus bisporus</italic> and 
 <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> are not considered as compatible fungi for the germination of seeds and protocorms development. This is because of endophytic fungi isolated from one species does not necessarily stimulate the seed germination or further development of protocorms of the other species. The elicitors used in the present study were prepared in our laboratory from the endophytic fungi of 
 <italic>Dendrobium moniliforme</italic> and 
 <italic>Vanda cristata</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the supplementation of elicitors on MS-medium played a vital role in seed germination, production of protocorms biomass and plant growth of 
 <italic>Cymbidium aloifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>Rhyncostylis retusa</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We wanted to develop a protocol that will lead to the production of increased phenolic and other bioactive secondary metabolites in the cultured protocorms biomass. The biosynthesis of natural products is integral to plant immune responses activated in response to attempted cell and tissue culture [
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During cell and tissue culture, the release of bioactive compound derivatives is very common as reported in much previous literature [
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>]. Many phytochemicals such as alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolic derivatives have been previously reported from its wild counterparts [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, phytochemicals synthesized in the tissue cultured plant material (protocorms) are reported first time in this paper. Moreover, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> propagated protocorms or plants have less variation in the content of secondary metabolites than wild counterparts [
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Also, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> propagated plant materials are found to contain a higher amount of active ingredients than the intact plants [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, the plant tissue culture technology is the alternative way to produce the bioactive secondary metabolites which may have found in the wild plants and also help to conserve the plants in the natural habitats.
