<p id="par0090">Antimicrobial effect of methanol extract of 
 <italic>D. longicornu</italic> protocorms was evaluated using the well-diffusion method against different bacterial strains. The zone of inhibition of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>E. cloacae</italic> growth was shown by extract as 4, 2 and 2 mm respectively (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, the extract has not inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and 
 <italic>C. freundii</italic> (
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Moreover, the average zone of inhibition of growth of all the bacteria by gentamicin (a positive control) was found as 23 mm which was more than that of plant extract. The zone of inhibition of growth of bacteria by plant extract and gentamicin was statistically significantly different. It has proved that protocorms extract has moderate antimicrobial activity towards the bacterial strains.
