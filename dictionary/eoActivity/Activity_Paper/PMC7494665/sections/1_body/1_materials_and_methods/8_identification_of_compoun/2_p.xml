<p id="par0065">Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS; Shimadzu Europa GmbH, Germany) was used to identify the compounds [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Spectroscopic detection has involved an electron ionization system which utilized high-energy electrons (70 eV). Pure helium gas (99.99 %) was used as the carrier gas with a column flow rate of 0.95 mL/min. The initial temperature was set at 100 °C and increased at a rate of 3 °C/min after a holding time of about 10 min. In the end, the temperature was increased to 300 °C at 10 °C/min. One microliter of 1% methanol extract was injected in a splitless mode. The relative quantity of the chemical compounds present in the extract was expressed as a percentage based on the peak area produced in the chromatogram. Compounds were identified based using GC retention time and by matching the spectra with standard values (literature) using computer software.
