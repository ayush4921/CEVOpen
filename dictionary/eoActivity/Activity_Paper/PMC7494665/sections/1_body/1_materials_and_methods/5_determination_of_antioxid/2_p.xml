<p id="par0050">Antioxidant effect of the extract was determined using a DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free-radical scavenging assay [
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The extract was diluted in methanol to prepare a series of concentrations (125, 250, 500 and 1000 μg/mL). A stock solution of 0.25 mM DPPH free-radical was also prepared in methanol. The reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 1.5 mL of DPPH solution and 1.5 mL of an extract of various concentrations. The reaction mixture was shaken well and incubated for 30 min in dark at room temperature. The rate of change of purple DPPH into yellow by the extract was determined quantitatively by measuring absorbance at 517 nm using Genesys UV–vis spectrophotometer. The ascorbic acid was used as the positive control compound for which the above-mentioned procedure was followed.
