<p>De Wet et al. carried out the anti-cancer activity of crude alkaloidal extract of rhizomes of 
 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> in three cancer cell lines, i.e., breast (MCF7), melanoma (UACC62) and renal (TK10) cell lines and the extract showed moderate anticancer activity [

 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> against HeLa cell line and the results showed an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 111 µg/mL [

 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> against Dalton’s lymphoma ascites (DLA) cells in mice. The methanolic extract of 
 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> showed significant cytotoxic activity with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 84.56 mg/mL in MCF-7 cancer cell line in-vitro. The extract also showed in-vivo antitumor activity as the doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg body weight significantly reduced the packed cell volume, tumor cell count, and restored the hematological and serum biochemical parameters towards the normal values [
