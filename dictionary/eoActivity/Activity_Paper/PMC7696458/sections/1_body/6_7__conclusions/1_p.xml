 <italic>Cocculus hirsutus</italic> is widely used in various traditional medicine systems in South Asia for the treatment of fever, skin diseases, stomach disorders, urinary diseases and also as a sedative among many other uses. The most commonly reported constituents were alkaloids such as jasminitine, hirsutine, cohirsitine and their derivatives. Some flavonoids, triterpene derivatives and volatile compounds were also reported from different plant parts. However, these chemical isolation studies were mostly carried out about 30–40 years previously, except for a few studies related to GC-MS analysis. Detailed bioassay guided isolation studies may afford pharmacologically active compounds. Extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> were evaluated for their antimicrobial, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, hepatoprotective activities among others. However, most of these studies were based on in vitro evaluation methods and only a few studies were carried out in animal models. There are also not many studies evaluating the activity of isolated compounds. In the future, properly designed in vivo and clinical studies are necessary to evaluate the pharmacological activities of 
 <italic>C. hirsutus</italic> along with bioassay guided chemical isolation studies to isolate and identify the active constituents. Similarly, the safety and toxicity evaluation studies are not performed in detail. The possible herb–drug interaction should also be studied in detail in the future.
