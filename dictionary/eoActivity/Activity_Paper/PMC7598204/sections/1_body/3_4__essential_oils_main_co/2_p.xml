<p>The antiarthritic potential of terpenes, the main components in EOs, has been reviewed recently by Carvalho and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. An in vivo beneficial effect was reported for 24 terpenes, such as the triterpene emodinol isolated from 
 <italic>Paeonia emodi</italic> Wall., and the sesquiterpene torilin, which were both demonstrated to modulate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in vivo.
