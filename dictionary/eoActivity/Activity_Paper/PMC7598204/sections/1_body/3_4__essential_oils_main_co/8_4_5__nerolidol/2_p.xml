<p>Nano-encapsulated nerolidol was recently studied for its effects on zymosan-induced arthritic mice [
 <xref rid="B61-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. An in vivo neutrophil migration assay was performed and both free nerolidol and its polymer nanoparticles pointed out a significant anti-inflammatory activity in arthritic mice, improving the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and significantly inhibiting the neutrophil migration into the joint cavity.
