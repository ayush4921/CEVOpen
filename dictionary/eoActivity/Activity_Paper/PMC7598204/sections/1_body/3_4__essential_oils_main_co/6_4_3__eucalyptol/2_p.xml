<p>Yin and coworkers recently verified the anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential of this compound on a mouse model of gout arthritis [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The disease was induced by the injection of MSU crystals into the ankle joint. Eucalyptol was able to reduce MSU-induced allodynia, edema, and neutrophil infiltration in ankle joint tissues. Moreover, this molecule inhibited nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-, leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The oxidative stress induced by MSU in both RAW 264.7 cells in vitro and in ankle joint tissues in vivo was also reduced.
