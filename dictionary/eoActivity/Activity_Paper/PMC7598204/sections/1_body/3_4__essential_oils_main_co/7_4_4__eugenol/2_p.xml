<p>The efficacy of this allylbenzene in arthritic rats was verified by Grespan and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Arthritis was induced in mice through the injection of an emulsion of bovin collagen type II and complete Freund’s adjuvant. Here, 100 µg of eugenol/day were administered orally. This compound was demonstrated to inhibit mononuclear cell infiltration and to decrease the cytokine (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and TGF-β) levels within the ankle joints.
