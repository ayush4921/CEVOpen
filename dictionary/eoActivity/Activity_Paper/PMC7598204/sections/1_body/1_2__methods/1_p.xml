<p>This search, conducted over a period of 5 months, included references published up until July 2020. The academic search engines Google Scholar, Pubmed, Microsoft Academic, and Scopus were utilized. The keywords “essential oils”, “arthritis”, “antiarthritic”, “anti-rheumatoid arthritic effect”, “terpenes”, and “volatile oil” were searched in the databases. These descriptors were combined by using Boolean operators, e.g., “and”, “+”, allowing for more targeted results. Studies focusing on the antiarthritic potential of essential oils in their whole forms or their single pure active components were included in the research, and both in vitro and in vivo studies were taken into account.</p>
