<p>The mechanism of action underlying the antiarthritic activity of some of the investigated species reported above was more deeply investigated. In some cases, the different expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and COX-2 in inflamed synovial membranes among control and treated groups were verified. As a results of their investigations, Suh et al. demonstrated that 
 <italic>C. obtusa</italic> was able to inhibit the expression of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the inflamed synovial membrane, as well as IL-1β and IL-6 in an inflamed meniscus [

 <italic>Litsea cubeba</italic>, whose EO was able to decrease the TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17A levels and to increase IL-10 in type II collagen-induced arthritic rats [

 <italic>K. galanga</italic> and some other species belonging to the Zingiberaceae family also demonstrated impacts on the expression of COX-2, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1 in Freund’s adjuvant-induced arthritic rats [

 <italic>E. caryophyllata</italic>, 
 <italic>C. inophyllum</italic>, 
 <italic>C. aurantium</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. globulus</italic>, as described by Komeh-Nkrumah and coworkers [
