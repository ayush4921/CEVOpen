<p>Suh and colleagues tested the effects of EO from the leaves of 
 <italic>Chamaecyparis obtusa</italic> (Siebold and Zucc.) Endl. (Cupressaceae) on pain-related behavior and pro-inflammatory cytokines in rats with carrageenan-induced arthritis [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The obtained results demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of this essential oil. The intra-articular application of 
 <italic>C. obtusa</italic> EO inhibited pain-related behavior and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and COX-2 in inflamed knee joints in rats.
