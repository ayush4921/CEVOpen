<p>Uriah and colleagues evaluated the in vitro biological potential of the EO obtained from the leaves of 
 <italic>G. fragrantissima</italic> [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The antiarthritic activity was evaluated with the egg albumin denaturation method and the protein denaturation method using bovine serum albumin as a protein model. At a concentration of 250 Âµg/mL, the sample induced 49.86% inhibition of protein denaturation.
