<p>Rahman and colleagues reported the anti-arthtritic potential of 
 <italic>A. agallocha</italic> Roxb. heartwood essential oil (EO) [
 <xref rid="B28-plants-09-01252" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In vitro, at the concentration of 500 µg/mL, this essential oil was demonstrated to induce 56.71% inhibition of protein denaturation. The biological potential was also assessed in vivo, in Freund’s adjuvant-induced arthritic rat model. At doses of 125 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg, 
 <italic>A. agallocha</italic> EO inhibited the increase in paw volume, with maximum inhibition values equal to 19.78% and 27.88%, respectively.
