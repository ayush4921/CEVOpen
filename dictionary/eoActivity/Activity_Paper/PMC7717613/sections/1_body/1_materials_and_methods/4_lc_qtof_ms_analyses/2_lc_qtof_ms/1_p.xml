<p>The LC-QTOF-MS system consisted of Ultimate 3000 RSLC (Dionex; Sunnyvale, CA) coupled to micrOTOF-QII quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer in positive electrospray mode (Bruker; Billerica, MA). A Zorbax SB-C18 (150 mm X 2.1 mm, 3.5 µm) column was used for the separation of compounds of interest. The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in ultra-high quality water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (B) at a constant flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Gradient programme was as follows: 0–6 min 40% A, 6–15 min 10% A, 15.1–18 min 0% A, 18.1–23 min 40% A. Optimised mass spectrometer conditions were: capillary voltage 4500 V; nebuliser pressure 5 bar; dry gas 6 L/min; gas temperature 300 °C; collision energy isomangostin and α-mangostin (15 V), garcinone C (30 V), crystal violet 372 (40 V), 8-deoxygartanin (11 V), γ-mangostin (12 V), mangostanol (20 V).</p>
