<p>For optimisation of MS conditions, stock solutions of the marker compounds at 1000 µg/mL were prepared by accurately weighing each marker compound, then dissolving them in HPLC grade methanol and storing at 4 °C prior to analysis. Working solutions were prepared by diluting an aliquot of the stock solution with methanol to the desired range of concentrations. All the diluted solutions were filtered through a 0.22 µm PTFE syringe filter (Whatman, UK) prior to injection into the LC system.</p>
