<p>Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to project the pairwise differences in the detected metabolites between samples. The method was selected over principle component analysis due to the presence of missing data (concentration below detection limits). A bubble plot was superimposed on the NMDS to illustrate the relative concentration of the metabolites across samples. NMDS and the corresponding bubble plots were constructed using the PRIMER7 programme package (PRIMER-E, UK). The differences in IC
 <sub>50</sub> across plant part clusters were presented using the box plot. Significant differences between the mean values were inferred based on analysis of variance (ANOVA). Subsequent 
 <italic>post-hoc</italic> analysis was conducted using Dunnett’s Test. Relationship between the xanthone content and IC
 <sub>50</sub> of AChE and BChE was tested using Pearson’s correlation. The relationship was illustrated using a scatter plot. Both box plot and scatter plot were generated using ggplot2 package implemented under the R programme.
