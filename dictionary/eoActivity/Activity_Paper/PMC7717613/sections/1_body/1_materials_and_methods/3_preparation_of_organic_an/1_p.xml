<p>The different parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> were extracted with methanol or distilled water by using the maceration method. In brief, the powdered samples (20 g) were extracted with methanol or distilled water for 3 days at 60°C at raw material to solvent ratio of 1:10 (w/v). Fresh solvents were replenished every day and the resulting extracts were filtered through filter paper. The pooled extracts were evaporated under vacuum and lyophilised. The yields of the lyophilised extracts were between 0.8% and 38.2%.
