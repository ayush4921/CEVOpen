<p>Our previous study showed that the methanol extract of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> pericarp and its six xanthones constituents possessed potent cholinesterase inhibitory activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value in the range of 1.28–8.0 µg/mL, whereby garcinone C, γ-mangostin and α-mangostin were the most potent inhibitors among the tested xanthones

 </xref>. Over the course of our continuing study to explore the potential cognitive enhancement properties of this plant, we aimed to compare the xanthone content in different parts of the plant and its correlation with their bioactivities. Herein, we report the analysis of six bioactive xanthones in aqueous and organic extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> using LC-QTOF-MS and evaluate their cholinesterase inhibitory activities for the first time, and correlate the influence of xanthone content on cholinesterase inhibitory potential.
