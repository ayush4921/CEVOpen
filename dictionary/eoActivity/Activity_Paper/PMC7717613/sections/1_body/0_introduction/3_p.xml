<p>Severe loss of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis and associated areas that form the cholinergic forebrain area resulted in up to 90% reduction in the activities of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, which is needed for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine

 </xref>. It is evident that acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter essential for processing memory and learning, is decreased in both concentration and function in patients with Alzheimer’s disease as a result of reduction in its synthesis and rapid breakdown by cholinesterase enzymes

 </xref>. Current available strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease relies on blocking the breakdown of acetylcholine through cholinesterase inhibitors to improve brain functions, and possibly slow deteriorations of cognitive functions
