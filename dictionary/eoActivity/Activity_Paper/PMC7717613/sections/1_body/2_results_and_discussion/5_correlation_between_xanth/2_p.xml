<p>A total of six xanthones, namely α-mangostin, γ-mangostin, 3-isomangostin, 8-deoxygartanin, garcinone C and mangostanol, were detected in the aqueous and/or methanol extracts. Based on the NMDS ordination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>), the composition of these metabolites in the methanol extracts showed greater variation than the aqueous extract. Three main clusters consisted of (1) pericarp, (2) bark and calyx (3) others were apparent when the samples were labelled based on plant parts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(B)</xref>). Among the metabolites, α-mangostin and γ-mangostin showed the strongest contribution to the separation along the horizontal axis. Indeed, the bubble plot superimposed on the NMDS showed highest level of α-mangostin and γ-mangostin in pericarp, while the lowest level of both in others (

 </xref>, the present findings suggest that α-mangostin and γ-mangostin are the key metabolites contributing to the cholinesterase inhibition. For the cholinesterase inhibition, only the methanol extracts of different parts of 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> showed appreciable activities. Based on the activities, the different parts of the plant can be clustered into three groups based on their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (refer to the box plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>). Further statistical analysis revealed a significant difference for the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of AChE between all three clusters (“Pericarp”, “Bark + Calyx”, and “Others”), suggesting that the AChE inhibitory activities of the pericarp is significantly superior to any other parts of the plant. Conversely, that is not the case for BChE inhibition as can be seen by the overlapping between the three clusters. Significant difference in IC
 <sub>50</sub> for BChE was only achieved between “Pericarp” and “Others”.
