<p>Both positive and negative ionisation modes are acceptable for the analysis of xanthones. Several groups have reported the analyses of xanthones by LC-MS in positive ionisation mode. Li etÂ al. has identified the bioactive prenylated xanthones that inhibited the growth of 
 <italic>Ralstonia solanacaerum</italic> using LC-MS in positive mode

 <italic>Swertia chirayita</italic> methanolic extract using LC-ESI/MS in positive mode

 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> in negative ionisation mode MS

 </xref>. To obtain structural information, MS/MS studies of the molecular ion of each compound were performed. All the compounds were characterised by the interpretation of their exact molecular weight, molecular formula, and characteristic MS/MS fragment ions data acquired from the Q-TOF-MS (

 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> and six authentic marker compounds. The fragmentation pathways of the xanthones derived from 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> were previously discussed
