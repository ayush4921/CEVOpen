<p>In this study, the cholinesterase inhibitory activities of the 
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic> extracts were evaluated. The cholinesterase inhibitory activities of the methanol extracts of different parts of the plant are compared with the aqueous extracts and summarised in 
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The methanol and aqueous extracts were initially screened for their cholinesterase inhibitory activities at 100 µg/mL. Extracts that had more than 50% inhibition at 100 µg/mL were further evaluated for their IC
 <sub>50</sub>. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were in the range of 0.37–72.22 μg/mL for both AChE and BChE. The methanol extracts of the pericarp and calyx showed the most potent inhibitory activities against AChE and BChE enzymes, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.90 μg/mL and 0.37 μg/mL, respectively. The methanol extract of calyx was a BChE selective inhibitor with a selectivity index of 26 while the methanol extracts of pericarp and bark are AChE selective inhibitor with a selectivity index of more than 2.
