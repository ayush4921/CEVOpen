  <p>High performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Chromatograms of the hexane (Hex) and ethylacetate (EtoAc) fractions of 
   <italic>H. noldeae</italic>. An in-house HPLC method used to screen the major components of crude extract was used. Analytical separation was carried out on a Hypersil ODS
   <sup>®</sup> RP18 column (250 × 4.6 µm; particle size 5 µm; Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All samples were dissolved in methanol HPLC-grade, filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size filter membrane and analyzed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC machine. Samples were eluted with a nonlinear gradient method with acetonitrile and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in ultra-pure water. The column temperature was maintained at 25 °C. Then 20 μL of each sample were injected into the HPLC-UV/DAD (Diode-Array Detection) system and the analysis, performed at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, was monitored at 210, 254, 288, and 350 nm.
