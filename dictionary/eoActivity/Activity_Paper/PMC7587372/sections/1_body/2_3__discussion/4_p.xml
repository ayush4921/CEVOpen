<p>The findings that our plant products of interest had inhibitory effects on the caspase-1 activities prompted us to assess the production of IL-1β in the supernatant from the different samples. Consistent with the inhibition of the caspase-1 activities all the tested crude extract, fractions and purified constituents of 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> revealed significant inhibition of IL-1β production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>A). To ensure that 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constituents acted on the inflammasome activation pathway, we further investigated their effects on pyroptosis. In fact, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces the activation of caspase-1 that promotes the production of Gasdermin D and the latter is associated to the programmed cell death called “pyroptosis” [

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04693">Figure S6</xref>). This may be explained by the fact that Dexamethasone is able to act at the transcriptional level or to selectively induce the degradation of IL-1β transcripts after their production [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Thus, the additional effect of these both mechanisms justifies its enhanced inhibition of IL-1β production in the supernatant. However, at the highest concentration tested (20 µg/mL) an unexplained ease of the inhibitory effect was observed with both fractions. Such unexpected reactions deserve further investigation during the characterization of ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions.
