<p>NLRP3 inflammasome-associated IL-1β production is a two-step process. Our findings on both pyroptosis assays (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>A) suggest that 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> derived products interfere with the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, to block cell death (pyroptosis) and IL-1β production. However, the Western blot results showed that ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions repressed the expression of Pro-Caspase-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Capsase-1 is a critical component of the inflammasome and the reduced expression of this enzyme by fractions from 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> indicates that ER2.4 and ER2.7 may in fact be acting to inhibit signal 1 (priming step) of inflammasome activation by specifically blocking upregulation of Caspase-1. In our future research, the mode of action of the molecules contained in these fractions will be elucidated.
