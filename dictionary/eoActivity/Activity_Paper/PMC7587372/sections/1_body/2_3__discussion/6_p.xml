<p>Several studies have reported in vivo anti-inflammatory properties of caffeic acid and isoquercetin as well as several corresponding derivatives [

 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> likely contribute to the inhibitory property of the plant on the inflammasome expression. However, the activity of the plant remains inferior to the activity of purified caffeic acid as well as the concentrated fractions ER2.4 and ER 2.7. This suggests that the fractionation of the plant extracts led to the enhancement of their inflammasome inhibition potency. This is in accordance with previous studies that reported the beneficial effect of fractionation in concentrating polyphenolic compounds, leading to enhanced biological activities [

 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We thus argue that the bioactive compounds in fraction ER2.4, ER2.7 together with the well-known caffeic acid and isoquercetin are the main compounds involved in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
