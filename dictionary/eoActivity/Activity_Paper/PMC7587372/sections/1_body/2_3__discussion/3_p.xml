<p>Within a plant extract, there can be hundreds of molecules, some of which are active individually or act synergistically against a given disease. In most of the cases, major compounds are responsible of the activity of the extract though it is not always the case [

 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this study, an important question was to determine whether the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome resulted from a single compound or from a combined effect of different compounds. We opted first to investigate the effect of cell pre-treatment with our various samples on the caspase-1 activities and observed an average reduction of about one-third which formed a plateau at the tested concentration ranges as shown in (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Such reduction suggested the presence of an inhibitor of caspase-1 in the plant extract. Indeed, caffeic acid, purified from 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> in this work, was reported to interact with and inhibits Caspase-1 and ASC activation [
