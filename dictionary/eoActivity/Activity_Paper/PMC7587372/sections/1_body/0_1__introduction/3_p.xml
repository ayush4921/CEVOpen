<p>In this study, we report on the bio-guided fractionation of 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> and assessment of the inhibitory properties of some fractions and purified compounds on NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-6. The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was determined by detecting the activity of caspase-1 and the production of IL-1β in Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and ATP-stimulated THP-1 macrophages, while the production of IL-6 was studied in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, a well-known standard method. It was observed that hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of the aerial parts of 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic>, as well as caffeic acid, isoquercetin, and ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions revealed the highest inhibitory effects on Caspase-1 activities, and on IL-1β and IL-6 production. The ER2.4 and ER2.7, our fractions of most interest, downregulated the production of IL-1β and IL-6, in a similar range as the caspase-1 inhibitor AC-YVAD-CHO and the drug Dexamethasone all used as controls, respectively. Overall, our findings pave the way for the first time on the scientific based evidence on 
 <italic>Hibiscus noldeae</italic> activities underlying its potential role in the treatment of inflammatory diseases and asthma in Rwanda.
