<p>The neutrophilic asthma is the most severe and has been reported to be refractory to the corticoid-based treatment [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite this resistance, the use of corticosteroids remains the basic treatment for several respiratory diseases involving cytokine storms. A recent clinical trial report revealed that the treatment with Dexamethasone significantly alleviated COVID-19 disease severity of hospitalized patients who were under invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen [
 <xref rid="B19-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Regarding the neutrophilic asthma, drugs that alleviate disease severity include specific monoclonal antibodies against key mediators of the inflammatory pathway [
 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but the associated treatment cost is not affordable for low and middle income countries (LMICs). Hence, urgent efforts are needed to identify new, effective, affordable, and safe anti-inflammatory drugs. A reliable therapeutic source which remains poorly explored is the traditional pharmacopeia. Previously, our investigations on the anti-asthmatic activities of herbal recipes from Rwandese traditional healers revealed a candidate recipe with significant inhibitory properties on the activation of caspase-1 using Caspase-Glo 1 Inflammasome assays [

 <italic>Hibiscus noldeae</italic>, from the 
 <italic>Hibiscus</italic> genus in the 
 <italic>Malvaceae</italic> family, was one of the plants composing the recipe. Plants from the same 
 <italic>Hibiscus</italic> genus, including 
 <italic>H. acetosella</italic>, 
 <italic>H. sabdariffa</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. vitifolius</italic> have been reported to have anti-inflammatory potentials and some of the responsible molecules, such as gossypin, caffeoylhydroxycitric acid, delphinidin-3-sambubioside, and neochlorogenic acid have been isolated [

 <italic>H. noldeae</italic>, although used by traditional healers in the treatment of asthma, urogenital infections, postpartum abdominal pain, swelling of the legs, cleaning of babies, facilitation of delivery, sprains, headache, wounds, women infertility, abortion prevention, etc. [
