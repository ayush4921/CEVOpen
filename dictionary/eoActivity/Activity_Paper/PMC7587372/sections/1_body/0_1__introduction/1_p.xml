<p>Respiratory diseases, with asthma being the most important, are classified among the major categories of non-communicable diseases and their prevalence accounted for more than 1 billion patients worldwide in 2018 [

 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease resulting from the malfunction of the interaction between the airways and the immune cells [

 <xref rid="B4-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Inflammation is considered to be a physiological defense mechanism which helps the body to protect itself from microbial infections, burn, toxic chemicals, allergens, or other harmful stimuli. Depending on the number or the degree of events and mediators linked to that reaction, inflammatory reaction can trigger, maintain, or aggravate many diseases [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Sometimes the delicate balance between immune-mediated clearance and noxious stimuli is troubled and this correlates with inadvertent self-harm from chronic inflammation. As a result, the immune system inappropriately leads to inflammation against its own cells, resulting in different chronic inflammatory diseases including respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [
 <xref rid="B6-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, the complicated form of SARS Cov-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) viral pneumonia outbreak was reported to be associated with a plethora of cytokines wreaking havoc throughout the body often vividly referred to as “cytokine storm”, which triggers a violent inflammatory immune response that contributes to respiratory problems, multiple organ failure, and finally death in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,

 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several studies have reported the role of different inflammatory cells and mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma where the volume and nature of involved inflammatory mediators determine the severity and exacerbations of the disease. Depending on those inflammatory patterns, there are two main subtypes of asthma, the eosinophilic (diagnosed by the expression of Th2-derived cytokines) and the neutrophilic (diagnosed by the expression of Th17-derived cytokines and chemokines) [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The latter asthma subset is characterized by a high proportion of neutrophils recruited by inflammatory cytokines like Interleukin 1β (IL-1β), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha (TNF-α). It is well known that inflammasomes, multiprotein cytoplasmic complexes activating inflammatory responses, are involved in the upregulation of these cytokines, particularly the IL-1β through the activation of caspase-1 [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among these inflammasomes, NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) is the most widely studied and its properties and functions are the best characterized [
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, in response to a microbial infection or injury, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated and involved in the host protection by inducing immune responses to clear injury or microbial invasion [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome requires two distinct signals. The first is a pro-inflammatory priming step, mediated by toll-like receptors (TLR), that induces the upregulation of the NF-κB transcription factor and promotes the expression of pro-IL-1β and the NLRP3 inflammasome component. The second signal is an activation step that induces the assembly of the NLRP3/ Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC)/pro-caspase-1 complex, ending up in the proximity auto-cleavage and maturation of caspase-1 which, in turn, induces a caspase-1-mediated maturation of pro-IL-1β and release of active IL-1β [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Several pieces of evidence from research suggest that inflammasomes and/or their components and effectors are associated with the physio-pathogenesis of asthma and other respiratory diseases including COPD, SARS CoV-2, etc. [

 <xref rid="B18-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In fact, it has been reported that the excessive release of active IL-1β and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain) specks leads to the induction of neutrophil-dominated inflammatory responses in the airways that contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD and neutrophilic asthma [
