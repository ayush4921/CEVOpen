<p>The evaluation of pyroptosis inhibition was done using the LDH-Glo
 <sup>TM</sup> Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega Co. Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, THP-1 cells were cultured for 2 days in 96-well plates to a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well in the presence of 10 nM PMA at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. PMA-supplemented medium was then discarded and macrophages were pretreated with fresh medium containing fractions at different concentrations for 1 h. Dexamethasone at a concentration of 20 µg/mL or 20 µM AC-YVAD-CHO treatments were used as controls. Cells were further incubated with LPS (Sigma, Saint-Louis, MO, USA) (at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL) for 3 h and then with 5 µM ATP (Invitrogen/Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA) for additional 1 h. Then, 2 μL of 10% Triton X-100 was added to 100 μL of Vehicle-treated Cells Control for 5 min before collecting the samples for LDH detection. Supernatants were harvested and 20-fold diluted in the LDH storage buffer and kept at –70 °C until analysis. The LDH activity was measured using the LDH-Glo 
 <sup>TM</sup> Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The % Cytotoxicity = 100 × (Experimental LDH Release − Medium Background)/(Triton X-100 LDH Release Control − Medium Background).
