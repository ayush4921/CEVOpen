<p>Preparative HPLC analysis was carried out on a Variant PrepStar machine. All extracts (500 mg) were dissolved in methanol and then diluted with water. The amount of methanol was not allowed to exceed 30%. Samples were filtered through a 0.45 Âµm filter membrane before injection. The mobile phase consisted of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 0.05% in ultrapure water (A) and acetonitrile (B). The 
 <xref rid="molecules-25-04693-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> gives the gradient used to separate the major compounds identified with HPLC analytical method described above. This gradient was obtained by transposing the analytical HPLC methods to preparative HPLC using HPLC calculator. The flow rate was 15 mL/min and the separation was monitored at 254 and 350 nm. Structural identification of isolated compounds was performed by 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopy (IR). The detection was followed at 254 and 350 nm.
