<p>The aerial parts of 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> were cleaned of dust and debris and washed gently with tap water, and air-dried under shade. The plant material was then pulverized with a grinder. A total amount of 500 g of the powder was extracted with the mixture of methanol: dichloromethane (3:1) as previously described [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The dried crude extract (55 g) was triturated in distilled water and then subjected to a liquid-liquid partitioning process using n-hexane and ethyl acetate successively. In each case, the mixture to be partitioned was vigorously shaken for 10 min, rested for 20 min, and then separated in a separatory funnel. Each partition was conducted three times and the same fractions were combined and dried-up using rotary evaporator. At the end, the non-soluble part was dissolved in methanol to make the methanol fraction.
