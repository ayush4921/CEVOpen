<p>Major compounds from two fractions showing the highest inhibitory activity on NLRP3 inflammasome components, namely hexane and ethylacetate fractions, were further isolated on preparative HPLC. To this end, an in-house HPLC method used to screen the major components of crude extracts was used. In this regard, analytical separation was carried out on a Hypersil ODS
 <sup>®</sup> RP18 column (250 × 4.6 µm; particle size 5 µm; Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All samples were dissolved in methanol HPLC-grade, filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size filter membrane and analyzed on an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA) 1100 HPLC machine. Samples were eluted with a nonlinear gradient method with acetonitrile (solvent A) and 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in ultra-pure water (solvent B) (
