<p>Human leukemia THP-1 monocyte and RAW264.7 murine cell lines were kindly received from the Institute for Medical Immunology/BioPark/ULB and were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Waltham, MA, USA) and DMEM, respectively. All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Life technologies), 1% glutamine, and 1% of penicillin-streptomycin (Life technologies) and 1% Sodium pyruvate (for RAW264.7 only) and maintained at 37 Â°C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were passaged at least 5 times before any experiment. For the determination of cell densities, the cell counting was done using a Neubauer counting chamber with trypan blue (0.4% in PBS; pH = 7.4; Life technologies) staining. Before investigating the anti-inflammatory activity of different fractions, their effect on the cell viability (THP-1, monocytes and derived-macrophages, and RAW264.7) was screened as previously reported [
