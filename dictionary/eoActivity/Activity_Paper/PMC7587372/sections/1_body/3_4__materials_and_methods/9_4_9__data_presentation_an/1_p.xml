<p>Each test was done in triplicates and all the experiments were reproduced at least two times independently. For each ELISA experiment, the amount of IL-1β or IL-6 produced was considered as 100% and the remaining treatments was calculated as (Treatment/LPS) × 100. The results are presented as the mean ± SD from two or three independent experiments (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3), each done in triplicate. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 5 and Statistical Analysis Data expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons of data between groups were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Benforroni’s multiple comparison test. The 
 <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
