<p>In all experiments, RAW264.7 cells were sub-cultured in a 24-well plate and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> to acclimate before treatment. They were then pretreated with test compounds, at indicated concentrations, for 3 h prior to 18 h stimulation with 1 µg/mL LPS. Cell-free supernatants were harvested and stored at −70 °C until analysis. The concentration of IL-6 in the culture supernatant was measured using an ELISA kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
