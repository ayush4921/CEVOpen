<p>A bio-guided fractionation approach was employed and as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f001">Figure 1</xref>, a complex chemical profile for hexane and ethylacetate fractions was observed in the High performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode-Array Detection (HPLC-DAD) analysis, indicating the presence of different major substances of different polarities. Many peaks eluted between 20 and 40 min, a fact that demonstrates the presence of medium polarity molecules, most of which are major compounds. The transposition of the analytical method to the preparative HPLC allowed for the isolation of five of the seven major compounds from ethylacetate and hexane fractions of 
 <italic>H. noldeae</italic>. Three of the five isolated compounds were pure and were identified by chromatographic and/or spectroscopic comparison with data from literature. This led to the elucidation of one flavone glycoside, namely quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucopyranoside, along with two polyphenols, caffeic acid and caffeoyl-hydrocitric acid (
