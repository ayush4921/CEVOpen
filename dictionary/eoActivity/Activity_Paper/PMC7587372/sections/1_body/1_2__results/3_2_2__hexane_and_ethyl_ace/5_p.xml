<p>NLRP3 inflammasome-associated IL-1β production is a two-step process: a priming signal that promotes Pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 synthesis and a secondary signal that induces the inflammasome assembly and the subsequent caspase-1 activation [
 <xref rid="B26-molecules-25-04693" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We investigated the effect of the crude extract and fractions of interest on the expression of Pro-IL-1β and Pro-Caspase-1 by Western blot (WB). We observed as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>B that cells pretreatment with ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions led to the reduced Pro-Caspase-1 amount marked by the faint WB-signals. This suggest that our fractions of interest inhibited the expression of this protein by impacting the first priming step of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation or induced its degradation by a mechanism to be clarified. Moreover, the Pro-IL-1β production appeared induced as marked by the width of the WB-signals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04693-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Knowing the critical role of Caspase-1 in the inflammasome activation, these observations suggest that the reduced expression of the Pro-Caspase by both ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions may in fact be acting to inhibit the upregulation of Caspase-1, hence block the Pro-IL-1β cleavage. In addition, treatment with Dexamethasone, the crude extract and the EtoAc fraction revealed reduced Pro-IL-1β WB-signals. While the effect of Dexamethasone is associated with the inhibition of the NF-κB activities leading to the repression of Pro-IL-1B production, the effects of the crude extract and EtoAc fraction could results from the dilution of the ER2.4 and ER2.7 fractions or likely their effects on NF-kB activities by their constituents to be identified.
