<p>Prior to the investigation of anti-inflammatory properties of the compounds of interest, their effect on the cell viability on both THP-1 monocytes and derived macrophages was first determined. Cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL) for 24 h, and the cell viability was determined using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA). Up to 25 µg/mL, all tested compounds did not exhibit cytotoxicity to both THP-1 and RAW264.7 cell lines (
