<p>It is well-known that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome induces the activation of caspase-1 that promotes the production of Gasdermin D. The N-terminal domain of Gasdermin D oligomerizes to form cytolytic pores and leads to the programmed cell death called “pyroptosis” [

Therefore, we investigated the effect of our compounds and fractions of interest on inflammasome activation-induced cell death by measuring the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the culture supernatants. As expected, the pretreatment of cells by our test compounds significantly inhibited ATP-induced pyroptosis (
