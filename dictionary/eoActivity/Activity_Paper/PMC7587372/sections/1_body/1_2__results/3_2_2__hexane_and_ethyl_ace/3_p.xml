<p>Next, the production of IL-1β was investigated using the human IL-1β (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) ELISA kit (Invitrogen/Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, USA). As controls, two distinct reference inhibitors, namely Ac-YVAD-CHO (YVAD) which specifically acts on caspase 1 and Dexamethasone (Dex) which downregulates the NF-κB pathway were used. As results, it was observed as expected that LPS and ATP treatment significantly (***

 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> constituents or the controls, the production IL-1β was significantly inhibited. Reductions of more than 70% could be revealed in some cases (

 <italic>H. noldeae</italic> revealed inhibitory activities comparable to the caspase 1 reference inhibitor YVAD. Isoquercetin was observed to have the lowest inhibitory effect on IL-1β production (
