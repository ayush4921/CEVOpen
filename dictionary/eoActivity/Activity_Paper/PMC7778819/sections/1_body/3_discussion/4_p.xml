<p id="Par65">The methanol extract of 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> leaves had significant activity against all tested bacteria. Among the tested strains, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> ATCC 25923, MRSA ATCC®43300TM, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC 25922, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> isolates were the most susceptible, with a zone of inhibition comparable to cefoxitin and penicillin at all tested concentrations. This finding supports the work of Manivannan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], Kannahi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and Badoni et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. ß-asarones, the active constituents found in the leaves, roots, and rhizomes of the 
 <italic>L. inermis,</italic> were responsible for all antimicrobial activities [
