 <italic>A. indica extract</italic> was found to have moderate activity against all tested strains except 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> isolate (6.3 ± 0.3 mm ZI) and MRSA (6.4 ± 0.5 mm ZI) at 400 mg/mL. In comparison with the reference drugs, the highest activity of 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> extract was recorded against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> isolate (21.0 ± 1.0 mm ZI), followed by 
 <italic>Shewanella algae</italic> (9.0 ± 0.5 mm ZI) at 400 mg/mL. Clinical isolates of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> strains were found to be less susceptible than the standard ATCCs at the tested concentrations. 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> extract at concentrations of 100 mg/mL and 200 mg showed low activity against the tested strains, except for 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>S. algae</italic> (Fig.
