<p id="Par72">The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is defined as the lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that inhibited the visible growth of microorganisms after overnight incubation. The MBC is complementary to the MIC. It demonstrates the lowest level of antimicrobial agent that results in microbial death after sub culturing the organism in an antibiotic-free media [
