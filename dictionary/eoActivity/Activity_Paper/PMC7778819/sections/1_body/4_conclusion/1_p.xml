<p id="Par78">The methanol extracts of 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> leaves exhibited antimicrobial activity against selected bacterial isolates involved in lymphoedema-associated wound infections and standard ATCCs including methicillin resistant 
 <italic>S. Aureus</italic>. 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> extract demonstrated high activity and had bactericidal effects against most of the tested bacterial strains. However, 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> and 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> extracts showed low to moderate activity against most tested strains at 400â€‰mg/mL. These findings support the traditional claim that the three medicinal plants have antibacterial activity in wound infections. Further investigations, however, need to be carried out before recommending their use.
