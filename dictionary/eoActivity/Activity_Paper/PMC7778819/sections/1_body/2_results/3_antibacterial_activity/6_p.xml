<p id="Par58">Among the strains, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> isolates were less susceptible to 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic> than the standard ATCCs. Similarly, multi-drug resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) was less susceptible to all tested extracts compared to 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolate and standard ATCC. All the references used in the test showed the highest activity against their respective tested species. The mean inhibition zones of triplicate experiments for the three different concentrations of extracts (100, 200 and 400 mg/mL) are summarized in Table
