 <italic>A. indica</italic> extract was shown to have activity against all tested species at high concentrations, and high activity was recorded against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> isolates at all concentrations (100, 200, and 400 mg/mL). However, 100 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL concentrations showed low activity against all tested strains. 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> showed the lowest activity against all tested species, except against 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> isolate (10.5 ± 0.9 to 13.3 ± 0.6 mm ZI) compared with the reference drug cefoxitin (15–24 mm) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). There were significant differences in the mean zone of inhibition between the different concentrations of 
 <italic>L. inermis</italic>, 
 <italic>A. aspera</italic> and 
 <italic>A. indica</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
