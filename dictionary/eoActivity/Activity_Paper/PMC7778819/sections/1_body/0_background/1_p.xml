<p id="Par26">Wound infections are usually associated with normal flora, bacteria from the environment or hospital-acquired infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Microorganisms infect soft tissue when the skin surface is compromised in some way. Patients with lymphoedema are at high risk of wound infection because of loss of skin integrity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], resulting in ingress of microorganisms. Impaired clearance of microorganisms from the infected area due to impaired lymphatic system results in recurrent infections [
