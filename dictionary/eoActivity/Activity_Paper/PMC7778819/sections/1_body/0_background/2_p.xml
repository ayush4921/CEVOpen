<p id="Par27">Acute inflammatory episodes associated with cellulitis and erysipelas are common complications of wounds in lymphoedema patients, and most infections are caused by group A, C, or G streptococci and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Microorganisms known to cause chronic wound infection and cellulitis in lymphoedematous limbs include 
 <italic>Streptococci species</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococci species</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas species</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bacteroides species</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Fungal infections are also common due to the moisture produced between the skin folds, resulting in skin breakdown, which in turn leads to infection in the macerated regions. Lymphangitis is an inflammation of the lymphatic system due to bacterial infection after invasion through skin wounds or abrasions [
