<p>This review presents a comprehensive account of the phytochemical constituents and biological activities of 
 <italic>G. morella</italic>. The fruits of this plant are edible, and the oil/fat obtained from its seeds is used as edible oil or ghee. Different secondary metabolites, such as xanthones, benzophenones, flavonoids, phenolic acids, organic acids, and terpenoids, have been isolated from the fruits, leaves, seeds, and heartwood of 
 <italic>G. morella</italic>, which have demonstrated several biological activities, including antioxidant, hepatoprotective, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and larvicidal properties. These properties suggest that 
 <italic>G. morella</italic> is an important source of therapeutic compounds. Nevertheless, additional research efforts are required to evaluate the toxicity of the phytochemicals isolated from this plant. There is also a need for research to explore the novel bioactive compounds of this valuable plant.
