 <italic>Garcinia morella</italic> (Gaertn.) Desr., known as Indian gamboge, is a fruit-yielding tree belonging to the family Clusiaceae and is a close relative of mangosteen (
 <italic>G. mangostana</italic>). It is an evergreen tropical tree naturally distributed across the Indian subcontinent to Indochina and Sri Lanka. In India, it is commonly distributed in the Western Ghats and northeastern regions. The tree grows up to 12 m tall (

Gamboge, the gum/resin obtained from the plant, is used as a yellow dye, as an illuminant, and in varnishes and watercolors. It is traditionally collected by cutting a thin slice off the bark of the tree about the size of the palm of the hand; the resin collects there and is scraped off when sufficiently dried. The plant is sometimes used as a root stock for mangosteen (
