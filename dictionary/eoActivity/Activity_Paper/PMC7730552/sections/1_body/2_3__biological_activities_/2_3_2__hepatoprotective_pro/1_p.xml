<p>There is evidence about the hepatoprotective properties of the fruit rind extract of 
 <italic>G. morella</italic> against carbon tetrachloride (CCl
 <sub>4</sub>)-induced albino rats [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The hepatoprotective activity was determined by measuring the activity of liver function enzymes such as aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and bilirubin and total protein in albino rats. It has been reported that albino rats treated with CCl
 <sub>4</sub> showed elevated levels of liver function enzymes and bilirubin, but a suppressed production of total protein [
 <xref rid="B37-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Pretreatment with the fruit extract significantly decreased the AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin levels and increased the production level of protein in a dose-dependent manner. The authors considered that the fruit rind extract of 
 <italic>G. morella</italic> contains both phenolic and flavonoids that are responsible for the hepatoprotective activity. Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] demonstrated that γ-mangostin exhibited the most potent activity to attenuate tert-butyl hydroperoxide (
 <italic>t</italic>-BHP)-induced hepatocyte injury. At concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 µg/mL, γ-mangostin was able to completely reverse the 
 <italic>t</italic>-BHP-induced decreases in glutamine oxaloacetate transaminase and glutamate pyruvate transaminase levels in HL-7702 cells. Similarly, the authors of [
 <xref rid="B50-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that α-mangostin also has hepatoprotective activity and could significantly decrease the level of lipid peroxidation and decrease the levels of superoxide dismutase in a mouse model.
