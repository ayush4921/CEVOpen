<p>Inflammation is a biological response to the immune system that can be triggered by various factors, including pathogens, damaged cells, and toxic compounds. These factors may induce acute inflammatory responses in various organs, potentially leading to tissue damage or diseases. Both infectious and noninfectious agents activate inflammatory cells and trigger inflammatory pathways such as NF-kB, MAPK, and JAK–STAT pathways [

 <italic>G. morella</italic> fruit is a good source of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents [
 <xref rid="B36-molecules-25-05690" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and the anti-inflammatory assay showed that it significantly decreased the release of nitrate and TNF-α levels of lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 246.7 cells. It has been reported that treatment of carrageenan-induced paw edema rats with 20 mg/kg of 
 <italic>G. morella</italic> methanolic fruit extract containing garcinol significantly inhibited paw inflammation and controlled the cytokine and nitrate levels of the induced-edema rats [

 <italic>Garcinia</italic> species. Mangostin attenuated the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in human U939 macrophage-like cells. Mangostin also decreased the activation of several signaling pathways, including IL-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), JNK, ERK, signal transducer and activation of transcription 1 (STAT-1), and activator protein 1 (AP-1), in these cells [
