<p>Terpenoids are organic compounds derived from five-carbon isoprene units assembled and modified in different ways. Terpenoids are classified according to the number of isoprene units as monoterpenoids (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15), diterpenoids (C20), sesterterpenoids (C25), and triterpenoids (C30) [

Similarly, 16 volatile compounds, including allo-aromadendrene, aromadendrene, ascaridole, caryophyllene oxide, germacrene B, globulol, myrcene, selina-3,7(11) diene, spathulenol, α-copaene, α-humulene, β-caryophyllene, β-copaene, β-gurjunene, δ-amorphene, and δ-elemene, have been isolated from the leaves of Indian gamboge and are known to be present in leaves in different concentrations (
