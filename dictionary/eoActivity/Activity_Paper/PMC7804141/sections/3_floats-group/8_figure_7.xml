   <bold>c</bold>) Anti-inflammatory activities of callus cultures of 
   <italic>Fagonia indica</italic> elicited with UV-C radiations (0–10.8 kJ/m
   <sup>2</sup>) and grown in complete dark (24 h) using sPLA2, 15-LOX, COX-1 and COX-2 cell free in vitro assays. The activities of extracts were expressed as % inhibition. Employed under the same experimental conditions as sample extracts, reference inhibitors were used as positive controls: Ibuprofen (10 µM) was used as positive control for COX-1 and COX-2 activity leading to enzyme inhibition of 31.4 ± 0.8% and 29.8 ± 1.2%, respectively; Thioetheramide-PC (5 µM) was used as sPLA2 inhibitor, resulting in an inhibition of 43.7 ± 0.8%; Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (100 µM) was used as 15-LOX inhibitor, leading to an inhibition of 30.6 ± 0.7%. The same volume of extraction solvent was used as blank. Values represented as mean ± SE of three replicates. Different letters represent significant differences between the various experimental conditions (
