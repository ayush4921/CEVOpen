<p id="Par9">Considering the stimulatory aspects of light elicitation and medicinal potential of 
 <italic>F. indica,</italic> its derived in vitro cultures need to be more explored and further optimize its biomass assemblies and phytochemicals production. For this purpose, we have previously established protocol for biomass accumulation and pharmaceutically significant metabolites in callus cultures of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> applying elicitors

 </sup>. In this sense, although the interest of these approaches is no longer to be demonstrated, our fundamental knowledge regarding production of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> biomass and phytochemicals under UV-C and different photoperiod regimes is missing. Currently, no previous report exists on elicitation by UV-C radiations for this species. Therefore, the current study aims to figure out the influence of UV-C radiations under various photoperiod regimes over biomass and phytochemicals accumulation in callus cultures of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic>. Further, to assess the antioxidative profile via different in vitro cell free assays (DPPH, FRAP, ABTS) under UV-C stress and evaluate the biosynthesis of these compounds through HPLC. Moreover, to investigate the anti-inflammatory activities including sPLA2, 15-LOX, COX-1 and COX-2 in extracts derived from cultures exposed to UV-C and light regimes. So, this is the first study to show the interactive influence of light regimes and UV-C radiations on the accumulation of pharmacologically significant phytochemicals in in vitro culture of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> (L.).
