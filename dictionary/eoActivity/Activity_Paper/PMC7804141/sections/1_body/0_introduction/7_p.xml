<p id="Par8">Among different approaches, the application of ultraviolet (UV) light as elicitor got more attention due to its tremendous effects on phytochemicals in several medicinal plant cultures

 </sup>. The most effective type of UV irradiations proven yet in raising the plant metabolites production is UV-C (190–280 nm), employed in different vegetables, medicinal plants and fruits

 </sup>. Mechanistically, the stress raised by UV light activates defense system in plants along producing phytoalexin

 </sup>. The production of these compounds raise plant factories as more defensive responses including antioxidative enzymes, secondary metabolites and cell wall modifications, that cope the oxidative damage prompted by UV, through scavenging lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS)

 </sup>. Alongside, recent developmental approach includes combinatorial use of elicitors for more efficient procedures and raised production of biomass. The application of different light regimes and UV-C has been proved to synergistically enhance production of ligans and neolignas in in vitro culture of
