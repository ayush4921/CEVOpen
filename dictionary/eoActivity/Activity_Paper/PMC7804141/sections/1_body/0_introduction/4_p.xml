Recent innovative approaches based on tissue culture technology are alternatives for efficient production of phytochemicals instead of utilizing whole plants

Therefore, emerging trends of biotechnology and genetics mainly has emphasized to adopt in vitro culture techniques broadly in breeding and genetics, as model systems for plant pathology, physiology, biochemistry as well as biosynthesis medicinally vital secondary metabolites
