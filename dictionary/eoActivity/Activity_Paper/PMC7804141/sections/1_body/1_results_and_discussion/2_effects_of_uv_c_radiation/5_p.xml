 </sup> found about the up regulation of CHS (chalcone synthase) and FLS (flavonol synthase) by UV-C radiation as key factors for flavonoid production

 </sup>. The reduced levels of phenolics and flavonoids accumulation occurred at higher concentrations and fluctuating light exposures. The underlying mechanistic reasons include high levels of ROS generation, biological membranes disruption, photo inhibition, impairments in lipid metabolism, DNA damages and photosystem II destruction
