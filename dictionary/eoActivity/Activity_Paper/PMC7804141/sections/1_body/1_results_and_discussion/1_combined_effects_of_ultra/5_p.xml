<p id="Par14">Morphologically, all the cultures were found compact while calli under photoperiod (16L/8D h) were observed green, dark green under Cont. Light (24 h) and yellow-white in Dark (24 h) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Naturally, the photosynthetic machinery in plants is adapted with a specific light/dark period. The extended dark phase is undoubtedly a significant stress factor for both the whole plant and photosynthetic system, resulting in reduced photosynthesis. For instance, prolonged dark period if continuously applied decrease the chlorophyll contents. Moreover, the possible reason could also be the senescence induced by both elicitors induced stress
