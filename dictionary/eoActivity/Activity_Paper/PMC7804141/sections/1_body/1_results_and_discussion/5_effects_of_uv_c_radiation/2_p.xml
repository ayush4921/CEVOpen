<p id="Par32">Optimum % inhibition (sPLA2: 35.8%), 15-LOX: 43.3%), (COX-1:55.3%), and (COX-2: 39.9%) was found in cultures exposed to UV-C dose (5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) and grown under (16L/8D h) photoperiod as compared with control respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Whereas, the cultures treated with UV-C radiation (7.2 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) and maintained under continuous light (24 h) expressed maximum inhibitory activities towards sPLA2 (28.1%), 15-LOX (36.4%), COX-1 (49.5%) and COX-2 (29.8%) as compared with control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b). For instance, optimum levels of sPLA2 (30.5%), 15-LOX (40.1%), COX-1 (53.4%), and COX-2 (37.5%) activities were recorded in cultures elicited with UV-C dose (3.6 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) for 20 min and grown in dark conditions (24 h) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c). The highest significant correlation was obtained for kaempferol and isorhamnetin (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Here, with the exception of apigenin and ursolic acid, all analyzed phytochemicals were significantly associated with potential anti-inflammatory action (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). It is the first report on documenting the anti-inflammatory activities of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> cultures treated with UV-C radiations and light regimes. Despite, the
