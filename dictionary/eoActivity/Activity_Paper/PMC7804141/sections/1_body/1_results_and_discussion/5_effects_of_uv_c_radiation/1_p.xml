 </sup>. According various mechanisms reported for anti-inflammatory action such as inhibition of lipoxygenase (15-LOX, eicosanoid generating enzymes), cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) and phospholipase A2 (sPLA2), dwindle the concentrations of prostanoid and leukotrienes

 </sup>. The underlying phytochemistry behind strong antioxidant profile of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> explicates its anti-inflammatory features. Therefore, the current study also investigated the anti-inflammatory potential of 
 <italic>F. indica</italic> callus cultures exposed to UV-C radiations and light regimes using in vitro cell free assays.
