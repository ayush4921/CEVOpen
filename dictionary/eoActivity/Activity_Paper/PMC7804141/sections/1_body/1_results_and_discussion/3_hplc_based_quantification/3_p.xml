<p id="Par24">The raised aggregation of compounds was noticed in cultures stressed with Ultraviolet-C treatments and various light regimes as compared with control (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Maximum levels of kaempferol (1.377 μg/mg DW), apigenin (1.057 μg/mg DW), myricetin (1.022 μg/mg DW) and isorhamnetin (1.022 μg/mg DW), followed by ursolic acid (0.235 μg/mg DW), nahagenin (0.226 μg/mg DW), hederagenin (0.207 μg/mg DW) and caffeic acid (0.175 μg/mg DW) were found in cultures prone to UV-C treatment (5.4 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) subsequently maintained under photoperiod (16L/8D h) as compared with control. Likewise, the accumulation of gallic acid observed was (0.281 μg/mg DW), followed by betulinic acid (0.495 μg/mg DW) in cultures mediated with UV-C dose of 7.2 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup> under continuous light. Furthermore, the Catechins biosynthesis was recorded with optimum level (1.032 μg/mg DW) in cultures at UV-C dose of 3.6 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup> under dark conditions.
