<p id="Par30">A relationship can be established among antioxidants activities with production of biomass and phenolic contents in cultures exposed to UV-C radiations and maintained in various photoperiod regimes. The raised accumulation of phenolics and flavonoids could be the possible cause for raised antioxidant activities of grown calli under photoperiod at UV-C dose (30 min). Here, the highest significant correlation was obtained for myricetin and ABTS assay (Pearson Coefficient Correlation (PCC) = 0.935, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 2.5 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup>) (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Flavanoids were all significantly correlated with this antioxidant assay (Supplemental Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The same correlation between phytochemicals and antioxidants potential has been stated previously
