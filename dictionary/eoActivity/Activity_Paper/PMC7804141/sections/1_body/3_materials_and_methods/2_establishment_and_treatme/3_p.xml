<p id="Par38">Total 6 Ultraviolet-C doses 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 min equivalent to 0, 1.8, 3.6, 5.4, 7.2, 9.0, and 10.8 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup> were used. First, the Ultraviolet-C lamp was made stabilized by leaving it ON for 15 min prior experiment. Then, fresh callus cultures were equally dispersed in sterile petri plates with sterilized forceps, to fully expose and properly irradiate with Ultraviolet-C doses (1.8–10.8 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) for 10–60 min total duration. The callus cultures (0.5 g) were inoculated back into Erlenmeyer flask (100 ml) having fresh culture media (40 mL) after UV-C exposure. Subsequently, the cultures were moved to growth room (25 ± 2 °C) and maintained under their relevant sub-experimental conditions i.e.; complete 24 h-dark, 24 h-continuous light and 16L/8D h photoperiod. The light conditions in different light regimes were as; continuous light (24 h light) continuous dark (complete 24 h dark conditions) and photoperiod (16 h light and 8 h complete dark conditions). The cultures in each light regime without UV-C exposure (UV-C 0 kJ/m
 <sup>2</sup>) were used as respective controls. Three biological replicas were used in each sub-experiment for respective UV-C treatment. Finally, after 30 days of growth period, the callus cultures were harvested, followed by investigation of biomass and stored for further analysis. The different experimental steps of whole study are mentioned in a schematic diagram (Fig.
