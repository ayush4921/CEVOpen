<p id="Par55">The amount of hydroperoxides accumulated thought the lipo-oxygenation reaction was calculated via the kit using standard filtered soybean 15-lipooxygenase in Tris–HCl bu_er (10 mM) at pH 7.4. The microplate reader (BioTek ELX800; BioTek Instruments, Colmar, France) was employed to measure the absorbance at 940 nm. The 5 µM Thioetheramide-PC was used as sPLA2 inhibitor. The extraction volume in equal amount was applied as blank.
