<p id="Par61">The COX1 (ovine) and COX2 (human) assay kits were utilized by following the manufacturer guidelines (701050; Cayman Chem; Co, Interchim, Montluçon; France). The 10 µM ibuprofen as positive control and Arachidonic acid (1.1 mM) was employed as substrate. In order to estimate the activity, COX peroxidase component kit employed and Synergy II plate (BioTek Instruments, Colmar, France) was used to demonstrate the oxidized tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine, Wurster’s blue (C10H16N2). The microplate reader (BioTek ELX800; BioTek Instruments, Colmar, France) was used to measure the absorbance at 5 nm for 5 min. The extraction volume in equal amount was applied as blank.</p>
