 </sup>. Briefly, autoclaved distilled water was used to rinse seeds, followed by treatment with HgCl2 (0.1%) and ethanol (70%) for a period of 2 min for surface sterilization of seeds. In order to remove impurities, seeds were entirely washed 3 times with autoclaved distilled water, followed by surface drying of seeds with autoclaved filter papers. The growth media (MS0; Murashige and Skoog basal medium; Phytotechnology Labs, USA)

 </sup> supplemented with sucrose (30 g/L) as carbon source and 8 g/L of agar (Phytotechnology Labs, USA) as solidifying agents was utilized for inoculation of seeds. The media was autoclaved (Systec VX 100, Germany) at 121 °C for 20 min after pH calibration (5.5–5.7; Eutech Instruments pH 510, Singapore) using NaOH (0.1 N) and HCL (1.0 N) to produce contamination free plantlets. The flasks having seeds inoculated on media were shifted to growth chamber and kept under fixed growth conditions i.e. temperature 25 ± 2 °C in photoperiod (16/8 h light/dark) and light intensity of 40–50 μmol m
