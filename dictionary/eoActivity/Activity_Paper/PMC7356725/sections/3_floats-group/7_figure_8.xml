  <p>Potential mechanisms of actions for antioxidant phenolic compounds as immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory agents [
   <xref rid="B66-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. These mechanisms work mainly through inhibition of two key signaling pathways; the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB) and arachidonic acid signaling pathways. This inhibition results in complicated cellular mechanisms finished with suppression of pro-inflammatory gens, and thus block the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6). In addition, the phenolic compounds also reduce the release of arachidonic acid which results upon the oxidation of membrane phospholipids, and thus reduce also its metabolites (leukotrienes and prostaglandins) that considered as important inflammatory mediators.
