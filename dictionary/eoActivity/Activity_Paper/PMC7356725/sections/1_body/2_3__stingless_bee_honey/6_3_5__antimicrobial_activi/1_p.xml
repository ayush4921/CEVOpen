<p>Another potential exciting use of SBH could be in the context of antimicrobial activity. It was reported that SBH has a broad-spectrum of antimicrobial effects against four types of Gram-positive bacteria: 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus megaterium</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus brevis</italic>, as well as two Gram-negative bacteria: 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> [

 <italic>Tetragonula carbonaria</italic> honey on 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. These bactericidal effects were attributed to the high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and phenolic extracts in SBH as measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [

 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> honey was significantly higher than those on SBH, several SBH types have been tested and presented higher antioxidant and biological activities, and relatively higher antimicrobial activity against fungus (
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>), Gram-negative (
 <italic>E. coli, K. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>) and Gram-positive (
 <italic>S. aureus, Listeria monocytogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>) bacteria, respectively [
