<p>In 2016, Saiful Yazan et al. used SBH to treat rats with colorectal cancer and showed that SBH has chemo-preventative properties; this finding demonstrated by the total number of aberrant crypts and aberrant crypt foci, and crypt multiplicity all were significantly decreased [

The results showed that SBH added to the culture media for three days resulted in a dose-dependent proliferative effect on DPSCs [

 <xref rid="B33-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. By using cell proliferation and cells death assays, the authors demonstrated that SBHâ€™s cytotoxic effect on this glioma cell line was time and dose-dependent. SBH also induced nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nucleus fragmentation, indicating that cellular changes were consistent with the apoptotic characteristics of the cells [
