<p>This antioxidant activity would also inhibit essential enzymes responsible to the endogenous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the metabolism of arachidonic acid, such as nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), cytochrome P450 (CP450), NADPH oxidase (NOX), xanthine oxidase (XO) lipoxygenase (LO), cyclooxygenases (COXs) and myeloperoxidase (MP) [
