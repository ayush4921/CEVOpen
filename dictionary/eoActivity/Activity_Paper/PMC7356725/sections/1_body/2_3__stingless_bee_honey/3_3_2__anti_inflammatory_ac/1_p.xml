<p>In broad terms, inflammation is a complex immunological defense mechanism rising either against harmful stimuli or as a result of an excessive response to a normal stimulus perceived as harmful [

 <xref rid="B65-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Because of their strong antioxidant and therefore immunomodulatory activity, phenolic compounds have been proposed as compounds to use for anti-inflammatory therapy [
