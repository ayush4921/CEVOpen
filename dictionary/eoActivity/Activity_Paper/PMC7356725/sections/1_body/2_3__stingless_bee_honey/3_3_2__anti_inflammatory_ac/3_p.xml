<p>Borsato et al. reported that SBH extract has anti-inflammatory activity to reduce ear edema, probably due to a synergistic effect of its phenolic compounds (such as kaempferol and caffeic acid) [

In this context treatment with SBH significantly modulated serum inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), while it enhanced antioxidants like malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) [
