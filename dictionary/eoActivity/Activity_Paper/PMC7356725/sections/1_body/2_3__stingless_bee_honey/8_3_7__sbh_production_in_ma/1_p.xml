<p>In 2000, Malaysia produced only 5 percent of the countries honey needs, which is considered a trivial estimate compared with Malaysia’s abundant nectar resources [

We estimated that using the MUSTAFA-hive in Malaysian stingless bee farms improves the implementation of standard operating procedure (SOP) in commercial meliponiculture, and also promote exploring the benefits of SBH in medical research. At present, 15 out of 26 studies on the medicinal properties of SBH around the world were conducted in Malaysia over the past 4 years (

 <xref rid="B82-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to utilize the unique physiochemical characteristics of Malaysian SBH to increase demand and market value of the honey via different methods. This could also help the beekeepers to increase and sustain their income, and promote SBH as a promising future Malaysian commodity.
