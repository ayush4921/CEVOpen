<p>The antioxidant effects of SBH have been shown in a study conducted on a diabetic rat model. Animals underwent treatment with SBH, which caused increased levels of superoxide dismutase and glutathione (antioxidant enzymes), whereas protein carbonyl and malondialdehyde (biomarkers of oxidative stress) levels decreased in their sperms and testis, thus, improving the quality of their sperm [

LCL viability was significantly higher during 24 h of treatment with SBH, while a decline in viability was reported after that with higher concentrations of SBH. These findings are in line with results of a comparable wound healing study on human fibroblast cells using freeze-dried SBH [

All together, these studies indicate that in a concentration-dependent manner, different antioxidant compounds of SBH could play a vital role in the increment or decline of cell viability by modulating oxidative stress and cytotoxicity.
