<p>There was no evidence of microbial contamination in the bee pollens examined, including 
 <italic>E. coli, Salmonella, S. aureus, Coliforms</italic>, and 
 <italic>Clostridia</italic>, though mesophilic microorganisms were detected [

 <xref rid="B130-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. A recent study suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect of stingless bee pollen results from its antioxidant activity that inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX), which promotes inflammation by producing prostaglandins [

Furthermore, a study to detect the synergistic effect of stingless bee pollen extracts with cisplatin (a chemotherapeutic drug) on breast cancer cells showed antioxidant and antiproliferative effects of bee pollen against the cancer cells [
 <xref rid="B129-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. The combination of bee pollen extracts and cisplatin further reduced the proliferation of the cancer cells, compared to cisplatin alone [
