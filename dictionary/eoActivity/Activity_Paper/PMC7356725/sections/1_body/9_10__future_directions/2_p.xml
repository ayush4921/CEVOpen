<p>Stingless bee species produce honey with different metabolite profiles, presenting a diverse range of biological mechanisms for the benefits of human health [

 <xref rid="B147-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. The gut microbiota of the honey bee provides advantages in terms of studying the systems that determine gut community composition and dynamics, as well as addressing how gut communities impact their hosts [

 <xref rid="B146-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. This was supported by Kek et al. [
 <xref rid="B145-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], who stated that the composition of honey was probably affected by the type of bee because the honey-making process is highly dependent on the enzymes added by the bees. Since the symbiotic bacteria of insects have received increasing attention due to their prominent roles in the provision of nutrients and modulating host responses, there is a need to study the contribution of stingless bee microbial communities to the metabolites profiles and immunotherapeutic potential of their honey extracts.
