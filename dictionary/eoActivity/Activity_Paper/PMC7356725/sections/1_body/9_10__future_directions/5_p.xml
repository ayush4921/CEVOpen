<p>Therefore, we strongly encourage future studies to perform a comprehensive metagenomics analysis on the best SBH producer species to select those capable of producing high-quality SBH with desirable properties; based on their gut microbiome. Then, it is important to do metabolomics analysis for the produced SBH, to ensure whether the expected properties exist, before proceeding towards the production of SBH in nano-size and utilize it against different inflammatory illnesses.</p>
