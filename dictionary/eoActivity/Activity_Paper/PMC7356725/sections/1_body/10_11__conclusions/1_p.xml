<p>It is known that all bee products are rich with compounds that provide high nutritional and medicinal properties. However, not all bee types have been equally studied, with limited knowledge about stingless bee products compared to other honey producers. This work provides a comprehensive review of all the medicinal properties of stingless bee products that have been explored to date. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that addresses all these data together. The present review also provides new promising insights to improve SBH research and to achieve more utilization for its medicinal properties. In general, despite exhibiting its tremendous medicinal properties, honey has still been abandoned and disregarded in the modern pharmaceutical era and only classified under complementary medicine. Way forward, rather than treatment approach, honey should be redefined as a potential agent for disease prevention, as measured by its antioxidant properties and effectiveness in manipulating the signaling pathways in the progression of disease.</p>
