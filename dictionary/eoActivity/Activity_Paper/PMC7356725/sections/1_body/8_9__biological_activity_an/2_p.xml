<p>On the other hand, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is a well-known antioxidant able to block the lipid peroxidation chain reaction by transforming an unpaired electron to the lipid radical (

While a variety of immunomodulatory and antimicrobial properties have been suggested for ascorbic acid, studies to assess its content in stingless bee products are still required, and its antimicrobial mechanisms of action need better understanding. Furthermore, there is a gap of knowledge about the content of other potential antioxidants, such as carotenoids and tocopherol, in stingless bee products and their potential medicinal properties.
