<p>As it is shown in the above sections, studies have discovered a variety of biological activities of stingless bee products and their compounds, while the mechanisms of action for these activities are less studied. However, the biological targets for the compounds of stingless bee products can be presumed based on previous studies on other natural products that contain similar compounds. The role of antioxidant phenolic compounds in the process of radical scavenging, to prevent damage of cellular components (diseases), has been discovered, while their antimicrobial activities still not clear. In addition to the enzymatic antioxidants that neutralize free radicals by transforming them to stable molecules (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00923-f004">Figure 4</xref>), there are non-enzymatic antioxidants (e.g., phenolic compounds and ascorbic acid) that not only interrupt the chain reaction caused by free radicals but also can inhibit the formation of free radicals [
