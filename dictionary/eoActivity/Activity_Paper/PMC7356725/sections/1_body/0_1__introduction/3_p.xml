<p>It is important to note that stingless bee products are not restricted to honey, but can involve several products including propolis, beebread, cerumen and bee pollen (

 <xref rid="B14-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Based on a comparison between the studies on stingless bees and honeybees, a significant gap in research on stingless bee products has been identified compared to the common honeybee products that are well-studied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00923-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, in 2019, approximately double the number of studies on stingless bees were reported (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-10-00923-f003">Figure 3</xref>). To improve the awareness on the stingless bee, its products, properties, benefits and future opportunities, this manuscript provides a comprehensive review and recent updates on the medicinal properties of stingless bee products. We also highlight the importance of increasing research investments into stingless bee products for future medical research, as well as to motivate their production and nutritional usage.
