<p>The most common species producing SBH are classified under two main genera, 
 <italic>Melipona</italic> and 
 <italic>Trigona</italic> [
 <xref rid="B6-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While stingless bees are one of the most common types of honey producers, the distribution of SBH is lower compared to the more common honey produced by 
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> bees (European/Western bees or honeybees) [
 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which has been associated with the limited data about SBH production and its properties. Interestingly, SBH is less used as a nutritional and medicinal product [
 <xref rid="B8-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], despite its higher nutritional and medicinal properties compared to the commonly used honeybee products (European/Western honey) [
 <xref rid="B9-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is believed that stingless bee products are superior promising sources of biologically active compounds over honeybees, and this can be attributed to the rich vegetation in the tropical and subtropical regions where stingless bees are found [
 <xref rid="B7-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, stingless bees have some principal characteristics that make them unique compared to honeybees, for example they are less vulnerable to disease (

Recent evidence indicates that SBH has potential therapeutic benefits in several contexts, including wound healing, diabetes mellitus, eye diseases, hypertension, fertility defects, cancer, microbial infection and dysregulated lipid profiles [
 <xref rid="B13-biomolecules-10-00923" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, promoting the research on SBH would help improve the knowledge on its putative medicinal properties and ensure the conservation of SBH trade.
