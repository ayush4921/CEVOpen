<p id="p0030">UV spectrum analysis was estimated using UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) with the wavelength range from 200 to 800â€¯nm. AgNPs were further characterized using FTIR to identify the functional groups, dynamic light scattering (DLS) particle size analyzer, XRD for elemental composition, TEM, and SEM for identification of morphology and size of biosynthesized AgNPs (
