<p id="p0020">The rhizome of 
 <italic>Z. officinale and C. longa</italic> was collected from the region of Tiruvallore District, Tamil Nadu, and India. Soil and other surface contaminants present on fresh rhizome were removed using tap water followed by distilled water. Further, the rhizome was air-dried and macerated to make a fine powder. Followed by 5 g of mixed rhizome powder of both the 
 <italic>Z. officinale</italic> and 
 <italic>C. longa</italic> was added into 250 mL of distilled water and boiled for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the extract was centrifuged at 5000 rpm, and filtered using Whatman number-1 filter paper (20–24 μm). Filtered extract was further used for green synthesis of AgNPs.
