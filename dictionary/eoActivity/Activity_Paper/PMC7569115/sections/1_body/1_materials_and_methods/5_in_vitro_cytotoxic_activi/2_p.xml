<p id="p0035">The cytotoxicity activity of AgNPs was performed using MTT assay (
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">Kleemann, 1993</xref>) against HT29 cells. In this method, 200 µL HT29 cells, roughly 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well, were seeded into 96 well plates and permitted to achieve confluence cell growth. After cells were completely attached to the well, culture media was discarded. Further, 100 µL of various concentrations such as 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 µg/mL of AgNPs were added and incubated for 24 h and followed for 48 and 72 h. After that, freshly prepared MTT [5 mg/mL of phosphate buffer solution] was added and incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 h.
