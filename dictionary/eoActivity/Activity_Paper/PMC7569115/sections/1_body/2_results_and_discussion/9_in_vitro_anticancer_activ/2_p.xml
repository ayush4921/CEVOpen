 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">Yin et al., 2003</xref>). In this present study, the cytotoxicity of green synthesized AgNPs was analyzed using MTT assay and found that AgNPs showed anti-cancer activity against colon cancer (HT29) cells at the concentration of 25–500 μg/mL. It was noted that cell viability was deceased on the increased concentration of AgNPs [

 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>]. AgNPs required concentration to reduce the cell viability of HT29 cells to 50% (IC50) of the preliminary population was 150.8 µg/mL. The results showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity of human colon carcinoma cells after 24 h of AgNPs treatment since it was tested at various concentrations such as 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 μg/mL [
