<p id="p0045">UV–visible spectroscopy was used to observe the AgNPs formation by the reduction of Ag ions through the exposure of plant extracts (
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">Cittrarasu et al., 2019</xref>). UV–Visible spectroscopy indicated the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sharp peak at 350–430 nm wavelength, which corresponds to the AgNPs production. AgNPs were absorbed radiation at 400 nm wavelength due to the transition of electrons. Colloidal AgNPs exhibit absorption wavelength at 390–420 nm (

 <italic>Centella asiatica,</italic> and 
 <italic>Clonorchis sinensis</italic> extracts and observed the absorbance at 420 nm using UV-spectrophotometer (
