 <p>This study was aimed to analyze the anti-cancer activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using aqueous plant extracts from the rhizome of 
  <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> and 
  <italic>Zingiber officinale.</italic> Synergistic aqueous extract of rhizome of 
  <italic>C. longa</italic> and 
  <italic>Z. officinale</italic> was used to green synthesis of AgNPs. Characterization of AgNPs was performed using UV–visible spectroscopy, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, TEM, and SEM analyses. Anti-cancer activity of AgNPs against human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells was tested using MTT assay. UV–Visible spectroscopy analysis indicated the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sharp peak at 350–430 nm wavelength that corresponds to the production of AgNPs. FTIR analysis reveals that existence of carboxyl (—C

SEM analysis showed that AgNPs are in a spherical shape with a size of 42–61 nm and TEM analysis showed particle size are ranged between 20–51 nm. Anti-cancer study reveals that AgNPs had shown cytotoxicity against HT-29 cells at the concentrations ranged from 25 to 500 μg/mL and IC
  <sub>50</sub> at 150.8 µg/mL. This study concludes that AgNPs synthesized using rhizome of 
  <italic>Z. officinale and C. longa</italic> possesses potential anti-cancer activity.
