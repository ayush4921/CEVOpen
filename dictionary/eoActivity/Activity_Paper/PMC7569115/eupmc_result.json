    "This study was aimed to analyze the anti-cancer activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using aqueous plant extracts from the rhizome of <i>Curcuma longa</i> and <i>Zingiber officinale.</i> Synergistic aqueous extract of rhizome of <i>C. longa</i> and <i>Z. officinale</i> was used to green synthesis of AgNPs. Characterization of AgNPs was performed using UV-visible spectroscopy, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, TEM, and SEM analyses. Anti-cancer activity of AgNPs against human colon carcinoma (HT-29) cells was tested using MTT assay. UV-Visible spectroscopy analysis indicated the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sharp peak at 350-430 nm wavelength that corresponds to the production of AgNPs. FTIR analysis reveals that existence of carboxyl (-C[bond, double bond]O) and amine (N-H) functional groups in the AgNPs. The X-ray diffraction analysis confirms four spectral peaks at 111, 200, 220, and 311. SEM analysis showed that AgNPs are in a spherical shape with a size of 42-61 nm and TEM analysis showed particle size are ranged between 20-51 nm. Anti-cancer study reveals that AgNPs had shown cytotoxicity against HT-29 cells at the concentrations ranged from 25 to 500 μg/mL and IC<sub>50</sub> at 150.8 µg/mL. This study concludes that AgNPs synthesized using rhizome of <i>Z. officinale and C. longa</i> possesses potential anti-cancer activity."
