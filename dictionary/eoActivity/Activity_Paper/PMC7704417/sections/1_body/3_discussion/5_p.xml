<p id="par0180">The colour change noted during the biosynthesis of AuNPs using AECR indicated a reduction of the synthetic process [

 <italic>C. rubens</italic>) were responsible for the stability [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], by providing a coating on the surface of the AuNPs. The formation and stability of the nanoparticles was confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy, of which the AECR-AuNPs were found in the wavelength range of 500−600 nm, a typical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of AuNPs [

 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref>) indicates that the nanoparticles were polydispersed in nature. This could be due to the presence of more than one reducing agent (phytochemicals) in the

 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) indicate that the synthesized AuNPs are polycrystalline in nature, which can be linked to the fcc structure of gold [
