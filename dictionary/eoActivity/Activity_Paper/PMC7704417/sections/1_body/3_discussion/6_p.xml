<p id="par0185">In the FT-IR analysis (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), the slight shifts noted in broad peaks at 3350.83 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for AECR and 3281.03 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for AECR-AuNPs, indicate the presence of the O—H stretch for alcohol or phenol. Also, the 1632.93 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> and 1638.58 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for AECR-AuNPs and AECR, respectively, corresponded to C—O and N—H stretching and bending for carboxylic acids and amides. This suggests that polyphenolic compounds and proteins were involved in the synthesis of AuNPs through the reduction of gold salt to AuNPs. Phenolic compounds reportedly have excellent binding affinity to metal ions, thereby aiding the reduction of gold ions (Au
 <sup>3+</sup>) to gold atoms and induce chelation effect [
