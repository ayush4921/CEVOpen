<p id="par0195">To enhance cancer specificity and targeted therapy, AuNPs were synthesized using AECR. The non-significant difference noted in the antioxidant and reducing potential result of AECR compared to that of AECR-AuNPs suggests the presence of phytochemicals capping the AuNPs. It is expected based on these parameters that AECR-AuNPs possess the ability to scavenge free radicals, mostly at lower concentrations, which could serve as potential anti-inflammatory and anticancer agent. In view of this, the cytotoxic effect of AECR-AuNPs was investigated against breast and colorectal cancer cells.</p>
