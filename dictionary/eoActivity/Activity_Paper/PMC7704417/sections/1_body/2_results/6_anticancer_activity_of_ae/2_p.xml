<p id="par0150">The anticancer activity of AECR-AuNPs on breast cancer (MCF-7) cells is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Significant (p &lt; 0.05) cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells was noted when exposed to fulvestrant and AECR-AuNPs, at all concentrations tested, when compared to the vehicle control at 24 and 48 h. At lower concentrations (31.25 and 62.50 μg/mL), % viability of cells was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) at 24 h, the AECR-AuNPs at all concentrations were as cytotoxic as the positive control at 48 h. At both 24 and 48 h, the 125 and 250 μg/mL AECR-AuNPs were also as cytotoxic as the positive control.
