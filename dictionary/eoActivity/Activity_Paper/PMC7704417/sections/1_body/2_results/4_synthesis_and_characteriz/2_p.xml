<p id="par0130">Aqueous, ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of 
 <italic>C. rubens</italic> leaves were used in the synthesis of AuNPs, with only the AECR suited for the production of AuNPs. The change from the initial dark green colour of AECR to purple of AECR-AuNPs was observed within 20 min, and the nanoparticles (AECR-AuNPs) were without agglomeration when left for a period of one month at room temperature. The UV–vis spectroscopy indicates the maximum absorbance peak at 538 nm for the AECR-AuNPs.
