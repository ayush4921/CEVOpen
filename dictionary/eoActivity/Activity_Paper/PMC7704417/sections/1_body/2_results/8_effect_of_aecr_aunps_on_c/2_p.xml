 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> shows the effect of AECR-AuNPs on the cellular morphology of both MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells. Cellular/structural changes were observed in MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells at 24 h treatment with the positive controls (Fulvestrant and 5′- Fluorouracil) and AECR-AuNPs. The vehicle control cells maintained their membrane integrity without visible changes in the cell morphology. Changes in the cell morphology was observed in both cell lines after 24 h of AECR-AuNPs treatment. The MCF-7 cells at 24 h exhibited apoptotic features such as cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing, while Caco-2 cells were rounding up and detaching from the plate. The morphological changes observed when both cell lines were treated with 250 μg/mL AECR-AuNPs were similar to the changes noted with the positive controls.
