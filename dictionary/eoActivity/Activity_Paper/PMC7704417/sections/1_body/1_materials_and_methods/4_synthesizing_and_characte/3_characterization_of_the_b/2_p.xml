<p id="par0080">The ultraviolet-visible (UVâ€“vis) spectroscopic analysis of the AuNPs was performed using the Nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermoscientific, USA), to determine the wavelength, stability, and aggregation levels of the NPs. The size and morphology of the synthesized AECR-AuNPs was investigated with high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) JEOL model 1200 LaB6), and the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis was performed to investigate the crystalline nature of the nanoparticles. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed on a dried pellet of AuNPs, to detect the presence of functional groups on the synthesized AuNPs as described by Ghosh et al. [
