<p id="par0100">Cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). MCF-7 or Caco-2 cells were grown routinely in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/mL penicillin and 10 μg/mL streptomycin (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cell viability assay using the tetrazolium dye, 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described by Mosmann [

 <italic>C. rubens</italic> leaf extract-mediated AuNPs on MCF-7 and Caco-2 cells. The cells were seeded at a density of 1.25 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/100 μL/well in a 96-well plate. Cells were treated with 100 μL AECR-AuNPs (in 0.1 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), at 31.25, 62.5, 125 and 250 μg/mL, and standard drugs (5´- Fluorouracil (100 μM) for Caco-2 and Fulvestrant (0.12 μM) for MCF-7). All cell experiments were performed in triplicates.
