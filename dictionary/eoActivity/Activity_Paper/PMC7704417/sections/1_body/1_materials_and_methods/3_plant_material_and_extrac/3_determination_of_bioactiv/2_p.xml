<p id="par0065">Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopic (GC–MS) analysis of AECR, ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>Crassocephalum rubens</italic> (EAECR) and ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Crassocephalum rubens</italic> (EECR) leaves was completed using the Shimadzu GC–MS-QP2010 Plus, at 250 °C. The split ratio was 20:0, and the carrier gas was nitrogen at an inlet temperature of 250 °C, with a column flow of 1.61 mL/min. The oven program started at a temperature of 60 °C, which was increased to 250 °C at 7 °C/min. A flame-ionization detection (FID) detector was used at 32 °C, at a hydrogen pressure of 22 psi and compressed air of 35 psi. The identification of compounds from the spectral data was based on the available mass spectral records (NIST08 s. Libraries).
