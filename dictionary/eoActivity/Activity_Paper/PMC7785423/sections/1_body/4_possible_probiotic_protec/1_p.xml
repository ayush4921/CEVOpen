<p id="p0065">Because probiotics can mitigate problems of dysbiosis, inflammation and immune function, and can include direct antimicrobial activities, there may be the potential for a positive contribution against secondary infection co-morbidities in COVID-19. New evidence is emerging that infections secondary to SARS-CoV-2 might contribute to COVID-19 pathology or severity [

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>]. Although an early study suggested relatively little concern across the COVID-19 patient population [
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], recent reports are finding increased secondary infections in hospitalized individuals with severe disease, observations that may have some association with immunosuppressive drugs in current treatment regimens [

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>]. Outside the COVID-19 context, application of the probiotic strains 
 <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> during clinical trials, showed a significant improvement in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia, including pathogens of various types, compared with placebo treatment [
 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In general, probiotic strains themselves, including LAB strains, are well known to be non-pathogenic and non-immunogenic, and therefore are considered safe and not a source of potential secondary infections, themselves [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Along with protective effects reported against influenza A virus, LAB have been reported to promote heterotypic immunity to secondary infections [
 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Furthermore, probiotics have been reported to provide some protection against biofilm-forming pathogens in the respiratory tract [
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. As secondary infections may rise to more prominence in COVID-19, perhaps commensurate with increasing anti-inflammatory regimens, treatment options that include probiotics may present an even more attractive modality that merits further investigation and attention in clinical trials.
