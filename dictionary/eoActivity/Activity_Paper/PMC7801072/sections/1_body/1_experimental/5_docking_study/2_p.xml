<p>Preliminary docking was performed to evaluate whether binding to DHFR might account for the bactericidal effect of the compounds. All docking studies were carried out using Discovery Studio 2017 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Docking studies were performed according to our previous report
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref>. The crystal structure data were obtained from the protein data bank (
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR PDB_ID: 1RX7). Enzyme structures were checked for missing atoms, bonds and contacts. Hydrogen atoms were added to the enzyme structure. Water molecules and bound ligands were manually deleted. Then the protein was refined with CHARMm. The structures of compounds were sketched in 2D and converted into 3D using the DS molecule editor. Automated docking studies were carried out to investigate the binding mode of compounds 
 <bold>8b</bold> and 
 <bold>8f</bold> utilizing DS-CDOCKER protocol. The pose with the top CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY was chosen for analysing the binding features of compounds 
 <bold>8b</bold> and 
 <bold>8f</bold> with DHFR.
