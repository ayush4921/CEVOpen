<p>The antimicrobial activities of the synthesised compounds were then tested against a series of pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains. Several different bacterial strains and one fungal strain were susceptible to most of the compounds tested with MICs in the range of 1–64 µg/ml. N-aryl carbazole derivatives containing an aminoguanidine or 1,4-dihydro-1,3,5-triazine moiety (
 <bold>8c–l</bold> and 
 <bold>9c–k</bold>) exhibited potent antibacterial activities with MICs ranging from 0.5 to 16 µg/ml. These compounds also exhibited antifungal activity against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> 7535 with MICs ranging from 1 to 32 µg/ml.
