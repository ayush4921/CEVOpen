<p>Compounds 
 <bold>8f</bold>, 
 <bold>8l</bold>, 
 <bold>9d</bold> and 
 <bold>9e</bold> exhibited strong antibacterial activity against two Gram-positive strains (
 <italic>methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA CCARM 3167) and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> RN4220) and one Gram-negative strain (
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> 1924) with MIC values of 0.5 or 1 µg/ml. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> against Gram-positive bacterial strains (
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN4220 and 
 <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> 3289) were comparable to the positive control drugs gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin. In addition, compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> displayed considerable potency against MRSA CCARM 3167 (MIC of 0.5 μg/ml) that was two- and four-fold greater compared with moxifloxacin (MIC of 1 μg/ml) and gatifloxacin (MIC of 2 μg/ml) respectively. In addition, compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> demonstrated a strong inhibitory activity (MIC of 0.5 μg/ml) against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> 1924, which was four-fold greater than the activities of moxifloxacin (MIC of 2 μg/ml) and gatifloxacin (MIC of 2 μg/ml), respectively. In contrast, compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> showed a weaker activity against the fungus 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> 7535 compared with the positive controls.
