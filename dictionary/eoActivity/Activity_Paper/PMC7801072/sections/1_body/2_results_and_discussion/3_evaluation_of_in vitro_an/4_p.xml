<p>Moreover, we determined the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) for compounds whose MIC value less than 256 µg/ml against strains. MBCs and MFCs are defined as the lowest bactericidal or fungicidal concentration required to kill a particular bacterial strain or the fungal strain over a fixed incubation time. Most of the series 
 <bold>8</bold> compounds displayed MBCs at 1–2 fold higher than their MICs against the strains tested. Compounds 
 <bold>9i</bold> and 
 <bold>9k</bold> also had four-fold higher MIC values compared with their MBCs against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> RN4220 and MRSA CCARM 3167, respectively. The MBC/MIC ratio of compounds 
 <bold>9 g</bold> and 
 <bold>9j</bold> were ≥4 for 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic> 3289. Compounds 
 <bold>9c</bold>, 
 <bold>9e</bold>, 
 <bold>9h</bold> and 
 <bold>9i</bold> demonstrated MFC values that were four-fold higher than their MICs against 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> 7535. Notably, bacteria appeared to be less tolerant to the series 
 <bold>8</bold> compounds compared with series 
 <bold>9</bold> compounds. When we altered the phenyl ring substituents of compounds 
 <bold>8a–l</bold>, we observed a significant effect on the potency of their antimicrobial activities. The order of antibacterial activities were as follows: phenyl group &gt; 2,4-dichloro-substitutions &gt; 4-CH
 <sub>3</sub>(for compounds bearing an electron-donating group) &gt; halogen substitutions &gt; benzyl group &gt; 4-CN (for compounds bearing an electron-withdrawing group) &gt; alkyl group. Furthermore, bromo- and chloro-substitutions on the phenyl ring in compounds 
 <bold>8a–l</bold> were observed to improve their antifungal activity against 
 <italic>C. albicans</italic> 7535. The antibacterial activity order of compounds 
 <bold>9a–k</bold> was similar to compounds 
 <bold>8a–l</bold>. Compounds in series 
 <bold>10a–b</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12a–d</bold> generally showed weak activity against all the strains tested in this study, with MICs greater than 256 µg/ml. As shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, most of the compounds exhibited equivalent or higher potency (with MIC values in the range of 0.5 to 16 µg/ml) towards MRSA CCARM 3167 compared with the positive controls gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin (MICs of 2 and 1 µg/ml, respectively).
