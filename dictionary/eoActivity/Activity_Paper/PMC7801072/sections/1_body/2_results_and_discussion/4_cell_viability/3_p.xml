<p>Compounds in series 
 <bold>8a–l</bold>, containing a dihydro-1,3,5-triazine ring moiety, were generally found to have more potent antimicrobial effects but less cytotoxicity compared with the corresponding series 
 <bold>9a–l</bold> compounds that comprised an aminoguanidine moiety. Interestingly, our results also showed that compound 
 <bold>9 b</bold> was selectively more toxic to human cancer cells compared with normal human cells. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> value is about three times higher in normal cells than AGS cell lines. Further studies are required to investigate if this compound has any potential as a new anticancer agent.
