<p>The synthetic routes used for the construction of target compounds 
 <bold>8a–l</bold>, 
 <bold>9a–k</bold>, 
 <bold>10a–b</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12a–d</bold> are outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH001">Scheme 1</xref>. A series of intermediates (2) was obtained from carbazole (1) via N-alkylation or N-arylation. Next, we performed a formylation reaction (Vilsmayer-Hack) on the intermediates (2) and commercially available compound 
 <bold>3</bold> in the presence of POCl
 <sub>3</sub> and DMF to obtain 9-substituted carbazole-3-carbaldehyde analogues 
 <bold>4</bold> in good yields. Compounds 
 <bold>8a–l</bold> were prepared by the reaction of each of the series 
 <bold>4</bold> compounds with metformin hydrochloride in acetic acid. Compounds 
 <bold>9a–k</bold> were synthesised via the reactions of each of the series 
 <bold>4</bold> compounds with aminoguanidine hydrochloride in ethanol with a catalytic amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Compounds 
 <bold>10a–b</bold> and 
 <bold>11</bold> were prepared by reacting compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> with thiosemicarbazide and semicarbazide, respectively, in the presence of acetic acid in methanol under reflux. Next, we reacted compounds 
 <bold>4</bold> with isonicotinic in the presence of acetic acid in alcohol to obtain compounds 
 <bold>12a–d</bold>.
