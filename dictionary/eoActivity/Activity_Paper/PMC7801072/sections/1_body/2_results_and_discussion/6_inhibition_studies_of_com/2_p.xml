<p>To investigate whether compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> can bind to and block the active site of DHFR, we performed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme assays to test the inhibitory effect of compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> (MIC of 0.5 μg/ml) on DHFR activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref>). At concentrations of 3 and 10 μmol/L, compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> decreased DHFR activity by 71% compared with the negative control. The results indicated that compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> exerts its antibacterial activity via binding to DHFR, which however might not be the only mechanism of action.
