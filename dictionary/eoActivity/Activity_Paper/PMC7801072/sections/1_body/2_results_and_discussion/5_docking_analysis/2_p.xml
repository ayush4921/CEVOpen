<p>The potent and selective antimicrobial activities of the series 
 <bold>8</bold> compounds prompted us to study the binding of these derivatives to their potential target, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR. In 3D binding mode, alkyl chains (ethyl and methylene) at the 9-position of carbazole possess considerable flexibility (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002 F0003 F0004">Figures 2â€“4</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>, the aryl group at the 9-position of carbazole in compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> inserted deeply into the active pocket of DHFR (composed of Ala7, Trp22, Leu28 and Phe31). Moreover, both the folic acid substrate and compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> have a nitrogen atom in their heterocyclic rings that forms a hydrogen bond with the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR residue Gly15. The hydrophobic interactions between compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> and residues in the DHFR active pocket were enhanced due to the presence of the carbazole moiety. In addition, the primary amine group at the N-3 position of the carbazole ring plays an important role in binding to the active site of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR. A salt bridge was formed between the primary amine and Glu17. To summarise, docking results suggested that 
 <bold>8f</bold>, the compound with the most therapeutic potential, has interacted with the critical active-site residues of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR.
