<p>We have designed, synthesised and evaluated the antibacterial and antifungal activities of five series of novel carbazole derivatives. Compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> showed the most potential as a therapeutic agent, with an MIC of 0.5–2 µg/ml against selected bacterial strains. Furthermore, compound 
 <bold>8f</bold> also was the least cytotoxic to SGC-7901, AGS and L-02 cells. Compound 
 <bold>9d</bold> also exhibited strong antibacterial activity with the cancer therapeutic potential. Therefore, the clinical potential of carbazole derivatives 
 <bold>8f</bold> and 
 <bold>9d</bold> could be explored further for future applications in antitumour and antimicrobial therapies.
