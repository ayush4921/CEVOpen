<p>An experiment was performed to assess the inhibitory activity of protein extracts from two kinds of bitter melon on 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase, and it showed that their inhibition rate (66% to 69%) and IC50 (0.26 to 0.29 mg) were comparable to acarbose [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It has been proved that the inhibitory activity of MC ethanol extract on pancreatic lipase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase is performed in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Moreover, the suppression of the ethyl acetate fraction of MC extract on pancreatic lipase is positively correlated with its phenol content [
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Momordicin, a compound identified from MC, acted against 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase with IC50 of 15.86 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml [
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. An acidic and branched heteropolysaccharide obtained from MC was found to have 89.1% 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibitory property [
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The inhibitory activity of cucurbitane-type compounds in 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase has also been observed [
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The inhibitory properties of compounds 1–7 isolated from MC on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase are between 35% and 70%; besides, gentisic acid 5-O-
 <italic>β</italic>-d-xyloside and momordicoside G showed the strongest effect on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase (56.4%) and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase (70.5%), respectively [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Total anthocyanins from bitter melon [
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], oil, and polypeptide-k extracted from MC seeds [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] can also contribute to the inhibitory effect of MC on 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase and 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase. Besides, it is suggested that fermentation of MC juice with lactic acid bacterium improves its inhibition of 
 <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase activity [
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], providing a new idea for researchers to acquire more efficient components from bitter melon in the future.
