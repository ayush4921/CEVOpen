<p>In addition, experiments pertaining to the mechanism of MC on activating 
 <italic>β</italic> cells have other discoveries. An article states that MC powder can improve pancreatic function by activating pancreatic 
 <italic>β</italic> cells, evidently increasing the expression of insulin and pancreatic duodenal homeobox factors-1 (Pdx1) genes [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. As we know, Pdx1 is beneficial to the regulation of pancreatic development and stimulation of 
 <italic>β</italic> cell growth [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. One study in healthy and diabetic Wistar rats illustrates that the effect of MC aqueous extract on the elevation of 
 <italic>β</italic> cell proliferation and insulin secretion is related to the elevation of GLP-1 level, and it may result from the enteroendocrine L-cell allosterism and proliferation; besides, the polar molecules of MC depolarize L cells by raising intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> concentration, which in turn strengthens the release of GLP-1 [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Another study suggests that water extract of bitter gourd stimulates GLP-1 and insulin secretion in mice, and the hypoglycemic effect can be revoked by GLP-1 receptor antagonist [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Subcutaneous injection with protein extract from MC fruit pulp can also lower plasma glucose and elevate insulin concentration via both insulin secretagogue and insulinomimetic activities, and this is further proved through pancreatic perfusion in situ [
