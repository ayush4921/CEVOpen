<p>Four new cucurbitane-type triterpenes derived from MC show a protective effect on H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-damaged pancreatic cells; in particular, the protection ratio of compounds 2 and 3 reached up to 94.85% and 92.85%, separately. It is also found that the saponin-rich part of MC motivated insulin secretion in pancreatic 
 <italic>β</italic> cells of MIN6 in a concentration-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. An experiment on the treatment of high glucose-treated RIN-m5F pancreatic 
 <italic>β</italic> cells with the aqueous extract of MC shows that the survival rate of cells was significantly higher than that of untreated glucotoxic cells after 24 hours, but no protective effect was detected after 72 hours [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The underlying mechanism of this beneficial effect is still unknown. One study believes that it is attributed to the increase in the secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) which may help toward beta-cell proliferation and insulin secretion. Water extract of bitter melon stimulates the secretion of GLP-1 in the mouse enteroendocrine cell line STC-1 in a dose-dependent way. In addition, it works through certain bitter taste receptors (type 2) (TAS2R) and/or phospholipase C 
 <italic>β</italic>2-signaling pathway (PLC-
 <italic>β</italic>2), and two cucurbitane triterpenoids isolated from MC display high efficacy [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Besides, it is recorded that excessive glucocorticoids regulated by 11
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD1 are involved in the beta-cell damage and impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>–
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], while MC extracts can inhibit the activity of 11
 <italic>β</italic>-HSD1 significantly [
