<p>The research on cucurbitane-type glycosides isolated from MC shows that the compounds can increase the uptake of glucose by the C2C12 myoblasts [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and they exert antidiabetic effect by behaving as a stronger adenosine 5â€²-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator than troglitazone [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, one study demonstrates that the cucurbitane-type triterpenoids can stimulate glucose utilization in C2C12 myotubes through insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) signaling pathway in skeletal muscle instead of adipose tissue and liver tissue [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Besides, MC juice can stimulate glucose elimination in L6 myotubes [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the protein extract of MC has similar effect on C2C12 myocytes and 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Interestingly, it was observed that a standardized MC fruit ethanolic extract improved glucose uptake of hemidiaphragm in vitro [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and a further study indicated that MC juice could do it in the presence and absence of insulin [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that bitter gourd methanol extract can promote glucose uptake of insulin-resistant FL83B cells [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that MC may have a hypoglycemic effect in a non-insulin-dependent manner and show an insulin signaling pathway-enhancing effect.
