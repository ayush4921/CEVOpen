<p>A novel insulin receptor-binding protein from 
 <italic>Momordica charantia</italic> (mcIRBP) was separated from MC. A further study identified mcIRBP-9 and confirmed the gastric resistance and hypoglycemic activity of the peptides [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The protein physically interacts with the insulin receptor (IR) through the binding sites different from that of insulin, and it shows a synergistic effect with insulin, enhancing the kinase activity of IR by 5.87 ± 0.45 times and increasing the amount of phospho-IR protein by 1.31 ± 0.03 times. All in all, mcIRBP motivated the glucose consumption of cells by 1.36 ± 0.12 times via affecting IR/phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways and consequently promoting translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) [
