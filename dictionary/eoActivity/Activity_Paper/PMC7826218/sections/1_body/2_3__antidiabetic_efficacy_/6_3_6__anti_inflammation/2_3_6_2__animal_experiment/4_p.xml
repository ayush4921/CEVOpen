<p>Moreover, the hypoglycemic activity of different dosage forms and extraction methods of MC has been evidenced in different animal models. In the ALX-induced diabetic rat model, the water extract of MC is more effective than dried fruit powder. The former also delayed the onset of cataracts, which indicates the adaptability of MC [

Additionally, it is reported that pretreatment with MC juice succeeds in reversing the pathological damage caused by STZ in diabetic rats via controlling hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and oxidative stress but fails in preventing the occurrence of disease [
