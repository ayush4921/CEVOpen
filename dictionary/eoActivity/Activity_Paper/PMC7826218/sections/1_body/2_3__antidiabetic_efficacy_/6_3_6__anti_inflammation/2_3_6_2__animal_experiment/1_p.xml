<p>In HFD OLETF rats, MC powder significantly decreases proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and CCL2) in liver, muscle, and epididymal fat by preventing the phosphorylation of JNK and nuclear translocation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, thus reversing the inflammation-induced changes in IRS-1 and Akt, which ameliorate glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, in HFD obese mice, MC powder treatment exhibits an activity against the infiltration of obesity-related macrophage and mast cell and the expression of inflammatory cytokines in adipose tissue [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The ethyl acetate-soluble fraction of MC extract, containing cucurbitacin B, markedly suppresses the expression of IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> mRNA, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> mRNA, and iNOS gene in T2DM ob/ob mouse model [

It has been proved that this effect of MC juice is associated with the anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities of T-helper 2 cell. The juice promotes the anti-inflammatory phenotype of Th2 by decreasing Th1 cytokines (IL-2, interferon-
 <italic>γ</italic>) and increasing Th2 cytokines (IL-4) and IL-10 (regulatory cytokines). It exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic>, and IL-7) and elevating anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-
 <italic>β</italic>, IL-10). As a result, MC juice prevents the effect of autoreactive T cells on 
 <italic>β</italic> cells in T1DM rats [
