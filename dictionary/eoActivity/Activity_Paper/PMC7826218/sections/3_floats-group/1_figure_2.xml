  <p>Mechanisms of MC in delaying glucose absorption. In the small intestine, MC agents delay the digestion and absorption of food because of the inhibitory activity in 
   <italic>α</italic>-amylase, pancreatic lipase, and 
   <italic>α</italic>-glucosidase. MC agents also activate PI3K, which is associated with less glucose absorption in the jejunum epithelium, and suppress GLUT2, which is associated with decreased reabsorption of glucose in the kidney.
