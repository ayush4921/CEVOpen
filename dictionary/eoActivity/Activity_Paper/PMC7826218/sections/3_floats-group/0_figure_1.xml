  <p>Mechanisms of MC in enhancing glucose uptake and alleviating insulin resistance. MC agents function by inhibiting the expression of SOCS-3 and JNK, activating IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway directly or indirectly, and thus promoting the biogenesis and translocation of GLUT4 and suppressing GSK-3. GSK-3 can also be blocked through connecting with MC agents. The activity of AMPK influenced by increased thyroid hormones, adiponectin, and MC agents diametrically also plays a role in stimulating GLUT4 and GS. Besides, MC stimulates adiponectin and the PPAR-
   <italic>α</italic>/PPAR-
   <italic>γ</italic> pathway that can upregulate ACO and leptin and downregulate resistin to alleviate insulin resistance.
