<p>Five agar plugs (6 mm diameter) were taken from the edges of growing colonies (3 to 5 days old) and transferred to 1000 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing sterile potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium. Flasks were incubated at 120 rev min
 <sup>-1</sup> on a rotary shaker at 24 
 <sup>°</sup>C for 14 days. After finishing incubation time, mycelia were separated from the broth by filter paper. Culture filtrates were extracted three times with an equal volume of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was isolated by using a decanting funnel and evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The dried extract was kept at -20 
 <sup>°</sup>C in a freezer. The remaining mycelia were dried and crushed with a grinder, followed by extraction with 200 ml of anhydrous ethyl acetate two times. The supernatant was isolated and its solvent was evaporated using a laboratory chemical hood. Then, the sample was lyophilized in a freeze dryer (
