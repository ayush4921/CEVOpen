<p>Genomic DNA of the fungal endophytes was isolated using DenaZist Asia fungal DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The DNA samples were stored at 4 
 <sup>°</sup>C for immediate use and stored at -20 
 <sup>°</sup>C for long-term storage. The fungal rDNA–ITS region was amplified using the fungal domain-specific ITS5 and ITS4 (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Amplicon master mix was used to enhance amplification accuracy in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. PCR was performed in a Bio–Rad MyCycler
 <sup>TM</sup> Thermal Cycler (Hercules, California, USA) with an initial denaturation step at 94 
 <sup>°</sup>C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 
 <sup>°</sup>C for 30 sec, 58 
 <sup>°</sup>C for 20 sec, and 72 
 <sup>°</sup>C for 30 sec, with a final extension step of 72 
 <sup>°</sup>C for 10 min. The primers LROR and LR5 were used to amplify the nuclear LSU gene (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The partial translation elongation factor alpha 1 gene (TEF1) was amplified using the primers EF1-983F and Efgr (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The amplified regions were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in 1X Tris–Boric acid–EDTA buffer (TBE) with a marker ladder of 100–bp. PCR products were sent to Macrogen Korea for sequencing. The obtained sequences were then analyzed using the BLAST algorithm and closely similar sequences obtained from the National Centre of Biological Information (NCBI) database (
