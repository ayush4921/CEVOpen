<p>Isolation of endophytic fungi was carried according to the method described by Hallmann 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Fresh and disease-free root samples were washed with running tap water and allowed to dry. Then, they were cut into pieces of 0.5-1 cm. Root pieces were placed in ethanol 75% for 1 min and in 1-4% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min and then ethanol 75% for 30 sec. The samples were washed in distilled water after sterilization and placed on filter paper in sterile conditions for drying. After drying, the root parts were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and malt extract agar (MEA) media containing streptomycin (20 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) and incubated at 25-30 
 <sup>°</sup>C for 7–14 days. A daily survey was conducted to ensure the absence of saprophytic contamination. Hyphal tips of fungi, emerging out of the root tissues, were picked and grown on potato dextrose agar in pure culture.
