<p>The genus 
 <italic>Ferula </italic>(Apiaceae) contains more than 130 species, among which 30 species are represented in Iranian flora (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). 
 <italic>Ferula </italic>species are good sources of biologically active compounds such as terpenoid, coumarins, and sesquiterpene derivatives (

 <italic>Ferula ovina</italic> is one of the Iranian species which is an ethnomedicinal plant used in folk medicines especially in the Eastern, middle, and some Western regions of Iran. It produces valuable compounds such as stylosin and tschimgine. These two compounds are monoterpene derivatives (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The pharmacological effects of an ester-type monoterpene, tschimgine, are cytotoxic activity against melanoma (SK-MEL-28) cell line (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), inhibition of acetylcholinesterase which is the leading strategy against Alzheimerâ€™s disease (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), modulation the activity of estrogen receptors (ERs) (
