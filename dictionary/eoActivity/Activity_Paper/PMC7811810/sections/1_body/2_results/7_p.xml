<p>The ethyl acetate extract of 
 <italic>P. persicus </italic>was also analyzed by the LC-MS method. The mass spectra of two peaks at the retention times of 3.5 and 9.3 min are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref> which are respectively related to the production of tschimgine and stylosin by this endophytic fungus. The molecular ion [M]
 <sup>+ </sup>and protonated molecule [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> signals of tschimgine (t
 <sub>R</sub>=3.5 min) were detected at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 274.30 and 275.33, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Some of its related adduct including sodium adduct ([M+H+Na] and [2M+H+Na]
 <sup>+</sup> and protonated dimmer adduct ion [2M+H]
 <sup>+ </sup>were respectively observed at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 148.3, 286.9, and 546.3. Stylosin (t
 <sub>R</sub>=9.3 min) displayed molecular ion [M]
 <sup>+</sup> and protonated molecule [M+H]
 <sup>+</sup> signals at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 274.86 and 275.76, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). The sodium adduct of stylosin was observed at 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 327.21.
