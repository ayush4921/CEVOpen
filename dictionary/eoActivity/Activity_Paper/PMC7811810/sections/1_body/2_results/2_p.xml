<p>Since molecular identification of fungal isolates was not possible using only ITS rDNA regions, the LSU region and part of the protein-coding gene EF1–α were also sequenced. Based on the BLASTn results of the three gene regions, 40 isolates from 9 different genera of endophytic fungi were identified all of which belonged to 
 <italic>Ascomycota</italic> phylum, 
 <italic>Pezizomycotina</italic> subphylum but in 4 different classes. The molecular taxonomy was also supported by morphology investigation (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.
