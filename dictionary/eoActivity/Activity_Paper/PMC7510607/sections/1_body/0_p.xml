 <italic>Bletilla striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. is one of the commonly used traditional Chinese medicine with tuber as medicine (He et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Xu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), Especially, in the northwest region high-quality 
 <italic>B. striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. is grown, which is used by the pharmaceutical industry (Bai et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). The root tuber of 
 <italic>B. striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. has been used over the years in traditional medicine to treat myriad of diseases. Medicinal plants are widely used for the treatment of human diseases, there is a growing interest in 
 <italic>B. striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. But, with the increasing demand of 
 <italic>B. striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. in the market, the wild resources are gradually exhausted. 
 <italic>Bletilla striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. is of high economic value because of the utilization of wild herb medicine species with medicinal values in northwest China. The data of complete chloroplast genome will serve as a foundation for species identification, germplasm diversity, genetic engineering of 
 <italic>B. striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f. In this study, we aim to establish and characterize the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of 
 <italic>B. striata</italic> (Thunb.) Reichb. f., and provide additional effective data for the phylogenetic study of Orchiidaceae in the future.
