<p>The complete chloroplast genome was annotated with 
 <italic>B. formosana</italic> (MN526744) and 
 <italic>B. ochracea</italic> (KT695602) as reference and has been submitted to GenBank with the accession number of MT193723. The chloroplast genome of 
 <italic>B. stariata</italic> is a circular quadripartite structure similar to major angiosperms chloroplast genomes (Hahn et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It has a length of 159,491 bp, which contained a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,778 bp and a large single-copy (LSC) region of 87,139 bp, separated by two copies of an inverted repeat (IR) of 26,787 bp.
