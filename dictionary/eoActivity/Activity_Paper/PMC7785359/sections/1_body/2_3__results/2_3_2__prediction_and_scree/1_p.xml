<p>Based on the BATMAN online tool, 222 important components with target records were predicted for the four main Chinese medicinal herbs in the QSBD TCM granule (Supplemental 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table 1</xref>), of which 31, 81, 75, and 35 important components with target records were predicted for Rhizoma Pinelliae, bighead atractylodes rhizome, 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, and 
 <italic>Astragalus mongholicus</italic>, respectively. After screening important components using ADME and targets with scores &gt;10, a total of 6 important components (magnesium lithospermate B, neocryptotanshinone II, heteratisine, daphneolone, tanshinone IIA, and tanshinone IIB) with 275 targets were obtained for 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, and 2 important components (soyasapogenol B and astragaloside II) with 15 targets were obtained for 
 <italic>Astragalus mongholicus</italic> (Supplemental 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table 2</xref>).
