<p>The results of GO functional analysis are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The 27 genes were significantly enriched in 98 GO functional terms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(a)</xref> and Supplemental 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table 3</xref>), including response to glucocorticoids, porphyrin-containing compound metabolic process, and terpenoid metabolic process. The 98 functional terms were classified into 11 categories based on the kappa coefficient and include regulation of the nitric oxide biosynthetic process, regulation of the cytokine biosynthetic process, regulation of lymphocyte-mediated immunity, and other biological processes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(b)</xref>). In addition, the 27 genes were significantly enriched in 63 KEGG pathways (Supplemental 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Table 4</xref>). The top 20 pathways are displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, showing cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the TNF signaling pathway, and the IL-17 signaling pathway, among others.
