<p>Molecular docking was performed to verify the key compound-target interactions in the above analysis, including the key compounds neocryptotanshinone II and astragaloside II and key targets CYP1A1, CYP1A2, APOA1, TNF, IL-6, NFKB1, and ALB. The 3D structures of these key compounds and target proteins are shown in Supplemental 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supplementary-material-1">Figure 2</xref>. For the docking results, a total of 10 docking models were obtained, and the docking model with the best affinity (lowest binding energy) was selected as the optimal docking model. The results showed that astragaloside II had a strong affinity with ALB protein. Neocryptotanshinone II had strong affinity with multiple proteins, of which it showed the best affinity with TNF (
