<p>Based on the TCM theory, the spleen is connected to the heart meridians, and their functions are compatible, so the malfunctioning of the spleen can lead to changes in the heart function. Guanlin Yang proposed the method of “Treatment According with the Spleen” and developed a qi-replenishing, spleen-strengthening, phlegm-dispelling, and blood-nourishing (QSBD) TCM granule for the treatment of CHD [

However, its pharmacological mechanisms are still unclear. Network pharmacology refers to the integrated analysis of a system biology network and pharmacology, which is in accordance with the core concept of the holistic philosophy of TCM, and provides insight into the detailed compound-target and target-pathway relationships of herbs used to treat complicated diseases [
