<p>Albumin (ALB) is a 69â€‰kDa protein that normally accounts for more than 50% of the total plasma protein content, functioning in regulating blood plasma colloid osmotic pressure, and acts as a carrier protein [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Low levels of serum ALB have been found to be associated with different kinds of cardiovascular diseases, including venous thromboembolism, CHD, and incident ischemic heart disease [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Chien et al. indicated that low levels of serum ALB were related to an increase in hard cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality for patients with stable CHD, suggesting the worse prognosis of low levels of serum ALB in stable CHD [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It was reported that decreased serum ALB levels may indicate worse prognosis of patients with CHD, probably by increasing autophagy [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our study, ALB was a hub gene with the highest degree in the PPI network and was a target gene of astragaloside II in the pharmacological network. Astragaloside II is an active compound from the medicinal herb Radix Astragali and has been reported to enhance T-cell activation [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], inhibit autophagy of hepatocellular carcinoma cells [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and enhance the secretion of adiponectin in primary adipocytes [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Here, we suggested that astragaloside II played roles in the treatment of CHD by targeting ALB and regulating the level of ALB in blood.
