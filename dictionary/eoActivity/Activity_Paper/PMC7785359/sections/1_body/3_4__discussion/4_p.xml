<p>An elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is one of the major causes of CHD and is an indispensable and independent index to predict the risk of CHD [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1) and CYP1A2 encode members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes, which catalyze multiple reactions associated with drug metabolism, as well as the synthesis of cholesterol and steroids [

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) and apolipoprotein A-II (APOA2) are major protein components of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in plasma, functioning in the transportation of cholesterol on HDL [

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In this study, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, APOA1, and APOA2 were all targets of neocryptotanshinone II in the pharmacological network. Neocryptotanshinone II is the active compound from the medicinal herb

 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> compounds could decrease the risk of CHD by improving the biochemical indices (reducing the levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipids, while increasing the levels of apolipoprotein A/B/E and total bilirubin) of patients with CHD [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, we concluded that neocryptotanshinone II played roles in the treatment of CHD by targeting CYP1A1, CYP1A2, APOA1, and APOA2 to regulate cholesterol levels.
