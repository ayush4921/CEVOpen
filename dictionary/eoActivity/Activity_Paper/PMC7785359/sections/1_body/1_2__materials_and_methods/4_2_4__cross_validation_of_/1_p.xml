<p>To validate the target proteins and to narrow the range of possible target proteins, “coronary heart disease” was used as the keyword to search CHD-associated genes from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ctdbase.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://ctdbase.org/</ext-link>, updated 2018), and the genes with inference scores &gt;40 were selected. In addition, “coronary heart disease” was also used as the keyword to search CHD-associated genes from the DisGeNET database (version 6.0) [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The overlaps between the CHD-associated genes and the predicted protein targets were selected and used in the subsequent analyses.
