 <italic>Chalcones</italic> are natural precursor compounds of flavonoids and iso-flavonoids. They are present in various plants and vegetables with a wide range of biological activities. Chalcone is an aromatic ketone and an enone with an ability to activate nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (2NRF2) pathway. Several novel dihydroxy chalcones were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to suppress ROS species and oxidative stress acting as an anti-ischemic stroke through KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway activation. Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) in stroke was studied using rat models. These compounds had a potent protection of H
