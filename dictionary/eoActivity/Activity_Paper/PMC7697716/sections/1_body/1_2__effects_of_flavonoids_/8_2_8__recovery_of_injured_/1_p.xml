<p>Injury to the spinal cord or central nervous system (CNS) causes paralysis of the body from the waist down, and this condition is known as Paraplegia. Experimentation of animal model using rats revealed that using isoflurane increased the number of motor neurons. The delayed preconditioning with a neuroprotective effect was observed, which may be associated with the expression of protein complex NF-ÎºB [

 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> L. is a medicinal plant with flavonoids as an active phytoconstituent. It has a flavonoid content of 6%. It protects the neuron of adrenal phaeochromo cytoma from oxidative stress caused by ROS species such as H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. Sciatic nerve injury (SNI) was induced in order to determine the effect of plant extract on oxidative stress, cell signaling molecules, cytokine production, and caspase expression in brain muscle. Wistar albino female rats were used for the study. The result suggested a delay in the progression of SNI caused by the plant extract [
