 <italic>Allium flavum</italic> and 
 <italic>Allium carinatum</italic> are wild, edible onions rich in flavonoids, rutin, quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, and kaempferol-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside. These, besides having known antioxidant potential, are effective anticancer agents. When combined with doxorubicin, they upregulate angiogenic factor against human hepatoma (HepG2) and lung carcinoma (A549) cell lines [

 <italic>Dulacia egleri</italic> showed anticancer activity by inhibiting cathepsins B and L. The extract was prepared from the Dulacia plant, and the compound 4′-Hydroxy-6,7-methylenedioxy-3-methoxyflavone were isolated from it (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05243-f003">Figure 3</xref>). This isolated flavonoids form the leaves of plant were then spectroscopically analyzed for structure determination. The isolated compound showed enzyme inhibition and can be used for cancer therapy [

 <italic>Glycyrrhiza uralensis</italic>) contain more than 300 flavonoids, and it is used to alleviate stomach pain, to eliminate phlegm, and to relieve coughing. Recent research proves that it exhibits several pharmacological activities such as antitumor, antiviral and antimicrobial effects [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Baicalein and baicalin are phytochemicals which are cytostatic as well as cytotoxic to various human tumor cells, and inhibit tumor growth in vivo [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. There are a few plants within the genus 
 <italic>Peganum</italic> which have been used as medicines in China for a long time. This genus contains several alkaloids, flavonoids, etc. It has a wide range of biological activities such as antitumor, anticoagulant, anti-parasitic, anti-hypertension and anti-inflammatory properties [
 <xref rid="B58-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Flavonoids and bioflavonoids extracted from 
 <italic>Ouratea</italic> and other genera of the Ochnaceae family have important biological activities such as anti-tumor, antimicrobial, antiviral, and DNA topoisomerase inhibition [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. One of the most popular Chinese medicinal herbs is 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic>. Wogonin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05243-f004">Figure 4</xref>), wogonoside, bicalein, and baicalin are flavonoids extracted from 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic>. These flavonoids are not only cytostatic, but also show cytotoxic effect on tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Besides the naturally isolated flavonoids, these can be synthesized in a laboratory using different techniques. Macgown et al. used microwave assisted approach to synthesize novel bisflavonoids, which exhibited anticancer activity against liver, breast and colorectal carcinoma cell lines [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Below is an extensive list of plants whose flavonoid content enable them to be used as anticancer agents (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05243-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Although majority of these studies on the anticancer activities of various flavonoids and their derivatives are in pre-clinical study phase, several flavonoids are under consideration for cancer treatment and are at various phases of clinical trials. For example, the icaritin (ICT) is in the third phase of clinical trial for the cure of hepatocellular carcinoma. This prenylated flavonoids lower the signaling process by affecting various receptors like estrogen receptor splice variant ERα36, STAT3 and NFκB, and CXCR4. The ICT also targets ROS pathways and sphingosine kinase-1. It has been suggested to boost the immune response against the developing tumors. The ICT target a number of metabolic pathways, it can be used in glioblastoma and various types of blood leukemia. Due to its promising antitumor properties, various analogs of ICT synthesis and their clinical trials are in progress [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Thoracic radiotherapy for lung cancer treatment results in acute radiation-induced esophagitis (ARIE). It has been noted in phase II clinical trials that the epigallocatechin-3-gallatein reduces the ARIE and other related toxicities caused by thoracic radiotherapy [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an enzyme present in endoplasmic reticulum and normally makes disulfide bonds in newly formed proteins. This enzyme is also involved in tumor progression and neurodegeneration diseases beside other important infectious ailments. The quercetin flavonoid blocks the function of PDI and is a useful anticancer agent. Phase II clinical trials showed that isoquercetin reduce hypercoagulability in cancer patients having high possibility of thrombosis [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Further clinical trials should be conducted on flavonoids and their derivatives for anticancer and other diseases as they have lower toxicity and minor side effects.
