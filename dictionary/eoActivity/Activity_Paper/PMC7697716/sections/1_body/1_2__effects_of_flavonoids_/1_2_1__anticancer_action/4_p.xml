<p>Quercetin is a natural flavonoid present in plants and in commonly consumed foods such as berries, green tea, and grains. It has been used most effectively for colorectal cancer. Cell cycle arrest, increase in apoptosis, antioxidant replication, modulation of estrogen receptors, regulation of signaling pathways, inhibition of metastasis and angiogenesis are among various mechanisms underlying the chemo-preventive effects of quercetin in colorectal cancer [

Luteolin, a natural flavonoid with pro-apoptotic activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, arrests the cancer cell cycle at the G2/M stage. The miR-6809-5p is overexpressed in HCC and it was found to be upregulated by luteolin by directly targeting flotillin-1 [

 <italic>Matricaria recutita</italic> L. (chamomile) flower has a flavonoid content of 157.9 ± 2.22 mg/g QE of dry extract. It displayed dose dependent enhanced mortality of HepG2 cells in HCC. Angiogenesis is an important process which is hijacked for progression of cancer. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) facilitates blood vessel formation via angiogenesis through VEGF receptors. This expression of VEGF was dose dependently reduced by synthesized extract, making it an efficient anticancer agent [
