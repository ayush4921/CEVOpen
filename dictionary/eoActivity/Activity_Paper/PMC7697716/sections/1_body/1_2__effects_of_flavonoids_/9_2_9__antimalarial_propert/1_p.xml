<p>Malaria is caused by the parasitic species of Plasmodium. 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and other species are now increasingly resistant to the common antimalarial drugs like chloroquine [
 <xref rid="B226-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>], and this resistance is spreading toward artemisinin and its analogues [
 <xref rid="B227-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>,
 <xref rid="B228-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. New drugs are required to treat drug resistant strains of Plasmodium [

 <xref rid="B228-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. In the continuing effort of synthesizing antimalarial drug it is reported that plant extracts that are rich in compounds, such as flavonoids, chalcones, terpenes, quinones, and xanthones, are antimalarial in nature [
 <xref rid="B229-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">229</xref>]. 
 <italic>Prosopis</italic> is plant genus which has been used for medicinal purposes since ancient times. Its components include flavonoids, tannins, alkaloids etc. These bioactive compounds are antimalarial, antiulcer and antibiotic in nature [
 <xref rid="B230-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. Species of the genus 
 <italic>Psiadia</italic> extract contain flavonoids, coumarins, phenylpropanoids, and terpenoids. It shows pharmacological activities such as antimicrobial, antimalarial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory etc [
 <xref rid="B231-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. Extracts of some plants such as 
 <italic>Psiadia dentata</italic> and 
 <italic>Psiadia arguta</italic> inhibit the growth of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> [
 <xref rid="B231-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>]. 
 <italic>Waltheria indica</italic> (
 <italic>syn. Waltheria americana</italic>) extract have flavonoids, (âˆ’) epicatechin, kaempferol, quercetin, sterols etc. It is used for the treatment of malaria and other infectious diseases (e.g diarrhea due to 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, lungs infection due to 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>), inflammation, and prevention of oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="B232-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">232</xref>]. Prenylated flavonoids obtained from the bark of 
 <italic>Artocarpus styracifolius</italic> show antiplasmodial and antitrypanosomal effects [
 <xref rid="B233-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. Silymarin from 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> has been isolated and purified. Anti-plasmodial activity of silymarin, a polyphenolic flavonoid, has been reported and it forms the silymarin-heme complex, and inhibits the conversion of toxic free heme into crystalline non-toxic heamozoid [
 <xref rid="B234-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>]. 
 <italic>Indigofera oblongifolia</italic> leaf extract has significant effects against malaria and protects the liver from injury caused by 
 <italic>P. chabaudi</italic> via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory ways [
