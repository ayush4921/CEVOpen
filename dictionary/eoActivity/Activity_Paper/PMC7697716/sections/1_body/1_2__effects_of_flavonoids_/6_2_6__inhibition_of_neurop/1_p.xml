 <italic>Cichorium intybus</italic> is a medicinal plant that contains a variety of beneficial biochemical constituents present, including flavonoid, saponin, and tannin. The presence of these compounds enables them to be used to suppress oxidative stress, and its possible interference of the two amino acid systems, namely GABAergic and glutamatergic systems in nerve injury and neuropathy [
