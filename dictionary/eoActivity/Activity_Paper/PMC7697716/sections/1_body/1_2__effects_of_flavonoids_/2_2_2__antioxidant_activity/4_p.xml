<p>Using natural flavonoids to synthesize its derivatives has immense application and can improve the existing potential of these natural flavonoids. A group of flavonoids derivatives was made through chemically modifying luteolin, apigenin, chrysin, and diosmetin. The synthesis process was carried out by adding different bromo-alkanes with their respective precursors in anhydrous acetone. The derivatives obtained were then assayed for their antioxidant properties using DPPH, FRAP, and ORAC assays. The entire synthesized compounds displayed enhanced antioxidant activity, which may be attributed to their electron or hydrogen radical discharging capacity to DPPH. These derivatives also displayed anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activity. Luteolin; apigenin; diosmetin; O

This one-step process gave twenty different compounds with antioxidant and antidiabetic potential. The α-glucosidase inhibition was investigated using an animal model while the antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH (

In order to detect the true antioxidant potential of the purified compounds and plant extract, several assays should be conducted so that the effects of solvents, other reagents, and temperature are minimized, and conclusive results are obtained.
