<p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in the human body mainly as byproducts of the electron transport chain. They are essential for protein phosphorylation, initiation of numerous transcriptional factors, apoptosis, immunity, and differentiation processes. However, ROS also cause oxidative stress upon reacting with molecules such as lipids, proteins, or nucleic acids. Lipid peroxidation by ROS causes cellular membrane damage. This membrane has a potential, with positive charges on the outside of the cell, and negative charges inside the cell. The damage to membrane alters the cell membrane potential and the cellâ€™sosmotic pressure, eventually causing cell death. The human defense system use different mechanisms and enzymes to battle endogenous elevated ROS [

Flavonoids act as exogenous antioxidants and are directly oxidized by radicals to form less reactive species via four mechanisms, namely (1) the inhibition of nitric-oxide synthase activity, (2) inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity, (3) modulation of channel pathways, or by (4) interacting with other enzyme systems [
