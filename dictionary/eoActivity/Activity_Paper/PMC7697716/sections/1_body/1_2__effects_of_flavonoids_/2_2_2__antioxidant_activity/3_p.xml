 <italic>Bryonia alba</italic> L. is a medicinal and homeopathic plant of Cucurbitaceae family with a wide range of biological activities. The methanolic extract of air-dried leaves of this plant was used to isolate four flavonoids (lutonarin, saponarin, isoorientin and isovitexin) using HPLC-DAD. The structures of these compounds were elucidated by NMR and UV spectroscopy, and by mass spectroscopy. Their antioxidant and antiradical activity were confirmed by their ability to suppress ROS produced by macrophages, the isolates being more effective in comparison to the crude extract [

 <italic>Salvia aristata</italic> was dried and extraction was performed using methanol. The methanolic extract was subjected to the Folin-Ciocalteu and Aluminum colorimetric methods to determine phenolic and flavonoid content, respectively. It turned out that TFC of 50% hydro methanol extract was higher than aqueous and methanolic extract. This was reflected in its potency as an antioxidant agent where IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 50% hydro methanol extract was 3.4 whereas aqueous and methanolic extract gave 4.0 and 5.7 (mg/mL), respectively [
 <xref rid="B100-molecules-25-05243" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Plant derived secondary metabolites possess potent antioxidant activity, and this was evident from the ethanolic extract of leaves of 
 <italic>Anisomeles malabarica</italic>. The DPPH assay confirmed its free radical quenching ability to be highest at 120 µg/mL. The extract thus showed enhanced antioxidant and antibacterial properties against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Proteus vulgaris</italic> [
