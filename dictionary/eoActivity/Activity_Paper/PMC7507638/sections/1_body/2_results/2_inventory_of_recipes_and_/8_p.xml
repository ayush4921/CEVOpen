<p id="Par49">Different plant organs are used to treat different candidiasis. At the end of this survey, eight (08) plant organs were involved in the composition of traditional recipes (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Leafy stems (44.53%) were the most commonly used, followed by whole plants (15.74%) and bark (15.55%). Roots have only a minor role (7.87%) in recipes against candidiasis. Indeed, leafy stems and/or leaves are very important in medicinal recipes since they would constitute the basis for the synthesis of the majority of phytochemical compounds.
