<p id="Par42">A total of 124 recipes were provided, 81 (65%) of which were from market herbalists. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> gives the composition of the recipes served. The recipes are made up of a single plant species (21.77%) or a combination of plants species (78.23%). The number of plants per recipe varied according to the category of informants. It was obvious that the proportion of plants constituting the recipes for market herbalists was in opposite trend compared to that of traditional healers. Indeed, plant associations were much more noticeable among herbalists with 45.68% of recipes composed of more than 6 plant species compared to only 6.98% among traditional healers. It should be noted that in some cases (6.45%) non-plant elements such as mineral compound (kaolin, alum or salt) and sulphur are added to plant organs in the composition of recipes.
