<p id="Par57">The botanical families most cited in this work (Leguminosae, Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae and Combretaceae) were similar to those obtained by Koudokpon et al. (2017) who, in their studies on plants used in the treatment of infections pointing out that Leguminosae species were predominant in the recorded species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This could be related first to geographical conditions (nature of soils, climatic and other factors) that did not always favor the growth of the same plant species on different soil types and having then a significant influence on bioactive compounds, but also to socio-cultural factors [
