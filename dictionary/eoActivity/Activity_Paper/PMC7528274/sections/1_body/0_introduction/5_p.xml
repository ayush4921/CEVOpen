<p id="Par9">However, changes in folk botanical knowledge, assessed using comparable research methods (ethnography-based techniques, e.g. face-to-face interviews), remain poorly investigated. Some diachronic comparisons in ethnobotany have been attempted, with interesting results, in Eastern Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and, more recently, in Southern Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], while beyond Europe this has been more sporadically done [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In particular, in Poland, a comprehensive historical study showed that LEK linked to the gathering of wild green vegetables has gradually decreased, mainly due to replacement by a few cultivated vegetables; this process started in the nineteenth century, but became more pronounced during the twentieth century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, a review focusing on wild food plant gathering in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] has underlined not only the decline of “traditional” foraging but also the remarkable emergence of a new, “recreational” foraging, practiced by urban classes, often popularized by trained botanists, organic farmers, chefs, and food activists, and whose real impact among the majority of the population in Western societies has still to be properly assessed. Schunko et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] well demonstrated a decade ago that the motivation of the resurgent popularity of wild plant gathering among organic farmers in Austria is to be attributed to an “internalization” of motivations, i.e. the pleasure of the activity itself, while diverse authors in Europe ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and chapters therein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) discussed how the resilience or resurgence of foraging may be linked to the increasing attention communities and citizens pay to their local/regional cultural identities and to the perceived healthy properties of the wild food plants.
