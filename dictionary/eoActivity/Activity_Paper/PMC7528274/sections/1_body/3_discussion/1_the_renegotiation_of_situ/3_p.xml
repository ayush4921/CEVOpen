<p id="Par36">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> clearly shows that the gathering and use of plant genera that, accordingly to the Italian botanical reference flora [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], mainly grow in pastures, forests and higher mountain areas (underlined in the figure) has ceased, while the collection of 
 <italic>cultivated</italic> medicinal plants or medicinal plants growing in more anthropogenic environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] has been newly introduced. This is similar to what has been observed for the patterns of change in wild food plant knowledge in Europe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].
