<p>The inhibition of ferric reducing power, hydrogen peroxide, ABTS, and DPPH by all extracts and standards at their respective concentrations that scavenged 50% (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of their radicals is shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The ferric reducing power scavenging activity of the extracts and the standard drugs based on the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was in the decreasing order: vitamin C (standard) &gt; wild (water) &gt; wild (methanol) &gt; cultivated (methanol) &gt; wild (acetone) &gt; cultivated (acetone) &gt; cultivated (water) &gt; BHT (standard). The wild plants showed a better reducing IC
 <sub>50</sub> than the cultivated plants. The hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity as recorded from the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values is in the following order: wild (methanol) &gt; wild (acetone) &gt; cultivated (acetone) &gt; vitamin C (standard) &gt; wild (water) &gt; cultivated (methanol) &gt; cultivated (water) &gt; BHT (standard). However, water extracts of the cultivated plants and BHT showed no activity against hydrogen peroxide.
