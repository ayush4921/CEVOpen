<p>The inhibitory effect of various extracts of wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> comparable to the standards (BHT and vitamin C) is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Extracts from three solvents demonstrated a strong scavenging activity against nitric oxide radical compared to standards. There was no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in the radical scavenging activity of the methanol extracts of wild and cultivated plants at all concentrations excepts at 0.025â€‰mg/mL. Methanol extracts of the wild plants had a significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) scavenging activity of 67.7% compared to methanol extracts of the cultivated plants. The acetone extracts of wild and cultivated plants showed a significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in radical scavenging activity at all concentrations assayed. Acetone extracts of the wild plants had a significantly higher mean inhibition at all concentrations. Higher significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) inhibition was also observed in the water extracts of wild plants compared to cultivated plants at all concentrations.
