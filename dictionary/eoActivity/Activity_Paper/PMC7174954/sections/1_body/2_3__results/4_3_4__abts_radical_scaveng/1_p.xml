<p>The results of ABTS radical scavenging activity of wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> at various concentrations are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. There was a concentration-dependent response in this assay. All the solvent extracts showed great ABTS radical scavenging activity at very low concentrations. There was no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in radical scavenging activity in the methanol extracts of the wild and cultivated plants except at a concentration of 0.025 mg/mL. Methanol extracts of the wild plants had a significantly higher (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) radical scavenging activity of 91.55% at 0.025 mg/mL. The acetone extracts of both wild and cultivated plants showed no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) at all concentrations except at 0.025 mg/mL. Acetone extracts of the cultivated plants showed significantly higher ABTS inhibition of 88.45%. A significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) was observed in the water extracts of wild and cultivated plants at all concentrations but not at 0.5 mg/mL. Water extracts of the wild plants exhibited higher radical scavenging activity of 79.96, 89.37, 93.51, and 94.74% at 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mg/mL concentrations, respectively, compared to those of the cultivated plants.
