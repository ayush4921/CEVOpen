<p>All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three replications. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the differences between the cultivated and wild 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> samples. Where applicable, data were subjected to statistical analysis using SAS (Statistical Analysis System) package. Mean separation was done using Fischer's LSD where the data showed significance (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The concentrations required to attain 50% radical scavenging activity (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined from regression lines with 95% confidence level.
