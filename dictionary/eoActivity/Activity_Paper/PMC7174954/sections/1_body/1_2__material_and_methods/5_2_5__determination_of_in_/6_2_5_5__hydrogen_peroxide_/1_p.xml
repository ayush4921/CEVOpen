<p>The ability of the plant extract to scavenge hydrogen peroxide was determined by the method of Kibiti and Afolayan [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Two millilitres (2 mL) of plant extracts prepared at various concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/mL) was mixed with 6 mL of 4 mM H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> solution in phosphate buffer (0.1 M pH 7.4). The mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 230 nm against the blank solution containing the plant extracts without H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>. The result obtained was compared with standard ascorbic acid. Percentage inhibition of H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub> = [(Abs (control) − Abs (sample))/(Abs (control))] × 100, where Abs (control) is the absorbance of the control and Abs (sample) is the absorbance of the extracts/standard.
