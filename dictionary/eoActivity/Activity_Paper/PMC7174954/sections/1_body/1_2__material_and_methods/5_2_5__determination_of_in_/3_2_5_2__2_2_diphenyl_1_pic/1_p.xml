<p>The scavenging activity of the plant extract against DPPH was determined according to the method described by Otang et al. [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A solution of 0.135 mM DPPH in methanol was prepared, and 1 mL of this solution was mixed with different concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/mL) of various extracts of 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> and standard antioxidants (vitamin C and BHT). The reaction mixture was vortexed thoroughly and left in the dark at room temperature for 30 minutes and absorbance measured at 517 nm. The ability of the plant extracts to scavenge DPPH was calculated as
