<p>Nitric oxide scavenging activity was determined using the method described by Ebrahimzadeh et al. [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Two millilitres (2 mL) of 10 mM sodium nitroprusside dissolved in 0.5 mL phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) was mixed with 0.5 mL of plant extract or vitamin C or rutin at various concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/mL). The resulting mixture was incubated at 25°C for 2.5 hours. After incubation, 0.5 mL of the reaction mixture was taken and mixed with 0.5 mL of Griess reagent (containing 1.0 mL of 0.33% sulfonic acid in 20% glacial acetic acid) and was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature with 1 mL of naphthylethylene diamine dichloride (0.1%
