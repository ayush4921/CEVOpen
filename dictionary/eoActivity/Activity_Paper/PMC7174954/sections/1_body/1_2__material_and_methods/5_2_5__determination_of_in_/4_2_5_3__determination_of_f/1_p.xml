<p>The reducing power of 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> extract was evaluated according to the method described by Idris et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] with a slight modification. The mixture containing 2.5 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.6) and 2.5 mL of potassium ferricyanide (K
 <sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)
 <sub>6</sub>) (1%) was added to 1 mL of each extract at different concentrations (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/mL). The mixture was incubated at 50°C for 20 minutes. After incubation, 2.5 mL of trichloroacetic acid (10%) was added to terminate the reaction. The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant (2.5 mL) was collected, and it was mixed with distilled water (2.5 mL) and 0.5 mL FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> (0.1%). The absorbance of the reaction mixture was then measured at 700 nm against the blank sample (without extract). Ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxyl toluene solutions were used as positive controls. Increase in absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated increased reducing power.
