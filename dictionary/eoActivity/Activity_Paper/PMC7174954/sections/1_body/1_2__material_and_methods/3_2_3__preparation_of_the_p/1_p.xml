<p>The rhizomes from wild and cultivated plants were rinsed with deionized water to remove soil particles and gently blotted with paper towel to remove water before chopping using a sterilized kitchen grater. Portions of grated wild and cultivated fresh 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> (200 g) were separately extracted in different solvents (acetone, water, and methanol) on an orbital shaker (Stuart Scientific Orbital SOI, Essex) for 24 hours. Each extract was filtered using a Buchner funnel and Whatman No. 1 filter paper. Water extract was frozen at 40°C and concentrated using a freeze dryer (VirTis BenchTop K, VirTis Co., Gardiner, NY) for 48 hours. Acetone and methanol extracts were concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure using rotary evaporator (Strike 202, Steroglass, Italy). Each extract was subsequently reconstituted in its solvent of extraction to give desired concentrations used for the various analyses.
