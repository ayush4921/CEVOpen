<p>Tannin content was estimated according to Sowunmi and Afolayan [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with slight modifications. 0.20 g of the sample was added to 20 mL of 50% methanol. This mixture was shaken thoroughly and placed in a water bath at 80°C for 1 hour to ensure uniform mixing. The extract was filtered into a 100 mL volumetric flask, followed by the addition of 20 mL distilled water, 2.5 mL Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, and 10 mL of 17% aqueous Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub>. The mixture was made up to 100 mL with distilled water and allowed to stand for 20 minutes. The development of a bluish green color was observed at the end of the reaction mixture of the different concentration ranges from 0 to 10 ppm. The absorbance of the tannic acid standard solutions as well as the sample was measured at 760 nm. Results were expressed as mg/g of tannic acid equivalent using the calibration curve: 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 0.0593
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.0485 (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9826), where 
 <italic>x</italic> is the absorbance and 
 <italic>Y</italic> is the tannic acid equivalent (mg/g).
