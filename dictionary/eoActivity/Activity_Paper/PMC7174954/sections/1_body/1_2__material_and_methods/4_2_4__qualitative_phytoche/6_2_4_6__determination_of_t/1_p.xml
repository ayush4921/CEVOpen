 <italic>v</italic> ethanol prepared in distilled water. The mixture was heated in a hot water bath at 55°C for 4 hours with continuous stirring. The mixture was filtered, and the residue was reextracted with another 50 mL of 20% aqueous ethanol. The volume was reduced to 20 mL in a hot water bath at 100° C. The concentrate was transferred to a separating funnel, and 10 mL diethyl ether was added. The concentrated solution obtained was shaken vigorously in a separating funnel, and ether layer was discarded, while the aqueous layer was retained. The process was repeated twice for purification purposes, and 20 mL of butanol was added to the aqueous layer. The n-butanol extracts were washed twice with 10 mL of 5% (
