<p>Total phenol content was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu method described by Oyedemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] using tannic acid as standard. Half a millilitre (0.5 mL) of the extracts (1 mg/mL) was mixed with 2.5 mL of 10% Folin-Ciocalteu solution and 2 mL of Na
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (75% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>). The mixture was vortexed for 30 seconds, and the resulting mixture was incubated at 40° C for 30 minutes for color development. Absorbance was measured at 765 nm using a UV spectrophotometer (AJI-CO
 <sub>3</sub> UV-VIS). The total phenolic content of the sample was extrapolated from as mg/g of gallic acid standard (mg GAE/g) using the following derived equation based on the calibration curve of the standard: 
 <italic>Y</italic> = 8.773
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.1956 (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9965), where 
 <italic>x</italic> is the absorbance and 
 <italic>Y</italic> is the gallic acid equivalent (mg GAE/g). mg GAE/g is derived from the equation 
 <italic>CV</italic>/
 <italic>m</italic>, where “
 <italic>C</italic>” is the concentration as derived from the calibration curve equation in mg/mL, “
 <italic>V</italic>” is the volume of the extract used in the assay in mL, and “
 <italic>m</italic>” is the mass of the extract used in the assay in “g.”
