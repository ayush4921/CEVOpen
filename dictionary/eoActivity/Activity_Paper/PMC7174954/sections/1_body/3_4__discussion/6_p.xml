<p>Hydrogen peroxide is an important reactive oxygen species (ROS) which has the ability to penetrate biological molecules and convert toxic to hydrophilic and breakdown to hydroxyl radical in the cell. However, the hydroxyl radical generated in the cell has been reported to induce breakage in DNA strand and chemical changes in the deoxyribose and nitrogenous bases; hence, hydroxyl radicals generated are degraded by the liver [

 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> exhibited a high percentage of hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging activity and this may be attributed to the higher flavonol, flavonoid, and proanthocyanidin contents in the wild plant compared to cultivated ones. This result is in agreement with the findings of Motlhanka [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], who reported that the cultivation has reduced antioxidant activity. It has been reported that drought and salt stress in a natural environment cause production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the plant resulting in an increased level of secondary metabolites, including phytochemicals. Hence, wild plants exhibited higher hydrogen peroxide radical inhibition [

 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> could be a reason to depend more on the wild species for therapy.
