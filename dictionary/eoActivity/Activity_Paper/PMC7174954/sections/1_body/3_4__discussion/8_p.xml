<p>The scavenging ability of the stable DPPH radical is widely used in evaluating the free radical scavenging ability of various compounds [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It was observed that DPPH radical scavenging potential in all solvent extracts and BHT significantly increased with increasing concentrations in both wild and cultivated plants. The research revealed that water extracts of the cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> exhibited significantly higher DPPH radical inhibition which may be due to the significantly higher phenolic compounds present in the water extracts of the cultivated plants. Similar results were reported by Masondo et al. [

 <italic>Bowiea volubilis</italic> in traditional medicine. The similarity in DPPH radical scavenging activity of acetone extracts of wild and cultivated plants in this study could be attributed to the presence of other bioactive agents capable of donating electrons. This result indicates the ethnopharmacological potential of cultivated
