<p>Significance difference in ABTS
 <sup>+</sup> inhibition observed in acetone and methanol extracts of wild 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> and methanol extracts of cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> at 0.025â€‰mg/mL may be due to the lesser phytoconstituent content in the cultivated plants. This study reflected the capacity of wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> to inhibit or quench free radicals. The ABTS radical scavenging potential exhibited by wild plant extracts could be attributed to polyphenolic compounds as earlier shown in the results. This agrees with several reports of plants which show antioxidant activity with ABTS [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The ability of the extracts to scavenge free radicals supports the folkloric use of the plant as a useful therapeutic agent for treating radical-related pathological damages. Also, it confirms the fact that cultivation of 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> did not affect the ability of the plant to inhibit free radicals.
