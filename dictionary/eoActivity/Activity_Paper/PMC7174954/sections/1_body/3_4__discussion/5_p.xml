<p>The nonsignificant difference observed in ferric reducing power of the methanol extracts of wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> might be to the high amount of phenolic content in the plants. Significantly higher ferric reducing power observed in acetone and water extracts of wild 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> at all concentrations may be due to the higher content of phytochemical in the wild plants. Several authors have reported that antioxidant activity expression is a consequence of the synergism between different phytochemical compounds and can be attributed to constituents [

 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> may be indicating the important role played by the environment, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, temperature, water stress, and mineral nutrient availability [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Amounts of phytochemical constituents found in both wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> correlated with antioxidant activity which confirms that they are contributing factors towards its antioxidant properties [
