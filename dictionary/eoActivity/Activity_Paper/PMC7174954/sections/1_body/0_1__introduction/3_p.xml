<p>Domestication of medicinal plants offers an excellent means of halting overexploitation [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As a conservation approach, 
 <italic>ex situ</italic> cultivation is becoming a key element of modern conservation strategies [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Unfortunately, medicinal plant users perceive cultivated plants as less potent compared to wild ones [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and lack of scientific evidence on the potency of cultivated medicinal plants remains a limiting factor. It is also reported that domestication of wild plants has to be done with extreme care because they may fail to synthesize the bioactive constituents following relocation [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Several studies have reported that the majority of pharmacologically important plant compounds are produced during defense mechanism when plants are subjected to stress and other secondary metabolites are produced due to the ability of plants to respond to chemical and physical stimuli [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. According to Bairu et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], plants that are growing outside their natural environments will thus not produce desired bioactive compounds; hence, there is a need to evaluate this claim. Zheng et al. [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also reported that the amount of phytochemicals in plants varies considerably from different ecological and climatic environments. No previous studies have been performed on the antioxidant and biological activities of 
 <italic>Alepidea amatymbica</italic> grown in the wild and under cultivated conditions. Therefore, this study evaluated and compared phytochemical and antioxidant activity of the wild and cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic>. The result of the study can provide useful information about the suitability of cultivated 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> rhizome as an alternative to wild species in terms of bioactive compounds.
