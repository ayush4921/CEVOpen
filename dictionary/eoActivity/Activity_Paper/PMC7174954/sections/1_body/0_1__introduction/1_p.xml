<p>The rhizomes of 
 <italic>Alepidea amatymbica</italic> are widely used for the treatment of various diseases because of their effectiveness due to the presence of the bioactive compounds. Some of the phytochemicals isolated from dried rhizome of 
 <italic>A. amatymbica</italic> include dehydro-16-kaurene-19-oic acid, 
 <italic>ent</italic>-16-kauren-19-oic acid, wedelia seco-kaurenolide, 313-acetoxy, phenolic acid, and rosmarinic acid [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Phytochemical compounds such as phenolic acid and flavonoids have health benefits, and they are an important part of human diet [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These compounds have been reported in many studies as free radical scavengers against superoxide, lipid peroxyl, and hydroxyl radicals [

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This, therefore, highlights many of their health-promoting functions as well as the prevention of diseases associated with oxidative damage of membranes, proteins, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The amount of polyphenolic constituents present in the plant affects its antioxidant activities [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Antioxidants are potential scavengers of free radicals in the body and protect the body against ill health and ravages of aging [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The use of natural antioxidants from plants has gained much attention as they are believed to be safer and have greater therapeutic activity than synthetic antioxidants [
