<p>Influenza A virus (IAV) from the family Orthomyxoviridae is understood to be the underlying cause for human and animal flu infections [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has an eight-segment negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, which codes several functional, structural, and nonstructural proteins, including PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NA, NP, M (1,2), and NS (1,2) (

 <xref rid="B2-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several antigenic drifts and shifts in its genetic structure, especially in HA and NA, have created different types and subtypes of this virus. Among them, three HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two NA (N1 and N2) subtypes have been responsible for human epidemics and pandemics for hundreds of years [
 <xref rid="B3-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These viral proteins play essential roles in viral life cycle steps including attachment and entry, synthesis of viral RNA and proteins, packaging, budding, and release [
