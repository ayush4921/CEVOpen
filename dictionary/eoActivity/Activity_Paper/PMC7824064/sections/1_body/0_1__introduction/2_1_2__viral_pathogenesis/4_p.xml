<p>Influenza infection has been shown to increase ROS production and decrease antioxidant levels in the host by dysregulation of T helper (Th)1/Th2 cytokine balance and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines production. After influenza infection, IFN-α/β, IFN-α, and IL-2 appear to have protective roles against influenza infection, while IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 seem to be involved in the inflammatory phase of the infection [
 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. IFN-α/β induces an antiviral state in cells by stimulating the transcription of genes coding for antiviral proteins such as 20,50-oligoadenylate synthetase (2–5 OAS), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, and the Mx proteins [
 <xref rid="B41-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The protein 20,50-oligoadenylate, produced by the activity of 2-5 OAS, activates cellular endoribonuclease, which is responsible for single-stranded viral and cellular RNA degradation [

 <xref rid="B43-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. IFNα/β also stimulates memory cells [
 <xref rid="B44-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. IFN-β, which is produced by Th1 and NK cells, stimulates macrophages and NK cell activity, upregulates the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, and controls immunoglobulin class switching [
 <xref rid="B45-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Meanwhile, IL-2, also produced by Th1, stimulates a rapid proliferation of T cells, which arrange many immunologic events to induce antibody responses [
 <xref rid="B46-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The IL-1 family includes of IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (Ra). IL-1α and IL-1β can induce fever, anorexia, hypotension, and sleepiness. IL-1Ra provides some protection against IL-1 by blocking the binding of IL-1 to its cell surface receptors [
 <xref rid="B47-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Because of its cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects, TNF-α plays a dual role (beneficial and harmful to the patient) during influenza infection. It is produced by several immune cells, including monocytes, NK, T, B, and neutrophils [
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In vitro TNF-α treatment leads to infectious virus decrease, viral protein synthesis inhibition, and cytopathic effect of virus reduction [
 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Systemic TNF-α administration produced fever and anorexia, which regulate body temperature and appetite. Other functions of TNF-α include induction of other cytokines (such as IL-1 and IL-6), induction of apoptosis in mature T cells and increased phagocytic activity [
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. IL-6, produced by lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells, is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates immune and acute phase responses and hemopoiesis through its involvement in T cell activation, growth and differentiation, as well as B cell differentiation [
