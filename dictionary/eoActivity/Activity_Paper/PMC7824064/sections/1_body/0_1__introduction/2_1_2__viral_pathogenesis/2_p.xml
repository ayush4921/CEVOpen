<p>Oda et al., 1989, indicated that oxygen radicals produced by the host’s delayed response affect the mortality of virus-infected mice and are important for the pathogenesis of influenza virus infection [

The effect of influenza virus on the pro-/antioxidant balance in the host cells has been investigated and the virus has been shown to be able to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pro-oxidant cytokines such as TNF from phagocytes [

 <sub>2</sub>-, which forms more reactive peroxynitrite, may be the most important pathogenic factors in influenza virus-induced pneumonia in mice [

The infected mice lung cells exhibited oxidative stress via enhanced superoxide and xanthine oxidase (XO) generation, as well as decreased capacity of small molecular antioxidants. Cytokines produced in the lungs may contribute to the systemic effects of influenza. ROS may activate viral replication via activation of NFκB, while oxidants decrease the CD4+ T cell count by inducing apoptosis in these cells [

Furthermore, it has been suggested that the influenza virus activates phagocytes by the generation of metabolites derived from superoxide (O2) and nitric oxide (NO) after interaction between the viral surface glycoproteins and the phagocyte’s plasma membrane. The virus may take advantage of these potentially virucidal metabolites to promote infection. Murphy et al., 1998, showed that experimental influenza virus infection increased oral NO, but not nasal exhaled NO levels, suggesting that NO does not directly contribute to the respiratory tract symptoms after infection with influenza A virus [
