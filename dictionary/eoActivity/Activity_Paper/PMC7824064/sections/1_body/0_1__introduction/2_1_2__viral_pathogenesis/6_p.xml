<p>It has been suggested that the cell cycle would be arrested under stress conditions by malondialdehyde (MDA), the endogenous product of lipid peroxidation. MDA can trigger p53 and p21 induction and may induce G1, S, and G2/M cell cycle arrest irreversibly [

Exposure of the vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) to HNE (the aldehyde component of oxidized low-density lipoprotein) causes mitogenesis by ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase activation, induction of c-fos and c-jun gene expression, as well as activator protein-1 (AP-1) activity. ERK is involved in cellular proliferation and differentiation, whereas JNK and p38 MAP kinases perform powerful responses to cellular stress such as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Activation of JNK induces apoptosis in response to stimulating cell proliferation and transformation, while c-fos and c-jun activate the transcription of several genes controlling cellular growth. AP-1, which is encoded by c-fos and c-jun, is also believed to regulate genes involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation. Indeed, HNE induces VSMC growth, which is consistent with other observations. These observations are consistent with the role of lipid peroxidation products in vascular smooth muscle cell growth [
