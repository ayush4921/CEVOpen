<p>The interactions between virus and host cell proteins are strong determinants of influenza A virus pathogenicity [

Once influenza virus gains access to the human respiratory tract, it attaches to and penetrates the epithelial cells via the HA protein and uses the host cell system for its replication. The newly emerging progeny viruses bud from cell membrane, are released with the assistance of NA, and infect adjacent epithelial cells. The NS1 protein inhibits IFN-I production in virus-infected cells by interfering with the RIG-I signaling pathway. Pulmonary macrophages then induce epithelial cell apoptosis, which is the underlying mechanism of viral pathogenesis and is mediated by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-DR6 in the infected lung cells. After shedding, it causes local inflammatory responses as well as systemic toxic symptoms such as high fever, pain, and a decreased white blood cells (WBC) count. The infected cells can also produce excessive interferon (IFN), which may be related to the systemic symptoms. However, no viremia has been reported [
