<p>Palamara et al., 2005, also showed that influenza A virus infection causes the activation of various MAPK pathways, such as the p38MAPK and JNK pathways, which play roles in the inflammatory and apoptotic responses, and the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, which results in nuclear transport of vRNPs. Phosphorylation events also play critical roles in virus penetration into the cell, efficient nuclear export of NP, and progeny viruses budding [

Among these, the imbalance of intracellular redox state plays an important role in modifying the activity of different signaling pathways. In particular, mild oxidative imbalance [
