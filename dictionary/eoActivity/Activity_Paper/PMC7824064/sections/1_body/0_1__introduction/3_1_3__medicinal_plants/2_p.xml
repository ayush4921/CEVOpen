<p>Natural active agents derived from medicinal plants often represent the most critical raw materials of lead compounds in pharmaceuticals. Although traditional societies have exploited medicinal plants to combat certain diseases, a crude extract dosage is not safe to prescribe, for two reasons: first, some phytochemicals may exist at toxic levels in crude extracts [
