<p>Quercetin (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a natural compound from the flavonoid family of the glycoside rutin [
 <xref rid="B75-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], which all share a similar flavone backbone (3-ringed molecule with OH groups attached). Several other substitutions have generated subclasses of flavonoids with different compounds within these subclasses. Quercetin has been isolated from more than 20 plant materials from the United States, European and Asian countries, and South Africa [
