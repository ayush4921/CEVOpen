<p>Quercetin and chlorogenic acid, potential lead compounds derived from traditional Chinese medicine, were tested in molecular docking against influenza A virus H1N1 (A/PR/8/34). They showed strong binding abilities (−10.23 and −11.05 kcal/mol for quercetin and chlorogenic acid, respectively) with NA of this virus, which were comparable with oseltamivir (−11.24 kcal/mol). To validate the NA inhibitory effect of these compounds in vitro, NA activity assay and cytopathic effect assay were carried out. The NA activity by quercetin and chlorogenic acid was almost fully inhibited under 50 µg/mL concentration and the viral cytopathic effect reduced significantly [
