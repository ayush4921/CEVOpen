<p>To verify the moderate antiviral activity of quercetin, the antiviral efficacy of flavonol glycosides isolated from 95% aqueous ethanol extract of the leaves of 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum piperitum</italic> was investigated against influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus in vitro. Several properties such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation, vasorelaxation, antibacterial, and antiviral have been proposed for this plant. The compounds quercetin 3-

 <italic>D</italic>-galactopyranoside, quercetin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside, and kaempferol 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-α-
 <italic>L</italic>-rhamnopyranoside were obtained by chromatographic separation, enriched in the ethyl acetate fraction as determine by biochemical activity. Plaque reduction and NA inhibitory assays were used to assess the antiviral activity, and NA activity decreased significantly in the presence of these compounds. Although their effect was not so strong as oseltamivir, they have the capacity as antiviral agents against the influenza A virus [
