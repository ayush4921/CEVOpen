<p>Shikimic acid, one of the primary components of oseltamivir, alone and in combination with quercetin were evaluated in comparison with oseltamivir in an in vitro model in terms of their ability to modulate the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 as immunomodulatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from six healthy volunteers were treated with different doses of shikimic acid with or without quercetin. The IL-8 and IL-6 expression levels were measured by means of ELISA. It was shown that shikimic acid alone was not able to modulate innate immunity in terms of antiviral activity. However, its combination with quercetin, even at low doses, effectively modulated innate immunity by increasing the IL-8 and IL-6 levels [
