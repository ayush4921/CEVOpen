<p>Quercetin has been reported to counteract influenza infection in the early stages by interacting with the HA2 subunit of influenza HA protein and inhibited virus-cell fusion. Quercetin exhibited an apparent inhibitory effect against both H1N1 and H3N2 virus strain infections in a dose-dependent manner. It showed IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 7.756 ± 1.097, 6.225 ± 0.467, and 2.738 ± 1.931 µg/mL against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), A/FM-1/47/1 (H1N1), and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2), respectively. It also reduced the HA mRNA transcription and NP protein synthesis in a dose-dependent manner in MDCK cells. A time-of-addition assay was performed to identify the effective stage by measuring HA mRNA and protein levels at the stages of virus entry (0–2 h), replication and translation (2–8 h), and/or release (8–10 h). The best performance was observed in the entry and whole life cycle steps including attachment, endocytosis, and fusion. It was more effective during the process of virus infection rather than postvirus infection and was more effective on virus particles rather than the host cell. The binding affinity between HA protein and quercetin was confirmed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay, which showed a medium-binding affinity of quercetin to HA protein, with a KD value of 1.14 × 10–3 µg/m. For further confirmation, the microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay was conducted, which showed that quercetin interacted with influenza HA protein in a dose-dependent manner. Using the pseudovirus-based drug screening system, quercetin also found to inhibit the entry of the H5N1 virus, which confirmed the specific interference with the function of the H5N1 influenza HA envelope protein [
