<p>Quercetin and oseltamivir were evaluated for their effect on the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling pathway in dendritic cells and macrophages infected with H1N1. Leukomonocytes were obtained from umbilical cord blood and harvested after stimulation using recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) and the recombinant human IL-4. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE) were infected with H1N1 and cocultured with the immunological cells, following which quercetin and oseltamivir were added into the medium. The expression levels of genes related to TLR7 pathway were determined by PCR. Quercetin and oseltamivir increased cell viability and inhibited the TLR7 signaling pathway induced by viral infection [
