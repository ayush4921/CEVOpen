<p>In a study by Kim et al., 2010, selected polyphenols, including quercetin, isoquercetin, quercetin 3-glucoside, resveratrol, rutin (quercetin-3-rutinoside), quercetin-3-galactoside, quercetin 3-rhamnoside, kaempferol, luteolin, fisetin, catechin, epigallocatechin (EGC), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were tested for their antiviral activity against influenza A and B H1N1 viruses (A/swine/OH/511445/2007 (H1N1) and human A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), as well as human influenza B virus (B/Lee/40). The 
 <italic>Hypericum perforatum</italic> and 
 <italic>Equisetum arvense</italic> L. extracts were tested in parallel and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thereby confirming the presence of quercetin and isoquercetin. In accordance with previously described findings, isoquercetin inhibited the replication of both influenza A and B viruses at the lowest 50% effective concentration (EC50). Isoquercetin, in combination with amantadine, exhibited synergistic effects on viral replication reduction in vitro, as well as suppressing the emergence of the resistant virus [

 <italic>Capparis sinaica</italic> Veill methanol extract was tested for antiviral activity against H5N1 using plaque inhibition assay in MDCK cells. The polyphenol-rich extract showed 100% inhibition of viral activity at 1 Âµg/mL concentration. Using bioactivity-guided fractionation, the fractions eluted with ethyl acetate and 25% methanol in ethyl acetate were found to possess antiviral activity. Chromatographic separation of these fractions confirmed the isolation of quercetin, isoquercetin, and rutin from this species, which showed a reduction in the virus titer by 68.13%, 79.66%, and 73.22% at concentration of 1 ng/mL, respectively [
