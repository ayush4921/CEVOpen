<p>Autophagy is one of the pathways that is essential for the host cell to remove unnecessary or dysfunctional components by degrading and recycling cellular components [

 <xref rid="B115-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. However, it has been shown that influenza A virus is able to inhibit autophagy [
 <xref rid="B119-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>], which causes the accumulation of autophagosomes by blocking autophagosome maturation and union with lysosomes using ion channel M2 protein, which is necessary for fusion [

 <xref rid="B120-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Therefore, managing this process can inhibit IAV proliferation and may be a strategy for developing new anti-IAV agents.
