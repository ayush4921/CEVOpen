<p>The inhibitory effect of Epimedium koreanum Nakai toward influenza A/PR/8/34 was shown by reduction in cell death and viral titer by nearly 1.8-fold at 24 h postinfection (hpi) in RAW264.7 cells. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> of the extract in these cells was 14.6 ± 1.68 µg/mL and EC50, determined by infection with PR8-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (MOI =1.0) and measuring the GFP expression at 24 hpi with the GloMax-Multi Detection System, was 0.94 ± 0.23 µg/mL. The high SI value (15.5) supported promising prophylactic or therapeutic potential of the extract, which stimulated the immune cells and induced high levels of cytokines such as IFN-β and IL-6, which mediate the antiviral state in the cells. In addition, treatment of cells with this extract upregulated the phosphorylation of key signaling molecules in the type I IFNs and NF-κB pathways; IRF-3, STAT1, TBK1, p65, as well as p38 and ERK, which are involved in controlling viral infection. The phosphorylation of these molecules was comparable to that obtained with LPS treatment, a potent stimulator of TLR4. The transcriptional levels of various antiviral genes, including Mx1, IFN-β, P56, IRFs, GBP-1, PML, IL-6, OAS-16, ISG-15, and ISG-56, were also upregulated by treatment with this extract [
