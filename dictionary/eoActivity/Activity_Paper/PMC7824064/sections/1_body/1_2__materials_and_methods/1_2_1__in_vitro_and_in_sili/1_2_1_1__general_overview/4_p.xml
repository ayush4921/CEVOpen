Among these, isorhamnetin showed the most potent antiviral activity, but, quercetin, which was tested in different periods, also caused suppression of influenza virus-induced cell death. They evaluated the effects of isorhamnetin and quercetin both in 50 ÂµM concentration in pre- and cotreatments. In a virus yield reduction assay, quercetin led to a significant decrease in virus titer [
