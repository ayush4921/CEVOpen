<p>Recent studies have described the therapeutic effect of quercetin and derivatives acting against influenza virus. Choi et al., 2009, showed that quercetin 3-rhamnoside (Q3R) isolated from Houttuynia cordata has antiviral activity against influenza A/WS/33 virus in vitro [

 <italic>Schinopsis brasiliensis</italic> plant, typically found in the northeastern Brazil, are widely used for the treatment of health disorders including influenza, diarrhea, and inflammation [

 <xref rid="B92-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MSE) allowed the identification of 33 compounds in 
 <italic>S. brasiliensis</italic>, including corilagin, chlorogenic acid, and quercetin derivatives, which may contribute to its antiviral activity [

 <italic>Tetrastigma hemsleyanum</italic> Diels et Gilg, a widely used medicinal plant in China, was characterized against the recombinant influenza virus PR8-NS1-Gluc in MDCK cells with Gaussia luciferase viral titer assay. Quercetin and isoquercetin were clarified among the constituents using UPLC coupled with hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-Exactive/MS) [
