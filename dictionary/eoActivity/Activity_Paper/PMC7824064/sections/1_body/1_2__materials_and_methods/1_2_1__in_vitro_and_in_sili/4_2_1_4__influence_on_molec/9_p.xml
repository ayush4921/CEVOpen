<p>In a recent study, in vitro biochemical and toxicological evaluation was performed to evaluate the effect of quercetin 3-glucoside, isolated from 
 <italic>Dianthus superbus</italic> L and verified by spectroscopic analysis, against influenza A and B virus infection. This plant is a well-known traditional herbal medicine used by ancient Mongolian and Chinese for its anti-inflammatory properties [

 <sub>50</sub>s at 4.93, 6.43, 9.94, 8.3, and 7.1 µg/mL toward A/PR/8/34, A/Victoria/3/75, A/WS/33, B/Maryland/1/59, and B/Lee/40, respectively. Quercetin 3-glucoside blocked influenza A/PR/8/34 replication in a time-dependent assay (−2 and −1 h before infection; at the time of infection; and 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 15, and 24 h after infection) and decreased expression of the related genes M, Atg-5, and LC3-β. Virus-induced ROS production was reduced by quercetin 3-glucoside. It significantly decreased autophagy, detected by Acridine Orange (AO) staining, by blocking virus infection-induced acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) [
