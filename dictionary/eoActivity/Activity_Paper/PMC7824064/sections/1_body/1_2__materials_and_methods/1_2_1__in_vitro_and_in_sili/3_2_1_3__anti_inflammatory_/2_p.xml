<p>The potential radical scavenging capacity, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-NA properties of 13 compounds, isolated from Chaenomeles speciosa, was evaluated. 
 <italic>Chaenomeles speciosa</italic> (Sweet) Nakai is a traditional herb in China. Its dried fruit is widely used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, prosopalgia, and hepatitis, as well as being used as an appetizer. Studies have confirmed the presence of glycosides, flavones, phenolics, tannins, and organic acids in this fruit, including quercetin. Quercetin showed significant dose-dependent DPPH radical scavenging activity, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 3.82 µg/mL. Along with other compounds, it also inhibited the NO production by more than 25% at a 5 µg/mL dose. It could inhibit the production of TNF-α by 33.14% compared with the control (
