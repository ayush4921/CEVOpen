<p>The anti-influenza activity of preparations of compounds with antioxidant and/or antihypoxant properties, such as hypoxene, reduced glutathione, dihydroquercetin, Trolox, coenzyme Q10, and the enzymatic preparation of superoxide dismutase, alone or in combination with rimantadine, was investigated with respect to influenza A (H3N2) infection in cultures of chorioallantoic membranes of chicken embryos and in MDCK cells. The antiviral activity of the aforementioned preparations was assessed by monitoring inhibition of the virus cytopathogenic effects on the cells. Among these preparations, free radical scavengers, including coenzyme Q10, Trolox, quercetin, and the enzymatic preparation superoxide dismutase, did not show protective effect and in some cases, even enhanced the production of viral particles and decreased the antiviral action of rimantadine [
