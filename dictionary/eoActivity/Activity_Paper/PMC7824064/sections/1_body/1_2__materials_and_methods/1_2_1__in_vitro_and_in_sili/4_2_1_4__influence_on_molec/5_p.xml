<p>Influenza virus polymerase consists of PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits and plays an essential role in viral RNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="B121-biomolecules-11-00010" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. It has been suggested as a target for influenza drugs, as it is highly structurally conserved across different influenza virus types and strains [

 <italic>Dianthus superbus</italic> is a medicinal plant used in Mongolia and China for its anti-inflammatory properties. The quercetin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside, isolated by structural elucidation by means of 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR, was evaluated for efficacy against virus-induced symptoms, ROS production, and autophagy induction. MDCK cell line was infected with influenza viruses A and B (A/Vic/3/75 (H3N2), A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), B/Maryland/1/59, B/Lee/40) and subjected to time-dependent assays, including pre- and postincubation with quercetin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values obtained were 6.61, 3.1, 5.17, and 8.19 Âµg/mL, respectively. Quercetin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside reduced ROS and autophagy formation by affecting cellular pathways but not the virus particles directly. Molecular docking analysis showed an inhibitory effect of quercetin-7-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucoside on viral RNA polymerase by occupying the binding site of m7GTP on viral PB2 protein [
