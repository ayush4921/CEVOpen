<p>The effect of quercetin-3-O-β-D-glucuronide isolated from Polygonum perfoliatum L., a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal plant, was investigated on influenza A virus in infected mice. A practical, specific, sensitive, reproducible, and accurate HPLC coupled with diode array detector (HPLC–DAD) method was developed to quantify quercetin-3-
