<p>Confirming their previous in vitro results, Choi et al., 2012 evaluated the effect of quercetin 3-rhamnoside (Q3R) on influenza A/WS/33 virus-infected mice. The mice were orally treated with Q3R (6.25 mg/kg per dose) at 2 h before and once daily after influenza virus infection for 6 days. They exhibited a significant decrease in weight loss, necrosis, inflammation, and mortality, while their lung virus titers at 6 days after infection were about 2000 times lower than placebo-treated control mice and two times lower than oseltamivir-treated mice. The administration of Q3R delayed the development and progression of pulmonary lesions, which was confirmed with histological evaluation. They introduced Q3R as an attractive lead for the development of antiviral agents against influenza virus [
