<p>The therapeutic effects of quercetin and derivatives have been evaluated in animal models as well as humans and have been studied from different aspects. One of the first in vivo studies on quercetin was conducted by EÅŸanu et al., 1981, who investigated the effect of aqueous extract of propolis, containing rutin and quercetin, on the experimental infection of mice with influenza virus A/PR8/34 (H1N1). When the extract was administered, 3 h after virus inoculation but not preinfection, the HA titers in the lung suspensions were reduced, and a slight decrease in mortality and an increase in survival length was observed [

The protective effect of quercetin was investigated during influenza virus-induced oxidative stress in adult male Swiss albino mice infected with influenza virus (A/Hong Kong/8/68). The mice were infected intranasally with 75 HA units of virus under anesthetic conditions and quercetin was administered orally at 1 mg/mL. The pathological effects were evaluated on day 8 postinfection. Upon assessment of lipid peroxidation and superoxide production, lipid peroxidation showed an increase in virus-infected mice, which decreased after administration of quercetin. Antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase decreased in the lungs of virus-infected mice, detected by SOD enzyme assay and catalase assay, but increased in quercetin-treated mice at the same level as in the control group. It concludes that quercetin was effective in ameliorating the oxidative stress induced during influenza virus infection [

Alveolar macrophages were obtained from the lung and superoxide radical production was assessed using nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay. The level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) was measured by TBARS and a significant decrease was observed in LPO levels after quercetin administration compared to untreated influenza infection [
