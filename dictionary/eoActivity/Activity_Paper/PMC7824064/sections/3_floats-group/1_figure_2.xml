  <p>Schematic of the influenza virus life cycle and the pathways affected by quercetin and its derivatives. Influenza virus uses Hemagglutinin (HA) receptor for binding and entry. Membrane 2 (M2) ion channel facilitates fusion and uncoating, and neuraminidase activity (NA) induces the release of progeny virus. Quercetin and its derivatives impact different steps of viral life cycle, such as binding, uncoating, mRNA synthesis, negative-strand synthesis, assembly, and release. They can also affect cytoplasm events to influence the virus indirectly.</p>
