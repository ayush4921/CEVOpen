<p>Chemotherapy following surgical excision is the most popular method for gastric cancer therapy, but chemotherapy options are limited due to the fact that these treatments kill not only cancer cells but also normal cells by inducing toxicity and apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, many researchers around the world have carried out studies to develop safe reagents that can target cancer cells and induce little damage to normal cells. Naturally occurring compounds have the potential to treat cancer patients [

 <italic>Commiphora mukul</italic>, has been used as a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonist to treat obesity, lipid metabolism dysfunction, hypothyroidism, inflammation, and arthritis [
