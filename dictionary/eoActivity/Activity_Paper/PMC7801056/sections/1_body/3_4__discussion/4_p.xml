<p>We also found that the normal gastric cell GES-1 was resistant to z-guggulsterone-induced cell death. Z-guggulsterone treatment did not significantly inhibit cell growth or promote apoptosis in GES-1 cells. There were no changes in mitochondrial-related active caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax protein expression, or in TNF-

 <italic>β</italic>1 level, in GES-1 cells with z-guggulsterone treatment. Thus, our findings showed that when compared with gastric cancer cells, normal gastric mucosa cells were less affected by z-guggulsterone, similar to results obtained in colon cancer [
