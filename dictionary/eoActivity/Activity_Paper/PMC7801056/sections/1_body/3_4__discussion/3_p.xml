<p>The accumulated data have shown that the potential anticancer activity of z-guggulsterone is related to the induction of apoptosis. More specifically, z-guggulsterone altered the Bcl-2 family proteins and regulates FXR, NF-

Here, we showed that z-guggulsterone exerted cytotoxicity on gastric cancer cells through inhibition of FXR signaling. Moreover, the mitochondrial intrinsic apoptosis pathway also participated in the chemotherapy process of z-guggulsterone in gastric cancer.
