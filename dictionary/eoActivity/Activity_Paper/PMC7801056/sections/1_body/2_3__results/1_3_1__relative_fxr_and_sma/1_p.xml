<p>We analyzed FXR expression level in gastric cancer cells. The expression of FXR was significantly higher in SGC-7901 cells comparing with that in normal gastric GES-1 cells (

We then analyzed the expression of SHP in gastric cancer cells. The result showed a higher expression of SHP in SGC-7901 cells when compared to that in normal gastric cells (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and z-guggulsterone significantly suppressed the expression of SHP in SGC-7901 cells (
