<p>To determine whether mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway was involved in z-guggulsterone-induced SGC-7901 cell apoptosis, expression levels of active caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 were investigated. Z-guggulsterone dose-dependently increased the expression of active caspase-3 in SGC-7901 cells (
