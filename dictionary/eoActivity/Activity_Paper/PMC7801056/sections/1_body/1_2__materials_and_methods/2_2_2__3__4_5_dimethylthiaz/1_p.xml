<p>MTT assay was performed to evaluate the cell viability after the treatment of z-guggulsterone. Cells were plated in a 96-well plate (1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well) and incubated with 0, 15, 50, and 75 
 <italic>µ</italic>M z-guggulsterone for 24 h. The results were determined at 490 nm under an ELISA microplate reader (iMark™; Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA).
