<p>Western blotting was used to detect protein expression as previously described [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In brief, cells were collected in lysis A buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Beyotime, China). A total of 30 
 <italic>μ</italic>g of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to PVDF membranes, and kept in incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The list of primary antibodies was as follows: mouse anti-FXR (#sc-25309, 1 : 750; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-SHP (#sc-2305, 1 : 750; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Bcl-2 (#ab32124, 1 : 500; Abcam), anti-Bax (#ab182733, 1 : 500; Abcam, USA), and mouse anti-
 <italic>β</italic>-actin (#A1978, 1 : 100; Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Bands in the membranes were determined with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher, USA).
