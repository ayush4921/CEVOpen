  <p>Z-guggulsterone, an FXR antagonist, exhibited cytotoxicity in SGC-7901 cells. (a) Cells were incubated with 0 and 50 
   <italic>µ</italic>M z-guggulsterone. FXR and SHP protein levels were assessed by western blotting. Quantification of protein bands are shown in the bottom panels. 
   <italic>β</italic>-Actin was used as a control. Data are expressed as means ± SD.
