<p>In order to induce diabetes, fifty male rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (60 mg/kg BW, i.p.) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), which was dissolved in citrate acid buffer (pH 4.5). Ten male rats in the normal control group received only citrate buffer. After 72 h, fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels were checked using glucometer (Accu-Chek Performa, Roche). Rats with FBG levels higher than 200 mg/dl were used and divided into five groups: (I) DM control, (II) DM+CCM 0.1 g/kg, (III) DM+CCM 0.5 g/kg, (IV) DM+CCM 1.0 g/kg, and (V) DM+sildenafil 5 mg/kg. CCM were weighted and blended thoroughly with a blender and were given by daily oral gavage for 3 weeks. Sildenafil citrate was given only one time 30 min before mating behaviour test.</p>
