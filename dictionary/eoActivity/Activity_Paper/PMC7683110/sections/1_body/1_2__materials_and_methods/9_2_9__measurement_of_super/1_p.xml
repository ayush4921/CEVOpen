 <italic>v</italic>), pH 7.2 (containing 1 mM EGTA, 70 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES, and 210 mM mannitol). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,500 g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4°C for 15 min. The SOD activity in the sample was then processed according to the manufacturer's instructions and determined by a microplate reader with the absorbance at 450 nm.
