<p>For prevention of pregnancy, female rats were subjected to bilateral oophorectomy surgery before beginning the sexual function assessment. Each adult female rat was anaesthetized by 1.5-2.0% isoflurane (Piramal Critical Cares, Inc., USA) combined with oxygen. The lower abdominal skin and muscle were opened vertically 1 cm, and the uterine horn was pulled out and ligated before removal of the ovary, one at a time. The uterine horn was returned to the peritoneal cavity, and the wound was closed in two layers (abdominal muscle and skin) using sterile sutures. The skin was then disinfected with povidone iodine and covered with Fixomull Stretch®. Each rat received an intramuscular tramadol (5 mg/kg) to ameliorate postoperative pain and allowed at least two weeks for full recovery. The ovariectomized female rats were artificially brought into oestrus phase by the administration of estradiol (0.025 mg/kg) and progesterone (1 mg/kg) at 48 and 4 hours before mating, respectively.</p>
