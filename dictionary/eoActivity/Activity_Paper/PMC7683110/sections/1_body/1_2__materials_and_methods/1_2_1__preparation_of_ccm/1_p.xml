 <italic>Cordyceps militaris</italic> was obtained from the Department of Agriculture (DOA) in Thailand. CCM was prepared at the Department of Agricultural Science, Faculty of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment, Naresuan University. In brief, the mycelia were cultivated with modified of potato dextrose agar (MPDA) medium under stable conditions at 22°C for 2 weeks. The resultant culture was transferred to potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium, which was then incubated on rotary shaker at 22°C for 2 weeks before transferring the mycelium to sterilized rice cultured medium that contained white rice and silkworm pupae. The fruiting bodies with the inoculums were kept in 12 : 12 h light-dark at 18°C, 60-70% humidity until the mycelium had transformed into the fruiting bodies primordia. Then, the flasks were maintained at 22°C, 80-90% humidity for 64 days before the fruiting bodies had been reaped and immediately frozen at -20°C until used.
