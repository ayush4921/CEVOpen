<p>Concentrations of TBARS in testes tissues were measured according to the method of Ohkawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with some modifications. Testicular tissue was homogenized (10% 
 <italic>w</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>), in ice-cold 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged at 4,000 g, 4°C for 15 min. Sample supernatant (100 
 <italic>μ</italic>l) was added into the vial containing 1,500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 20% acetic acid (pH 3.5), 200 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 8.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), and 1,500 
 <italic>μ</italic>l of 0.8% of thiobarbituric acid (TBA). The mixture was incubated for 60 min at 95°C and immediately cooled on ice, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 3 min. The resulting supernatant was then used as the enzyme source for the determination of the malondialdehyde (MDA) level by the optical density (OD) measurement of the pink complex at 532 nm. MDA values were calculated using tetramethylpiperidine (TMP) as a standard curve and expressed as nmol/mg of protein that determined absorbance at a wavelength of 562 nm. Protein level was measured using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
