<p>After completion of mating test, each male rat was anaesthetized with 2-2.5% isoflurane combination with oxygen. The ventilation rate, pulse rate, temperature, and heart rate were monitored via PhysioSuite® (Kent Scientific, USA). The carotid artery of rat was cannulated to measure mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by using PowerLab® (AD Instruments, Australia). The penile skin was removed, and a polyethylene tube was inserted with heparinized saline via a 22
 <italic>-</italic>gauge needle for measuring intracavernosal pressure (ICP). The lower abdomen was opened exposing the cavernous nerve, which was then stimulated via a copper bipolar electrode connected to the PowerLab®. The cavernous nerve was stimulated by electrostimulation, starting from 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to 10 volts at a frequency of 20 Hz for 60 sec for each voltage. The results were recorded by LabChart (version 7.3.7; AD Instruments, Australia) connected to a computer. Since electrostimulation slightly lowered MAP, ICP was normalized by MAP as ICP/MAP. Upon completion of experiment, rats were euthanized, and their penis and left testis were immediately collected and stored at -80°C for further analysis. The relative weights of penis and testis were calculated by the following formula: (weightofpenisorlefttestis/bodyweight) × 100.
