<p>SOD is a necessary antioxidant enzyme which maintains body reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, SOD levels were measured from the testicular tissues, and the result of disclosed SOD activity in the DM control group was significantly reduced when compared with the normal control group. Interestingly, the SOD levels in the DM+CCM (0.1, 0.5, and 1â€‰g/kg) and DM+Sildenafil groups were significantly augmented when compared with the DM group (

Since CCM administration increased the SOD activity while decreased MDA levels in the testicular tissue, it seems that the treatment with CCM moderates testicular tissue damage in diabetic rats possibly through its antioxidant properties [
