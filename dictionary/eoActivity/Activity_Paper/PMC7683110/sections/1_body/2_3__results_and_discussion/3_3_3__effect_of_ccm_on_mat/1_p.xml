<p>Many studies have reported diabetes can lead to reduce sexual motivation. In the present study, the results of male mating behaviour showed that all males displayed mounts and intromissions and all females responded with lordosis to every mount received under experimental conditions. Diabetes induced a significant reduction in sexual motivation and mating behaviour. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, decreased sexual activity was found in diabetic rats as a decrease in MF, IF, and EF and increase in ML and IL were observed in these rats. This observation was consistent with the study of Escrig [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Minaz [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Treatment with CCM (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) or sildenafil restored the sexual function in diabetic rats, as evident by an increase in IF and a decrease in ML and IL compared to DM control rats. However, the result of EF in diabetic rats treated with CCM 1.0 g/kg which was not different from DM control remained equivocal. In view of this, CCM treatment could be beneficial in reducing the deleterious effect of diabetes on sexual functions, and sildenafil can also enhance sexual motivation and function in diabetic rats.
