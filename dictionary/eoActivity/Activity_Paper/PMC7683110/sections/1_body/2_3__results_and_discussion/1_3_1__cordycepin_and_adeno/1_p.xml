<p>Many species of Cordyceps are being cultivated in artificial medium for their medicinal and pharmaceutical properties. Cordycepin, a derivative of the nucleoside adenosine, has been shown to be the first and is the main active constituent isolated from 
 <italic>Cordyceps</italic> sp. [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In this study, we performed an analysis of bioactive compounds and found that the adenosine and cordycepin contents in CCM were 1,166.59 ± 22.89mg/kg and 4,799.32 ± 9.22mg/kg, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This amount of cordycepin is relatively similar to that cultured in silk worm pupae medium (4.17 ± 1.66mg/g) and higher than that obtained in brown rice medium (2.98 ± 1.41mg/g), as reported by Kang et al. [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, cordycepin production could yield with a maximum of about 445 mg/l, when CM was cultured in submerged conditions [
