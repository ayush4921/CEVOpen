<p>Nitric oxide (NO), produced either by nerves or by endothelium, plays an important role in the relaxation of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle and vasculature [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In this study, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity was measured from penile tissue after completion of ICP measurement (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). A statistically significant decrease in penile NOS activity was observed in diabetic rats compared to the normal control group. The result of NOS measured from penile tissue of diabetic rats in DM+CCM (0.1 and 0.5 g/kg) significantly increased, while increased level of NOS in the DM+CCM 1 g/kg was not evident. The increase in max ICP/MAP and NOS levels was observed in this study, which might be due to the cordycepin, which is analogues of adenosine, and has been shown to stimulate in vitro and in vivo steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig cells through the activation, at least, of the protein kinase A pathway [

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] indicated that adenosine may contribute to penile erection through the activation of adenosine receptors, A
 <sub>2A</sub> and A
 <sub>2B</sub> receptors, as observed in mouse corpus cavernosum. Accumulating evidence indicates the role of adenosine in penile erection as reviewed by Phatarpekar [
