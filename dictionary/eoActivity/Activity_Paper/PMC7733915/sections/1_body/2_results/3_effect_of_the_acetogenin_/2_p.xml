<p>A significant increase (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in prostate weight and relative prostate weight was observed in the group that received the hormone alone when compared to the normal control, also validating that prostate hyperplasia was induced. A significant decrease (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in prostate weight, as well as relative prostate weight, was observed in the group treated with the acetogenin fraction when compared to the untreated rats (TP group). This indicated a remedial effect of the plant material on the induced BPH. Also, there was no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) in prostate and relative prostate weights between the test rats and those treated with the reference drug (TP + Dutasteride group)
