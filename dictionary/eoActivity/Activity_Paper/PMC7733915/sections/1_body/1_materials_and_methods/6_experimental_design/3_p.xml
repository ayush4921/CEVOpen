 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. BPH was induced in the rats by subcutaneous injection of testosterone propionate (3 mg/kg body weight, dissolved in olive oil) for 28 days [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Successful induction of BPH was ascertained by testing PSA level of the rats on the 29th day. Then oral administration of the acetogenin-rich fraction dissolved in DMSO/H
 <sub>2</sub>O (0.5: 9.5 v/v) was done for one week. On the last day of the experiment (day 36th), the animals were fasted, weighed using a sensitive balance and bled by cardiac puncture. Blood samples were collected in plain sample bottles and centrifuged (3000 g for 15 min) for the separation of serum. The prostates were excised, washed with cold saline solution, dried with adsorbent paper and weighed on sensitive balance. One prostate per group was selected and a section of the dorsolateral lobe was processed for histology. The remaining prostates were used for biochemical analyses. Relative prostate weight of the rats was calculated using the method of Kalu
