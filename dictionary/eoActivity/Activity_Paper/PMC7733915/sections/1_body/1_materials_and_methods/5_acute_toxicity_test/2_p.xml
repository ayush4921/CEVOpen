<p>The median lethal dose (LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of AFAL was determined according to the method of Lorke [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Thirteen BALB/c albino mice weighing 20–22 g were used for the LD
 <sub>50</sub>. They were purchased from the Veterinary Medicine Department, University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The mice were kept in standard cages at the average ambient temperature of 26 ± 1°C, 12 h light −12 h dark cycle and were fed commercial mice chow and tap water 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. In stage one, the animals were placed in three different groups of three mice each and were administered graded oral doses of 10, 100 and 1000 mg/kg body weight respectively of AFAL dissolved in a mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and H
 <sub>2</sub>O (in the ratio of 0.5: 9.5 v/v). Then in stage two, three mice were placed in three different groups and were orally administered 1600, 2900 and 5000 mg/kg body weight of the dissolved AFAL, while one mouse served as control. The mice were observed for toxicity signs and possible death in each group within 24 h of administration for the lethal dose determination. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of AFAL was obtained at 2900 mg/kg body weight which was considered safe and, based on this, doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg were selected for the experiment.
