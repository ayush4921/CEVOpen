<p>It has been shown from previous studies that acetogenin fraction obtained by column chromatography of ethanol extract of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> leaves contains predominantly annonaceous acetogenins [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]; however, the presence of little amount of flavonoid has equally been detected in the fraction [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].
