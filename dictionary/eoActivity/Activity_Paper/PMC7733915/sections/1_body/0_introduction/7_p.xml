<p>Annonaceous acetogenins are the major constituents of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> and many pharmacological activities of the plant have been attributed to these bioactive constituents [
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15â€“17</xref>]. In this study, the effect of acetogenin-rich fraction of 
 <italic>A. muricata</italic> leaves was investigated on testosterone propionate-induced BPH in Wistar rats through the measurement of antioxidant indices and some other biochemical parameters including prostate-specific antigen, prostate weight, relative prostate weight and prostate protein content.
