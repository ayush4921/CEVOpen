<p>The results of this study confirmed that acetogenin-rich fraction isolated from 
 <italic>Annona muricata</italic> leaves could alleviate BPH induced in Wistar rats. At the dose of 200â€…mg/kg, the extract clearly reversed the effect of the supernormal dose of testosterone propionate on the Wistar rats. Enhanced antioxidant system may be one of the mechanisms through which the plant material was able to exert its effect on the induced BPH. Therefore, acetogenin-rich fraction from 
 <italic>Annona muricata</italic> leaves may be useful in the management of BPH.
