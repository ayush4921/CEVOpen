<p>Dutasteride is a known potent BPH drug whose mechanism of action is specific for the inhibition of 5α-reductase [
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This was evident in this study where the drug obviously exhibited a higher ameliorative effect in BPH markers (PSA levels, prostate weight, relative prostate weight and prostate protein content) compared to AFAL, though the differences were not statistically significant. However, superior antioxidant capacity of rats treated with AFAL (200 mg/kg dose) compared to the standard drug is notable. This suggests that reinforcement of the antioxidant system could be one of the possible mechanisms through which the plant material was able to attenuate the induced BPH. Further studies, however, are recommended to elucidate other possible mechanisms of action of this plant material on BPH.
