<p>These studies’ findings indicated that DCA and its derivative compound 
 <bold>4</bold> could be new dual inhibitors of SMS activity and Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> aggregation. DCA was recently reported to inhibit the aggregation of Aβ
 <sub>40</sub> [
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], similar to our findings that DCA inhibits the aggregation of Aβ
 <sub>42</sub>. Furthermore, SAR studies of the ability of a terpenoid containing a benzopyran moiety to inhibit both SMS activity and Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> aggregation suggested that benzoic acid and hydrophobic long alkyl chains are essential for both activities (
