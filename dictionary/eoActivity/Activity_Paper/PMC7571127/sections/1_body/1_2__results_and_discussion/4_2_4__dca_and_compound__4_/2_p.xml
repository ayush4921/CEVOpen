<p>Natural products are a source of potential pharmacological agents with an abundance of novel chemical entities with various biological activities. The goal of our study is to identify potent SMS inhibitors from a natural source. In this study, we found that DCA (
 <bold>1</bold>), which is isolated from a 
 <italic>Rhododendron dauricum</italic>, is a potent SMS inhibitor. Leaves of 
 <italic>Rhododendron dauricum</italic> are reported as anti-HIV, used for the treatment of many diseases, and are also involved in cell proliferation, as well as being one of the well-known, practically used Chinese traditional medicines. DCA (
 <bold>1</bold>) itself possesses several biological activities, popularly anti-HIV and antibacterial, but its molecular mechanisms have not yet been examined. To completely understand the pharmalogical behavior of DCA (
 <bold>1</bold>) with sphingomyelin synthase enzyme, a series of DCA derivatives 
 <bold>2</bold>–
 <bold>6</bold> and (−) hongoquercin A (
 <bold>7</bold>) were synthesized to evaluate functional group participation in the enzyme inhibiton. Structures of isolated and all synthesized compounds were analyzed using various spectroscopic methods such as UV, IR, ESI-MS, and optical rotation for synthesized compounds. Compounds with SMS inhibition properties against cell-based assays and the fluorescent substrate C6-NBD (4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)-Cer share a carboxylic acid moiety which is also related to anti-aggregative properties against amyloid beta protein. MSHTS assays were used to evaluate amyloid beta aggregation activity using DCA and their derivatives. DCA (
 <bold>1</bold>) and compound 
 <bold>4</bold> with the presence of a carboxylic acid group tend to inhibit both SMS and Aβ aggregation inhibition. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first report on daurichromenic acid and derivatives of DCA and compound 
 <bold>4</bold> as a dual inhibitor for sphingomyelin synthase and amyloid beta aggregation.
