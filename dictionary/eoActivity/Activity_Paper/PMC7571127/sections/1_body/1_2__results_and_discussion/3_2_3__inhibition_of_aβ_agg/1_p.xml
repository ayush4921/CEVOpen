<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a multifactorial disease, which is believed to be caused by complex interactions among several contributing patho-mechanisms. The ability of DCA and its derivatives, along with other natural compounds, ginkgolic acids (
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04077-f002">Figure 2</xref>) and malabaicone A–C (
 <bold>10</bold>, 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>12</bold>), to inhibit Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> aggregation was evaluated by microtiter-scale high-throughput screening (MSHTS) assays [

 <xref rid="B28-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were measured from inhibition curves, in which the percent SDs of fluorescence intensities were plotted against the concentration of each compound (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04077-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Here, 30 nM quantum dot amyloid beta (QDAβ) and 30 µM of Aβ were incubated with different concentrations to evaluate the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of all derivatives. DCA and its derivative compound 
 <bold>4</bold> showed relatively potent inhibition activities, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 57 and 74 μM, respectively, similar to the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of rosmarinic acid (60 μM) [
 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The inhibitory activities of hongoquercin A (
 <bold>7</bold>) and ginkgolic acids (
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>) for Aβ aggregation were lower, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 150–300 μM. The inhibitory activities of the other cyclized DCAs and malabaricones were lower (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-04077">Figure S2</xref>). These results indicate that DCA, a terpenoid containing a benzopyran moiety, is a candidate inhibitor of Aβ aggregation, and that the carboxylic acid group on aromatics and hydrophobic long alkyl chains may be required for this activity.
