<p>The identity of DCA (

 <italic>Rhododendron dauricum</italic> was confirmed by 
 <sup>1</sup>H- and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and compared with previously reported values [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To understand the structureâ€“activity relationship (SAR) between DCA and its target molecules, DCA derivatives were synthesized. Compound (
 <bold>2</bold>) was prepared from DCA by selective methyl esterification of its carboxylic acid moiety by TMS-CH
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub>. Compound (
 <bold>3</bold>) was prepared by protecting the carboxylic acid and hydroxy groups with iodomethane, and compound (
 <bold>4</bold>) was prepared by hydrolysis of the methyl ester group of compound (
 <bold>3</bold>). Subsequently, hongoquercin A (

 <bold>2</bold>) was treated with FeCl
 <sub>3</sub> to obtain the cyclized derivative compound 5 (
