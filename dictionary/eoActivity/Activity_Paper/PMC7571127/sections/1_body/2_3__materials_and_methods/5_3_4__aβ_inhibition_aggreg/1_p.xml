<p>The aggregation inhibitory activities of plant extracts, fractions, DCA, DCA derivatives, and naturally occurring SMS inhibitors (compounds 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>9</bold>, and 
 <bold>10</bold>) were measured using a modified MSHTS system [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Various concentrations of each were incubated with 30 nM QD-labeled Aβ
 <sub>40</sub> (QDAβ), and 30 μM Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> in PBS containing 5% EtOH and 3% DMSO at 37 °C for 24 h in 1536-well plates (782096, Greiner) (Kremsmünster, Austria). The center of each well as viewed with an inverted fluorescence microscope (TE2000, Nikon)) (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a color CCD camera (DP72, Olympus) (Tokyo, Japan), and the central region of each well were measured with ImageJ software Ver 1.53b (NIH) to determine the standard deviations (SD) of fluorescence intensities of 40,000 pixels (200 × 200 pixels: 320 × 320 μm) [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-04077" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The SD values, which were approximately proportional to the amount of aggregates, were plotted against the concentrations of the putative inhibitors to generate inhibition curves, and the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined.
