 <sub>3</sub>I (55 mg, 0.400 mmol) was added to a solution of DCA (
 <bold>1</bold>) (59.0 mg, 0.160 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) at room temperature, and the reaction mixture was stirred at 90 °C overnight. The reaction mixture was brought to room temperature and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was concentrated, and the residue was dissolved in hexane and purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane/EtOAc (9:1) as an eluent, resulting in 59.0 mg of compound
