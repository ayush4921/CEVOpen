<p>Ferric chloride (81 mg, 499 μmol) was added to a solution of 
 <bold>2</bold> (194 mg, 505 μmol) in toluene (10 mL) at room temperature and the solution stirred for 8 h until the disappearance of the starting material. The toluene was evaporated, and the residue dissolved in 10 mL of water, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was dried over Na
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>, and the residue was dissolved in hexane and purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane/EtOAc (9.5:0.5) as an eluent, resulting in compound 
 <bold>5</bold> as a white solid (yield, 46%).
