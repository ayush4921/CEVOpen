<p>A solution of TMS-CH
 <sub>2</sub>N
 <sub>2</sub> in hexane was added to a solution of DCA (compound 
 <bold>1</bold>) (100 mg, 0.270 mmol) in methanol (5 mL) and diethyl ether (5 mL) at 0 °C until the color of the solution became yellow. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 0.5 h and at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction was quenched with acetic acid and concentrated under vacuum to yield a residue, which was dissolved in hexane and purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane/EtOAc (9.5:0.5) as an eluent, resulting in ester
