 <italic>Rhododendron dauricum</italic> leaves were collected in Hokkaido, Japan, dried, and ground into powder. The dried powder, weighing 81 g, was extracted three times with 400 mL methanol for 24 h each at room temperature. The methanol extracts were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure, yielding a black residue weighing 24.2 g. The residue was dissolved in 20% MeOH in water (500 mL) and partitioned three times with 200 mL hexane, three times with 200 mL Et
 <sub>2</sub>O, and three times with 200 mL EtOAc. The solvents were evaporated, and SMS activities were assessed in the hexane, Et
 <sub>2</sub>O, EtOAc, and water residues. The hexane fraction was more active than the Et
 <sub>2</sub>O fraction, whereas the EtOAc and water fractions were inactive. The active hexane fraction, weighing 3.8 g, was further fractionated by column chromatography on a spherical silica gel of diameter 40–50 μm (Kanto Silica Gel 60). The active component was identified as DCA, a finding confirmed by
