<p>The present study showed that DCA, a terpenoid from the leaves of 
 <italic>Rhododendron dauricum</italic>, is a natural inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthase. Several of its derivatives, including compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold>, and 
 <bold>7</bold>, also showed good inhibitory activity against SMS. In addition, DCA and compound 
 <bold>4</bold> were found to inhibit Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> aggregation. These properties suggest that DCA is a suitable candidate for further development as a new drug or medicinal supplement to treat diseases of abnormal lipid metabolism and to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.
