  <p>Inhibition of SMS1 and SMS2 activities by (

   <bold>b</bold>) derivative (
   <bold>4</bold>), (
   <bold>c</bold>) derivative (
   <bold>6</bold>) and (
   <bold>d</bold>) derivative (
   <bold>7</bold>). IC
   <sub>50</sub> values were measured using a cell lysate assay. SMS-expressing cell lysates and compounds were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and the extracted fluorescent lipids were directly analyzed by HPLC. Each point represents the mean ± SD of triplicate assays.
