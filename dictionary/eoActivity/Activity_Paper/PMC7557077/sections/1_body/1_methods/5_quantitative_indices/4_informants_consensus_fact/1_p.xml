<p id="Par21">ICF estimates the user variability of medicinal plants and it is calculated as (N
 <sub>ur</sub> − N
 <sub>t</sub>)/(N
 <sub>ur</sub> − 1) (N
 <sub>ur</sub>: number of used citations in each ailment category, and Nt: number of medicinal plants reported in each ailment category). This index is used to indicate to what extent the information is homogenous. The ranges obtained for this factor vary between 0 and 1. A value close to 1 indicates a relatively high use of the medicinal plant, while a low value close to 0 shows that this plant species is not used by informants for the treatment of an ICF condition. This factor was originally developed by Trotter and Logan (1986) [
