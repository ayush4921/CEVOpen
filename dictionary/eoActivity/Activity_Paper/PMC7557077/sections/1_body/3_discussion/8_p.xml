<p id="Par44">Due to the wide traditional utilization of medicinal plants and the limited existing clinical trials, there is a lack of scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of medicinal plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Adverse drug reactions is defined as “all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. There is a common perception of safety of medicinal plants as “natural” and “harmless”, which could lead to an under-reporting of adverse reactions. Adverse reactions may be due both to medicinal plants and to other factors (i.e. adulteration, lack of botanical identification) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Studies conducted on natural products’ perception for health, show an increase in the demand for information about medicinal plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It is necessary to include medicinal plants consumption in the usual medical history to identify possible adverse reactions and drug interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Many health professionals have not received academic preparation on medicinal plants during their Degree studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In Spain, only pharmacists receive university education on medicinal plants. This lack of knowledge is a limiting factor when health professionals recommend medicinal plants and identify possible adverse reactions and interactions. The need to include medicinal plants in undergraduate training to the rest of health professionals is presumed.
