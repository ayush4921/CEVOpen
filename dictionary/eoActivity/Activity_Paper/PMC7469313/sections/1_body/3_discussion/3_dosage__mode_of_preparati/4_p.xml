<p id="Par37">The route of administration was majorly orally. In the case of 
 <italic>Eucalyptus camaldulensis</italic>, decoctions were prepared by boiling the leaves in an earthen pot and the patient was advised to cover themselves with a blanket such that the emanating steam completely engulfed them. This was done over a period of time and the patient would later be advised to take 2 teaspoons of the decoction in the event that they had a common cold. Patients were asked to revert back to the herbalist for further directions in case they did not feel better. It is worth noting that many of the interviewed herbalists were of the opinion that their remedies rarely failed. In the minds of the herbalists, the failure of the remedies to work was largely due to the incapacity of the patients to follow the instructions issued by the herbalists.
