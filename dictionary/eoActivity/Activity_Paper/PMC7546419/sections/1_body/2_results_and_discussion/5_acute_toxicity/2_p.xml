<p>Pretreatment with chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) caused marked (P &lt; 0.05) dose-dependent decrease in distance traveled by charcoal meal and showed a remarkable increase in GI transit time. The percent activity exhibited significant effect of extract and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) isolated from the title plant. When investigated in charcoal meal gastrointestinal transit, the extract and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the propulsive association of charcoal and displayed strong GIT motility effects as compared to atropine sulfate, a muscarinic receptor blocking agent. It has been reported that blockage of muscarinic receptors in the GIT has a promising effect on the GIT smooth muscle motility. Normally, tone and propulsive moments are diminished, thus causing an increase in the intestinal transit time (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Rauf et al., 2016a</xref>). Consequently, it is recommended that anti-GIT motility of chloroform fraction and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) may be due to the blockage of muscarinic receptors in the GIT. In short, the chloroform fraction and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) isolated from title plant provoked a strong decrease in GIT motility with significant safety in initial studies. More studies are required to ascertain clinical utility.
