<p>The fruits (8.2 kg) were dried in a shade at room temperature, ground into powder and then subjected to cold extraction with methanol (×3), which yield 349 g of reddish extract. The extract was suspended in distilled water and then successively extracted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane (52.8 g), chloroform (93.6 g), and ethyl acetate (45.1 g) as per reported methods (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Bawazeer et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the TLC profile, the chloroform extract (25.0 g) was chromatographed on the silica gel normal phase column. The column was eluted with a mixture of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and ethyl acetate (0:100) of increasing polarity order. One hundred sub-fractions were obtained, which were combined to 12 major sub-fractions (SB-1–SB-12), as per the TLC profile. Based on the TLC profile, SB-7 was subjected to frequent pencil column chromatography (CC), eluting with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and ethyl acetate (14:86), which yielded white crystals. The obtained crystals were washed with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane to afford daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) (2.7 g; 99.87% pure). The chemical structure of daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) was elucidated by advanced spectroscopic technique. The structure was confirmed by crystallography technique (
