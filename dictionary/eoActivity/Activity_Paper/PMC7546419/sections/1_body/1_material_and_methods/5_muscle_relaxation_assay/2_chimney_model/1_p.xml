<p>Muscle relaxation potency of chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) was performed according to our reported procedure (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Rauf et al., 2018</xref>). In this model, a pyrex tube having a diameter of 3 cm and length of 30 cm was used. The design tube was marked 22 cm from the base, and the treated mice were allowed to muscle relaxant traits after 30, 60, and 90 min. The animals were divided into various groups (
 <italic>n = 6</italic>). Animals in one group were fed with distilled water (10 ml/kg), one group with diazepam (1 mg/kg) as a standard drug, and the remaining animals with chloroform fractions at the doses 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, i.p. and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) at doses 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, i.p. All groups of treated animals were allowed at the one adjacent of the tube and then permitted to move rising from the base to the marked position at 20 cm. When the animals reached the mark then we directly converted the tube to vertical. Those animals which fail to climb to the 20 cm mark of the glass tube in 30 s were counted as animals with muscle relaxation potential.
