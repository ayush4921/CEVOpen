<p>This model was also used to check the muscle relaxation effect of chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) as per the published method (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Rauf et al., 2018</xref>). The inclined plane used in this method consisted of two plywood boards which were joined in such a pattern that one plywood board was from the base and the other with the base at 65°. Animals were divided into various groups (
 <italic>n = 6</italic>); each group was administered with distilled water (10 ml/kg), standard drug (1 mg/kg), chloroform fraction at the doses 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, i.p., and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) at the doses 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 mg/kg, i.p. After 30, 60, and 90 min of the administration, animals were permitted on the higher portion of the inclined plane for 30 s to hang or fall.
