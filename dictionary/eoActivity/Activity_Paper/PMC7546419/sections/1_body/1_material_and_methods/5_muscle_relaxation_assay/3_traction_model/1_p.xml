<p>The muscle relaxation effect of chloroform fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) was performed according to our reported traction methods (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Rauf et al., 2018</xref>). These methods were designed by using a metallic wire coated with rubber, and both sides of the wire were connected with a stand around 60 cm upstairs of the laboratory bench. Different groups of animals (
 <italic>n = 6</italic>) were fed with distilled water (10 ml/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), and the chloroform extract and isolated daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) (2.5, 5, 10, 20 mg/kg i.p.). Then all the animals were open to traction testing after 30, 60, and 90 min. All groups of animals were suspended by back legs to the attached wire then hanging time was recorded for less than 5 s. Failure of each animal to hang to the wire indicated muscle relaxant potency. The activity was performed again and again to calculate the muscle relaxant potency according to reported methods (
