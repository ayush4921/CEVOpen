<p>The chloroform fraction and daturaolone (

 <italic>n = 6</italic>). The 1
 <sup>st</sup> group received normal saline (10 ml/kg) and acted as a negative control; the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> group was administered with the reference drug (atropine; 10 mg/kg, i.p.). The remaining groups were treated with chloroform fraction at the doses 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, i.p. and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) at the doses 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg, i.p. After 15 min of treatment, every animal received a 0.3 ml charcoal meal in the form of a suspension in water with 10% vegetable charcoal and 10% gum acacia. Exactly after 30 min of the above administration, all animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the whole small intestine was detached. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and the percent activity was measured from the distance traveled by charcoal in the small intestine as per our previous methods (
