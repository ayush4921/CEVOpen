<p>Phytochemicals can afford an excellent pharmacophore template for novel drug discovery which is used for the cure of many diseases. The crude extract/fraction and the isolated compound, daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) exhibited significant gastrointestinal motility cessation, muscle relaxation, antipyretic effects. The fractions and daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) were found safe when tested in a wide range of doses for acute toxicity. However, its safety and effect should further be assessed in chronic disease animal models. Thus daturaolone (
 <bold>1</bold>) could be used as lead compound for new drug development for fever, muscle relaxation, and associated gastrointestinal problems.
