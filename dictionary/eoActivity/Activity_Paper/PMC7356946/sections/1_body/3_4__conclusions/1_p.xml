<p>The present study revealed that MAE method of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> and 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> yielded more EOs than those obtained using HD method, while the number of identified compounds were comparable. The EOs of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> are characterized by the preponderance of sesquiterpenes, especially 6-epi-shyobunol, delta-cadinene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-pinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-pinene, germacrene-D, and 
 <italic>t</italic>-muurolol. However, the EOs of 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> are dominated by monoterpenes, with carvacrol and 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene as major compounds. The EOs of 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> showed strong phytotoxic, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. However, the 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> EOs revealed moderate phytotoxic and antibacterial activities and no antifungal activity. Therefore, the 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> EOs could be integrated as ecofriendly bio-herbicides or as antimicrobial agents. However, further studies are needed for more characterization of the reported major compounds, either singular or in synergism, and to explore their activity at the field scale. On the other hand, from a taxonomic point of view, our results revealed either close similarity or differences of the EO composition of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> with other ecospecies, therefore we recommend further identification of Egyptian ecospecies of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic>, which could help for more detailed identification at the sublevel.
