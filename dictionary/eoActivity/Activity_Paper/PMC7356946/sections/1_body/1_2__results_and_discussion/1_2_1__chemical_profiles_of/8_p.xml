<p>In the case of 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic>, GCâ€“MS analysis of the extracted oil revealed a lower number of identified compounds compared to 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00716-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results also showed that the type of extraction method used affected the chemical profile of the extracted EO. Extraction using HD showed the presence of eighteen compounds, while the extracted EO with MAE method showed the presence of nineteen compounds. Monoterpenes were the main identified components of both extracted EOs, using HD and MAE methods, with concentrations of 99.19% and 98.53%, respectively. Overall, the identified monoterpenes were categorized into (1) oxygenated monoterpenes (94.53% and 76.93%, respectively) and (2) monoterpene hydrocarbons (4.66% and 21.59%, respectively). Carvacrol (94.40% and 75.91%, respectively) was the main oxygenated monoterpene identified, while 
 <italic>p</italic>-cymene (3.61% and 16.98%, respectively) was the main identified monoterpene hydrocarbon. In the present study, the superiority of monoterpenes in the EOs of 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> is in complete agreement with the previously documented studies of the EOs of Egyptian 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> [

 <italic>T. pulegioides</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In contrast to our results, De Martino, et al. [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] described that the EO of 
 <italic>T. longicaulis</italic> collected from Italy is rich with sesquiterpenes. These chemical diversities could be attributed to different environmental and genetic variations, for example plant age, seasonality, temperature, moisture, altitude, nutrient availability, and salinity variations [
