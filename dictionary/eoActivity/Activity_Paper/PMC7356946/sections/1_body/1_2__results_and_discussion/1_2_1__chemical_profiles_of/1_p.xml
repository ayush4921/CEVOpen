<p>The EOs of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> were extracted using hydrodistillation (HD) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) methods and produced 0.045% and 0.061% (
 <italic>v/w</italic>) of yellow oils, respectively. The variation of the oil yield might be attributed to the extraction method used [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The extracted EOs were analyzed by Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and the chemical constituents were identified and described in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-00716-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Twenty-seven compounds were identified from the hydro-distilled EO, representing 100% of the total mass, while 28 compounds were identified from MAE extracted EO.
