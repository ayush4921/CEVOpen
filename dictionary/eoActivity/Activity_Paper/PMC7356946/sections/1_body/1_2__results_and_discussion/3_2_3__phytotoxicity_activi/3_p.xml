<p>Based on the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, the EOs extracted by MAE method showed a slightly higher phytotoxic activity than those extracted by HD method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00716-f002">Figure 2</xref>). However, the EO extracted using the MAE method from 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> showed a higher inhibitory effect than 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> by 16-, 32-, and 24-fold, regarding the seed germination, shoot growth, and root growth of lettuce, respectively. Moreover, the EO extracted by HD showed a similar pattern with a 16-, 28-, and 14-fold change, respectively (
