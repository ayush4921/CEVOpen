<p>The EOs of the aerial parts (300 gm, each) of 
 <italic>T. polium</italic> and 
 <italic>T. decussatus</italic> were extracted separately via the HD and MAE methods, analyzed by GC–MS, and the constituents were identified as described previously by our team [
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-plants-09-00716" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In brief, the HD-EOs were extracted via a Clevenger-type apparatus for 3 h. Meanwhile, the extractions of the MAE-EOs were performed using a focused microwave apparatus (CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC, USA), model (MARS 240/50, No. 907511, frequency 2450 MHz) operating at 2450 MHz with a maximum power of 1600 W. A sample of each plant was separately placed in a 5000 mL round-bottomed flask connected to a Clevenger-type apparatus outside of a microwave oven. The extraction was operated using 800 W power for 60 min. The temperature was adjusted to 100 °C. The essential oil was recovered and its volume was determined using a micropipette. The oily layer was separated using diethyl ether and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (0.5 g). This extraction was repeated two times and afforded two samples of EO. The extracted two samples of EO were stored in sealed air-tight glass vials at 4 °C until further analysis. The extracted EO constituents were analyzed and recognized by GC–MS analysis. The GC–MS analysis was performed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry at the department of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Research, National Research Center, Dokki, Giza, Egypt. This instrument consists of TRACE GC Ultra Gas Chromatographs (THERMO Scientific™ Corporate, Waltham, MA, USA), coupled with a Thermo Scientific ISQ™ EC single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The GC–MS system is equipped with a TR-5 MS column (30 m × 0.32 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness). Helium was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup> with a split ratio of 1:10 following a temperature program of 60 °C for 1 min, rising by 4.0 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> to 240 °C and held for 1 min. Both injector and detector were held at 210 °C. One μL of the diluted samples in hexane at a ratio of 1:10 (
 <italic>v/v)</italic> was injected. Mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, using a spectral range of 
 <italic>m/z</italic> 40–450.
