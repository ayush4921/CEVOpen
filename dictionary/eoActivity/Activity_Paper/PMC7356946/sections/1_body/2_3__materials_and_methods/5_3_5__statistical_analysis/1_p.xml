<p>The phytotoxic bioassay experiments were performed in a completely randomized design, and the experiment was repeated three times with five replicates per treatment. Based on two factors, the extraction methods (two types) and the concentration (four concentrations), the data was subjected to two-way ANOVA, followed by Duncanâ€™s test at the probability level of 0.05 using the CoStat software program (CoHort Software, Monterey, CA, USA). According to the approach proposed by Legendre and Legendre [

PCA was performed using XLSTAT software (version 2018, Addinsoft, NY, USA).
