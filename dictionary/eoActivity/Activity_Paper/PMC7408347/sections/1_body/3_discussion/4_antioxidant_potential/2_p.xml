<p id="par0095">The effective role of antioxidants is their interaction with oxidative free radicals. During the DPPH process, antioxidants respond with the steady free radicals of α,α-diphenyl-β-picrylhydrazyl (deep color) and gradually exchange or adapt them to produce DPPH derivatives, resulting in a color change [

 <italic>T. simplex</italic> neutralized the free radicals present in the solution. Generally, secondary metabolites in plants proved vital to humans because of their antioxidant contents. Differences in antioxidant concentrations were compared to gallic acid concentration, one of the major natural antioxidants in plants, widely used as a standard measurement for antioxidant values. The percentage of antioxidant capacity was measured to determine the scavenging activity, resulting in an increase of lipid peroxidation inhibitory molecules. Nevertheless, this value might include all types of antioxidants present in the sample, thus the variation in antioxidant properties was unable to be accurately measured. There are also plant extracts that have high DPPH radical scavenging actions. These variations are likely because of their diverse geographical distribution or sample collection and processing [

 <italic>T. simplex.</italic> The selected types of plants are already distributed only in some Arab countries and Oman is one of these. The plant is new and there are no research has been done on the selected plant species. In addition, this plant species was used traditionally by the Arabian ethnic communities to treat various ailments. Therefore, in this study, we selected this plant to screen the biological activity of the aerial parts with multipolar crude extracts. There are reports are available on antioxidant activity for other species belongs to this family, but not
