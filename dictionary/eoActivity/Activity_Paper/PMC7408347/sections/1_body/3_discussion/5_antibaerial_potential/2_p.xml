<p id="par0100">The experimental antibacterial results obtained from this study are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Almost none of the crude extracts from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> showed any antibacterial activity against the bacterial strains used [

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], with the exception of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> in methanol extract. The aerial methanol crude extract at concentrations 250 μg/mL showed the minimum activity with the range of 5 mm against 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial strain. Hexane and DCM did not show any activity at any concentrations against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. However, methanol aerial extracts at all concentrations except 1000 μg/mL showed activity within the range of 0–25 mm. The lowest concentration methanol extract gave promising activity against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae.</italic> The ethyl acetate at concentration 2000 μg/mL and water at 500 and 250 μg/mL also gave activity within the range 0–10 mm against 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae. P.</italic> bacilli did not show any activity against any of the polarities, except with ethyl acetate at 250 μg/mL and 2000 μg/mL within the range of 0–9 mm. On the other hand, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneunoniae</italic> did not show any activity. Almost all crude extracts at all concentrations except ethyl acetate 2000 μg/mL with the value of 10 mm. It is noticed that low concentrations of crude extracts have high inhibition zones. The ethyl acetate, butanol, and water extracts did not show any activity against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus.</italic> However, the hexane, methanol, and DCM extracts gave inhibition of the variety of 0–10 mm against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Our research findings illustrate that extracts are not sensitive to high concentrations. The antimicrobial activity of the plant's crude extracts relies on the bioactive phytochemicals e.g., alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, glycosides, steroids, etc. [
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The antibacterial data cannot be compared with the reported antibacterial data due to a lack of data on the antibacterial activity of 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic>. Several reports are available on the antibacterial activity of other plants belonging to the Zygophyllaceae family [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; however, our results are not aligned with their conclusions. The variation of results may result from the preparation of crude extracts, bacterial strains and dose applied.
