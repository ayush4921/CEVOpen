<p id="par0060">Antibacterial activities of the six crude extracts prepared from aerial parts of 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> were determined using the agar disc diffusion assay against two gram-positive 
 <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and three gram-negative bacteria 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, and P. bacilli. A total of 10 mg of each crude extract was dissolved in 5 mL DMSO in different test tubes to obtain a concentration of 2000 μg/mL; this concentration was diluted to obtain concentrations of 1000, 500, and 250 μg/mL. The standard was prepared by dissolving 1 mg levofloxacin in 1 mL DMSO. A 5-mm disc was prepared using a filter paper. The bacterial strains were inoculated on different agar plates. The discs were soaked in different concentrations of the samples; DMSO was used as a negative control and levofloxacin as a positive control. The agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Finally, the inhibition zones were measured using a ruler and documented in mm [
