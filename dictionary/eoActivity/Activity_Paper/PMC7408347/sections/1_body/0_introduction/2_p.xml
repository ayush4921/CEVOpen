<p id="par0025">Typically, the medicines used for human diseases are mostly derived from plant and animal sources, and almost all available indigenous plant species may be used as medicines to cure different illnesses. Plants as herbal remedies have been used to treat various diseases since ancient times [

Several studies have shown that consuming various vegetables or fruits as a part of our daily diet is beneficial for health and reduces the risk of developing diseases. Therefore, the risk of certain diseases is reduced due to antioxidants present in different plant and animal parts [

As a result, such antioxidants have frequently been discussed for their health benefits and disease preventive potential. Some severe and chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension etc may be prevented through the consumption of fruits, seeds, peel, roots, and vegetables. Additionally, these substances remove oxidizing agents, which are potentially harmful to living organisms. The human body naturally produces free radicals to counter these harmful effects. However, in most cases, the levels of free radicals are much higher than those of naturally occurring antioxidants. There are various naturally occurring antioxidants, including beta-carotene, lycopene, proanthocyanidins, and flavonoids, which are effective in preventing diseases (
