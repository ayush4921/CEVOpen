 <italic>Tetraena simplex</italic> (
 <italic>T. simplex</italic>) is a newly identified species of the family Zygophyllaceae. Over 53 species belonging to this family are known globally. Synonyms of 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> such as 
 <italic>Zygophyllum simplex</italic> L or 
 <italic>Fabago portulacifolius</italic> M are used in some Arabian countries. 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> has several common names such as arid, batbaak, aburukaiba, qarmal, harmal, and retreat. In Oman, it is known as harmal. 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> is a new species found in Gulf countries, including Oman [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is an annual plant with red stems branching from the base. It is also native to North and Northeast Africa, Arabia, and east of India. The plant reaches the height of ∼20–30 cm. The leaves are bright green or yellow and with entire margins, and the leaf arrangement is opposite. The flowers are bright yellow with five petals, and these are produced throughout the year. The fruit is an oval capsule with winged segments. Harmal is a halophyte growing in arid and semi-arid regions. Traditionally, 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> has been used in Arab states to treat asthma, gout, and swelling [

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Most plants belonging to Zygophyllaceae have traditionally been used to treat diseases such as cancer, non-malignant tumors, osteomyelitis, psoriasis, and warts [

Microorganisms, animals, and plants are one of the most important natural sources of drugs. Among these sources, plants and their derived products are only safe and suitable owing to their renewability. Therefore, they play key roles in maintaining good health. Meanwhile, indigenous plants as sources of effective drugs and therapeutic agents have garnered much research attention in recent years. Such drugs are more effective than their synthetic counterparts and are often associated with negligible side effects [
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Oman, several plant species belonging to Zygophyllaceae are readily available and have traditionally been used to treat various illnesses such as cancer, diabetics, hypertension, and kidney and liver diseases [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the United Arab Emirates and Oman, 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> has also been used to treat various eye infections and is often present in ophthalmic preparations. However, several studies suggest that there is no evidence of the biological, pharmacological, and chemical characteristics of 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> or of its alleged antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Therefore, our aim was to prepare crude extracts of aerial parts of 
 <italic>T. simplex</italic> with various polarities and to evaluate their antioxidant and antibacterial activities using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and agar gel diffusion assays.
