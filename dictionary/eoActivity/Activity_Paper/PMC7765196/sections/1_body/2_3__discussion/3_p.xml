<p>On the other hand, flow cytometry analysis with annexin V and PI staining indicated that MOL fraction no. 7 was not only able to induce apoptosis but also triggered necrotic cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells. This mechanism might be caused by the activation of caspase-3 which triggers cross-talk to necrotic signaling, resulting in secondary necrosis [

The main features of secondary necrosis are osmotic cell swelling and lysis that lead to leakage of the cell contents; thereby it may cause tissue injury and induction of inflammation and other immune responses if the dying cells are not quickly removed by phagocytes [
