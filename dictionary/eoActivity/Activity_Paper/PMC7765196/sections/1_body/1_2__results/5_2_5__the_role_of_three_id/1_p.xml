<p>Cytotoxicity of compounds on MDA-MB-231 cells was measured by incubating with serial concentrations of 7-octenoic acid, cis-9-octadeceneamide (oleamide), and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol for 24 h (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00464">Figure S6</xref>). The result showed that cytotoxic dose of oleamide was less than both 1-phenyl-2-pentanol and 7-octenoic acid. To determine the anticancer effect of compounds, we examined the morphologic changes by Hoechst 33342 staining (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00464-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). An apoptotic morphology was observed after treatments with 7-octenoic acid, oleamide, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol for 24 h, whereas control cells were round and homogeneously stained. Then apoptosis was assessed by AnnexinV/7-AAD staining with Muse cell analyser (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00464-f005">Figure 5</xref>B,C). Treatment with 7-octenoic acid significantly increased the proportion of late apoptotic cells. Oleamide and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol significantly increased the proportion of both early and late apoptotic cells. Moreover, the expression of apoptotic-associated proteins; Bcl-2, Bax, pro-caspase 3, and cleaved caspase-3 were measured by Western blot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00464-f005">Figure 5</xref>D). We observed an increase of cleaved caspase-3 with the decrease of Bcl-2 in cells treated with the compounds. Additionally, Muse cell analyzer indicated cell cycle arrest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00464-f005">Figure 5</xref>E,F). The accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase was significantly increased in oleamide treated cells, while 7-octenoic acid and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol resulted in the accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase. These results suggested that the three-identified compounds, 7-octenoic acid, oleamide, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol, can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells.
