<p>To examine the inhibitory effects of crude EtOAc extract and its derived fractions, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with crude EtOAc extract and fractions no. 1–11 at concentrations of 75, 100, and 150 μg/mL for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00464-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Cell viability was significantly decreased after treatment with crude EtOAc extract and fractions no. 5–8 and 10–11. There was a noticeable difference with fractions no. 6–8 showing a significant decrease in cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The fraction no. 7 showed the strongest cytotoxicity, and thus this fraction was investigated further at different times points (

As fractions no. 6–8 exhibited notable effects on viability, we further investigated the impact of crude EtOAc extract and fractions no. 6–8 on the clonogenic growth of MDA-MB-231 cells (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00464">Figure S1</xref>). Cells were incubated with crude EtOAc extract or fractions no. 6–8 for 24 h. After incubation, cells were cultured for 14 days in complete medium and then stained with crystal violet to visualize the colonies. Fractions no. 6–8 at concentrations 50–150 µg/mL showed a significant reduction in the number of colonies. These results suggest that the clonogenic growth of MDA-MB-231 cells was completely inhibited by fractions no. 6–8 of MOL extract.
