<p>To evaluate the role of crude EtOAc extract and fractions no. 6–8 on cell apoptosis and cell-cycle regulation, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with crude EtOAc extract and fractions no. 6–8 (150 µg/mL) for 24 h. After incubation, cells were stained with Annexin V/7-AAD and analyzed by a Muse cell analyzer (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00464">Figure S2</xref>). Crude EtOAc extract and fractions no. 6–8 significantly increased the proportion of late apoptotic cells up to 16.0, 23.9, 44.2, and 39.8%, respectively. The proportion of dead cells also increased to 43.6, 75.8, 54.2, and 60.1%, respectively. In addition, the alteration of the cell-cycle distribution was also analyzed (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pharmaceuticals-13-00464">Figure S3</xref>). Treatment with fractions no. 6 and 8 resulted in the accumulation of cells at the G0/G1 phase. This varied from 53.5% (control) to 61.8% and 63.4%, respectively. Fraction no. 7 resulted in the accumulation of cells at the G2/M phase (from 26.2% to 38.4%). Therefore, these results suggest that fractions no. 6–8 promoted cell cycle arrest and induced apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells.
