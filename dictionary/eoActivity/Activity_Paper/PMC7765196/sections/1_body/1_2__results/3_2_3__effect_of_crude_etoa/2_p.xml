<p>Since active fraction no. 7 exhibited the strongest anticancer activities, we further investigated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and mRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pharmaceuticals-13-00464-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F). The expression of certain pro-apoptotic markers, including cleaved caspase 3 protein, Bax mRNA, and p53 mRNA were significantly increased while anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein was decreased by fraction no. 7 treatment. These results suggest that the apoptosis induction by MOL fraction no. 7 is through the inhibition of Bcl-2 and the activation p53, Bax, and caspase 3.
