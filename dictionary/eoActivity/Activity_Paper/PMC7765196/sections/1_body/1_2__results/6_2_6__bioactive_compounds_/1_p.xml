<p>TNBC is an aggressive form of breast cancer with high metastasis. We determined the effects of the compounds on MDA-MB-231 cell migration using the in vitro scratch assay (

The number of migratory cells across the wound regions was significantly decreased after treatment with 7-octenoic acid, oleamide, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol. This result indicated that 7-octenoic acid, oleamide, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol may have the ability to inhibit MDA-MB-231 cell migration. As oleamide exhibited notable anticancer effects against MDA-MB-231, we further investigated the effect of oleamide on two different cancer cell lines, including human myelogenous leukemia cell K562 and human squamous cell carcinoma lines SCC-15. Result revealed that treatment with 70 and 100 Âµg/mL of oleamide increased late apoptosis in both K562 (13.76% and 87.11%) and SCC-15 (11.37% and 24.47%) when compared to the control (
