<p>Understanding the binding target of compounds provides important insights into the therapeutic approach. In this study, we preliminary predicted the blinding target of oleamide based on similarity-based approaches and then query the target profiles in drug target commons platform (

 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceuticals-13-00464" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We found 16 target molecules, including four transmembrane receptors, nine enzymes, and three nuclear proteins. However, the prediction of certain blinding-targets required the combinations of data from multiple platforms such as DrugBank, BindingDB, and Protein Data Bank.
