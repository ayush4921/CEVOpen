<p>The cytotoxicity of the MOL extract and its derived fractions were determined using the methyl thiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well and treated with MOL extract at concentration 75, 100, and 150 µg/mL for 24 h. MTT salt solution was added and the plate was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Then, formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 µl DMSO. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an ELISA plate reader (PerkinElmer, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA).
