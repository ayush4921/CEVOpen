<p>Cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis were examined on the Muse Cell Analyzer (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). MDA-MB-231 cells were plated into 24-well plates at the density of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well. Cells were incubated with MOL extract (150 µg/mL), fractions no. 1–11 (150 µg/mL), 7-octenoic acid (2.5 and 4 mg/mL), oleamide (70 and 100 μg/mL), 1-phenyl-2-pentanol (600 and 700 μg/mL), or doxorubicin (1.5 μM) for 24 h. Cell apoptosis was examined by staining with Muse™ Annexin V and Dead Cell reagent (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; cat. no. MCH100105). For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in chilled 75% ethanol for 3 h at −20 °C. Then cells were washed with PBS and incubated with Muse™ Cell Cycle Reagent (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; cat. no. MCH100106) for 30 min in the dark at RT. Cells were read on the Muse cell analyser.
