<p>Migration of MDA-MB-231 cells was examined by using the in vitro scratch assay. MAD-MB-231 cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were plated into 6-well plates and cultured for 24 h to form monolayers. The wound area was created by scratching with a SPLScar™ Scratcher. Cells were then incubated with 7-octenoic acid (1.5 mg/mL), oleamide (40 µg/mL), 1-Phenyl-2-pentanol (250 µg/mL), doxorubicin (1.5 µM), or media alone for 24 h. The images were captured at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h using an inverted microscope (Zeiss Microscopy, Oberkochen, Germany). The percentage of wound closure was calculated using ImageJ software (Version 1.52a, Madison, WI, USA).
