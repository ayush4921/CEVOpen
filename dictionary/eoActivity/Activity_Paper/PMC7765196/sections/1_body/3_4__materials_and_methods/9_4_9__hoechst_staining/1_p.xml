<p>To assess the effects of compounds on nuclear material, MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with Hoechst 33342. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded at a density of 7 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 6-well plate containing glass cover slips. Cells were treated with 7-octenoic acid (2.5 mg/mL), oleamide (70 µg/mL), and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol (600 µg/mL) for 24 h. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde, and stained with Hoechst 33,342 (4 µg/mL) for 10 min in dark. Cover slides were then mounted with 70% glycerol and images were captured with an inverted microscope using 350 nm excitation and 450 nm emission filters (Zeiss Microscopy, Oberkochen, Germany). A total of three images per treatment were captured at 40× magnification.
