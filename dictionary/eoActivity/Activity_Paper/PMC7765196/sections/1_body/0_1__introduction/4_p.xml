<p>In this study, we investigated the in vitro anticancer effect of MOL extract against MDA-MB-231 cells by bioassay-guided fractionation, and identification of potential bioactive compounds responsible for the observed effects. We found that MOL extracts and derived fractions showed a remarkable anticancer activity with a significant decrease of cell viability, striking reduction of colony formation, and induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Additionally, we tentatively identified 10 bioactive compounds by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis. Three of them (7-octenoic acid, oleamide, and 1-phenyl-2-pentanol) can arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells. We also demonstrated the anticancer properties of oleamide on human myelogenous leukemia cell K562 and human squamous cell carcinoma SCC-15.</p>
