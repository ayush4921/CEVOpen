  <p>Effect of crude EtOAc extract and fractions no. 6–8 on MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. (
   <bold>A</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) Cell apoptosis and cell cycle progression analyzed by using Muse cell analyzer. Cells were incubated with crude EtOAc extract or fractions no. 6–8 at 150 µg/mL for 24 h. For untreated control, cells were incubated with complete medium alone. For positive control, cells were incubated with doxorubicin (1.5 µM). (
   <bold>E</bold>) Western blot analysis. (
   <bold>F</bold>) mRNA expression by RT-PCR. Cells were incubated with fraction no. 7 for 24 h. One-way ANOVA was performed with multiple comparison correction (Dunnett test). Data represent the mean ± SEM of three independent experiments. (*
