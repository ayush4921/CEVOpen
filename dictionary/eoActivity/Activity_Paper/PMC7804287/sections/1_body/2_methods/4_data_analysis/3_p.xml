<p id="Par26">Variations in knowledge about wild food plants were assessed at the individual and plant level. In the second case, we aimed to identify whether the best-known wild food plants are those best evaluated by those who know them. For this, we performed a simple linear regression, assigning the square root of the number of people who cited each plant as the response variable, and the average score of each plant as an explanatory variable, considering all the attributes. The use of a multiple regression model, considering each attribute as an independent variable, would bring more detailed results on the factors that influence knowledge. However, as the sample of known plants is small, models with high numbers of explanatory variables are at risk of presenting biases and, therefore, we chose to use the combination of all variables measured from local perception as an explanatory variable. In order to observe whether people adopt independent criteria to assign the scores or whether, alternatively, they tend to highlight the same plants, regardless of the parameter evaluated, a Spearman correlation matrix was performed between all the measured attributes.</p>
