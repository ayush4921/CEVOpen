<p id="Par27">To investigate variations in local knowledge about wild food plants, we used as parameter (1) the number of plants mentioned by the interviewees, and (2) the similarity in the lists of plants mentioned. We used the exact Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney test to check whether there are differences between men and women in terms of the number of plants mentioned. Average rankings were used to deal with ties, due to their high incidence (equal number of plants mentioned by different people). We also investigated the relationship between age and the log
 <sub>10</sub> of the number of plants mentioned + 1 using a simple linear regression. The transformation in the response variable served to adapt the data to the premises of linear regression.
