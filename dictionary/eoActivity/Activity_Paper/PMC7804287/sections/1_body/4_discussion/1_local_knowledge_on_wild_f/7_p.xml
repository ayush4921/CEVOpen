<p id="Par52">The predominance of forest species among the wild food plants cited in the Dom Helder settlement differs from most findings in the literature for agricultural populations. According to investigations in the context of local farmers, these groups usually collect mainly species that are typical of anthropogenic areas, when compared to plants from pristine ecosystems, especially when forest areas are being lost or are distant from the community

 </sup>. In the case of the Dom Helder settlement, although anthropic areas are easier to access comparing to forests, residents have opted for a different strategy to reduce energy collection costs. Thus, instead of using primarily ruderal and invasive species, settlers chose to promote forest species in their agricultural production areas. Thus, although the forests are still the main source of collection of wild food plants, anthropic areas are gaining more and more importance, as the availability of forest species in these environments grow.
