<p id="Par72">Based on the attributes measured from local knowledge and perception, we reccomend the species 
 <italic>Psidium guineense, Genipa americana, Xanthosoma sagittifolium</italic> and 
 <italic>Dioscorea trifida</italic> for popularization efforts in northeastern Brazil. In this sense, it is necessary to expand studies related to the economic valuation and acceptability of products produced from these plants. However, the high variation in local knowledge about wild food plants indicates that species that are not often mentioned can also be promising. Thus, these species should alsoÂ be studied from an ethnographic point of view in other socioecological contexts with less intracultural variation in knowledge.
