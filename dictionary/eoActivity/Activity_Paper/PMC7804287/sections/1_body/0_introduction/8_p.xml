<p id="Par9">Therefore, in order to understand aspects related to the knowledge and potential for popularizing wild food plants, this study was conducted in a rural settlement in northeastern Brazil. We departed from the following questions: (1) what is the profile of the plants known to residents in terms of habit, place of occurrence and part used?; (2) how is knowledge about wild food plants distributed?; (3) which plants have the potential for popularization among potential consumers in the surrounding urban area?; and, (4) is the local perception about the biological and ecological attributes of plants a good predictor of knowledge about these plants?</p>
