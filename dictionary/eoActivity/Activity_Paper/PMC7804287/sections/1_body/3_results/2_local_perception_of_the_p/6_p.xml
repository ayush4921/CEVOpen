<p id="Par43">The plants whose edible parts are easier to collect are, according to the interviewees, 
 <italic>P. guineenses</italic> and 
 <italic>A. viridis</italic>. The fruits of 
 <italic>Talisia</italic> cf. 
 <italic>macrophylla</italic> were considered difficult to collect, given the considerable height of the individuals and the persistence of the fruits on the tree. 
 <italic>Talisia</italic> cf. 
 <italic>macrophylla</italic> was also among the three plants with the lowest associated medicinal potential, while 
 <italic>G. americana</italic> and 
 <italic>C. rufa</italic> were regarded as having high medicinal potential. Seven of the 12 species obtained maximum value (5) for the absence of adverse effects. The plant that can cause more problems when consumed is, according to the interviewees, 
 <italic>Amaranthus viridis</italic> L. However, if the leaves are properly scalded or boiled, their consumption does not constitute a risk.
