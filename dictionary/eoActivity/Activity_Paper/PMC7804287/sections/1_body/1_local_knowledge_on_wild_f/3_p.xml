<p id="Par13">In addition to the routes of transmission, socioeconomic variables have been reported in the literature as determinants of traditional botanical knowledge, and age and gender are among the most important. Many studies, within the scope of food plants or plants with other uses have found that the older the person, the greater the local botanical knowledge, measured mainly from the number of known plants

 </sup>. However, a growing number of studies have shown that this knowledge grows with age to the point where it stabilizes or declines, possibly due to issues associated with memory impairment in elderly people

 </sup>. In addition, in the specific case of knowledge on wild food plants, there is a substantial variation reported in literature, as studies have also identified no connection between age and knowledge
