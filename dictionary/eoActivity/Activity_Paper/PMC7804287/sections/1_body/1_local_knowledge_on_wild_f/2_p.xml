<p id="Par12">Studies have identified different patterns of distribution of local botanical knowledge and the means the routes of transmission can influence the degree of heterogeneity of this knowledge. Considering the classic models of cultural transmission, the vertical route (knowledge transmitted between different generations of the same family line) usually leads to a more conservative and heterogeneous knowledge in a socio-ecological system, that is, with less changes within the family line, but with many differences when considering the different families

 </sup>. On the other hand, when horizontal (knowledge transmitted between people of the same generation) and oblique (transmission between people of different generations and different family lines) predominate, the traditional botanical body of knowledge is usually more dynamic (with greater changes over time) and less heterogeneous, considering the system as a whole
