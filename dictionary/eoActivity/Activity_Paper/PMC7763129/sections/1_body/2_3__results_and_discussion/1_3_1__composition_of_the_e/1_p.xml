<p>EOs and their constituents are widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetics industries [17]. The chemical names of the identified constituents of the EOs isolated from the stem bark and roots of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> , together with their RIs and percentages, are given in Table 1, where the compounds have been listed in the order of elution on the DB-5 column used. A total of 76 volatile components were detected in the EO of the 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> stem bark, which represented about 91.84% of the oil extracted. The dominant compounds were 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene (57.28%), thymol methyl ether (9.51%), humulene epoxide II (5.96%), and orcinyl tiglate (3.78%). For the 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> roots, 55 compounds, representing about 96.51% of the oil, were identified, with 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene (64.76%), thymol methyl ether (8.93%), palmitic acid (5.18%), and Î±-humulene (2.34%) being the most dominant (Table 1, Figure).
