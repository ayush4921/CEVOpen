<p>To the best of our knowledge, and according to literature survey, there have been no previous antioxidant activity reports for the EOs and extracts of any parts of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> . However, among the 20 
 <italic>Laggera</italic> species, antioxidant activities of the EOs of the aerial parts of only 2 plants, namely 
 <italic>L. decurrens</italic> and 
 <italic>L. aurita</italic> , were reported. For the oils of these plants, good antioxidant activity values that were slightly higher than the current results, were reported [3,32]. At a concentration of 1 mg/mL, the EO of 
 <italic>L. decurrens</italic> , with high content of 3-methoxythymoquinone (28.1%), showed strong antioxidant activity (93.1%), which was comparable to that of AA (96%). However, the EO of 
 <italic>L. aurita</italic> , with a dominant compound of hexadecanoic acid (21.2%), showed moderate antioxidant activity (81.40 Â± 1.98% at 4 mg/mL) in the DPPH assay.
