<p>Assessed EOs of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> were able to reduce stable purple DPPH radical to the yellow DPPH-H with IC50 values in the range of 0.33 ± 1.10 to 0.43 ± 1.12 mg/mL (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, the EO of the stem bark of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> had slightly higher radical scavenging activity (lowest IC50 value, 0.33 ± 1.10 mg/mL) than the root EO (IC50 value, 0.39 ± 0.97). When compared with the H2O2 assay, the EOs exhibited better antioxidant activities in DPPH than that in H2O2 (Table 2). The overall inhibitory activity of the EOs against H2O2 can be presented in the following order: AA (0.14 ± 0.56 mg/mL) &gt; stem barks EO (0.36 ± 1.05 mg/mL) &gt; roots EO (0.43 ± 1.12 mg/mL). However, the oils showed potent antioxidant activities in all of the tested concentrations when compared with AA. This observed activity of the oils was most likely related to their dominant constituents, such as 2,5-dimethoxy- 
 <italic>p</italic> -cymene and thymol methyl ether (oxygenated monoterpenes). Linalool, terpineol, δ-cadinene, and phenolic chemical compounds, such as eugenol, thymol, and carvacrol, which were also present in the oils, may also have had a significant contribution to the antioxidant activity of the oils [29–31].
