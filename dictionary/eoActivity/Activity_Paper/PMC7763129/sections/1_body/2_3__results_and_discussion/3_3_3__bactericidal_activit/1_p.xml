<p>Results from the disc diffusion tests for the in vitro antibacterial activity of the EOs of the roots and stem bark of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> are presented in Table 3. These oils displayed slightly variable activity towards the investigated bacterial strains. As shown in Table 3, the DIZs of the studied oils ranged from 2.79 ± 0.97 to 9.81 ± 0.70 mm for the different (0.10, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/mL) concentrations tested. The gram– pathogen, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> , was the most resistant, while the gram+ bacterium, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> , was the most sensitive microorganism to the EOs. The DIZs of the stem bark EO were 9.81 ± 0.70 and 8.15 ± 1.32 mm, while those of the root EO were 8.47 ± 0.93 and 7.42 ± 1.26 mm for 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. cereus</italic> , respectively, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. The results indicated the susceptibility of the gram+ bacteria to the EOs. However, the oils showed no inhibitory activity towards 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> at any of the concentrations and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> at 0.10 and 0.25 mg/mL (Table 3). The results of the MIC values (Table 4) also indicated that the oils were more sensitive against gram+ microorganisms than gram– ones, which were similar to the results obtained by the disc diffusion method. The EO of the stem bark showed the greatest activity against the gram+ (MIC = 0.625 mg/mL) bacteria, while that of the roots demonstrated moderate activity (MIC = 1.25 mg/mL) against the same bacterial strains. However, both oils were least active against the gram– (MIC = 2.5 mg/mL) bacteria.
