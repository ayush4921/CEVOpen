<p>EOs were obtained from the dried and powdered samples (150 g each) of the stem bark and roots of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus for about 3 h. The obtained oils were separated completely from the condensed water using a separation funnel to afford 0.17% w/w of light yellow and 0.12% w/w of pale yellow EOs from the stem bark and roots of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> , respectively. The separated oils were then dried by anhydrous Na2SO4 and kept in sterilized dark glass bottles in the refrigerator at 4 Â°C prior until the analyses.
