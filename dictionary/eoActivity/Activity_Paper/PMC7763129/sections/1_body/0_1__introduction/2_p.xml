 <italic>Laggera tomentosa</italic> Sch. Bip. ex Oliv. et Hiern, an annual fragrant subshrub or bushy herb, is an endemic medicinal plant of Ethiopia. Its leaves are used to treat various diseases, including the common cold, cough, flu, rabies, leech infestation, dysentery, and febrile illness and headaches, while the aerial parts are used for the treatment of toothache, swelling, and ringworm, and the roots are used for the treatment of evil eye [2]. The plant is also reported to be used against migraine, as a fumigant, as a treatment for stomachache, and for cleansing milk containers [8]. It is also used to treat skin infections and external parasites [9]. Previously, the chemical constituents of the EO of the leaves and inflorescence of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> were documented [10]. However, to the best of our knowledge, and according to a literature survey, no data about the chemical compositions of other parts of the EOs of the plant have been reported to date. Moreover, there are no previous biological activity reports on any parts of the EOs of this plant. Therefore, in this paper, various chemical constituents of the stem bark and roots of 
 <italic>L. tomentosa</italic> EOs were isolated and analyzed, respectively, by hydrodistillation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Moreover, the antioxidant and antibacterial potentials of the oils, which may be useful in foods, pharmaceuticals, and other industries, were also assessed and reported.
