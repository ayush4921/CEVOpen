<p>Interestingly, for the highest non-lethal concentrations (2.3 g/L (acetonic), 7.2 g/L (aqueous)), we observed a delay in hatching in a concentration- and exposure time-dependent manner. A significant hatching reduction of 38% and 75% was observed at 96 hpf for the aqueous (7.2 g/L) and acetonic (2.3 g/L) extracts, respectively. Hatching normally occurs between 72 and 96 hpf. Although this remains to be investigated, we can speculate that the delayed hatching observed in our experimental conditions for the treated embryos may be induced by an impairment in the hatching process, such as the production-secretion of hatching enzymes (zhe1), cathepsin L (catL1), involved in this physiological process [
