<p>Despite the beneficial effects of natural polyphenols, the safe consumption of beverages from medicinal plants remains poorly studied. Indeed, polyphenols can also display adverse effects, including carcinogenic/genotoxic ones; act as endocrine disruptors; disturb iron absorption; and also interact with drugs [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We consequently decided to investigate for the first time the potential toxicity of the medicinal plant 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> using the zebrafish model. Whilst the classical approach for the assessment of drug and plant extract toxicity is time consuming, expensive, and requires in vitro and in vivo models (mainly rodents), the zebrafish embryo model emerged as a relevant tool for a first toxicological screening approach. This developmental model is widely used to assess drug toxicity [
 <xref rid="B15-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and appears as a relevant model, given its strong genic homology (more than 70% of human genes have an orthologue in zebrafish). As well, zebrafish display many evolutionary conserved organs and physiological processes [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and exhibit a high fertility rate as well as transparent eggs, allowing their easily monitoring at the different stages of organogenesis [
