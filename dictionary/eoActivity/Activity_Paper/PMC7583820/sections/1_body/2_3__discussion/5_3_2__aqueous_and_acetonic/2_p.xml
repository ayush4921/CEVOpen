<p>In the present study, we used the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity test (FET) designed by OECD and known to be a reference in the field [

At the highest doses tested (40–16.9 g/L), a 100% mortality was observed at 24 hpf for both extracts, in spite of the chorion presence, which potentially acts as a barrier. The toxicity of both plant extracts evidenced that the acetonic extract was more toxic than the aqueous extract (LC
 <sub>50</sub>: 5 ± 0.2 g/L vs. 17.6 ± 1.7 g/L, respectively). Such a toxicity may be associated with the high bioactivity of the plant extracts or the presence of other phytochemical compounds, such as alkaloids and terpenes, known to be produced for defense against abiotic and probiotic stresses in plants. Previous studies have reported that alkaloids significantly contribute to the toxic effect of various plants [
