<p>In this work, we have identified 19 main polyphenols. Among them, we observed that the major compounds of both extracts were quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, caffeoyl- and dicaffeoyl-quinic acids isomers, protocatechuic acid, coumaric acids isomers, and caffeic acid. These results were consistent with previous ones reported from our laboratory [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, we provide a significant input to this previous work, since our MS
 <sup>2</sup> spectral analysis identified new compounds such as quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, protocatechuic acid, and coumaric acids isomers.
