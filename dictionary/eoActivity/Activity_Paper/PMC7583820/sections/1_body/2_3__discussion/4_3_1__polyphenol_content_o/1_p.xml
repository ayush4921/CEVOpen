<p>A quantification by high-resolution mass spectrometry of the acetonic and aqueous extracts revealed the presence of polyphenol derivatives belonging to the phenolic acid and flavonoid classes known to be the most abundant in plant and plant-based foods [

 <xref rid="B38-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. From a qualitative point of view, no difference was observed between both extracts. Interestingly, although herbal infusion allows a very powerful polyphenol extraction yield, from a quantitative point of view the total amount of phenolic acids and flavonoids remains a little higher in the acetonic extract than in the aqueous extract. This result was expected, since it is well known that the polyphenol solubility depends on the solvent polarity and the kind of extraction used [
