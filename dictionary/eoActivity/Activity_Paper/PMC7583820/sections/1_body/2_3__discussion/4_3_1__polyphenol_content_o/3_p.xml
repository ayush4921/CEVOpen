<p>The identification of these new compounds could be explained by a different geographical location of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> leading to different environmental conditions, such as moisture, illumination, altitude, and temperature [

Furthermore, in these previous studies, conventional C18 reverse-phase column was used, while in the present study we used a pentafluorophenyl-phase column known to offer a greater selectivity for several compound classes such as aromatic and isomeric compounds, achieved not only by hydrophobic interactions as C18 reverse-phase but also by aromatic, π–π, dipole–dipole, and ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding [
