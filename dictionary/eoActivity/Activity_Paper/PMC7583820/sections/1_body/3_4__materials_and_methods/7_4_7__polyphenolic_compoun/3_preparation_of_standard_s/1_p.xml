<p>Standard stock solutions of caffeic acid, caffeoylquinic acid, kaempferol, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, quercetin-3-
 <italic>O</italic>-galactoside, protocatechuic acid, and coumaric acid were dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. A mixed stock solution containing 10 Âµg/mL of each polyphenol standard was prepared in methanol. The calibration standard solutions were prepared by the dilution of the mixed stock solutions in 0.1% formic acid in water to obtain the desired calibration curves ranging from 10 to 4000 ng/mL. The quality control (QC) samples were prepared at 25, 250, and 4000 ng/mL and analyzed in triplicate within each batch.
