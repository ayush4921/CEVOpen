<p>For the mass spectrometer conditions, a Heated Electrospray Ionization source II (HESI II) was used. Nitrogen was used as the drying gas. The mass spectrometric conditions were optimized as follows: spray voltage 2.8 kV, capillary temperature 350 °C, sheath gas flow rate 60 units, aux gas flow rate 20 units, and S lens RF level 50. Mass spectra were registered in full scan mode from

 <italic>z</italic> 400. The automatic gain control (AGC) was set at 1e6. The MS/MS spectra were obtained by applying a relative higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) energy of 25%. The identification of the compounds of interest was based on their retention time, exact mass, elemental composition, MS fragmentation pattern, and comparisons with available standards and the advanced mass spectral database,
