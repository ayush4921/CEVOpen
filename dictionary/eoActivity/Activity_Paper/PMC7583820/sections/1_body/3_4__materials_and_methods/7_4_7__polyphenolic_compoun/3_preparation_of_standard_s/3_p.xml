<p>The variability was expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD, %), and the accuracy was expressed as the relative error (RE, %). The limit of quantification (LOQ) was defined as the lowest analytical concentration of the calibration curve at which the measured precision, expressed as relative standard deviation (RSD), was within 20% and the accuracy, expressed as relative error (RE), was in the range of 20%.</p>
