<p>Lethal concentrations (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) corresponding to the concentration that induced a 50% mortality were obtained by plotting the percentage of cumulative mortality at 96 hpf against logarithm of the different concentrations. A nonlinear regression (log (inhibitor) vs. response-variable slope was applied to obtain a sigmoid curve. In addition, morphological abnormalities such as spinal curvature, delay in pigmentation, delay in eye color, and delay hatching were recorded.
