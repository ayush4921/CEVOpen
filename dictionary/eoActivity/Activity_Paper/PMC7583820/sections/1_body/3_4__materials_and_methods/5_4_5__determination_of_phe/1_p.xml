<p>The total phenolic acid contents in acetone-evaporated and aqueous extracts were determined by using the Folin–Ciocalteu assay [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] with slight modifications. Briefly, in a 96-well microplate, 25 μL of plant extract, 125 μL of Folin-Ciocalteu’s phenol reagent (Sigma Aldrich), and 100 μL of 75 g/L sodium carbonate (Sigma) were added and incubated at 50 °C for 15 min and then at 4 °C for 3 min. The absorbance was measured at 760 nm (FLUOstar Optima, Bmg Labtech). A calibration curve between 12.5 and 300 µM was prepared using a standard solution of gallic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Darmstadt, Germany). The total phenolic acid contents were expressed as the mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per 100 g of dried plant powder.
