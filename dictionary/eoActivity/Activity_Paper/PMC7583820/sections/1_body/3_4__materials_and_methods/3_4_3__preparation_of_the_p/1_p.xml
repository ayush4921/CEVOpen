<p>Acetonic extract from 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> was obtained after dissolving 1 g of crushed leaves in 25 mL of an aqueous acetonic solution (70%, 
 <italic>v/v</italic>). After incubation at 4 °C for 90 min, the mixture was centrifuged at 3500 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min and the polyphenol-rich supernatant was collected and dried using a rotary evaporator. The extract was resuspended with an identical volume of E3 medium (classical embryonic medium), filtered with a 20 µm membrane, and stored at −20 °C until analysis.
