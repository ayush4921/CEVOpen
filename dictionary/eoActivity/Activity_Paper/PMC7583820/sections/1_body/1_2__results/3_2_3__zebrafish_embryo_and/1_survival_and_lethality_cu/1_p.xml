<p>In order to investigate the toxic effect of polyphenols-rich acetonic and aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic>, a Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity (FET) test was performed according to the OECD guidelines [

 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> (acetonic or aqueous extract) until 96 hpf (developmental day 4), the extract being freshly renewed every day. Within the first day (0–24 hpf), none of the embryos survived at the highest concentrations of acetonic (16.9 g/L) and aqueous (40–22.5 g/L) extracts (
