<p>Obviously, the mortality rate is dose-dependent (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04482-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D, the median lethal concentration (LC
 <sub>50</sub>) corresponding to the concentration that induced a 50% mortality was lower with the acetonic extract than with the aqueous extract (5 ± 0.2 vs. 17.6 ± 1.7 g/L, respectively), demonstrating the higher toxicity of the acetonic extract. At non-lethal concentrations (2.3 and 7.2 g/L for acetonic and aqueous extracts, respectively), incubation with polyphenols-rich acetonic and aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> leads to developmental delay and malformations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04482-f004">Figure 4</xref>A–D). Although a 90% hatching was measured in the E3 medium, a significant decrease of 75% and 38% in hatching was observed at 96 hpf for the acetonic (2.3 g/L) and aqueous (7.2 g/L) extracts, respectively. This percentage reached 0% at 7.2 g/L (acetonic) and 9.5 g/L (aqueous) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04482-f004">Figure 4</xref>B). For the hatched embryos who have been exposed to the two types of extracts, we observed 21 ± 3% and 15 ± 1.6% pericardial edema with 2.3 g/L of acetonic and aqueous extracts, respectively, this percentage reaching 50% with 7.2 g/L of aqueous extract (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04482-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). Spinal curvature was observed in 14 ± 2% and 15 ± 1.5% of these hatched embryos exposed, respectively, to acetonic and aqueous extracts, and reached 50% at 7.2 g/L of aqueous extract of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04482-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Taken together, these data demonstrate the deleterious impact of such non-lethal concentrations during zebrafish development.
