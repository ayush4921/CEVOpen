<p>The toxicity of polyphenols-rich acetonic and aqueous extracts from 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> was also studied in zebrafish larvae from 3 to 5 dpf. Indeed, at 3 dpf the swimming larvae already displayed functional livers and kidneys, allowing them to metabolize a variety of compounds [

 <xref rid="B27-molecules-25-04482" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. As a consequence, the toxicity of the respective extracts could be different in zebrafish embryos and larvae. By treating the zebrafish larvae for 2 days in a way similar to the embryos, the respective LC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined for both extracts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04482-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F). In embryos, the LC
 <sub>50</sub> is higher with the aqueous extract than with the acetonic one (20.3 g/L vs. 5.6 ± 0.4 g/L). In addition, although no significant differences in LC
 <sub>50</sub> were observed between the embryos and larvae, the LC
 <sub>50</sub> is weakly higher for larvae than for embryos (20.3 g/L vs. 17.6 ± 1.7 g/L, respectively). Our data strongly suggest that even at non-lethal concentrations, these extracts can lead to developmental defects.
