<p>In their traditional use, 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> leaves are used for herbal infusion. We assessed the antioxidant capacity of 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> aqueous extract and compared it with a polyphenols-rich extract obtained by acetonic solvent-assisted extraction, which is supposed to contain the maximal yield of polyphenols. To this end, an 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was performed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-04482-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, both extracts displayed, compared to ascorbic acid (40 g GAE/L) (94.7% ± 0.5%), an important antioxidant capacity of up to 90.7% ± 0.6% and 84.8% ± 1.2% (*

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 vs. 40 g/L (GAE) ascorbic acid) for polyphenol rich and aqueous extracts, respectively. The DPPH assay on both 
 <italic>A. borbonica</italic> extracts at different concentrations of 40, 30, 22.5, 16.9, 12.7, 9.5, 7.2, and 2.3 g GAE/L is shown in
