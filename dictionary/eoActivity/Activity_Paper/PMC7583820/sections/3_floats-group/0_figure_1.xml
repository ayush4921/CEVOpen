  <p>Antioxidant capacity, total phenolic acid, and flavonoid contents from 
   <italic>A. borbonica</italic> extracts. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Total antioxidant capacity of polyphenols-rich extracts from 
   <italic>A. borbonica</italic> was measured by a the 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. The results are expressed as the % of reduced DPPH. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Total phenolic contents of acetonic and aqueous extracts from 
   <italic>A. borbonica</italic> were determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu colorimetric assay at a concentration of 40 g/L (plant dried powder). The results are expressed as the mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g of plant dried powder. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Total flavonoid contents were determined using an aluminum chloride colorimetric assay. The results are expressed as the mg quercetin equivalent (QE)/100 g of plant dried powder. Data are the means ± SDs of three independent experiments. * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ***
