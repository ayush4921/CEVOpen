  <italic>Antirhea borbonica</italic> (
  <italic>A. borbonica</italic>) is an endemic plant from the Mascarene archipelago in the Indian Ocean commonly used in traditional medicine for its health benefits. This study aims (1) at exploring polyphenols profiles from two types of extracts—aqueous (herbal infusion) and acetonic (polyphenol rich) extracts from 
  <italic>A. borbonica</italic> leaves—and (2) at evaluating their potential toxicity in vivo for the first time. We first demonstrated that, whatever type of extraction is used, both extracts displayed significant antioxidant properties and acid phenolic and flavonoid contents. By using selective liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, we performed polyphenol identification and quantification. Among the 19 identified polyphenols, we reported that the main ones were caffeic acid derivatives and quercetin-3-
  <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside. Then, we performed a Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity test to assess the toxicity of both extracts following the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines. In both zebrafish embryos and larvae, the polyphenols-rich extract obtained by acetonic extraction followed by evaporation and resuspension in water exhibits a higher toxic effect with a median lethal concentration (LC
  <sub>50</sub>: 5.6 g/L) compared to the aqueous extract (LC
  <sub>50</sub>: 20.3 g/L). Our data also reveal that at non-lethal concentrations of 2.3 and 7.2 g/L for the polyphenol-rich extract and herbal infusion, respectively, morphological malformations such as spinal curvature, pericardial edema, and developmental delay may occur. In conclusion, our study strongly suggests that the evaluation of the toxicity of medicinal plants should be systematically carried out and considered when studying therapeutic effects on living organisms.
