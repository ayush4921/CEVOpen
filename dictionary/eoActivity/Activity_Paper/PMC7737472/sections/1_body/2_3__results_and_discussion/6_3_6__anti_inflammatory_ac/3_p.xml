<p>Nitric oxide plays an important role in inflammation. It is a key mediator in various phases of carrageenan-induced rat paw inflammation. It stimulates cyclooxygenase activity, which results in the overproduction of proinflammatory prostaglandins. It also reacts with superoxide anion to form the potent oxidant peroxynitrite, which plays a critical role in the inflammation process [
