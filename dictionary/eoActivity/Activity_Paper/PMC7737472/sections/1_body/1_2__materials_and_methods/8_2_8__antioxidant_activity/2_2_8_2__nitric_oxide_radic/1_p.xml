<p>Nitric oxide radical scavenging activity of plant extracts was measured using the Griess reagent [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This assay is based on the principle that decomposition of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in an aqueous solution at physiological pH (7.2) results in the production of nitric oxide, which under aerobic conditions interacts with oxygen to form nitrate and nitrite ions that can be quantitatively estimated using Griess reagent. Curcumin was taken as standard. Briefly, 1 mL of extract/standard (1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was mixed with 1 mL of 5 mM sodium nitroprusside solution in standard phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and incubated for 2.5 h at 29°C. After incubation, 2 mL of Griess reagent (sulphanilamide 1%, orthophosphoric acid 5%, and N-(1-Naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride 0.1%) was added to the reaction mixture, and the absorbance was measured at 546 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer.
