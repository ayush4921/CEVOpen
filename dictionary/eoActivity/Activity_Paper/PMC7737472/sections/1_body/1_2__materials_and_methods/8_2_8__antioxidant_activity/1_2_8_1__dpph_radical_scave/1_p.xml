 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and 60 
 <italic>μ</italic>M DPPH solution were mixed in a test tube. The reaction mixture was kept at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The absorbance of the solution was measured at 517 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800).
