<p>In this study, different heteroaryl mercapto compounds were combined with the phenolic group. The compounds 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-[(heteroaryl)thio]ethan-1-one 1–6 showed enzyme inhibitory potency at nanomolar concentrations. The compounds 2 and 4 were found potent AChE inhibitors with the Ki values of 22.13 ±1.96 nM and 23.71 ±2.95 nM, respectively, among others. On the other hand, based on the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, the compound 1 made attraction with the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 28.76 nM against AChE. The compounds 2 (Ki = 8.61 ±0.90 nM, on hCA I) and 1 (Ki = 8.76 ±0.84 nM, on hCA II) had also considerable CA inhibitory potency. The promising bioactivity results of these compounds can lead to the design of more potent enzyme inhibitors with additional molecular modifications for further studies.
