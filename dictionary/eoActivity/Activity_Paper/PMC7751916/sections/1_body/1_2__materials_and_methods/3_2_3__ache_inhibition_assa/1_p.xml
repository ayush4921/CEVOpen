<p>AChE inhibitory effects of the newly synthesized compounds were utilized by Ellman’s test [29] as previous studies with minor modifications [30–32]. Briefly, sample solution (750 μL) dissolved in deionized water with Tris/HCl buffer (100 μL, 1 M, pH = 8) at different concentrations, and then AChE solution (50 μL) was added. The final mix was incubated at 21 °C for 64 min. The reaction was initiated by acetylthiocholine iodide (50 μL). Then, 5,5′ -dithio-bis(2-nitro-benzoic)acid (50 μL, 0.5 mM) was added. The hydrolysis process was determined at 412 nm. As a control drug, Tacrine (TAC) was used. The inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated by the Lineweaver–Burk plot [33]. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Hamburg, Germany).</p>
