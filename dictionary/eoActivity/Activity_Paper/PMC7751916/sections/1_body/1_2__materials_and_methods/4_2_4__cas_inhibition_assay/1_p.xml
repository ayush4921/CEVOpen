<p>Human CA isoforms (hCAI and hCAII) were purified by the Sepharose - 4B - L - tyrosine - sulfanilamide affinity segregation method as reported [34, 35]. Bradford technique was used to measure protein concentrations at 595 nm [36]. Inhibitory effects of the compounds were investigated by measuring the esterase activity according to Verpoorte et al. [37] as described in previous [38–40]. The hCA activity was determined by measuring the conversion of thep-nitrophenyl acetate substrate to 
 <italic>p</italic> -nitro phenolate at 348 nm by the spectrophotometer (UV - VIS Spectrophotometer, UVmini-1240, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) [41]. Acetazolamide (AZA) was used as a control drug. Lineweaver–Burk plot was used to calculate inhibition constants (Ki) of the compounds [33]. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH.
