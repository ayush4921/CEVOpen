<p>Carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) are zinc bearing metalloenzymes which contribute to the controlling of pH balance by the acceleration of the hydration reaction of carbon dioxide in the living cells [14–16]. Regulation of CAs activity by using inhibitors is used in the clinic as antiglaucoma drugs and diuretics [17,18]. Besides, CAIs might have potential as anticancer, antiobesity, and antiinfective agents [19, 20]. To date, 15 α - CA isoforms in mammals have been reported. Among them, the cytosolic CA I and CA II isoforms are well-established targets for several diseases. While CA I is responsible for cerebral edema, CA II inhibition has a role for glaucoma, edema, altitude sickness, and epilepsy [21–23]. The sulfonamides and their bioisosteres (sulfamates, sulfamides, etc.) are the main pharmacophore groups which interact with the active site of CA isoenzymes [24]. For instance, sulfonamide having acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide (Figure 1) are widely used systemic antiglaucoma drugs in the clinic and these drugs have heterocyclic structures in their chemical skeleton. After that, the investigation of CA inhibition capacity and the mechanism of action of the phenol (Figure 1) led to design novel phenolic compounds targeting CA isoenzymes [25–27]. Hence, the substitution of phenol pharmacophore can be considered in the design strategy to have potent compounds with enhanced CA activity.</p>
