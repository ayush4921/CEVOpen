<p>Many heteroaromatic compounds such as benzoxazole [1], triazole [7], tetrazole [8], oxadiazole [6], and benzimidazol [9] which have the potency to make molecular interactions within the ChE enzyme were reported with their ChE inhibitory effects. In addition to these structures, the problematic process of AD directs scientists to search for new therapeutic multifunctional compounds [10,11]. Therefore, phenolic compounds might be a promising structure in the designing of novel AChEIs since the phenolic compounds exhibit cholinesterase inhibitory potency and antioxidant effects [12]. Recently, Sang et al. reported phenolic compounds as AChE inhibitors. In series, the compound, namely TM-3, showed a favorable AChE inhibitory effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.69 Î¼M. Molecular docking studies also showed that a 2,4-dihydroxyacetophenone nucleus interacts with the enzyme via intermolecular hydrogen bonds [13].
