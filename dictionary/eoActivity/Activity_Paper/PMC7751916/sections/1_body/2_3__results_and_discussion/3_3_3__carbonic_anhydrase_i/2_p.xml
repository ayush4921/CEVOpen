<p>Among the compounds having the most common bicyclic rings, the compound 2 (Ki = 8.61 ±0.90 nM) was 2.5 fold more potent inhibitor against hCAI while the compound 1 (Ki = 8.76 ±0.84 nM) was 2.0 fold more potent against hCAII isoenzyme than reference AZA. On the other hand, among the compounds carrying five-membered rings 3–6, the compound 4 (Ki = 13.81 ±2.47 nM) for hCAI, and the compound 5 (Ki = 14.32±5.10 nM) for hCAII were potent CA inhibitors. When diazole (3), triazole (5) and tetrazole (6) derivatives were compared, the following results can be made. The tetrazole derivative 6 had good inhibitory potency against hCAI while triazole derivative 5 was effective inhibitor against hCAII isoenzyme. In series, benzothiazole and benzoxazole bearing compounds 1 and 2 were found the most potent CA inhibitor against the hCAs with the lowest Ki values. Also, it can be stated here that linking bicyclic ring with phenol function was found more rewarding modification than five-membered rings. Additional aromatic hydrophobic interactions with the active site residues of the enzyme may result in increasing enzyme inhibitory potency of these compounds. For future studies, these phenolic compounds can be used to synthesize novel CAIs by the reaction of phenol group with suitable reagents to obtain new sulfamate-based CAIs to see how this modification affects the CAs inhibition activity.</p>
