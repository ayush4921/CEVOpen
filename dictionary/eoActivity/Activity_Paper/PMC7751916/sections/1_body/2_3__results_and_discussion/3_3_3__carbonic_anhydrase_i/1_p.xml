<p>Since the phenol group is an important zinc-binding group, the compounds 1–6 were evaluated towards CAs isoenzymes to show their CA inhibitory potency. The Table showed that the Ki values of reference drug AZA were 21.74 ±5.48 nM and 18.27 ±3.56 nM, whereas the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of AZA were 23.90 nM and 18.73 nM towards hCAI and II, respectively. Ki values of 1–6 were calculated as 8.61 ±0.90 – 42.59 ±7.59 nM (hCAI) and 8.76 ±0.84 – 31.64 ±3.29 nM (hCAII).
