<p>As a spectral evaluation, in 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR, methylene protons were seen in the range of 5.07–4.49 ppm as expected. In some cases, the phenolic proton was not seen since it is an exchangeable proton. Signal of methyl substituent for the methyl-substituted compounds was seen in the range of 3.97–2.63 ppm. The carbonyl peak of the compounds in 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR was seen in the range of 191.0–192.6 ppm. The carbon peak of the methylene bridge was seen at 49.1–41.1 ppm, while the carbon signal of methyl was in the range of 34.1–15.6 ppm. Further, calculated and measured m/z values of the compounds were also found compatible in HRMS analysis. In the IR spectra, C=O stretching band was recorded in the range of 1655–1672 cm
