<p>This study reported the synthesis and bioactivities of the compounds having 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-((aryl)thio) ethanones chemical formula. 2-Bromo-4â€™-hydroxyacetophenone was attached to the heterocyclic rings via thioether functional group by conducting a single step reaction. The compounds 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were found as registered compounds at the Sci Finder database without any article and experimental data, while compound 4 [42] was reported as an intermediate. Therefore, the current study is the first study for the synthesis and bioactivities of 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.</p>
