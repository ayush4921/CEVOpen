<p>The compounds reported might be potential candidates for designing novel and more powerful AChE inhibitors for future studies. AD drugs such as donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine have amine moiety in their chemical structure. So, the compounds having nitrogen atom/s may show favorable enzyme-ligand interactions [43]. Also, for the future concept, the most potent amine bearing phenolic compounds can be synthesized with Mannich reaction by the reaction of amine, formaldehyde, and phenolic compound under suitable reaction conditions as mono or bis Mannich bases against AChE based on our previous work regarding Mannich bases as promising AChE inhibitors [30].</p>
