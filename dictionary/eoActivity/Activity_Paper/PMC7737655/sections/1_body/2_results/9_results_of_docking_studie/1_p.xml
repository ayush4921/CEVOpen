<p>Our research group has already explored the synergistic effects of constituents of different plant extracts against α-glucosidase 
 <italic>via</italic> docking simulations (Nadeem et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2020a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Farooq et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Hence, we also performed docking simulations in order to correlate the 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> results and to explore the possible role of putative bioactive compounds identified in the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>Eryngium caeruleum</italic>. A Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software package was used for this purpose. These putative bioactive compounds identified in the chloroform fraction of 
 <italic>Eryngium caeruleum</italic> were tested 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> against α-glucosidase from Baker's yeast. The 3-D structure of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Baker's yeast) has not yet been reported. Hence, we performed docking simulations by using our previously reported Homology modeled α-glucosidase (Ali et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
