<p>In the chromatogram of methanolic extract, various components are separated in different ratios. The ratios of some distinct peaks are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> with their retention times. The highest concentrated signal was observed at a retention time of 22.96 min which was 22.78%. All the other signals especially after 10 min, were smaller. On the other hand, the HPLC spectrum of chloroform fraction was observed to be different with respect to the nature and ratios of components. After retention time 10, various peaks were observed in dominant ratios, which shows the possible solubility of these components in chloroform. The dominant peaks after a retention time of 10 min were observed at 14.06, 14.97, 15.89, 16.08, 18.83, 20.20, 21.91, 28.05, 34.18, 37.91, and 40.24 min. All the peaks with their retention times and ratios are shown in
