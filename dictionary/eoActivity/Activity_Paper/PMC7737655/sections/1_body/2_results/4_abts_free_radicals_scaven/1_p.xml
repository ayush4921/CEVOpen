<p>In ABTS anti-radicals assay, Ec.Chf displayed the highest activity causing 75.13 ± 0.69, 67.23 ± 0.61, 60.56 ± 0.42, and 54.06 ± 0.58% scavenging of free radicals at concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml, respectively. Ec.Cr was equally effective causing 72.30 ± 0.62, 64.13 ± 0.46, 53.26 ± 0.59, and 46.16 ± 0.60 μg/ml respectively at concentrations of 1,000, 500, 250, and 125 μg/ml, respectively. For Ec.Chf and Ec.Cr the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 109 and 175 μg/ml respectively. Ec.EtAc, Ec.Hex, and Ec.Aq showed 69.10 ± 0.66, 66.16 ± 0.44, and 57.20 ± 0.41 at highest tested concentration attaining IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 200, 332, and 590 μg/ml, respectively. In scavenging of ABTS free radicals, the standard drug ascorbic acid exhibited 89.10 ± 0.49, 81.20 ± 0.41, 70.36 ± 0.57, and 63.26 ± 0.67% inhibitions respectively at the same concentrations with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 60 μg/ml (
