<p>The GC-MS analysis of the most active fraction (i.e., the chloroform fraction was performed as described). A total number of 60 compounds were identified in the GC-MS analysis of chloroform fraction (
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Various parameters provided for the major identified compounds are summarized in 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. The chromatogram of this fraction representing various peaks is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Out of these compounds, 15 were found to be in dominant concentrations (compounds 
 <bold>A</bold>-
 <bold>O</bold>), which are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>. Furthermore, we assessed overall GC-MS analysis of the chloroform fraction and found some interesting bioactive compounds which might be responsible for the proposed activities. These compounds include triacontane, tocopherol, 2,5-phyrrolidione, N-[2-(thienyl)acetyloxyl], methyl palmitate, cyclohexene, 3-(1,5-dimethyl-4-hexenyl)-6-methylene, phytol, neophytadiene, thymol, falcarinol, and linolenic acid as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>.
