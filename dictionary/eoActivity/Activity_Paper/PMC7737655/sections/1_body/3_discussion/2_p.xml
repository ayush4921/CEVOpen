<p>In the current study, we screened various solvent extracts from 
 <italic>Eryngium caeruleum</italic> against Î±-glucosidase enzyme and a number of free radicals both of which are important targets in the management of type 2 DM. Although the percent of inhibitions of crude extracts were low in comparison to the standard drug, the presence of active anti-glucosidase constituents were still observed. The Ec.Chf was observed to be more potent as compared to other fractions in all 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> assays. Similarly, the Ec.Chf was also found to be effective in 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> antidiabetic assay at various concentrations. The first extracted fraction was with n-hexane which probably showed less potency due to the presence of non-polar and inactive compounds. In comparison, the next two fractions (i.e., with chloroform and ethyl acetate were relatively effective). One of the reasons for their effectiveness might be the solubility of active polar organic compounds in it. The remaining aqueous fraction was the least active. A major reason was that the majority of the active polar compounds tend to be extracted with chloroform and ethyl acetate, leaving a very small ratio of remaining compounds in the last fraction. For the preliminary identification of active compounds GC followed by GC-MS analysis of the active fraction was performed. We observed that 15 compounds were in greater concentration. Apart from the GC-MS analysis, further fingerprinting of 
 <italic>E. caeruleum</italic> has been performed with the help of HPLC-DAD. The GC-MS and HPLC-DAD reveal the importance of 
 <italic>E. caeruleum</italic> in terms of natural compounds.
