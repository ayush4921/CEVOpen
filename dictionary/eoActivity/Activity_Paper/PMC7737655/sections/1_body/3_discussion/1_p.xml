<p>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors represent a group of antidiabetic drugs that regulate postprandial hyperglycemia through inhibition of carbohydrates digestion in the small intestine and thus hamper the diet associated with acute glucose excursion (Dwek et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Among these drugs, acarbose and voglibose have got substantial attention in the past decades due to their effectiveness in controlling type 2 DM (Scheen, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Acarbose is a natural product obtained from the fermentation of 
 <italic>Actinoplanes</italic> species (Truscheit et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>). Apart from presently available drugs, several herbal medicines have been recommended for the management DM. Traditional medicinal plants and plants-based remedies are used all over the world for a range of diseases, including DM (Aslam et al.,

 <italic>Euclea undulata</italic> var. 
 <italic>myrtina, Schkuhria pinnata, Pteronia divaricata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Elaeodendron transvaalense</italic> which are traditionally used against DM were scientifically proved (Deutschl√§nder et al.,

 <italic>Calamintha origanifolia, Satureja thymbra, Prangosasperula, Sideritis perfoliata, Asperula glomerata, Hyssopus officinalis, Erythraea centaurium, Marrubium radiatum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salvia acetabulosa</italic> were recently reported to possess strong anti- glucosidase potentials (Loizzo et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Likewise, the solvent extracts prepared from 
 <italic>Azadirachta indica, Murraya koenigii, Ocimum tenuflorum, Syzygium cumini, Linum usitatissimum</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bougainvillea spectabilis</italic> which are ethno-botanically known medicinal plants against DM was reported to possess anti-glucosidase potentials (Bhat et al.,
