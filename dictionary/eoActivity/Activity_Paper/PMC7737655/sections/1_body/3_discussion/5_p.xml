<p>As discussed in the Introduction section, the isolated two new flavone glycosides reported by Rehman et al. were evaluated for their potential against α-glucosidase, aldose reductase (ALR1 and ALR2). Compounds were only found active against ALR1 and ALR2 and were not able to show α- β-glucosidase inhibition and antiglycation potential. Docking studies were performed only on aldose reductase targets. In the current study, we performed a docking experiment to justify the synergistic effect of all these isolated bioactive compounds. The data obtained from docking studies agrees with the α-glucosidase inhibition activity. The computed binding energy of standard drug acarbose is −9.2756 kcal/mol. Putative bioactive compounds showed binding energy values in the range of −7.7008 to −4.5388 kcal/mol. Among simulated constituents, tocopherol showed best binding energy (−7.7008 kcal/mol). While the binding energy from major phytoconstituents identified by GC-MS analysis were found in the range of −6.6118 to −4.0372 kcal/mol. The highest affinity was shown by bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (
