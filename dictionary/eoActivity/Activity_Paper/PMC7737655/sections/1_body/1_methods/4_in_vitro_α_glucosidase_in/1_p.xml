<p>The α-glucosidase inhibitory potentials of solvent extracts from 
 <italic>E. caeruleum</italic> were investigated following the reported protocol (Aslam et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The enzyme solution was made by dissolving 0.5 unit/ml in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). The final concentration of enzyme solution was 20 μl α-glucosidase (0.5 unit/ml). Whereas, 
 <italic>p</italic>-Nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (5 mM) was made in the same buffer (pH 6.9) which acted as substrate for the reaction. Test samples prepared were mixed with the enzyme solution and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Finally, 20 μl substrate solution was added to the enzyme mixture and was incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The reaction was completed by the addition of 80 μl of 0.2 M sodium carbonate solution. Absorbances were measured at 405 nm using UV spectrophotometer (Thermo electron corporation, USA). The system without α-glucosidase was used as the blank and acarbose was the positive control. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate and percent inhibitions were calculated using the following formula;
