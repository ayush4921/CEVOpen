<p>Molecular docking studies were made by Molecular-Operating Environment (MOE-2016.08) (Munir et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Docking study for α-glucosidase enzyme was performed on our previously reported homology modeled α-glucosidase (Ali et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Preparation of ligand's downloaded enzymes such as determination of binding sites, energy minimization and 3-D protonation was performed by previously reported methods (Iftikhar et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Ullah et al., 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Tanoli et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Docking results were interpreted, and their surfaces were analyzed with graphical representation utilizing discovery-studio visualizer (Biovia, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).
