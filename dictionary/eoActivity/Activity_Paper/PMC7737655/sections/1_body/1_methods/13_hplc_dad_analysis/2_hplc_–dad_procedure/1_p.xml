<p>The determination of various compounds' peaks was carried out by means of an Agilent 1260 infinity High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system, having basic parts like quaternary pump, auto-sampler, degasser and ultraviolet array detector (UVAD). The separation was achieved via Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 column. The gradients system comprises of solvent B (methanol: acetic acid; deionized water, 100: 20: 180, v/v) and solvent C (methanol : acetic acid : deionized water, 900: 20: 80, v/v). The efficient gradient program was started with 100% B at 0 min, 85% B at 5 min, 50% B at 20 min, 30% B at 25 min, and 100% C from 30 to 40 min (Zeb et al.,
