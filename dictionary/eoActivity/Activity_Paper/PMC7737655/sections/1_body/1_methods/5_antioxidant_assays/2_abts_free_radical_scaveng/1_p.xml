<p>The ABTS free radical scavenging potential of Plant samples were tested following previously published procedure (Zafar et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Briefly, solutions of ABTS 7 mM and potassium persulphate (K
 <sub>2</sub>S
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>) 2.45 mM were mixed and stored in a dark place at room temperature for about 12–16 h to obtain a dark colored solution. This solution was diluted using Phosphate buffer (0.01 M) pH 7.4 and absorbance value was adjusted to 0.70 at 734 nm. Finally, 300 μl solution of the test sample was added to 3.0 ml of ABTS solution in cuvette and was analyzed using a UV spectrophotometer (Thermo electron corporation, USA) at 734 nm. Reduction in absorbances was determined following 1 min of mixing the solutions and analysis was continued for 6 min. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. The assay was repeated in triplicate and percentage inhibition was calculated using the formula;
