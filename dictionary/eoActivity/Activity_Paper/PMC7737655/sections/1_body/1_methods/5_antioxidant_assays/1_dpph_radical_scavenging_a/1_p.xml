<p>DPPH free radical scavenging ability of test samples were tested according to previously reported procedures (Shah et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Zahoor et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Samples solutions were prepared ranging from 125 to 1,000 Î¼g/ml and were added to 0.004% methanolic solution of DPPH. Following incubation for 30 min, absorbance values were recorded at 517 nm using UV spectrophotometer (Thermo electron corporation, USA). DPPH scavenging activities were calculated as;
