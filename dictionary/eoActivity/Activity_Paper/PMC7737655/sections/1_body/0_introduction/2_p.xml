<p>Among the currently available synthetic drugs that target the dual metabolic defects of type 2 DM that are impaired insulin secretion and insulin resistance, some of these drugs produce some serious side effects at high doses (Carroll et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Therefore, the main goal of anti-diabetic research is to discover anti-hyperglycemic agents that are comparatively safe with fewer side effects. In this regard, research has begun to study traditional medicines and foods for the discovery of new therapeutic drugs against type 2 DM. Traditional medicines including plants and herbal extracts have a long history of use as anti-diabetic agents (Grover et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Indeed, a lot of medicinal plants have been reported inhibiting the activity of α-glucosidase (Bnouham et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Dietary α-glucosidase inhibitors that act by inhibiting the enzymatic breakdown of starch, soluble carbohydrates, and their derived products have been recognized as a potential natural and safe approach for reduction of hyperglycemia via modulation of meal derived glucose absorption (Bischoff,
