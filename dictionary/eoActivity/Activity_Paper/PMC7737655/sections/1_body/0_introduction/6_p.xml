<p>We previously reported the antimicrobial properties of 
 <italic>E. caeruleum</italic> (Sadiq et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). As is obvious from the current literature, only the essential oil of this plant has been explored up to some extent with excellent pharmacological activities (Saeedi and Morteza-Semnani, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The plant powder and extract of 
 <italic>E. caeruleum</italic> are still to be explored. Moreover, the isolated chemicals by Rehman et al. were not able to show α- β-glucosidase inhibition and antiglycation potential. Being unexplored and one of the specie of important genus, this investigational study was inevitable. Therefore, the current investigational study is arranged to assay various solvent fractions of 
 <italic>E. caeruleum</italic> for inhibitions of α-glucosidase and free radicals followed by GC-MS analysis of the most potent solvent fraction.
