<p>In DM, hyperglycemia set free reactive oxygen species (ROS) called free radicals, which subsequently cause lipid peroxidation, membrane damage and play a vital role in the initiation of secondary complications of kidneys, eyes, blood vessels, nervous system, and DM (Hunt et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>). Numerous studies established that oxidative stress is implicated in the development of insulin resistance via inhibition of insulin signals and adipokines dysregulation (Houstis et al.,
