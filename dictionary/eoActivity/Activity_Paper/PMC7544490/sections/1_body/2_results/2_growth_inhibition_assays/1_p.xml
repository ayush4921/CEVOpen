 <italic>gingivalis</italic> at 256 μg/mL were defined as hits. The hits from this screen, 38 extracts from 17 plants, were chosen for a second screening at 64 μg/mL. The second screen yielded 21 extracts from 11 plants that were considered as hits (&gt;90% inhibition) and were further selected for MIC assays by dose-response testing (

 <italic>Pistacia lentiscus</italic> fruits exhibited the best MIC with a value of 8 μg/mL, followed by 
 <italic>Zanthoxylum armatum</italic> fruits/seeds with an MIC of 16 μg/mL. Ten plant extracts had an MIC of 32 μg/mL, and eight had an MIC of 64 μg/mL (
