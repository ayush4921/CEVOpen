<p>Another solution for

 <italic>gingivalis</italic> infections could come from medicinal plants. Not only are plant species a rich source of antibacterials [

 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Indeed, there is a vast wealth of recorded ethnobotanical information concerning the use of plants for oral health. For example, clove oil (
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (L.) Merr. &amp; L.M. Perry, Myrtaceae) is widely used for managing dental pain; the twigs of miswak (
 <italic>Salvadora persica</italic> L., Salvadoraceae) are used as a toothbrush in the Middle East and Africa, and neem twigs (
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic> L., Meliaceae) are employed as oral deodorant, toothache reliever, tongue cleaner and toothbrush in Asia [

 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic> have found antimicrobial activity, but often only at high concentrations; for example, a 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> peel extract and an extract of 
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> were both found to have MICs (minimum inhibitory concentrations) of 12.5 mg/mL [
