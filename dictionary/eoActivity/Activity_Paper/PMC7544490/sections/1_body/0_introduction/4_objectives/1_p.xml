 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic> is linked to dental diseases (especially periodontitis) and ethnobotanical data on the long-standing use of plants for oral hygiene and in the treatment of dental disorders could serve as a guide to identifying natural products with activity against this pathogen.
