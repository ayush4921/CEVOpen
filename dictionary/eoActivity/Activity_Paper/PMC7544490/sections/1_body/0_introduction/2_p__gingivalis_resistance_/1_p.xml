<p>Currently, periodontitis is treated with systemic and local antibiotics and occasionally surgery to reach deep-pocket inflammation [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Antibiotics are used to target anaerobic bacteria, especially 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic>. A variety of antibiotics are employed, including metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin, tetracycline and fluoroquinolones [

 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic> strains show resistance levels as high as 21.56% to metronidazole, 25.49% to amoxicillin, and 23.52% to clindamycin [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Significant levels of resistance have also been recorded for penicillin, erythromycin, azithromycin, and tetracycline [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While antibiotic resistance is rising, new antimicrobials are increasingly necessary, but in recent years there has in fact been a decrease in the discovery of new antibiotics [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To counteract this lack of drug discovery, new treatments for 
 <italic>P</italic>. 
 <italic>gingivalis</italic> have been documented. This includes photo-activated disinfection, small molecule inhibitors, local drug delivery systems, and immune-based therapy [
