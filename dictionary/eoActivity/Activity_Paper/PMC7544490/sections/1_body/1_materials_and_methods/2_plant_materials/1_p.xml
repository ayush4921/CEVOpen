<p>The QNPL is a plant extract library composed of 2,000 extracts from 600 plant species belonging to 52 plant families. All plants have been collected under appropriate permits and with express permission from landowners. All of the extracts are stored in the phytochemistry laboratory of the Quave Research Group (Emory University, Atlanta, GA, US). A voucher specimen for each species is also deposited at the Emory University Herbarium (GEO). Various plant parts from the same plant species were extracted with different solvents. For aqueous extractions, samples were extracted in Type II distilled water at a ratio of 1 g plant material:10 mL H
 <sub>2</sub>O and boiled for 20 minutes. The extraction products were then filtered after cooling at room temperature, concentrated using a rotary evaporator (Buchi®, Flawil, Switzerland), and then shell-frozen and lyophilized for 24 hours. For methanol and ethanol extractions, plant materials were mixed at a ratio of 1 g:10 mL with 80% methanol and 80 or 95% ethanol respectively for 72 hours under constant agitation. This step was repeated one time using the same plant residue, and then both extraction products were filtered and combined. The alcoholic filtrate was concentrated using a rotary evaporator, shell-frozen and lyophilized for 24 hours. All extracts were stored dry at -20°C before being dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a stock concentration of 10 mg/mL for the assays.
