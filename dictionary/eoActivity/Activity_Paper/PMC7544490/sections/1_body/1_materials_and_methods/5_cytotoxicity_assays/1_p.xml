<p>Human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaTs) were used to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of plant extracts on human gingival cells. HaCaTs represent a suitable substitute for gingival keratinocytes and are often used as such because they can be easily grown and passaged indefinitely [
 <xref rid="pone.0239316.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. HaCaTs were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with L-glutamine and 4.5 g/L glucose (Corning®, Corning, NY), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Seradigm®, Randor, PA) and a 1X solution of 100 IU penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Corning®, Corning, NY). The Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity activity following manufacturer’s instructions (LDH assay kit, G-Biosciences, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, HaCaT cells were first standardized to a concentration of 4 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/mL using a hemocytometer, and then incubated for 48 hours (5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>) in 96-well flat-bottom tissue culture treated plates (Falcon®, Corning, NY). Then, treatments were added to HaCaT cells at a concentration range of 4–512 μg/mL or 1–128 μg/mL via serial dilution and incubated for 24 hours. Cells were then processed, and OD was measured at 490nm to determine the proportion of lysed cells. Cytotoxicity was calculated using the following formula: (
 <italic>ODtest</italic> − 
 <italic>OD
  <sub>spontaneous</sub>
 </italic>)/(
 <italic>OD
  <sub>max</sub>
 </italic>)*100, where OD
 <sub>max</sub> is the OD
 <sub>490nm</sub> read for wells treated with lysis buffer after incubation to achieve maximum of cell lysis, and OD
 <sub>spontaneous</sub> is the OD
 <sub>490nm</sub> read for wells without treatment. Selectivity index (SI) was defined as the following: SI = (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of extracts against human keratinocytes)/(IC
 <sub>50</sub> of extracts against 
 <italic>P</italic>.
