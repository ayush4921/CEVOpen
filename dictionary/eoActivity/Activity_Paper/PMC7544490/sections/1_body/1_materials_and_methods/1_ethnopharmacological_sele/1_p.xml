<p>We performed a literature search by reviewing books related to medical botany and Native American plants, articles published in the 
 <italic>Journal of Ethnopharmacology</italic>, and scientific articles found in the PubMed database. This literature search was not a comprehensive systematic review. We sought plants that have been used for oral hygiene or for symptoms of periodontitis including toothache, sore mouth, mouth abscesses, loose teeth, and halitosis. Specific keywords were used to search the online databases, such as “medicinal plant,” combined with terms related to dental disorders, any symptoms of periodontitis, and oral hygiene/health, such as “oral health,” “oral hygiene,” “dental disorders,” “toothache,” “halitosis,” “sore throat.” For each plant species, we recorded information on plant family, genus, species, part of plant used, medical systems, and application. After compiling these sources, all reported plant names were cross-checked for accuracy with The Plant List (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.theplantlist.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.theplantlist.org/</ext-link>), and any botanical synonyms or citations with unaccepted author epithets were updated to the current corrected nomenclature. Then, an additional literature search was performed to check whether the plant species had been previously tested against 
 <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic>. The plant list created from this review was cross-checked with the extracts contained in the Quave Natural Product Library (QNPL), an in-house plant extract library developed in our laboratory. Matches were sorted according to priority level. Priority levels were defined as follows: 1) genus, species, and plant part match; 2) genus and species match, but different plant part; 3) genus and part match; 4) genus, species, and part match but the plant is part of a multi-ingredient medicine.
