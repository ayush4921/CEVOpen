<p>The new DoPs indicator proved to be a valuable tool that fills a gap compared to other ethnopharmacological tools. Other than existing field assessment tools, e.g., the relative frequency of citation, the fidelity level, the use value, and the informant consensus factor, the DoPs tool can be leveraged to better identify those species that are understudied and merit deeper investigation. This includes using the tool for selection of species for costly lab studies, thereby avoiding reproduction of results, while facilitating a more time-efficient approach to ethnopharmacological research. When applied by other researchers in the future, another value of the new tool will be that gaps in the literature could be filled more strategically, making ethnopharmacological research more targeted and efficient.</p>
