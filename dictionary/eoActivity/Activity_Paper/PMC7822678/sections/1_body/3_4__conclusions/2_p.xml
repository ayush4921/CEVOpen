<p>Generally, there was no significant correlation between the DoPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the RFCs (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) of individual plant species, previously published by Schultz et al. [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This is most likely due to the fact that the species are highly used within the study area (Greater Mpigi region, Uganda) but occur interregionally on the African continent, and some are even native to other continents (e.g., 
 <italic>M. lycopodioides</italic> or 
 <italic>T. asiatica</italic>). From the literature survey, it was noted that other natural plant habitats and ethnic groups than the people of the Greater Mpigi region were more often surveyed in the past, followed by ethnopharmacological lab studies of some of the plant species. In conclusion, the discrepancy between high regional medicinal use and low DoPs confirms the demand for studying the diverse cultures and ethnomedical practices of the Greater Mpigi region, in particular, and the 16 selected species, in general.
