<p>It should be noted that focusing on a logic approach to the field of ethnopharmacology, such as (a) starting with ethnobotanical/ethnopharmacological field studies; (b) continuing with validation of traditional medicine via 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacological assays in the lab, and (c) progressing to bioassay-guided fractionation, natural product isolation and structure elucidation studies, cannot always, though in most cases, be applied within the field. One such example would be ritual use or where pharmacological effects cannot be “measured,” which would still be of value to the field, e.g., with symbolic significance to an indigenous community. Here, it would be categorized under the DoP
 <sub>traditional use</sub>, thus recognized, and lab studies may not follow.
