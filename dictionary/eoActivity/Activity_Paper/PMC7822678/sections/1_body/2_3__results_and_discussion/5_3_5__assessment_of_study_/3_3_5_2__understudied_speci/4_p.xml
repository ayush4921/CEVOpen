 <italic>P. hadiensis</italic> has been only mentioned to be traditionally used (DoP
 <sub>traditional use</sub>) in three ethnobotanical studies so far. One paper described the use of leaves for wound healing in the Malabar Region of Kerala, India [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Another article reported the use of seeds and stem bark as a fishing poison in South Africa [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The third article mentioned 
 <italic>P. hadiensis</italic> and related species in the context of medicinal plant use to treat respiratory infections, digestive disorders, and skin infections [
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. Following these ethnobotanical data, the plant's leaves have recently been reported in a preliminary study to display antibacterial activity against 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, isolated from wounds in Bushenyi district, Uganda [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. A study investigated the antibacterial effect of the essential oil from the aerial parts against 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. mutans</italic>, which showed no significant activity [
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Another study published by the same group investigated the antioxidant activity of the aerial parts [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. A leaf extract displayed low larvicidal activity against the fourth instar larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, a dengue fever vector (LC
 <sub>50</sub>: 489.278 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. A terpene-rich methanolic extract of the shoot part and a methanolic extract of the stem was investigated for cytotoxicity using a shrimp brine lethality assay (LC
 <sub>50</sub>: 145 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL) and against HeLa cells (141.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Other studies include (a) antibacterial susceptibility single dose and antioxidant activity studies [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>–
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]; (b) two studies investigating the antioxidant, antiproliferative, and antiinflammatory properties of the shoot parts [
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]; and (c) a study screening several 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> species, including 
 <italic>P. hadiensis</italic>, for antiinflammatory effects [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Isolation and structure elucidation of compounds from 
 <italic>P. hadiensis</italic> (DoP
 <sub>structure</sub>
 <sub>elucidation</sub>) resulted in five new abietane-type diterpenoids (7
 <italic>β</italic>-acetoxy-6
 <italic>β</italic>-hydroxyroyleanone, 7
 <italic>β</italic>, 6
 <italic>β</italic>-dihydroxyroyleanone, 11,20-dihydroxysugiol, 11-hydroxysugiol, 1,11-epoxy-6,12-dihydroxy-20-norabieta-1(10), and 5,8,11,13-pentaen-7-one) [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], a known stereoisomer (7
 <italic>α</italic>-acetoxy-6
 <italic>β</italic>-hydroxyroyleanone) [
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], carnosolon [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], and 25 known compounds detected in the essential oil extracted from the seeds [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. A terpenoid fraction of 
 <italic>P. hadiensis</italic>, containing 1-octern-ol, linalool, nerol, Z-citral, geraniol, neryl acetate, 
 <italic>α</italic>-copaene, geranyl acetate, 
 <italic>δ</italic>-cadinene, 
 <italic>β</italic>-cubebene, 
 <italic>α</italic>-cadinol, and valencene induced apoptosis in human colon cancer HCT15 cells [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].
