<p>Concerning 
 <italic>S. aculeastrum</italic> and the DoP
 <sub>traditional use</sub>, multiple medicinal uses were recorded. These include traditional use of (a) the berries and leaves in treatment of lymphatic filariasis in the KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga regions of South Africa [
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]; (b) the berries, leaves, roots, and bark against cancer in the Kakamega county of Kenya and Eastern Cape Province of South Africa [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]; (c) the roots to treat stomachache in Limpopo Province of South Africa [
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]; and (d) the berry juice against 
 <italic>ditlapedi</italic> (a facial skin condition) in the Central Sekhukhuneland of South Africa [
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Although the practice is regarded by Rwandan women as “a positive force in their lives,” 
 <italic>S. aculeastrum</italic> has been described as being used as medicine applied during stretching sessions for elongation of the labia minora, which is classified as Type IV female genital mutilation by the World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Publications, categorized under the DoP
 <sub>bioactivity</sub>, reported low antioxidant activity of the berries and low antimicrobial activity of the berries and leaves against ten bacterial and five fungal strains [
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>–
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. A methanolic extract from the berries displayed low activity in inhibiting the growth of promastigotes in 
 <italic>Leishmania major</italic> infection in BALB/c mice (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 78.62 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/ml) [
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Methanolic extracts of the berries showed antiproliferative activity against human HeLa, MCF7, and HT29 tumour cell lines, while the leaf extracts displayed no cytotoxic activity [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. In another study, the methanolic extracts of the leaves and the berries showed moderate activity against host snails of schistosomiasis [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. MeOH-CH2Cl2 (1 : 1, v/v) extracts from the stem bark and the berries showed growth inhibitory activity against five African livestock pathogens of the genus 
 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic>, displaying a mean MIC value of 20 
 <italic>µ</italic>g/mL [
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. One acute toxicity study of an extract of the unripe berries in Wistar rats resulted in toxicity symptoms such as respiratory distress, epistaxis, and hypoactivity that disappeared 72 h after treatment. Above 125 mg/kg body weight, the extract produced mortality in the Wistar rats, and the latency was inversely proportional to the doses [
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Another study investigated the toxicological effect of the aqueous extract of fresh, dried, and boiled berries in male Wistar rats at 1, 10, and 25 mg/kg body weight for 28 days. The rats gained weight, but showed no signs of clinical toxicity at the doses tested [
 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Concerning the DoP
 <sub>structure elucidation</sub>, two new steroidal alkaloids were isolated from the root bark, along with known compounds such as solamargine and 
 <italic>ß</italic>-solamargine [
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Steroid alkaloids, namely, solasodine and tomatidine, isolated from the berries, displayed cytotoxic effects on the growth of HeLa, MCF7, and HT29 cancer cell lines and antioxidant properties [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Solamargine, isolated from the berries, induced nonselective cytotoxicity and P-glycoprotein inhibition [
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Volatile oil fractions from the leaves and berries were investigated via GC-MS analysis and contained mainly alkanes and alkenes [
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].
