<p>Statistical analysis of the DoP “Other” resulted in the identification of three journals that were most abundant: the 
 <italic>African Journal of Ecology</italic> (4.2%, 8 articles, COPE member), the 
 <italic>African Journal of Biotechnology</italic> (2.6%, 5 articles), and the 
 <italic>Uganda Journal of Agricultural Sciences</italic> (2.6%, 5 articles). Moreover, the majority of papers, including their corresponding journals, were summarized as “Other” (&lt;2.5% of articles in DoP “Other” published in this journal), consisting of a total of 173 articles (90.6%) printed in 138 different journals, whereas only 58 of these are COPE members.

 <italic>Plant Ecology</italic>, 
 <italic>Oecologia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Advanced Journal of Ecology and Ecosystems</italic>), animal sciences (e.g., 
 <italic>Journal of Advanced Veterinary and Animal Research</italic> and 
 <italic>Livestock Science</italic>), and insect studies (e.g., 
 <italic>Journal of Applied Entomology</italic>, 
 <italic>Journal of Insect Physiology</italic>, 
 <italic>Applied Entomology and Zoology</italic>, and 
 <italic>Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata</italic>) to more abstract journals (e.g., 
 <italic>Polymers</italic>, 
 <italic>International Journal of Creative Research Thoughts</italic>, 
 <italic>International Journal of Cosmetic Science</italic>, 
 <italic>Journal of Archaeological Science</italic>, and
