 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the distribution of papers by DoPs. A total of 191 publications (30.1%) were allocated to the DoP “Other,” as these were mostly non-field-related publications and a few review papers. Reference to the plant species of interest was often in the form of documentation of traditional knowledge and medicinal application, and those papers were allocated to the DoP “Traditional use” (139 papers). This represents 21.9% of all original research publications mentioning one of the 16 plant species or about a third of all field-related publications (31.5%). With 186 articles (42.2%), the largest share of field-related publications were classified to the DoP “Bioactivity,” depicting the importance of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of traditional use and pharmacology activity in the field of ethnopharmacology. DoP “Bioactivity” categorized articles made up 29.3% of all published papers (including DoP “Other”). As this is the final stage of the bioassay-guided fractionation methodology in drug discovery, original research dealing with structure elucidation of bioactive compounds made up the smallest share (DoP “Structure elucidation” = 116), representing 18.3% of all recorded publications and 26.3% of the field-related publications (without DoP “Other”).
