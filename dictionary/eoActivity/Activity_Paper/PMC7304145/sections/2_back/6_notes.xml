 <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
 <p id="Par90">Ethical considerations were addressed prior to starting the interviewing process with each participant. The purpose of the interview and study was explained verbally to each one of the informants. Their consent was requested for recording the process and using the provided information for the purposes of scientific research. Respondents were explicitly notified that their participation is voluntary, confidential, and non-identifiable. All participants agreed to give consent before moving on to the data collection processes. There was a single exception of an informant that did not agree on the voice recording.</p>
 <p id="Par91">A solemn declaration to the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, including all the previously mentioned statements was signed after the completion of the data collection process.</p>
