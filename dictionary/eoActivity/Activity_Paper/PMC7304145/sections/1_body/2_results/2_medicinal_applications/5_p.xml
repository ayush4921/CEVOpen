<p id="Par38">Even if people were asked to describe only the medicinal applications for each of the harvested plants, some mentioned additional uses. Species like

 <italic>T. capitata</italic>, 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic>, 
 <italic>Asparagus acutifolius</italic> L., 
 <italic>Eruca vesicaria</italic> (L.) Cav., 
 <italic>Cichorium intybus</italic> L., 
 <italic>Portulaca oleracea</italic> L., and several species of the genus 
 <italic>Taraxacum</italic> were reported to be used mainly as food or condiment due to their pleasant taste. Almost half of the harvested plants have been recorded to be used primarily as food or flavor enhancer rather than medicine (Additional file
