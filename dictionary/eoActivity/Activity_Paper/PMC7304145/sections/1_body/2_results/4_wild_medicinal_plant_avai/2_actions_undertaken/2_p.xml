<p id="Par62">Two of the respondents mentioned that they cultivated a WMP species. The first case was 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> subsp
 <italic>. hirtum</italic> for which a harvester decided upon quitting wild harvesting and only cultivating it for his/her household and market needs. A second informant reported that he/she unsuccessfully tried to cultivate striped 
 <italic>Crepis zacintha</italic> (L.) Babc. seeds to deal with its reduced availability and thus the difficulty to obtain from the wild.
