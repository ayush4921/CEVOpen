<p id="Par42">Three informants (18.7% of the sample, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 16) said that in cases where a certain plant species is available in more than one harvesting site, they would rather choose the area with the highest abundance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In such locations, some explained that plants can be prosperous and have become well established due to local conditions, therefore can tolerate harvesting much better. Others indicated that the choice of their harvesting site is a matter of experience and knowledge earned throughout time. They identified these sites as areas where they have already been harvesting multiple times in the past and therefore know which plants grow there and when. One of the interviewees said that she/he would pick the less popular site among other harvesters and supported the idea that this is a way to prevent the plant species from over-exploitation.
