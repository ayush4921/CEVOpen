<p id="Par79">The introduction of WMPs in home gardens as a reaction to overexploited or disturbed plant populations and habitats also favors the ecological sustainability of WMP. Schippmann et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] described this practice as a priority conservation option for threatened or vulnerable wild plant species, which might be the case for 
 <italic>Salvia</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>C. zacintha</italic>, according to our respondents. The pressure on a wild plant species is expected to be relieved if the locals’ demand can be met from cultivated sources, allowing the recovery of the plant population in the wild. Nevertheless, for wild plant species that do not face availability issues, like most of the listed plants in this study, sustainable harvesting is the best option to ensure local benefits, maintenance of populations, and ecosystem’s balance [
