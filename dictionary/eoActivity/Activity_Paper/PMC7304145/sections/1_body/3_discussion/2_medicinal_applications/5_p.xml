<p id="Par71">Plants cited by at least two informants as having specific medicinal use reports were examined for their validity as therapeutic and/or preventative agents in pharmacological literature. All were found to hold pharmacological or medicinal properties, and many of which coincide or approximate the medicinal properties reported by our informants. Both 
 <italic>T. capitata</italic> and 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> have been reported to have antibacterial, antioxidant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], and antiviral [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] properties suggesting a potential repressive activity against bacterial and viral human body infections. Some of our informants assigned the exact same properties to these plants or suggested their use against diseases or health issues of bacterial or viral etiology (for example, common cold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], urinary tract infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]). Similarly, the cited antidepressant, wound healing, and anti-inflammatory properties of Saint John’s Worts (
 <italic>H. perfoliatum, H. perforatum, H. triquetrifolium</italic>) have been justified in literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Equally, for the antioxidant activity of 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], the kidney protective properties of 
 <italic>Taraxacum</italic> and 
 <italic>Cichorium</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], the nutritional value of 
 <italic>P. oleracea</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], the nephroprotective properties of 
 <italic>S. oleraceus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>], and the galactagogue action of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] (Additional file
