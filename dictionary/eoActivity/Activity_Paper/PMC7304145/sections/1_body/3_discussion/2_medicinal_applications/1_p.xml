The same or very similar medicinal properties of some plants presented in the current study have been reported in ethnopharmacological studies around the Mediterranean. For example, the use of aerial parts of 
 <italic>F. vulgare</italic> for health issues related to the digestive system is reported by González-Tejero et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] (Algeria, Cyprus, Italy) and Sargın et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] (Turkey). Roots of 
 <italic>C. dactylon</italic> are used for the preparation of remedies to heal issues of the urinary system in Tunisia as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The flowering aerial parts of 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> are traditionally consumed in Albania as a tea to treat respiratory ailments too [

 <italic>H. perfoliatum</italic> and 
 <italic>H. perforatum</italic> have been reported in another study from Greece [
