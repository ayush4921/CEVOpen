<p id="Par69">Despite the fact that 25 plant species cited as harvested and utilized in our study are occurring in the study of Axiotis et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], similarities in terms of medicinal uses are not proportionally as many. From 204 medicinal uses assigned to these 25 plant species in our work, only 19 coincide with the medicinal uses presented by Axiotis et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). It is not clear though whether these medicinal uses were reported by local people of Lemnos, as the results of their study rely on information collected on a sample of 200 members inhabiting nine islands of the Northeastern Aegean region where diversity of WMP uses seems very high. Research investigating more in detail the WMP uses on each of these islands could yield promising and comparable results.
