<p id="Par82">According to harvesters interviewed, 
 <italic>O. vulgare</italic> subsp. 
 <italic>hirtum</italic>, 
 <italic>Crithmum maritimum</italic>, 
 <italic>Capparis spinosa</italic>, and 
 <italic>A. acutifolius</italic> already face survival problems due to an increased popularity for their consumption as edibles and consequently a rise in the number of harvesters targeting only these taxa. So, even though the knowledgeable harvesters do not currently pose a threat while harvesting these plant taxa, the growing popularity among locals may affect, or may already have affected, its survival rates. This comes to agree with Posthouwerâ€™s et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] recommendation that the harvest of species with high use popularity may encounter sustainability problems. Similarly, Ticktin and Johns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] indicate that wild plant populations managed by less knowledgeable harvesters may decline even under low harvest levels.
