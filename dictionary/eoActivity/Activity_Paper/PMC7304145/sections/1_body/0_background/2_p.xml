<p id="Par6">However, unsustainable harvesting is not an issue everywhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and, in contrary to that, most plant species have been found to be harvested sustainably [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Tolerance to the harvesting of wild plants varies and depends on several factors, including a plantsâ€™ lifespan, the part of the plant that is harvested, species abundance, the habitat where it is harvested, or species growth rate. For example, slow-growing plants are particularly susceptible to heavy harvesting, while those of weedy nature are less vulnerable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The assessment of ecological sustainability of harvesting thus needs to be based on the consideration of several factors together, most importantly the plant parts collected and its life form [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Estimating the sustainability of a harvested population and the effect of wild plant harvesting on other elements of the ecosystem requires long-lasting studies and can be hard to isolate and monitor.
