<p>Despite the promising possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects exhibited by both plant extracts and natural molecules, several limitations should be considered. Overall, due to the recent outbreak, the clinical usefulness of these products needs to be demonstrated since the current data are still immature, and no final conclusions have been validated. As shown in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 2</bold>
 </xref>, for some species, there was no relationship between the traditional ethnopharmacological uses and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects. In spite of that, these plants are currently used to treat or manage symptoms reported in SARS-CoV-2 disease such as fever, inflammations, or cardiovascular and circulatory disorders. Moreover, efficacy and safety of the active natural products should be further studied

Importantly, bioavailability, modes of administration, safe doses, time of exposure, pharmacokinetic profile, the health of the patientsâ€™ digestive system, and disease stage are to be considered in the evaluation of the beneficial effects of natural products against SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms and pathways targeted by such products, which will help to improve their clinical usefulness. Assessing the effects of combinations of active natural products with validated antiviral drugs could be a promising alternative to explore.
