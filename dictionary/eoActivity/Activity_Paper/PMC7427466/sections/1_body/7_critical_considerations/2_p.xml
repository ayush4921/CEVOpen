<p>When studies were analyzed using the best practice recommendations in phytopharmacological research (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Heinrich et al., 2020</xref>), several concerns were detected especially regarding reporting data and outcomes. A large number of natural products reported in this review such as phenolic acids, quercetin, or kaempferol belong to phytochemical classes known to possess a broad spectrum of biological activities both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, most of the studies failed to demonstrate the specificity of such products. In addition, all the included studies did not consider the drugability of the “active” compounds or extracts and presented an insufficient interpretation of the obtained data. Likewise, all the studies presented limitations regarding concepts and methods and also in the development of the project. In fact, all the studies investigating herbal extracts and isolated compounds did not consider the sustainable sourcing of the species nor the registration standards of both compounds or accepted plants’ names. Likewise, the included studies presented serious bias concerning the dose range and the toxic doses. On the other hand, eight studies did not report the use of control, whereas the other studies did not justify the choice of the positive controls used for comparison. This could be considered as a risk of bias resulting in possible limitations in the methodology of the studies. Besides, the lack of full taxonomic validity has been detected in all these studies.
