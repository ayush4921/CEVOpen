<p>It has been reported that IC
 <sub>50</sub> of chloroquine inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication was found to be 1.13 to 5.47 µM (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Smit et al., 2020</xref>) whereas that of SARS-CoV was 8.8 µM (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Keyaerts et al., 2004</xref>). On the other hand, IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ivermectin was found to be ~2 μM (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Caly et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, molecules with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 0 to 10 µM have been considered as possible active molecules against SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, few natural molecules reported in the included studies could be considered active against SARS-CoV-2 including amentoflavone, dieckol, hirsutenone, cryptotanshinone, xanthoangelol E, tomentin E, psoralidin, scutellarein, myricetin, and caffeic acid. Nevertheless, most of these active molecules are phenolic compounds characterized by a low bioavailability and rapid elimination (
