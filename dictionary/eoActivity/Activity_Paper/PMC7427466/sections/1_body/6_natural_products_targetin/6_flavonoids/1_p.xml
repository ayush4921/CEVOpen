<p>Seven flavonoids (Quercetin, Puerarin, Daidzein, gallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, ampelopsi) were evaluated for their inhibitory effects of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) expressed in 
 <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> GS115. At 200 µM, gallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, and quercetin were able to inhibit the SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) activity by 91, 85, and 82%, respectively. Gallocatechin gallate was found to be a competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of almost 47µM. Molecular docking studies confirmed the important inhibitory potential of gallocatechin gallate owing to the hydrophobic and H-bonds interaction formed with the active site of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) (

Furthermore, the strength of the H-bonds is not evaluated in this study which could limit the selectivity of the tested molecules since an important number of weak H-bonds often increase their affinity and therefore their interaction with off-target proteins.
