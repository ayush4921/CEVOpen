 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. (2013)</xref> isolated nine phlorotannins from the ethanolic extract of brown Alga 
 <italic>Ecklonia cava</italic>. These phlorotannins were assessed regarding their inhibitory effects towards SARS-CoV- 3CL(pro) using a cell-free based assay. Eight phlorotannins (triphloretol A, eckol, dioxinodehydroeckol, 2-phloroeckol, 7-phloroeckol, fucodiphloroethol G, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol A) were shown to be competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV- 3CL(pro) in a dose dependent manner. IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranged from 2.7 ± 0.6 (dieckol) to 164.7 ± 10.8 µM (triphloretol A). Moreover, six phlorotannins (dioxinodehydroeckol, 2-phloroeckol, 7-phloroeckol, fucodiphloroethol G, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol A) resulted in a significant micromolar dose-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) cis-cleavage activity. Of the tested molecules, diekcol (possessing two eckol groups linked by a diphenyl ether) exhibited the best inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro). Molecular docking studies corroborated this result since diekcol possessed the lowest binding energy (11.51 kcal/mol) towards SARS-CoV-3CL(pro). Diekcol was shown to form strong H bonds to the catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41). Nevertheless, the bioavailability of phlorotannins and the inter-individual differences regarding their metabolization is still a substantial limitation to validate their usefulness. Gut microbiota composition seems to play a critical role in determining their health benefits (

Moreover, the complexity of their structures due to the diversity of structural linkages and the different structural and conformational isomers for the same molecular weight, in addition to the absence of analytical standards and the lack of clear relationship between their structure and bioactivity may be another limitation to their clinical use (
