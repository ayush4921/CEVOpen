<p>Four biflavonoids (amentoflavone, bilobetin, ginkgetin, and sciadopitysin) were isolated from the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Torreya nucifera</italic> (L.) Siebold &amp; Zucc. leaves and evaluated for their SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) inhibitory effect by using a FRET method. All biflavonoids exhibited a marked inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 8.3–72.3 µM. This inhibitory effect was stronger than that of eight diterpenoids isolated from the 
 <italic>T. nucifera</italic> extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 49.6–283.5 µM). Amentoflavone exerted the most important inhibitory activity since it possessed the lowest IC
 <sub>50</sub> (8.3 ± 1.2 µM). Moreover, its inhibitory potential was more important than that of apigenin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 280.8 ± 21.4 µM), quercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 23.8 ± 1.9 µM) and luteolin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 20.0 ± 2.2 µM). Molecular docking demonstrated that amentoflavone showed a good affinity with SARS-CoV-3CL(pro) and formed strong hydrogen bonds. An apigenin moiety at position C-30 of flavones was suggested to be responsible for a better inhibitory effect (
