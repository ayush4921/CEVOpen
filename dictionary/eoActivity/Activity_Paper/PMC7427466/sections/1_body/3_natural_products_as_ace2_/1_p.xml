<p>The penetration of the SARS-CoV-2 genome into the host cells occurs as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to host receptors (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Sigrist et al., 2020</xref>). By using phylogenetic analysis and critical site of ACE2 structure, different animals such as cat, pigeon, and sheep were predicted to be important intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2020</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al. (2020)</xref> demonstrated that the ACE2 receptor is used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter human cells. Moreover, they reported that the use of TMPRSS2 inhibitors may be a promising therapeutic approach against SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 is a transmembrane serine protease that cleaves both ACE2 and the S protein. Recently, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Ortega et al. (2020)</xref> used 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches to understanding the relationship between changes in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and ACE2 receptor. They demonstrated superior affinity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein towards human ACE2 as compared to that of the Bat-CoV spike and ACE2. This study supported the idea that the ACE2 receptor may be the key “bridge” used by SARS-CoV-2 to transmit among humans. 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2020)</xref> confirmed that although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD of spike glycoprotein had 72% of structural similarities, SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited higher interaction with ACE2. ACE2 inhibitors are thought to indirectly alter the RBD binding site and therefore block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Likewise, 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et al. (2020)</xref> found that the SARS-CoV-2 spike exhibited a higher affinity to ACE2 than SARS-CoV. 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Adedeji et al. (2013)</xref> demonstrated that early blocking of SARS-CoV with ACE2 inhibitors was one of the mechanisms used by novel efficient anti-SARS drugs. Nonetheless, it has been shown in three recent studies on COVID-19 that hypertension and diabetes mellitus significantly enhanced the risk of COVID-19 infection, in spite of using ACE2 inhibitors (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">Yang X. et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">Zhang J. J. et al., 2020</xref>). ACE2 inhibitors, angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers, and ibuprofen lead to ACE2 upregulation which justifies the urgent need to use and/or identify alternative ACE2 blockers (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fang et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, medicinal plants-derived products or natural products able to selectively block the ACE2 receptor without inhibiting the enzyme activity may be useful to prevent and/or treat SARS-CoV-2 spread in humans without increasing ACE2 expression in patients and therefore increased risk for COVID-19.
