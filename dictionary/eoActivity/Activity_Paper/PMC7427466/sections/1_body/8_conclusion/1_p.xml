<p>Medicinal plants and natural products are still considered promising alternatives to prevent or treat several diseases. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, various traditional herbal medicines have been used and resulted in positive health effects among COVID-19 patients, mainly in China. In the present review, we have discussed the possible potential uses of medicinal plants and/or natural products to prevent or even treat COVID-19. Although the studies evaluating the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of medicinal plants are still insufficient and relatively immature, some natural products with IC
 <sub>50</sub> below 10 ÂµM could be considered as promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents since they were able to block its life-cycle related proteins such as the cellular receptor ACE2, papain-like or chymotrypsin-like proteinases. Nevertheless, several limitations have been detected in relation to the specificity of the action exerted by such products, sustainable sourcing of the species, doses range used, or the use of appropriate controls.
