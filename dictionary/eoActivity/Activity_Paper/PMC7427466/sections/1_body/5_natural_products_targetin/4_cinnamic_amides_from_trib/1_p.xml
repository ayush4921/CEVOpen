<p>Several natural compounds were found to possess promising PLpro inhibitory effects. Indeed, 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">Song et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated that six cinnamic amides (N-trans-Feruloyloctopamine, N-trans-Coumaroyltyramine, N-trans-Caffeoyltryamine, Terrestrimine, N-trans-Feruloyltryamine, and Terrestriamide) extracted from 
 <italic>Tribulus terrestris</italic> L. fruits were able to inhibit SARS-CoV PLpro in a dose-dependent manner. PLpro inhibitory IC
 <sub>50</sub> of these compounds were found to be 15.8–70.1 µM. Terrestrimine [(E)-N-(1-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2- oxoethyl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxypheny) acrylamide] showed the best inhibitory activity of SARS-CoV PLpro with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 15.8 ± 0.6 µM. The presence of a polar substituent (ketone or alcohol) on the methylene groups (C8’and C7’) was associated with enhanced inhibitory activity.
