 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Cho et al. (2013)</xref> identified five new geranylated flavonones, tomentin A, tomentin B, tomentin C, tomentin D, tomentin E from the ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>Paulownia tomentosa</italic> (Thunb.) Steud. fruits. These flavonoids besides seven other knowns resulted in significant inhibition of SARS-CoV PLpro in a dose-dependent manner with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.0 and 14.4 μM. Tomentin E exhibited the highest inhibitory effect with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.0 ± 0.06 µM. It has been found that molecules with 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety possessed higher inhibition. The 
 <italic>P. tomentosa</italic> flavonoids were found to be reversible, mixed inhibitors.
