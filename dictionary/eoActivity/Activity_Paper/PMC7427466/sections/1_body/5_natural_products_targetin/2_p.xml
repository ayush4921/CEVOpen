<p>Recently, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Arya et al. (2020)</xref> screened FDA-approved drugs for their 
 <italic>in silico</italic> inhibitory potential of PLpro. They demonstrated that sixteen FDA-approved drugs (Biltricide, Cinacalcet, Procainamide, Terbinafine, Pethidine, Labetalol, Tetrahydrozoline, Ticlopidine, Ethoheptazine, Levamisole, Amitriptyline, Naphazoline, Formoterol, Benzylpenicillin, Chloroquine, and Chlorothiazide) exhibited important binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro suggesting their possible effectiveness as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Likewise, Disulfiram (an alcohol-aversive drug) was found to be a competitive inhibitor of SARS-CoV PLpro (
