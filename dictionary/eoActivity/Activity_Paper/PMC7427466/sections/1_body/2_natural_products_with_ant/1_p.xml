 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Runfeng et al. (2020)</xref> studied the inhibitory effects and anti-inflammatory potential of a Chinese herbal mixture called Lianhuaqingwen (a mixture of 11 medicinal species, a mineral medicine called gypsum and menthol) against SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
  <bold>Table 2</bold>
 </xref>). Traditionally, Lianhuaqingwen has been widely used to treat fever, cough, fatigue, influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia, and early stage of measles (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2017</xref>), and has been included in phase II clinical trial in the USA (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). This herbal mixture was recommended by the Chinese National Health Commission to treat or manage COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">Yang Y. et al., 2020</xref>). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect inhibition and plaque reduction assays. The herbal mixture inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 411.2 µg/ml. Furthermore, the mixture was able to suppress the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1, and CXCL-10/IP-10) in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Runfeng et al., 2020</xref>). These results could be interesting since the cytokine storm has been shown to be one of the COVID-19 lethal complications. In a previous study, among the 61 molecules identified in this herbal mixture, seven (arctiin, forsythoside A, gallic acid, isoliquiritigenin, kaempferol, rutin, and secoxyloganin) exhibited important antiviral activities with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 4.9 ± 0.1 (kaempferol) to 47.8 ± 1.5 µM (secoxyloganin) (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2020)</xref> reported results in four COVID-19 patients treated using a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra
 <sup>®</sup>) and arbidol with capsules of Shufeng Jiedu (a Chinese traditional medicine). After treatment, three patients were found COVID-19 negative and experienced significant improvements of the symptoms. In another study on 132 patients with COVID-19 living in northeast Chongqing (China), the traditional Chinese medicine was applied in almost 92% of them. The study concluded that the best therapeutic approach was a combination of Kaletra and the traditional medicine (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Lung et al. (2020)</xref> demonstrated that theaflavin could be used as an important anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug using 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approaches. Indeed, theaflavin showed promising docking affinities in the catalytic pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Nevertheless, it is worthy to point out that their bioavailability could limit their use since they are not absorbed in relevant amounts and that the theaflavin skeleton was found to resist to the degradation by the microbiota (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Pereira-Caro et al., 2017</xref>). By searching single cohort studies undertaken regarding the efficacy of herbal medicines against SARS and H1N1 influenza viruses, it has been concluded that medicinal species, usually used as herbal formula, could be an interesting preventive approach for high-risk populations (medical staff and their families’ members, people living in COVID-19 outbreak areas, old populations). Six herbal species were found to be the most frequently used including 
 <italic>Astragalus mongholicus </italic>Bunge, 
 <italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> L., 
 <italic>Saposhnikovia divaricata (</italic>Turcz. ex Ledeb.) Schischk., 
 <italic>Atractylodes lancea</italic> (Thunb.) DC., 
 <italic>Atractylodes macrocephala</italic> Koidz., 
 <italic>Lonicera japonica</italic> Thunb., and 
 <italic>Forsythia suspensa</italic> (Thunb.) Vahl. These species are the ingredients of the Chinese traditional medicine Yupingfeng powder (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2020</xref>). On the other hand, the ethanol extract of 
 <italic>Sambucus javanica</italic> subsp. chinensis (Lindl.) Fukuoka stem exerted promising anti-human coronavirus NL63 effects with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 1.17 (virus yield) to 15.75 µg/ml (virus attachment). The extract significantly decreased virus yield, plaque formation, and virus attachment. Furthermore, three of its major phenolic acids (caffeic, chlorogenic, and gallic acid) were shown to inhibit the NL63 replication and virus attachment. Caffeic acid was the most potent phenolic acid (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Weng et al., 2019</xref>). Phenolic acids are characterized by their metabolizing ability by the microbiota enhancing their bioavailability. Moreover, their antiviral potential could be increased with the alkyl chain length (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Kumar and Goel, 2019</xref>). However, their efficacy is still controversial due to their low absorption and instability in alkaline and neutral media, which could limit their use in pure form. Therefore, the clinical utility of phenolic compounds as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents remains debatable since their bioavailability, delivery mechanisms and efficient doses should be further studied using 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models.
