<p>In Sri Lanka, traditional herbo-mineral formulations are documented in the textbook known as Vatikaaprakarana [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the present survey, some of the herbo-mineral preparations described in Vatikaaprakarana are costly and the processes of purification/detoxification and incineration techniques need much effort. Total numbers of 143 formulations (both herbal and herbo-mineral) are found in Vatikaaprakarana. In addition, all the purification/detoxification and incineration techniques for herbo-minerals are not mentioned in Vatikaaprakarana. Therefore, commonly used purification/detoxification and incineration techniques are followed whenever required. In the present survey, purification/detoxification and incineration techniques were collected from journal articles published between 1
 <sup>st</sup> January 2000 and 1
 <sup>st</sup> June 2020 through searching PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, USA), Science Direct (RELX Group, Netherlands), and Sementic Scholar (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, USA). The keywords are “herbo-minerals and toxicity” and “herbo-minerals and purification and incineration”. From a total number of 165 results, 40 were excluded due to duplication or being irrelevant for the title. The frequently used traditional herbo-mineral formulations used in Sri Lanka are given in
