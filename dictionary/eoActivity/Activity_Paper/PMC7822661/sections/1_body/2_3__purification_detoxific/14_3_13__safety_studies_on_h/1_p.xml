<p>Literature on evaluation of toxicity levels of metals/minerals in herbo-mineral preparations after purification/detoxification or incineration is limited. Some experiments were carried out to determine the overall toxicity of herbo-minerals using animal experiments in terms of hepatotoxicity, hemototoxicity, renal toxicity, etc. However, purification/detoxification or incineration techniques of herbo-minerals were not properly documented in those studies. Thus, one example is cited here in order to get an idea about toxicity of herbo-minerals. Doddamani and co-workers [
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] found that Tribhuvan Keerthi rasa (contains cinnabar), Swasakutara rasa (contains mercury and sulphur), Smritisagara rasa (contains orpiment), Sutashekara rasa (contains mercury), Lashunadi vati (contains sulphur), and Agnitundi vati and Arogya vardini vati (contain both mercury and sulphur) did not affect kidney functions in terms of urea and creatinine levels. More than one purification/detoxification or incineration technique are available for metals/minerals. Therefore, without knowing the purification/detoxification or incineration technique, there is a difficulty to interpret the suitability of the techniques towards safety studies of herbo-minerals.
