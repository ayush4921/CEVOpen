<p>Equal quantities of mercury (500 g) and Sudha churna (limestone-500 g) are taken into a mortar and triturated for 36 hours (3 hours for 12 days). Mercury is collected from limestone filtered through a cloth. The remaining mercury is obtained by washing it with warm water. The wet powder of limestone is allowed to dry. After drying of these carefully, mercury is collected from these trays. Then, equal quantity of Lashuna Kalka 439 g (paste of garlic) is added to the obtained mercury and half the quantity of saindhava lavana (219.5 g) is added and triturated for 8 hours. Washing of garlic paste is done with lukewarm water. The salt present in it dissolves in water leaving behind the garlic paste from which again mercury can be collected. Once again, drying of the remaining garlic paste into trays is done for 6 days and then triturated into fine powder and filtered through cloth to obtain the remaining mercury from the garlic paste to avoid the loss of mercury. The collected mercury is known as purified mercury [
