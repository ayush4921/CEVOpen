<p>Copper sulphate is converted into a powder form using “
 <italic>khalva yantra”</italic> (it is an instrument that can made up of good quality of stone useful for trituration and levigation). After that, copper sulphate powder is collected on a three-layered cloth and closed firmly by a tight knot. Subsequently, cow urine is collected and filtered to a steel vessel through a filter paper. Then, 8 L of cow urine is added to a special vessel called “
 <italic>dolayantra</italic>” and copper sulphate which is tightened with cloth which is dipped in three fingers above from the bottom of vessel. Then, “
 <italic>dolayantra</italic>” is kept on a stove and exposed to mild heat and the cow urine is left to boil for 9 hours. When the level of cow urine is decreased, extra 500 ml cow urine is added again to it. After completion, leave it to cool and allow it to settle down for re-crystallization for 24 hours under room temperature. The crystals of copper sulphate are formed at bottom of the
