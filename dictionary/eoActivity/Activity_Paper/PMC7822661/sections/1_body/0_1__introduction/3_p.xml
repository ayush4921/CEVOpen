<p>Most of the herbo-mineral recipes mentioned in traditional medicine in Sri Lanka are in the form of paste (kalka) or in pills (guli). Buddharaja kalka and Desadun kallka are used in the form of paste. Seetarama guliya, Koladavunde, Suranvidura guliya, Diyatarama guliya, and Krimiraja guliya are the common form of pills. These pastes or pills contain the minerals such as thurisi (copper sulphate), savindalunu (rock salt), sinakkaram (aluminium sulphate), pushkara (borax sodium biborate), nellikka gendagam (sulpher sublimatum), sivanguru (kaolinumbolerubja (china clay)), sadilingam (hydragyrisulpidum), haritala (trisulfide of arsenic), manosila (arsenigralar), galmada (rock alum), galnahara (asbestos), black salt (suwasa lunu), swarna makshika (ferri sulphuratum), and shilajathu (asphaltum/asphalt mineral). In this review, an attempt was made to gather the herbo-mineral formulations which are used commonly in traditional medicinal systems in Sri Lanka and display the purification/detoxification and incineration techniques.</p>
