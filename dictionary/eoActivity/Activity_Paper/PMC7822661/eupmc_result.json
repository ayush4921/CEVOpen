    "<h4>Background</h4>Herbo-mineral therapies are very popular in traditional medical systems and formulations consisting of specific minerals or metals or mixture of both and mixed with organic components derived from plants. Purification/detoxification or incineration procedures play an important role to detoxify these and metals and minerals.<h4>Objective</h4>In the present review, an attempt was made to gather herbo-mineral formulations which are used commonly in traditional medicinal systems in Sri Lanka and recapitulate the purification/detoxification or incineration techniques.<h4>Method</h4>Commonly used herbo-mineral formulations are collected from a text book of Vatikaaprakarana. However, the purification/detoxification and incineration techniques for all minerals/metals are not mentioned in Vatikaaprakarana, and these techniques were collected from journal articles published between 1<sup>st</sup> January 2000 and 1<sup>st</sup> June 2020 through searching PubMed (US National Library of Medicine, USA), Science Direct (RELX Group, Netherlands), and Semantic Scholar (Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, USA).<h4>Results</h4>Ten herbo-mineral formulations were selected, and purification/detoxification or incineration techniques were described in brief for copper sulphate, aluminum sulfate, borex powder, sulphur, sodium chloride, cinnabar, arsenicals, realgar, orpiment, ammonium chloride, magnesium silicate, zinc, and mercury.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The review has demonstrated different types of purification/detoxification or incineration techniques of minerals used in herbo-mineral preparations. In addition, there is an urgent need for comprehensive survey or evaluation to check whether purification/detoxification or incineration techniques of metals/minerals are practiced properly in the country."
