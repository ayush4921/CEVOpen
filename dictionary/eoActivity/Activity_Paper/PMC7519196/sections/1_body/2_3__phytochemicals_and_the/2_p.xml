<p>Plants produce three major classes of phytochemicals, 
 <italic>viz.</italic> phenolic metabolites and alkaloids, terpenoids, and other nitrogen-containing compounds [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"> Figure 3</xref> represents major classes of plant-derived phenolic compounds. Among these, polyphenolics are well known for their high antioxidant capacity [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Phenolics are compounds possessing one or more aromatic rings with one or more hydroxyl groups. Plant polyphenols, such as epicatechin, 
 <italic>β</italic>-catechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, tannic acid, isoflavones, glycyrrhizin, saponins, and chlorogenic acid, have an antidiabetic property [
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Flavanoids have been reported to show therapeutic activity in cardiovascular diseases and atherosclerosis [
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Basirnejad et al. [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] reviewed the protective role of carotenoids including lycopene, 
 <italic>γ</italic>-carotene, lutein, and xanthophyll against cancer progression. In animals, phytosterols exhibit anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, antipyretic, and immune-modulating activities [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Flavonoids perform a wide range of actions against free radical-mediated inflammation, tumors, and cellular signaling, [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These impaired signaling may cause neurodegenerative disorders.
