<p>Due to high reactivity, superoxide radicals generated in the brain mitochondria limit their movement and cause damage to its DNA and lead to impaired function [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and neurodegenerative diseases. Hydrogen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) is the major precursor of superoxide radical in mitochondria. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX1 and NOX4) being another sources, are expressed in neurons [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Increased NOX activity in the microglia induces neuroinflammation [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and neurodegenerative diseases [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The level of free radical damage increases when nitric oxide interacts with superoxide to become more toxic to neurons [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the major factors determining the bipolar disorder and depression. Increased free radical concentration and oxidative stress are directly proportional to low concentrations of BDNF and promote depression and anxiety. The use of an antidepressant will increase BDNF, regenerate brain cells, and reduce oxidative stress, depression, and anxiety [

A similar mental disorder is observed in patients with anxiety showing symptoms such as insensitiveness, unpleasant feeling, and loss of interest [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The irregular production of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate in the brain is also associated with neurodegeneration [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Oxidative stress, increased levels of nuclear factor 
 <italic>κ</italic> B (NF
 <italic>κ</italic>B) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) is also linked with the progression of these disease conditions [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Oxidative stress and mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders have been well studied [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Antioxidants can remove these free radicals and suppress the conditions leading to depression and anxiety (
