<p>According to research findings, increasing time and temperature will increase the solubility and extractability of compounds; however, plant phenolics may undergo enzymatic oxidation and reactions forming undesirable compounds under such conditions [

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Sample matrix and particle size also strongly influence phenolic extraction from plant materials [
