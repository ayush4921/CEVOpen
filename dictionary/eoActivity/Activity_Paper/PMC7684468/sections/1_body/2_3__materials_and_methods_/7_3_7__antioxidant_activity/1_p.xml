<p>DPPH radical scavenging assay was adopted to measure the ability of biosynthesized compounds extracted from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem to scavenge free radicals. The activities were evaluated according to the method described by Hrichi et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], with a few modifications. Serial dilutions in ethanol were prepared to obtain six concentrations (2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and 0.0625 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) of each extract, volatile fraction, and ascorbic acid (standard). A 0.1 mM DPPH solution was prepared in ethanol. A 0.5 mL of each diluted sample was added glass vessel followed by the introduction of 0.5 mL of DPPH solution. After 30 min of incubation in obscurity at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at λ = 517 nm. Ethanol was used as the blank solution; a control was DPPH/ethanol (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) solution. The percentage of scavenging free radicals by the tested samples was calculated with Equation (1):
 <disp-formula>% SFR = ((A 
  <sub>control</sub> − A 
  <sub>sample</sub>)/A 
  <sub>control</sub>) × 100
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> where A 
 <sub>control</sub> is the absorbance of the control sample and A 
 <sub>sample</sub> is the absorbance of the tested sample. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> is defined as the occurrence of 50% of radical scavenging by each sample.
