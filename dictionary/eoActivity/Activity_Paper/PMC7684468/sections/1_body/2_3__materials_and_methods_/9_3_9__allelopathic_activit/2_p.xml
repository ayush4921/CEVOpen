<p>The lengths of roots and shoots are measured and expressed in centimeters (cm). The percentages of elongation were calculated using Equation (4):
 <disp-formula>% I = [1 − (E/T)] × 100
  <label>(4)</label>
 </disp-formula> where E is the value of the parameter studied (length of the aerial part, length of the root part) in the presence of the extract and T is the value of the parameter studied (length of the aerial part, length of the root part) in the presence of the control (distilled water). The percentage of hydration was evaluated using Equation (5):
 <disp-formula>% H = [(PF − PS)/PF]*100
  <label>(5)</label>
 </disp-formula> where PF is the fresh sample weight and PS is the dry sample weight after drying at 60 °C for 24 h. The percentage of inhibition of hydration was calculated according to Equation (6):
 <disp-formula>% I = 100 − % H
  <label>(6)</label>
 </disp-formula> if % I &gt; 0 there is inhibition; if % I &lt; 0 there is stimulation.
