<p>The activity of dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethanol extracts on the germination, root, and shoot length elongation and hydration of 
 <italic>Lens culinaris Medik</italic>. (lens) and 
 <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> L. (kohlrabi) species seeds were evaluated according to the method described by Teerarak et al. [
 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], with a few modifications. Five concentrations (8, 4, 2, 1, and 0.5 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) were prepared for each tested extract, compared to a control (distilled water). Briefly, 1 mL of each concentration sample was piped to a filter paper discs (Whatman ™, 9 mm), placed in a 9 cm diameter petri dish. The solution was allowed to evaporate to air for 24 h, and then 5 mL of distilled water were poured onto each filter paper disc. Ten healthy seeds of each species, previously soaked in distilled water for 2 h, were placed on the filter paper disc. All tests were done in triplicates. Petri dishes were left under ambient temperature, light and humidity conditions in the laboratory. The data to seed germination, shoot length, root length, and hydration were recorded after 7 days of sowing. The germination percentage was determined using Equation (2): 
 <disp-formula>% G = [(NSS/TNS) × 100]
  <label>(2)</label>
 </disp-formula> where NSS is the number of sprouted seeds and TNS is the total number of seeds. Germination inhibition percentages were calculated using Equation (3):
 <disp-formula>% I = 100 − % G
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula>
