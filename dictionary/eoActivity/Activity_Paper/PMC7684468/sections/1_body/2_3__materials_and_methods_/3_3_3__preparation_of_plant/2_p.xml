<p>The whole process from preparing the dichloromethane extract from stem powder to the ethanol extract was following the protocols detailed by Hrichi et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Briefly, 100 g of stem powder was subject to four successive extractions, using for each 300 mL of solvent (dichloromethane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and ethanol), after boiling for 90 min, filtrating with filter paper, the solvent was evaporated from the filtrate and the residue was used for the next extraction. The resulting extract of each extraction was stored until use at 4 Â°C.
