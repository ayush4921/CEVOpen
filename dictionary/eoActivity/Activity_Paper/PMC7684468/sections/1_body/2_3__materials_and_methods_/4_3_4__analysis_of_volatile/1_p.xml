<p>Separation and quantification of volatile compounds of the fractions VF1 and VF2 were obtained after the hydrodistillation process was performed on HP-5890 Series II instruments, equipped with HP-WAX and HP-5 capillary columns (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness), with an oven temperature program as follows: 60 °C for 10 min, the ramp of 5 °C min
 <sup>−1</sup> up to 220 °C; injector and detector temperatures 250 °C; carrier gas was helium (2 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>); detector dual Flame Ionization Detector (FID); split ratio of 1:30; injection of 0.5 μL (10% hexane solution). The identification of components with GC-FID was by comparing their linear retention index (LRI), relative to the series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hydrocarbons. The GC-MS analyses were performed on a Varian CP-3800 gas-chromatograph equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; coating thickness, 0.25 μm) and a Varian Saturn 2000 ion trap mass detector. The analytical conditions were as follows: injector and transfer line temperatures 220 and 240 °C, respectively; oven temperature programmed from 60 to 240 °C at 3 °C/min; carrier gas helium at 1 mL min
 <sup>−1</sup>; injection of 0.2 μL (10% hexane solution); split ratio of 1:30. Constituents identification was based mainly on a comparison of their linear retention indices relative to the series of 
 <italic>n</italic>-hydrocarbons (C7–C28) and computer matching against the commercial and homemade libraries of mass spectra, and MS literature data [
