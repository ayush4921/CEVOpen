<p>The fresh stems of annual 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> speeding in the province of Kondar (35°55′58′′ N latitude, 10°18′00′′ E longitude) from the Tunisian Sahel, situated about 30 km from the north-west of Sousse governorate, were harvested during May 2017, when the plant was flowering. The species identification was based on shape and morphological features of 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> leaves, flowers, and fruits, compared to scientific botanic illustrations [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, a genetic characterization using bio-molecular tools were applied to plant fresh material in order to confirm genus and species identification. Briefly, DNA from 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> stems, freshly collected was extracted using the chelating resin Chelex 100 [
 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The extraction eluate was subjected to a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a Chloroplastic DNA fragment, using the species- and group-specific primers “ycf6F” and “psbMR”, targeting for the 
 <italic>petN-psbM</italic> intergenic spacer region [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The PCR products were purified and sequenced. The sequence alignment was performed at first with BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Then, the obtained sequence (MW036172) was aligned with reference sequences of 
 <italic>Lomelosia caucasica</italic> (KX073338.1), 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> sp. (KX073339.1), 
 <italic>Scabiosa tschiliensis</italic> (MN524616.1; MN524617.1), 
 <italic>Pseudo scabiosa saxatilis</italic> (KJ025966.1), 
 <italic>Knautia purpurea</italic> (KX073307.1), 
 <italic>Knautia arvensis</italic> (KX073229.1), and 
 <italic>Knautia dipsacifolia</italic> (KX073256.1) from the NCBI database. Genetic distances computing and phylogenetic trees inferring were realized using MEGA 5.0 software-based on Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method, with 
 <italic>Prunus armenica</italic> L. (KY101151.1) as outgroup.
