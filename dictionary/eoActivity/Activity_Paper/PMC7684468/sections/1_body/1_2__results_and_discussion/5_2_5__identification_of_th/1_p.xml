<p>Principal biochemical classes of pigments identified in this study from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem were chlorophylls and carotenoids, all characterized by their importance for nurturing good health [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Twenty-four compounds were detected, 10 belonging to the family of chlorophyll and eight carotenoids, based on literature data (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05032-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The three following extracts, namely dichloromethane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate, have shown similar pigment profiles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-05032-f003">Figure 3</xref>). However, different levels of carotenoid pigments were detected. The major detected compounds were lutein, most abundant in chloroform (247.57 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) and ethyl acetate (447 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup>) extracts, and 4,4-diapophytoene, which yielded 96.31 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup> in the ethyl acetate extract (

Minor differences between these three extracts were observed for the rest of the compounds, such as actinioerythrin, isomer lutein and lutein. The ethanol extract presented a different pigment profile compared to other tested solvents, where only one carotenoid compound, 4,4-diapophytoene, was abundant (476.31 µg g
 <sup>−1</sup>). According to literature data, none of the 
 <italic>Scabiosa</italic> species was characterized by its carotenoid composition.
