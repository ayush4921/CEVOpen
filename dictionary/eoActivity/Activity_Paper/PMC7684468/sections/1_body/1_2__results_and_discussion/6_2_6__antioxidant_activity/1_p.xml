<p>The free radical scavenging assay is widely used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity of different plant second metabolites. The free radical-scavenging activity of extracts and volatile fractions from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem was evaluated by the DPPH assay and compared to ascorbic acid (

 <xref rid="molecules-25-05032-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Among all the extracts, ethanol extract had the highest antioxidant capacity (IC

 <sup>−1</sup>) followed by the ethyl acetate extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 0.4806 ± 0.0487 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). However, chloroform extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 2.0951 ± 0.3750 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) and dichloromethane extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 2,6985 ± 0.4296 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) exhibited weak scavenging activity. Volatile fractions acted as extracts, following the polarity gradient, with more effectiveness for polar factions. Thus, the hexanoic VF1 fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 0.4798 ± 0.0897 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) presented a maximum of activity compared to the chloroformic VF2 fraction (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 1.2944 ± 0.2067 mg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>). The antioxidant potential of second metabolites extracted from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. was dependent on the presence of different bioactive compounds, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, carotenoids, and chlorophylls [

 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L.; concluding that the ethanol extract and ethyl acetate fraction expressed high capacity with 2.2% and 3.03% of change from control, respectively. The ethyl acetate fraction from the pre-flowering stage of
