<p>The analysis of the composition of the volatile fractions (VF1 and VF2) recovered by hydrodistillation from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem showed different percentages in compounds, according to the solvents employed, namely hexane and chloroform. A total of 15 volatile compounds were isolated, identified, and quantified by GC-FID/MS in the VF1 and VF2 fractions, and accounted for 90.8% and 93.8% of total volatile constitutes (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-05032-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), respectively. A significant difference was observed for the contents in oxygenated monoterpenes, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, phenylpropanoids, and other derivatives between VF1 and VF2. However, no significant difference was observed for the contents in apocarotenes. The most abundant volatile compounds detected in 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem were 1.8 cineole, tetradecene, and (E)-
 <italic>β</italic>-ionone, with contents ranging from 8.1–33.5%, 5.7–24.1% and from 5.9–20.7%, respectively. In particular, dihydroactinidiolide was only detected in VF2 with a content equal to 26.1%. Most of these compounds were reported in essential oils extracted from 
 <italic>S. arenaria</italic> [

 <italic>Scabiosa flavida</italic> [
 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-05032" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, the GC-MS profiling of the 
 <italic>S. stellata</italic> lipophilic extract from Algeria showed sitosterol, ursolic acid, and oleanolic acid as the most abundant terpenes [
