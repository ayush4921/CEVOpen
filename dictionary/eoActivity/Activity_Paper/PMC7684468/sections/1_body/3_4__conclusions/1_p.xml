<p>In this study, the chemical profile and biological activities of the two volatile fractions and the four extracts from 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem are reported for the first time. The volatile chemical profile revealed that the most abundant compounds were 1,8-cineole, dihydroactinidiolide, tetradecene, and E-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-ionone. The non-volatile chemical profiles revealed that the most abundant phenolic compounds were cynaroside and chlorogenic acid and the most encountered carotenoid was lutein. The ethanol extract yielded the highest number of phenolic compounds, while the dichloromethane extract yielded the highest number of pigment compounds. 
 <italic>S. atropurpurea</italic> L. stem proved to be a rich source of antioxidant, antibacterial, and allelopathic substances with great health-promoting potential, and could be utilized in agriculture and pharmaceutical industries.
