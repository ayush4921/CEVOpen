 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> and is most notably composed of numerous flavolignans, including silybin, silydianin, and silychristine. Silybin constitutes approximately 50% to 70% of silymarin extracts. This plant possesses several pharmacological activities and is used to treat disorders related to the liver, gall bladder, and spleen [
 <xref rid="B56-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Notably, because of its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic activities, silymarin is probably the most commonly used natural compound for hepatic disease care worldwide [
 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Most importantly, its medicinal property has been explored as hepatoprotective for supportive therapy in case of hepatic dysfunctions such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, and fatty liver [

 <xref rid="B59-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Moreover, studies have shown that 
 <italic>Silybum marianum</italic> is very potent against stress induced by toxicants, including poisonous mushrooms, alcohol, and toxic chemicals [
 <xref rid="B60-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Bioactive components isolated from 
 <italic>Silybum</italic> spp., silymarin, showed therapeutic benefits in acute and chronic viral, alcohol, and chemically induced hepatitis [
 <xref rid="B61-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Silymarin is the most frequently used natural compound for treating hepatic diseases worldwide due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic activities. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase cycle, leukotrienes, and free radical production contribute to its cytoprotective effects in liver [
