 <italic>Solanum nigrum</italic> has numerous medicinal properties [
 <xref rid="B73-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In traditional medicine, plant leaves have reportedly been used to treat many illnesses, including seizures, asthma, nausea, ulcers, vomiting, diarrhea, some eye infections, and jaundice [

 <xref rid="B78-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Aqueous extract of 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> has been shown to reduce hepatic enzymes ALT, AST, and ALP significantly. Moreover, this inhibits bilirubin’s level and scavenge the free radicals production, as observed in CCL
 <sub>4</sub> induced hepatic damage in rats [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The antioxidant activity may be attributable to the polyphenolic compounds’ existence in stems and leaves [
