<p>It is observed that the host body activates an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection to facilitate virus clearance and induce a sustained adaptive immune response. Moreover, serologic analysis has shown elevated levels of Th17, CD8+ T-cells, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, GM-CSF, MCP-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, as compared to those in control [
