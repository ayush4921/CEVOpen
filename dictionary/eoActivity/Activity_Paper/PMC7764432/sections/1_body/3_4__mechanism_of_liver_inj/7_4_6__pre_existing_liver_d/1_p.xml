<p>Due to systemic immunodeficiency, patients with chronic liver disease and cirrhosis may have a higher risk of COVID-19 infections [
 <xref rid="B42-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, a post-transplant patient is at higher risk due to immunosuppressive therapy [

 <xref rid="B44-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the relationship between underlying liver disease and COVID-19 has not been fully studied. Patients with cirrhosis are at an increased risk of decompensation or development of acute-on-chronic liver failure when coupled with a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection [

 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Co-morbidities, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, are more prevalent in hospitalized patients with severe/critical illnesses from COVID-19, and these patients are more likely to manifest abnormal liver chemistries [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-05905" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, special attention should be paid to monitoring hepatic changes triggered by COVID-19 in patients with a pre-existing history of liver disease (especially older patients).
