<p>After collection, plant material was air dried in the shade at room temperature. Crushed dried leaves (135 g) were extracted by maceration with EtOAc (2 × 0.7 L, 2 × 24 h) on a rotary shaker (90 rpm). The organic solvent was collected by vacuum filtration and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to yield 10.6 g of extract. A portion of the extract (1.2 g) was subjected to reverse phase flash chromatography using a gradient of H
 <sub>2</sub>O mixed with an increasing proportion of CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN, both with 0.1% formic acid, to afford 14 fractions (A to N). A portion of fraction I (10 mg), eluted with 100% CH
 <sub>3</sub>CN, was subjected to preparative HPLC (isocratic elution at 20:80) to afford the mixture ursolic acid 
 <bold>3</bold>:oleanic acid 
 <bold>4</bold> (6:4) (2.4 mg, RT = 6.0 min), and Aspidin BB 
 <bold>1</bold> (4.3 mg, RT = 12.5 min). A portion of fraction J (40 mg) was washed with cold MeOH (0 °C) to afford Aspidin VB 
 <bold>2</bold> (20 mg). After NMR experiments, small crystal needles were observed in samples tubes of Aspidin BB 
 <bold>1</bold> and Aspidin VB 
 <bold>2</bold>. These crystals were carefully collected and analyzed by X ray crystallography.
