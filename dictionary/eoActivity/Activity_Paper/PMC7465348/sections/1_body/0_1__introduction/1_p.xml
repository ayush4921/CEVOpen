 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a Gram-positive bacterium and the major cause of hospital-acquired infections, often resulting in longer stays and increases in patient mortality [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> infections, promoted by the use of ventilators or venous catheters, affect the bloodstream, lower respiratory tract, and the skin and soft tissues [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The microbial world is ruled by adaptation to environmental pressure, and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> has developed very effective tools to resist antibiotics since the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s to cure infections. The selective pressure of antibiotics continually promotes the emergence of drug-resistant strains of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, which have dramatically increased and spread around the world [
