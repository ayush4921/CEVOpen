<p>Bioassay guided fractionation of the antibacterial EtOAc extract of 
 <italic>Psiloxylon mauritianum</italic> led to isolation of the known molecules Aspidin BB (

 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], ursolic acid (
 <bold>3</bold>) and oleanic acid (
 <bold>4</bold>) [
 <xref rid="B13-molecules-25-03565" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], along with compound 
 <bold>2</bold> that had not previously been isolated or described in the literature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03565-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The known compounds were identified by comparison of 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C data with values reported in the literature, together with crystallography data for 
 <bold>1</bold>. The common triterpenic acids 
 <bold>3</bold> and 
 <bold>4</bold> were isolated as a 6:4 ratio mixture, and the complete 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C-NMR assignments were deduced from NMR 1D and 2D experiments conducted on a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer.
