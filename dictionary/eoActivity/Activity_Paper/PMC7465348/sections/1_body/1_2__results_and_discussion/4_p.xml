<p>The structure determined with the NMR data was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (See 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-molecules-25-03565">Tables S9â€“S16</xref>). Crystallographic data were recorded at 150 K to reduce agitation induced by the length of the valeryl side chain. Compound
