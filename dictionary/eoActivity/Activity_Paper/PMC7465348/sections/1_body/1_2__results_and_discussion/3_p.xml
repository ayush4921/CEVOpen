<p>These findings suggest that 
 <bold>2</bold> is an analogue of 
 <bold>1</bold> with different structure of the side chains. Interpretation of COSY and HMBC experiments, especially HMBC correlations observed with the two ketonic carbons at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 208.0 (C8′) and 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 207.5 (C8), easily revealed the presence of valeryl and butyryl chains. The connection of the valeryl side chain to the acylfilicinic acid moiety was determined with HMBC correlation between the protons of the methylene H9 at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 3.19 with the quaternary carbon C3 at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>C</sub> 108.9 ppm. The allocation of the butyryl chain was established with the ROESY experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-03565-f002">Figure 2</xref>). In fact, the protons of the methylene H9′ at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 3.15 displayed a ROE correlation with the protons of the methoxyl H7′ at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 3.80, which exhibited a clear ROE correlation with the toluene methyl H12′ at 
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>H</sub> 2.10.
