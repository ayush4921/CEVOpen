<p>Interestingly, multidrug resistance of bacterial species causes health difficulties. Extracts of volatile oils have been investigated as new potential antimicrobial agents, biopreservative products, and promising antiseptic enhancers for topical uses [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. 
 <italic>Micromeria</italic> species VOs were considered to have strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The results listed in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> showed that the VOs of the three samples exhibited considerable antifungal potency but little antibacterial potency. The results of the antimicrobial activity of the VOs of three samples revealed that this activity was specific against 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (CI), and MRSA and nonspecific against the rest of the microbial organisms. Screening the potential antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs and methanolic extract, growing in Turkey conducted by Güllüce et al. [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], concluded that the VO provided stronger antimicrobial properties than methanolic extract (methanolic extract did not show any antimicrobial activity); the MIC values of 0.5 mg/mL volatile oil stock solution for bacterial species which were susceptible to the oil ranged from 31.25 to 125 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL and for fungi which were susceptible to VO ranged from 31.25 to 62.50 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. A study conducted by Omari et al. [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] evaluating the antifungal activity of 
 <italic>M. barbata</italic> growing in Lebanon, using different fungal strains and yeasts, including 
 <italic>Epidermophyton floccosum</italic> and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, concluded that the 
 <italic>M. barbata</italic> VOs showed a high fungistatic activity. Investigating the antimicrobial activity of 
 <italic>Micromeria cilicica</italic> VOs growing in Turkey resulted in the finding that the 
 <italic>Micromeria cilicica</italic> VOs and pulegone crude compound (the main component) showed a significant antifungal and antibacterial activity; the activities increased relying on the amount of pulegone and VOs and 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> was the most sensitive to pulegone [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. 
 <italic>Micromeria congesta</italic> VOs were considered as a significant antibacterial due to abundant components such as pulegone and isomenthone [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Studying the chemical ingredients and antibacterial and antifungal activity of the volatile oils of four plants including 
 <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> growing in Iran by Kazemi et al. [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and crude menthone (the dominant component) for antimicrobial activity, reported that VOs showed very strong antimicrobial properties against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, all of 
 <italic>Shigella species</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Klebsiella sp.</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus sp.</italic>, 
 <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, and other strains and concluded that menthone (isomenthone) exhibited strong antibacterial properties with MIC 1.5-3.5 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. These findings could be linked with our results obtained from Hebron in which the VOs of 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> owned the highest quantity of isomenthone (14.41%) which is thought to be effective against 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic>. On the contrary, isomenthone represented the lowest amount of constituents (3.16%) in Nablus and therefore exhibited the lowest potency against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (CI) and MRSA.
