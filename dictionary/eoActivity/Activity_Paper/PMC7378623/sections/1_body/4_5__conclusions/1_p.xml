 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs from different regions in Palestine represented by three cities showed variable antioxidant and antimicrobial activities depending on the phytochemical constituents of the volatile oils. The sample from middle Palestine (Ramallah) showed the most potent antioxidant properties. The plant extract exhibited strong antifungal activities and minimal antibacterial activities. The sample of the south region showed higher potency against 
 <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> while the sample of the northern region showed lower potency against 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (CI) and MRSA. These findings enable 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs to be good agents in curing or preventing oxidative stress and healing wounds and skin dermatitis and a good food preservative agent.
