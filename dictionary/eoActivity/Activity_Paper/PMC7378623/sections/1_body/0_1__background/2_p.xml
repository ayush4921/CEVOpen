<p>There is a growing concern about antimicrobial resistance issue [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The complications of multidrug resistance enforced scientists to search for new antimicrobial agents from various sources such as medicinal plants [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In recent time, there has been considerable interest in VOs and extracts of medicinal plants for the development of alternatives to prevent or to delay the growth of pathogens [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many scientific investigations reported that the chemical composition, total yield, and the aroma of VOs may be different due to growing conditions (climate, type of soil and composition, and altitude), plant age, geoclimatic location, and environmental conditions of collection time and site [
