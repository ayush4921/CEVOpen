<p>DPPH assay was used as in vitro approach to determine the free radical-scavenging activity and to screen for the possible antioxidant activity of the 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> VOs from different regions in Palestine. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were used to assess the ability of the examined samples to inhibit DPPH. The assay revealed that the VO samples exhibited higher antioxidant potency compared to Trolox but they showed lower efficacy (maximum inhibition) (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA was performed to compare the antioxidant potency (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) and efficacy among samples. There were significant differences in antioxidant potency and efficacy of VOs compared to Trolox (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 or &lt;0.01). There were significant differences in antioxidant efficacy of VOs compared to each other (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 or &lt;0.01), but there were no significant differences in antioxidant potency of VOs compared to each other (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05).
