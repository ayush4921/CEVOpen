<p>Volatile oils of the three samples of 
 <italic>M. fruticosa serpyllifolia</italic> were extracted using microwave-ultrasonic apparatus; still, the results of this section can be obtained from the previously published work by the same research group [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, these results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> modified from [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> represents the chemical composition obtained using GC-MS analysis in which the most abundant components in all three samples were pulegone and isomenthone. The total identified components in the three samples were almost consistent in which 90.48, 94.44, and 93.55% of the constituents were identified in Nablus, Ramallah, and Hebron districts, respectively.
