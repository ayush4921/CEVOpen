<p>The primary active component of the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Radix Paeoniae alba</italic> is paeoniflorin (PF). This ingredient, as a monoterpene glycoside, can enhance memory and learning and has anti-oxidant and sedative properties (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). It has been revealed that PF (0.1, 1.0, and 10 μM) reduce glutamate toxicity in PC12 cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Its protective effect was attributed to the inhibition of apoptosis via regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 signaling and MMP (

 <italic>et al.</italic> hypothesized that the possible protective mechanisms of PF are through anti-oxidant mechanisms and Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> antagonism in PC12 cells (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). Besides, pretreatment of PC12 cells with PF (100, 200, and 300 μM) inhibited the cytotoxicity of glutamate (15 mM) by increasing Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, reducing Bax and Bad expression, and preventing caspase-3/-9 activity (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). So, PF seems to be a potential natural compound for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.
