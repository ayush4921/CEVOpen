 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Research has shown that AST elevated the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and reduced oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In another study, mouse neuronal cells (HT22) were exposed to different concentrations of AST (1.25–5 µM) and then incubated with glutamate at a dose of 5 mM. The results have shown that AST reduced glutamate toxicity via reduction of cell death, decreased the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and attenuated the expression of caspase-3/-8/-9 activity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction by modulating the Akt/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β signaling pathway in HT22 cells (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Also, in a different study, the neuroprotective roles and probable mechanisms of AST against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in PC12 cells were explored. Inhibition of neuronal cell death (reducing the elevation of caspase-3 activation and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio), decreased Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx, and the down-regulation of ROS-associated NF-κB and MAPK pathways were the main possible mechanisms of AST action (
