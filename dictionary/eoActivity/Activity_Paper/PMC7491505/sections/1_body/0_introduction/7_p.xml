<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are related to the glutamatergic pathway, prompting the activation of nitric oxide synthase, impairment of cellular calcium homeostasis, ROS generation, and apoptosis. Recently, further mechanistic details identified with glutamate overstimulation have been detailed in neurodegenerative diseases (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Changes in the enactment pattern of NMDA receptors (NMDARs), as the fundamental receptor involved in neurodegenerative diseases, at various cellular locations have been indicated as crucial in initiating pathways driven to neuroprotection versus neuro-destruction. For this reason, evidence suggests that glutamatergic excitotoxicity is interceded by the activation of extrasynaptic relative to synaptic NMDARs. Various investigations have shown that high enactment of extrasynaptic pathways explicitly promote apoptotic signal transduction cascades, causing neuronal cell death, while the actuation of synaptic NMDARs has a neuroprotective role via Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>-mediated signal transduction pathways advancing neuronal survival (

 <sup>2+</sup>, and free-radical scavenging. Neuronal cell death is specifically intervened by the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> entry over NMDARs. Hence, mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly in excitable cells, is in charge of expanding ROS production, and consequently, oxidative damage, promoting neurodegenerative disorders (
