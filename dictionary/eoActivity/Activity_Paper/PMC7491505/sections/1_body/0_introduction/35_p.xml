<p>Tanshinone, isolated from 
 <italic>Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic>, has been proposed to have cytotoxicity as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects on a variety of cells and modulates breast cancer metastasis by regulating adhesion molecules (

 <italic>et al. </italic>study, it was shown that tanshinone IIA mitigates glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity through the suppression of mitochondrial dysfunction and inhibition of MAPK activation in neuroblastoma cells (
