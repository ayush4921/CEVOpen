<p>Glutamate receptors are classified into two major classes, metabotropic and ionotropic receptors. Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are divided into N-methyl-D aspartic acid (NMDA, high calcium conductivity), kainite (mediate sodium influx), and Î±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA, mediate sodium influx). In contrast, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that initiate intracellular cascades, prompting the modification of ion channels (
