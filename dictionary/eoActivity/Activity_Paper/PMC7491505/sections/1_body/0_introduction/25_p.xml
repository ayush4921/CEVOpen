<p>Ginkgolide K, as an active compound isolated from leaves of the 
 <italic>ginkgo Biloba</italic>, inhibits the release of beta-glucuronides from platelet (a platelet-activating factor antagonist) and ameliorates neurotoxicity induced by cerebral ischemia (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Various doses of ginkgolide K (10, 50, 100 mM) were added to PC12 cells with glutamate (10 mM) for 12 hrs. Glutamate has been shown to increase the concentration of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx, MDA, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, LDH, caspase-3 protein, the release of cytochrome C, and ROS production. Also, it leads to a decrease in SOD, cell viability, MMP, and GSH peroxidase activity. The outcomes revealed that ginkgolide K attenuated the toxicity of glutamate in PC12 cells by various mechanisms, such as preventing Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx, ROS production, and apoptosis reduction (
