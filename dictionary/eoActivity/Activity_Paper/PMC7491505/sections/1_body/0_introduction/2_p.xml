<p>It has been hypothesized that elevated glutamate is mediated by the over-induction of glutamate receptors, leading to increased calcium (Ca
 <sup>2+</sup>) influx. Another hypothesis is reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation, depletion of glutathione content, and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (

Also, excessive glutamate causes up-regulation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and autophagy cascades that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases pathophysiology, as well (
