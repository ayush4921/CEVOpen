<p>Suppression of NMDA receptors may be relevant to cinnamaldehyde neuroprotective effects against amyloid-β-induced neurotoxicity (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). In a study, the protective effects of cinnamaldehyde (5, 10, 20 μM) on glutamate-induced excitotoxicity were examined in PC12 cells. Glutamate at a concentration of 4 mM caused the generation of ROS and reduced the level of glutathione (GSH) and SOD activity. Pretreatment of the cells with cinnamaldehyde reduced cell death, ROS production, the activity of caspase -3/-9, and the release of cytochrome C, and modulated the expression of the Bcl-2 family (
