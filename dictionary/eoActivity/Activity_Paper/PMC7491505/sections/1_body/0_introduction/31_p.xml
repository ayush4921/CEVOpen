<p>Naringenin, as an anti-oxidant bioflavonoid isolated from 
 <italic>Dracocephalum rupestre</italic>, is found in a variety of fruits and herbs (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). In a study, the neuroprotective impacts of naringenin on excitotoxicity incited by glutamate in primary hippocampal neurons of neonatal mice were investigated. Naringenin directed ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation and decreased the degeneration of dendrites because of glutamate exposure in cultured hippocampal neurons. Besides, naringenin actuated the BDNF and other neuroprotective cytokines and notably improved the survival rates of the neurons 24 hrs following glutamate exposure (
