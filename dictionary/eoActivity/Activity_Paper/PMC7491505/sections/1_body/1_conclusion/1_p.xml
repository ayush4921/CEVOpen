<p>The idea of excitotoxicity as a vital mechanism to comprehend neurotoxicity has made significant progress in determining its role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. It is currently accepted that glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter, and when its level elevates over its threshold value, it leads to excitotoxicity. In this review, we concentrated on different induced neurotoxicities in various studies (

 <italic>in vivo</italic>) and investigated the protective effects of plants and their constituents on induced toxicity in neural cells. Because of the limited studies available that evaluate their neuroprotective activities, neuroprotective properties of natural compounds, especially curcumin, cinnamaldehyde, thymoquinone, and astaxanthin, need to be discussed more. Most of these promising phytochemicals could play their neuroprotective roles through a reduction in neuronal cell death, restoration of GSH, a decrease in MDA levels, preventing caspases activity, modulation of oxidative stress and protection of neurons against ROS as anti-oxidant activities, reduction of Ca
