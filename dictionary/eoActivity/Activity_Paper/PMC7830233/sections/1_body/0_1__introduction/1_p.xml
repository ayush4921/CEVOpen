<p>Ethnobotany is a relatively recent denomination for a discipline that studies plant names, uses and management by human societies from ancient to current times, aiming at their projection to the future [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Even if a precedent of this term, botanical ethnography, was coined to name the investigation of any plant materials in archaeology in order to unveil their uses and symbolisms [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], Harshberger [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] himself emphasised the fact that ethnobotanical findings should not only constitute an inventory of old knowledge, but should be relevant for current productive activities. From those dates to the present times, ethnobotany undertook methodological innovations, but maintained the double approach of recording and preserving the ancient uses of plants by people—which contributes to describing human lifestyles—and aiming to improve human life conditions [

According to the importance of using folk local knowledge to preserve and improve health, not a few drugs have been developed based on their ethnobotanical background, such as, to quote just two famous and recent ones, the oseltamivir, used against chicken flu [

 <xref rid="B6-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, in agreement with this, medical or pharmaceutical ethnobotany, the botanical side of ethnopharmacology, is one of the main pillars of the discipline, particularly in industrialised countries [
