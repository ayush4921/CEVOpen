<p>One of the aspects always addressed in ethnobotanical investigation is the distribution of the plant taxa recorded in botanical families, since, after the number of plant species known in a given territory, the families in which they are included is one of the most evident pieces of information. Even if some deeper analyses of the causes for some predominating families have been undertaken [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], work in this field is still lacking, including territories other than those already considered, and taking into account, among others, phylogenetic issues.
