<p>With the aim of assessing the general state of pharmaceutical ethnobotanical knowledge in the studied area, we calculated the ethnobotanicity index (EI; [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]), which is the quotient between the number of plants used and the total number of plants that constitute the flora of the territory, expressed as a percentage. For this purpose, only the plants present in the Catalan linguistic area’s flora [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were considered, and 5,500 taxa at specific and infraspecific level (Sáez, 2019, pers. comm.) were adopted. Furthermore, we adapted this index to calculate it for families as well.
