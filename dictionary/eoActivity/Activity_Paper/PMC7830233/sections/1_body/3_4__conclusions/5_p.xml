<p>In the phylogenetic reconstruction, a robust hot node appears in three medicinal groups: immune system disorders and neoplasia; pain and inflammation; and pregnancy, birth and puerperal disorders constituted by the Iridaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae, and Asphodelaceae. The last three families also constitute a hot node clade for tonic and restorative. Tonic and restorative activities also have another robust hot node, constituted by Betulaceae, Juglandaceae and Fagaceae. For the endocrine system and metabolic disorders, the clade of Apiaceae and Araliacaeae was detected as relevant. Two robust hot nodes appear for poisoning, on the one hand Cucurbitaceae and Coriariaceae, and on the other hand Malvaceae, Cistaceae and Thymelaeaceae. These results centred on the familial level are appropriate when establishing relationships between chemical composition, phylogenetic aspects and ethnobotanical knowledge.</p>
