<p>A robust hot node appears in three medicinal groups: immune system disorders and neoplasia; pain and inflammation; and pregnancy, birth and puerperal disorders. The hot node is constituted by the Iridaceae and three families classically included in the Liliaceae l.s., Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae, and Asphodelaceae. The last three families also constitute a hot node clade for tonic and restorative. In addition, only Amaryllidaceae and Asparagaceae are hot nodes for the endocrine system and metabolic disorders. </p>
