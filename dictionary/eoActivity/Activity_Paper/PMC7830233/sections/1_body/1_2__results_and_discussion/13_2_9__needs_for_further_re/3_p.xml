<p>Given their relevance in most ethnofloristic surveys, the role of commercially-acquired plants in the ethnoflora, and the comparison of their uses with those of autochthonous or allochthonous plants currently present in the flora —and, then, the comparison between these two categories—is a subject that should be addressed in detail in the different major geographical areas of the world. At the family level, as treated in this work, 15 families not present in the local flora (apart from some others present hosting non-native taxa) have been recorded in a relatively small territory. This is a consequence of cultural exchanges through time, recently accelerated by the globalisation process. </p>
