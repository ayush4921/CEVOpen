<p>Finally, a relevant aspect is a relationship between ethnobotany and phytochemistry (the latter leading to pharmacology and linked to phylogeny). Although there is not an obvious and unidirectional relationship, and little is known about phytochemical composition as compared with evolutionary aspects [

 <xref rid="B16-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], and thus can help in progressing in the necessary multidisciplinary approach to ethnopharmacology and ethnomedicine. Projecting data such as those treated here in a phylogenetic framework has allowed us to detect hot nodes, richer in families useful in pharmaceutical ethnobotany. Further deeper combination of ethnobotanical and phylogenetic information within one family or a group of a few related families could lead to detecting and predicting taxa useful for particular troubles. Several ethnobotanical works include the phytochemical and/or pharmacological validation of the folk uses reported or discuss ethnobotanical knowledge in the light of chemical plant composition [

 <xref rid="B73-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], and this will probably be more common in the near future. Family level is particularly adequate to be addressed for establishing relationships between chemical composition, phylogenetic aspects and ethnobotanical knowledge, the three fields confronted either two by two or altogether.
