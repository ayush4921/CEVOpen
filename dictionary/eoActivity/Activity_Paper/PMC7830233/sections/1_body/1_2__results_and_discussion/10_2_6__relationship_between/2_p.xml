<p>A general consideration of the relationship between families and UR in a phylogenetic frame (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-10-00163-f001">Figure 1</xref>) shows, within the angiosperms, that the superasterids clearly host the largest number of uses, as well as the largest number of families with an important number of UR, in comparison with the remaining large groups. In each of these, only one or a few families play a protagonist role, such as Malvaceae, Rosaceae and Rutaceae in the superrosids, Ranunculaceae in the eudicots, and Amaryllidaceae and Poaceae in the monocots. Magnoliids and basal angiosperms are not of much significance in terms of UR. It is worth mentioning that, in the asterids, most UR are concentred in the most evolved clade, formed by the campanulids plus the lamiids. As for the gymnosperms, the Pinaceae accumulate most UR.
