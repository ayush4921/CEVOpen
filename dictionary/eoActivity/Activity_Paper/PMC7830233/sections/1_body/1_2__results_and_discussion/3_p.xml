<p>The ethnobotanicity index (EI) for the studied area is 14.44%. In addition, the total considered flora ([
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], see materials and methods for precisions) is at least slightly larger than that of the territories object of the present research, since some plants present in the places not covered here (i.e., Valencian area and some of the Balearic Islands) do not grow in the areas here concerned. This just means that, in fact, the EI in the studied area has been slightly underestimated. The result, as calculated, is higher than in other Mediterranean areas like Arrábida Natural Park, Portugal (12.1%; [
