<p>The remaining most quoted families are Adoxaceae (4.14%), Apiaceae (3.49%), Amaryllidaceae (3.24%), Oleaceae (3.08%), Pinaceae (2.90%) and Rutaceae (2.79%). Four of these families (Apiaceae, Oleaceae, Pinaceae, Rutaceae) have not been the object of any recent systematic restructuring, and they are classically important in terms of medicinal taxa. Conversely, the Adoxaceae, with only ca. 225 species worldwide [
