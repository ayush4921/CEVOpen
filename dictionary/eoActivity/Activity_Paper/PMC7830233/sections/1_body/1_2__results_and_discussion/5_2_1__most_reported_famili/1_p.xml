<p>Among the 10 most cited families (
 <xref rid="plants-10-00163-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which represent 57.34% of total use reports, we find some of the most relevant in ethnobotanical studies in the Mediterranean, namely Lamiaceae (15.40%), Asteraceae (11.90%) or Rosaceae (5.57%). These are large in terms of number of taxa, Asteraceae being the largest one [
 <xref rid="B32-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These families are cosmopolitan and well represented in our territories, but also, particularly in Lamiaceae and Rosaceae, they are economically very significant, thanks to aromatic plants in Lamiaceae [
 <xref rid="B33-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and edible fruits and ornamental uses in Rosaceae [
 <xref rid="B34-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In ethnofloristic works conducted in Mediterranean areas, these three families are almost always predominate at the top of the list, and also some others such as Fabaceae and Apiaceae [
