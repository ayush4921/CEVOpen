<p>Results for the over- and underused high taxonomic groups are shown in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00163-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Gymnosperms and monocots are the only two groups that differ from the common proportion. The observed proportion was 0.1709 and ranges from 16% and 18% with 95% of probability and, consequently, we can refuse the null hypothesis for these groups. While monocots are underused, gymnosperms are overused. The proportion of used monocots is very low, and the 95% posterior credible interval very narrow. Contrarily, gymnosperms show the highest proportion of the used plants, and a larger interval, possibly related, according to Weckerle et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], to their small number of species.
