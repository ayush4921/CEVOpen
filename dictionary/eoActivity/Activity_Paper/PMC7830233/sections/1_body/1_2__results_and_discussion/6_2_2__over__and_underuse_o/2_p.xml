<p>The families whose 95% posterior credible interval lies above the interval of the overall proportion of flora (0.160, 0.182) are listed in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00163-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. These overused families are families represented by a small number of genera, and most of them having medicinal uses, that is, with high proportions. The preponderance of woody species over herbaceous among the most used has been discussed by several authors [

 <xref rid="B54-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Fagaceae, Rutaceae and Cannabaceae are the three most overused families. The woody families such as Fagaceae, Pinaceae and Cupressaceae (the last two gymnosperms) together with some shrubby families such as Buxaceae, Rhamnaceae and Ericaceae are overrepresented in the medicinal Catalan flora, but in approximately the same proportion as weedy plant families, such as Equisetaceae, Asphodelaceae or Urticaceae.
