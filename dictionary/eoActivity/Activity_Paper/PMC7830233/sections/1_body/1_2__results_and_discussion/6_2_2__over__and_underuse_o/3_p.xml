<p>The families whose 95% posterior credible interval lies below the interval of the overall proportion of flora (0.160, 0.182) are listed in 
 <xref rid="plants-10-00163-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Usually, these are families comprising a large number of species in the local flora and with little representation in the medicinal one. In the present study, only nine families are underused, Cyperaceae, Plumbaginaceae and Poaceae, the most underused. Three families, Poaceae, Juncaceae and Cyperaceae belong to the underrepresented high group of monocots. In the present study, most of members of the underused families are herbaceous plants.
