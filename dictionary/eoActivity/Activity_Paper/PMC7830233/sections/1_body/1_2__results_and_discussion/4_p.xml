<p>The EI was conceived [
 <xref rid="B31-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and is usually calculated, for species and infraspecific taxa. Nevertheless, as the present paper focuses on families too, we calculated the EI for this taxonomic category (excluding the 15 non-native families, not present in the flora used as a basis). We found a familiar EI of 68.21%, indicating that almost three-quarters of the families in the area considered contained plants used in pharmaceutical ethnobotany. We believe that it would be of interest to calculate this parameter for other ethnofloras, in order to be able to compare the rates of families hosting useful plants.
