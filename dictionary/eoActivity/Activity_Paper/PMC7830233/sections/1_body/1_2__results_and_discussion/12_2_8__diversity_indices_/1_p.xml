<p>The results of the Shannon and Margalef indices for each family are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-plants-10-00163">Supplementary Materials</xref>. Although the values of the two indices are zero for several families and some of them present low values, such as the Vitaceae (H = 0.01 and k = 0.11), other families show a moderate diversity. The family Asteraceae is the one that presents the highest diversity according to the Shannon index (H = 1.45), while, according to the Margalef index, the Campanulaceae is the family with the greatest diversity (k = 0.70). These differences are due to the fact that the Margalef index is higher when the number of taxa and the number of use reports are equal or close within a family, while if there are many use reports for a few taxa, the diversity decreases. Despite showing a different sensitivity to the variation in the number of taxa and use reports, both indices are well correlated, (r = 0.841,
