<p>Concerning plants not appearing in the flora of the territories studied ([
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; see materials and methods for details), there are 15 families not present in the flora of our territory, representing 12.5% of the total number of families. Examples are Actinidiaceae, Myristicaceae and Zingiberaceae. These families contain very renowned and used medicinal plants, some of them used first for food purposes, such as 
 <italic>Actinidia chinensis</italic> Planch., 
 <italic>Myristica fragrans</italic> Houtt. and 
 <italic>Zingiber officinalis</italic> Roscoe. In addition, there are 62 taxa not present in our territory, yet belonging to families that nonetheless are present thanks to other genera; this is the case of 
 <italic>Cinnamomum verum</italic> J.Presl (Lauraceae), 
 <italic>Cocos nucifera</italic> L. (Arecaceae) or 
 <italic>Coffea arabica</italic> L. (Rubiaceae), to give some examples. Even the two most quoted families, in terms of UR, Asteraceae and Lamiaceae, very abundant in wild representatives in the region under investigation, include non-native plants in the local ethnoflora, some examples are 
 <italic>Echinacea purpurea</italic> (L.) Moench and 
 <italic>Stevia rebaudiana</italic> (Bertoni) Bertoni, and 
 <italic>Monarda didyma</italic> L., 
 <italic>Ocimum basilicum</italic> L., and 
 <italic>Perilla frutescens</italic> (L.) Britton, respectively. It is important to emphasise that a number of plants ethnobotanically used are not present in the Catalan flora [
 <xref rid="B25-plants-10-00163" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and yet they are important in local ethnobotany. Indeed, in a work in progress regarding in the Catalan linguistic area we are recording a non-negligible number and percentage of UR attributed to non-native plants [
