<p>In order to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the results, the certified reference materials and standards were used, namely NIST SRM 1575a—Trace Elements in Pine Needles, NIST SRM 1547—Peach Leaves, NIST SRM 1633b—Constituent Elements in Coal Fly Ash, NIST SRM 1632c—Trace Elements in Coal (Bituminous), IRMM SRM 667—Estuarine Sediment, NIST SRM 2711—Montana Soil, NIST SRM 2710—Montana Soil. 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01764-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the differences between certified and calculated values of concentrations, where “SRM” were used as standards for calculations of concentrations for SRMs in the column “Sample”. Most differences between certified and obtained values are lower than 2 σ, but for Sc, Sm, and U the relative differences are 20–27%. There are no such data for elements Mo and Cd because their certified values are in the irradiated SRM only.
