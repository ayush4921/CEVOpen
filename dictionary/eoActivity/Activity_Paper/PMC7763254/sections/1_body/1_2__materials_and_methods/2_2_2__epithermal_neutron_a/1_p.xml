<p>The analytical procedures and the basic characteristics of the pneumatic system employed at the pulsed fast reactor IBR-2M are described in detail elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Two types of irradiation were carried out. One is a short irradiation for 3–5 min to determine short-lived isotopes (Al, Ca, Cl, I, Mg, Mn, and V). After a decay-period of 5–7 min the irradiated samples were measured twice, first for 3–5 min and then for 10–15 min. A long-irradiation of 4–5 days was used to analyze for long-lived radionuclides. After irradiation the samples were re-packed and measured twice: first after 4–5 days for 40–50 min to determine As, Br, K, La, Na, Mo, Sm, U, and W and after 20 days for 2.5–3 h to determine Ba, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Fe, Hf, Ni, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, Yb, and Zn. The gamma spectra of induced activity were measured with an HPGe detector with a resolution of 1.9 keV for the 
 <sup>60</sup>Co 1332 keV line.
