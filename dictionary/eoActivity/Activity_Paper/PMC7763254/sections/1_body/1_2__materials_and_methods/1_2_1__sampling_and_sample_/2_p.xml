<p>Sample no. 3 was collected in August in the vicinity of Beijing, in the Xian Shan Mountains region (near the Botanical Garden of the Institute of Botany of the Academy of Sciences of China), where the soils are highly acidic and depleted in nutrients, such as potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen. The humus content in the upper horizon reaches 6–9%. Due to the fact that red soils are often located on the slopes of mountains and foothills, they are prone to erosion, which sharply reduces their fertility. All of the plant material samples were collected away from possible sources of industrial pollution. Sample no. 4 (also collected in August) was of plants grown from seeds in the Peter the Great Botanical Garden of the Botanical Institute of RAS (the Russian Academy of Sciences) (St. Petersburg, Russia). The plants were grown on an artificial soil mixture of sod, leafy soil, sand with the addition of peat. Seeds for the cultivation of 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> were brought from China in 2014 and the plants were grown in the collection nursery of Medicinal plants of the Peter the Great Botanical Garden in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the herbs collected in August 2015. The plant material (branches, flowers, and leaves in equal amount) was not washed. Plants were air-dried in a clean drying chamber and then oven dried at 40 °C for 48 h until constant weight. The dried samples were ground into fine powder in an agate ball mill. Two sub-samples of each plant were pressed into thick pellets using a press-form of 13 mm diameter.
