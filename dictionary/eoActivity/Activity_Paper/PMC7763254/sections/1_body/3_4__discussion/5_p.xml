<p>Our results are consistent with those of Affaf et al., 2019 [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-09-01764" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It has been established that potassium and calcium accumulate in the highest amounts among the macroelements in 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> grass samples; they account for about 90% of the total content of elements in the plant. It was revealed that the distribution of macro and microelements in a plant differs significantly depending on the place, time, and growing conditions.
