<p>From the data in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01764-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, it can be seen that the level of Na, K, Fe decreases in the grass on the gradient of summer months in the 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> grass collected in China. The grown plants of 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> in the conditions of St. Petersburg accumulate much fewer basic elements, in comparison with wild plants.
