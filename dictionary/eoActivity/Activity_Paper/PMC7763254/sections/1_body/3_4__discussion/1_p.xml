<p>It was shown earlier that the content of such macronutrients as K—41.5 (mg/g), Ca—36.7, Mg—6.1, Fe—0.3 were determined in the 
 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> herbs [

Moreover, the concentrations of the trace elements (the coefficient of accumulation of microelements) are as follows: Mn—0.11, Cu—0.52, Zn—2.49, Co—0.09, Mo—0.90, Cr—0.48, Al—0.20, Ba—11.83, V—0.01, Se—5.50, Ni—0.51, Sr—6.17, Cd—8.00. It is indicated that they accumulate Zn, Cd, Sr, Ba, Se (especially Ba and Sr). A comparison of the data obtained with the published data [

 <italic>T. terrestris</italic> from China accumulate the same substances in comparable amounts.
