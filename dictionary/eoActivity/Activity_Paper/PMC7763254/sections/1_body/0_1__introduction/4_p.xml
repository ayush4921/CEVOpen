The chemical constituents in plants, including metal ions, are particularly responsible for medical and nutritional properties and for toxicity as well. The metals also play an important role in the plants themselves. The heavy metals can directly impair mental and neurological function, by influencing neurotransmitter production and by utilizing and altering numerous metabolic body processes. The systems in which toxic metal elements can induce impairment and dysfunction includes the blood and cardiovascular detoxification pathways (colon, liver, kidney, and skin), endocrine energy production pathways, and the enzymatic, gastrointestinal, immune, nervous, reproductive, and urinary systems.
