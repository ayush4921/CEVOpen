<p>From the data in 
 <xref rid="plants-09-01764-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> it can be seen that in natural samples (from China) the content of elements such as Na, Mg, Cl, K, Ca, and Fe is higher than in plants grown in the Botanical Garden (Russia). However, the content of magnesium and zinc is higher in the Russian samples, 2â€“3 times higher than in the Chinese ones.
