 <p>Plants of the Euphorbia genus present a wide range of therapeutic applications. This study is aimed at investigating new antidigestive enzyme agents from 
  <italic>Euphorbia cyparissias</italic> through inhibition of lipid and carbohydrate absorption, to evaluate their potential applications for the treatment of metabolic syndrome. Lipase, phospholipase, protease, 
  <italic>α</italic>-amylase, 
  <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase, and xanthine oxidase activities under treatment with aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
  <italic>Euphorbia cyparissias</italic> were observed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of these extracts, as well as their antioxidant and cytotoxic effects. Results showed that ethanolic and aqueous extracts exhibited important inhibitory activity in a concentration-related manner on digestive enzymes, which is more effective than the commercial drugs used as controls. Results also showed that, out of the two extracts tested, the ethanolic extract presented the most promising results in inhibiting the activities of all digestive enzymes used. Moreover, the two extracts displayed a higher reducing power than that of the positive control used. The obtained results, together with previous reports in the literature, strongly suggest that 
  <italic>Euphorbia cyparissias</italic> extracts may be natural inhibitors of the digestive enzymes and thus a potential new drug for metabolic syndrome treatment.
