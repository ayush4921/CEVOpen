<p>Some 
 <italic>Euphorbia</italic> plants have been identified as having antioxidant effects, such as 
 <italic>Euphorbia royleana Boiss</italic> [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], 
 <italic>Euphorbia hirta</italic> L. [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], 
 <italic>Euphorbia heterophylla</italic> Desf. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and 
 <italic>Euphorbia cuneata</italic> Vahi [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Interestingly, the use of Euphorbia spp. L constituents as remedy for diseases, like antipyretic, analgesic, anxiolytic, and anti-inflammatory, has been previously stated in literatures [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and thus can be used to inhibit secreted inflammatory enzymes such as secreted phospholipase A2 (PLA2) [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], among other phospholipases. According to several studies, digestive enzymes are implicated in metabolic syndrome components, namely, obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia, and this metabolic imbalance is related specifically to lipolytic and metabolic enzymes such as pancreatic lipase, 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase, 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, and XO [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Considering all these facts and in order to prevent metabolic syndrome, searching a natural drug without undesirable side effects should be an urgent purpose. Thus, the present study is aimed at investigating if 
 <italic>Euphorbia cyparissias L</italic>. (
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic>) possesses inhibitory effects on some important digestive enzymes in addition to its possible cytotoxicity on three human cell lines.
