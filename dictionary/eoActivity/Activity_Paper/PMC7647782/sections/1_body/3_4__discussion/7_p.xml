<p>In this study, we have selected the two pancreatic digestive proteases trypsin and chymotrypsin to observe their behavior in the presence of different concentrations of ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4(b)</xref>). The inhibitory effect of the two extracts was compared to that of the positive control with BBI [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These results were in line with those obtained previously by Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] who demonstrate that the phenolic compounds partially inhibit trypsin and a residual activity of trypsin was always maintained at 32%.
