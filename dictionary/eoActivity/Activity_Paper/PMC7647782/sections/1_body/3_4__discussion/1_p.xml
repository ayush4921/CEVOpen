<p>According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES, 2009-2010), approximately 69% of US adults are overweight or obese, with more than 78 million adult Americans considered obese (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)) [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It is safe to assume that obesity is a public health problem. One of the most promising targets to regulate and prevent obesity is through the inhibition of the digestion and absorption of dietary fat [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Pancreatic lipases are the targeted enzymes because of their role in the dietary lipids' digestion. In this study, three digestive lipases, which are DrPL, SPL, and PPL, had their activities evaluated in the presence of different concentrations (0-100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> or orlistat, a potent inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic lipases and among the most used drugs in obesity, and possibly diabetes, treatment [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the two extracts presented a stronger inhibition effect of activities of the three lipases tested than that of orlistat at all concentrations used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> extracts and more specifically ethanolic extract (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.3 ± 0.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) was found to be more effective in inhibiting the catalytic activity of PPL than previously reported plant extracts such as common plant sterols sitosterol and stigmasterol [
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and positive controls such as orlistat (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 12.3 ± 0.1 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], curcumin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 13.3 ± 0.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and quercetin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 18.6 ± 0.8 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This result is valid for lipases tested (
