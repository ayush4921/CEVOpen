<p>Unlike with lipids and carbohydrates, the benefits of inhibiting protein digestion are not clear-cut even though it may reduce calorie intake because of the suppression of digestive proteolytic activities during gastrointestinal transit. Digestion of proteins is catalyzed by a synergistic action of different digestive proteases which are secreted in the stomach (like endoproteinases), but mostly in the pancreas (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase). Other proteases such as carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase are also involved in protein digestion reactions [
