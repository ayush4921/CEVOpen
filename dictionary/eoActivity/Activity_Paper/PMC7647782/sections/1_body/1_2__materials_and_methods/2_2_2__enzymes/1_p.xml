<p>Dromedary (DrPlA
 <sub>2</sub>-IB), porcine (PPPlA
 <sub>2</sub>-IB), and stingray group IB phospholipases (SPLA
 <sub>2</sub>-IB) were purified and prepared as described in our previous works [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and De Haas et al. [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], respectively. Dromedary (DrPL), stingray (SPL), and porcine (PPL) lipases were also purified according to protocols optimized in previous works [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The enzymes
