<p>To measure reducing power activity, extracts with concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 1 mg/mL were mixed with 1 mL of 1% potassium ferricyanide and 1 mL of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.6). After incubation for 20 min at 50°C, 1.25 mL of 20% TCA was added to the mixture and was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. Finally, the upper layer solution (1.25 mL) was mixed with an equal volume of deionized water and 0.5 mL of 0.1% fresh ferric chloride. The absorbance of the obtained mixture was measured at 700 nm using distilled water as the blank and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) as a positive control.</p>
