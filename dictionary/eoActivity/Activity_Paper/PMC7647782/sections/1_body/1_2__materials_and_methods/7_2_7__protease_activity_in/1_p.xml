<p>The trypsin and chymotrypsin activity inhibition was performed as described by Kunitz [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An aliquot of 1 mL of ethanolic or water extract was incubated for 15 min at 37°C with an equal volume of the enzyme. The mixture was then incubated for 30 min at 37°C with 2 mL of 2% casein as the substrate. The reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 mL of 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The activity was determined by measuring the absorbance of the mixture at 280 nm, after 15 min of centrifugation at 15 000 rpm. Ethanol was used as a negative control and Bowman-Birk Inhibitor (BBI) as a positive control. The protease activity inhibition was also expressed as inhibition percentage, which was determined by comparing the results with those of a control experiment.
