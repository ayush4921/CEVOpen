<p>According to methodology described by Bondet et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], XO activity was determined by measuring the formation of uric acid from xanthine at 295 nm. The first reagent was a mixture of xanthine (667 mM), EDTA (0.1 mM), hydroxylamine (0.2 mM), and phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5). In each microplate well, 15 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> aqueous or ethanolic extract (0 to 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) and 40 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of XO were preincubated for 5 min at 37°C. After that, 95 
 <italic>μ</italic>L from the first reagent was added into each microplate well and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Then, 150 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of uric acid reagent was added in the mixture and the absorbance was measured again. Ethanol was used as a negative control and allopurinol as a positive control. The same equation used to measure 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase and 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase activities was used to measure that of XO.
