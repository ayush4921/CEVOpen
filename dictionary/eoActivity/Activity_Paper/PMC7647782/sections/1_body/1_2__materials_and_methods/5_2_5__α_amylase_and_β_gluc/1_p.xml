<p>Alpha amylase activity was measured according to Subranian et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L sample of 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase (3 IU) was mixed with a final concentration range from 0 to 500 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> aqueous and ethanolic extracts at 37°C for 5 min. Acarbose was used as a positive control. The residual activity was evaluated by measuring twice the absorbance at 620 nm after 8 min (A1) and 13 min (A2) after incubation with substrate (180 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of lab test diluted in water (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>)). The reaction was carried out in a microplate (Bio-Tek ELX-800, Winooski, VT, USA). The 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase inhibition (
 <italic>i</italic>) was calculated as follows: 
 <italic>i</italic> (%) = 100–(A2–A1/A2 control–A1 control) × 100, where A1 is the absorbance of the initial reading and A2 is the absorbance of the second reading.
