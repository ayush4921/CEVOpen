<p>The phospholipase activities were measured based on the De Araújo and Radvanyi method [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The inhibitory effect of various extracts was determined using samples of dromedary, stingray, and porcine digestive group IB phospholipases (PLA2-IB). A 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L sample of ethanolic or aqueous extract was mixed with 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>L of PLA2-GIB and preincubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was added to 1 mL of the substrate, which was composed of lecithin (3.5 mM) solubilized in 100 mM NaCl, 3 mM sodium taurodeoxycholate, 10 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 0.055 mM red phenol at a pH of 7.6. The activity was verified by measuring spectrophotometrically the absorbance at 558 nm for 5 min. The inhibition percentage was calculated by measuring residual activity compared to negative control assay (absence of extract). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined from the curve.
