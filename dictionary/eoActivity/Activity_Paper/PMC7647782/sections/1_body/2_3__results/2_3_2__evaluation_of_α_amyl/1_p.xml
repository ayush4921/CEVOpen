<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, most of the enzymes tested including 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase, and XO were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner after incubation with ethanolic and aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(a)</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3(c)</xref>). The values of IC
 <sub>50</sub> presented in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> allowed us to quantify more precisely the inhibitory effect of the two extracts on enzyme activities compared to those of the positive controls. Ethanolic extract presented the most promising results in inhibiting 
 <italic>α</italic>-amylase, 
 <italic>β</italic>-glucosidase, and XO, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 98.8 ± 8.6 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, 8.1 ± 0.3 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, and 7.2 ± 0.7 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively, followed by aqueous extract and positive controls.
