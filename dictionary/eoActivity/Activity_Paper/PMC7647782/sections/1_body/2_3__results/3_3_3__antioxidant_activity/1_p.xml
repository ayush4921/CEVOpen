<p>The antiradical activities of different concentration of the two extracts were determined using DPPH free radical assay, and results were compared to those of the BHT, which was used as a positive control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(a)</xref>). The activities of the two extracts were expressed as the mean of IC
 <sub>50</sub> (mg/mL) values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>). The scavenging activities of the two extracts as well as of the BHT were concentration dependent. Results showed that, at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, the ethanolic and aqueous extracts presented high scavenging activities, with values of 90.6 ± 1.2% and 88.2 ± 1.0%, respectively, which were close to that of BHT, with 95.3 ± 0.4%. This finding was confirmed by the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5(b)</xref>, which presents an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ~0.073 mg/mL, ~0.22 mg/mL, and~0.054 mg/L for ethanolic extract, aqueous extract, and BHT, respectively.
