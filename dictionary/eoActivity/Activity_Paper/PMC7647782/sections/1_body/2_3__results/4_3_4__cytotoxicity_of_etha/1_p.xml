<p>The cytotoxicity of 
 <italic>E. cyparissias</italic> extracts in MDA-MB-231, Lovo, and HCT-116 cells was evaluated by measuring the cell density in the presence of increasing concentrations of extracts (0-100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(a)</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6(b)</xref>). This concentration range is the same with that used in previous experiments aiming to test their inhibitory effect on digestive enzymes. Results showed that there is more cell death in the presence of the ethanolic extract than in the presence of the aqueous extract particularly at a concentration of 100 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL for the three type of cells used (
 <xref rid="tab5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). However, at a lower concentration, between 10 and 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, one can note that the three cell lines used are more resistant to the two extracts than with higher concentrations. No significant decrease in the cell number was observed in the presence of the two extracts at a concentration of 10 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL. An average of about 55% of the total cell number was viable and resistant in the presence of 25 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL of the ethanolic extract. In contrast, 100% of the cells were viable in the presence of the aqueous extract.
