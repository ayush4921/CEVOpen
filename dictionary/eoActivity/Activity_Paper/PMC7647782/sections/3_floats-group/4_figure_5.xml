  <p>Antioxidant activities of ethanol and aqueous extracts tested with two methods: scavenging activity (a) and DPPH radical and reducing power activities (b). For each method, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was used as standard, under the same conditions. Each value is the mean of triplicate measurements ± SD. 
   <sup>∗</sup>IC
   <sub>50</sub> (mg/L): the concentration at which 50% of the activity is inhibited. 
   <sup>∗</sup>EC50 (mg/L): the effective concentration at which the absorbance reaches 0.5.
