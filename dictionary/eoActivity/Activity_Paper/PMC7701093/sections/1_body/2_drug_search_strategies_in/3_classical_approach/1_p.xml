<p>Classical approach represents either the screening based on previously purified natural compounds or on activity-guided screening of crude extract mixture for active compounds. Further, active compounds are purified by activity-guided purification (

 <xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">Li et al. (2005)</xref>. More than 200 Chinese medicinal herb extracts were screened for anti-SARS-CoV activities by assay for virus-induced cytopathic effect. The crude extracts of 
 <italic>Lycoris radiata</italic>, 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, 
 <italic>Pyrrosia lingua</italic>, and 
 <italic>Lindera aggregate</italic> showed antiviral activity. The ethanolic extract of 
 <italic>L. radiata</italic> was the most active. The majority of bioactive components of 
 <italic>L. radiata</italic> belong to alkaloids that were confirmed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (LC). Finally, lycorine was identified by LC-MS/MS as an effective anti-SARS-CoV component. Now, anti-SARS-CoV2 effect of the lycorine is also shown (
