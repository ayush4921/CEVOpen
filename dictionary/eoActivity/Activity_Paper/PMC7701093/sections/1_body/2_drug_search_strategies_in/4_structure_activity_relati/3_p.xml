 <xref rid="ref71" ref-type="bibr">Tallei et al. (2020)</xref> made a list of natural components with M
 <sup>pro</sup>-inhibitor effect; among them are hesperidin, morine, rhoifolin, pectolinarin, and nabiximols. Binding interaction and ligand affinity of these compounds to M
 <sup>pro</sup> was the same as of nelfinavir, and even better than chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, − recommended by the FDA as emergency anti-COVID-treatment anti-malarial drugs (
