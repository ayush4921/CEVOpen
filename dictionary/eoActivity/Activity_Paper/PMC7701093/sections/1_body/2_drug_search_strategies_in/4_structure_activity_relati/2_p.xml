<p>Topological indices are able to predict different activities and physicochemical characteristics such as boiling point, entropy, enthalpy, etc. Similarly, based on the topological properties of some chemical structures with antiviral activity, (for example remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and theaflavine), the antiviral activity of the new compounds can be predicted (
