<p>Structure-activity-relationship is an approach for finding the relationships between the chemical structure (structural-related properties) and the biological activity of studied compounds. The need to streamline the drug development process has spawned the development of such strategies as “rational drug design,” where large-scale screening can be done through a database of potential candidate molecules to find those of interest (

Some of them are known to have antiviral and other properties, for others only structural data is available. The properties of many plants-derived substances remain unclear. These unknown properties can be predicted by computer modeling methods.
