<p>Previously, new drugs were discovered mostly by a “trial and error” approach (

The emergence of genomics and proteomics and the development of bioinformatics and cheminformatics made a breakthrough into the drug design, bringing the concept and techniques for large-scale screening. Newly emerging diseases require faster pace of drug development. Worldwide transmission of COVID-19 (
