<p>The cell-based cleavage assay does not require purification of the active protease, and represents closely the natural physiological state. Investigating the

 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. (2005)</xref> have made in-frame construction, containing the M
 <sup>pro</sup>, the substrate, and the luciferase, and transformed it into Vero cells. Since a more than 30 kDa protein fused at the N-terminus of the luciferase resulted in a dramatic decrease of luciferase activity, the detection of activity of luciferase was considered by authors as a measure for the cis-cleavage by M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Epigallocatechin gallate abundant in green tea (
