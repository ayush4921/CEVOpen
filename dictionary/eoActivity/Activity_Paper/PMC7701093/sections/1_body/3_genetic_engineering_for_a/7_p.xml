<p>Genetic engineering technologies are also applicable at the stage of evaluating the therapeutic effect of drugs using preclinical animal models. Several animal models, from mice to and non-human primates, have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. From one hand, primates are closest to humans; the clinical picture of their disease is almost the same as in humans. From other hand, they are much more expensive than mice. Therefore, drugs are initially tested on mice (

Unfortunately, due to structural differences in mouse ACE2 compared to human ACE2 proteins, the SARS coronaviruses exhibit poor tropism characteristics for mouse tissues. So, the wild-type lines are not optimal for studying infections of the newly discovered coronavirus. Several transgenic mice strains, carrying hACE2 under control of different promoters, including human cytokeratin 18 (K18) promoter, composite CAG promoter consisting of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer, the chicken β-actin promoter and rabbit globulin splicing and polyadenylation sites, HFH4 lung ciliated epithelial cell-specific promoter, were developed in 2006–2016 to study SARS-CoV infection (
