<p id="Par11">The protean nature of fragments provides ample opportunities for chemical elaboration, and a single fragment can lead to multiple drugs. For example, a 9-atom fragment (7-azaindole) is found in at least six clinical compounds targeting multiple kinases developed by different groups of researchers
