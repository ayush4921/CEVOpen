<p id="Par3">SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells and coopts ribosomes to translate its viral RNA into two polyproteins. These polyproteins are in turn cleaved into individual peptides, largely by an enzyme prosaically called the main protease, or M
 <sup>pro</sup>. Because of its early, essential role in the viral replication cycle, M
 <sup>pro</sup> is an obvious target for drug discovery. Indeed, researchers have previously identified potent peptidomimetic inhibitors of M
 <sup>pro</sup> from MERS-CoV, a related coronavirus

 <sup>pro</sup> have also been rapidly developed
