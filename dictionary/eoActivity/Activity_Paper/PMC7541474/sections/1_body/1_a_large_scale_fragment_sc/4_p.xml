<p id="Par6">In the new 
 <italic>Nature Communications</italic> paper, the researchers started by screening a library of ~1000 electrophilic fragments against M
 <sup>pro</sup> using mass spectrometry to identify which ones could bind to the protein. Due to the reactivity of the active-site cysteine, rather stringent conditions (5 µM of each fragment for 1.5 hours at room temperature) were used to achieve some degree of discrimination. Under these conditions, 68 fragments appreciably modified M
 <sup>pro</sup> but were not generically reactive against other proteins or small molecule thiols.
