 </sup>. Covalent bond formation can improve the efficacy of inhibitors, particularly when the bond formation is irreversible, as is the case for drugs such as penicillin. Starting with the era of high-throughput screening, however, pharmaceutical companies tended to move away from covalent drugs for fear that indiscriminate binding to other proteins could cause unpredictable toxicity. Yet the recent success of multiple selective, well-characterized covalent cancer drugs has renewed interest in covalent modifiers, including fragment-sized molecules
