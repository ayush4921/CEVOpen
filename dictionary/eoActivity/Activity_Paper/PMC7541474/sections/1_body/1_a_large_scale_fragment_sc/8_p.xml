<p id="Par10">Another impressive aspect of the work is the researchers’ dedication to open science. Coordinates for all the structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank and were released in real time as they were solved. The next steps are to use this information to produce molecules with better activities to seed drug discovery programs. These methods commonly include merging or linking two fragments to produce a larger, more potent molecule as for example in the case of cancer drug venetoclax
