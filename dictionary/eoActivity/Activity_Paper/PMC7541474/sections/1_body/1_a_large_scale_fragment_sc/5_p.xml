<p id="Par7">Among the various methods used to characterize fragments that bind to a protein, X-ray crystallography is arguably the most informative as it reveals the detailed molecular interactions of ligand binding. Even when successful, crystallography can be time-consuming, and many drug hunters consider themselves fortunate when they have one or a few crystal structures. Here the researchers obtained a 1.25 Å high-resolution structure of M
 <sup>pro</sup> from crystals suitable for soaking experiments. Some of the covalent fragments were first reacted with the protein and then crystallized. In total 68 covalent fragments and 1176 mostly noncovalent fragments were screened by either co-crystallization or soaking of the compounds into the crystals. 1877 crystals were mounted at Diamond and 1638 datasets with a resolution better than 2.8 Å were collected—an impressive undertaking that yielded structures of 96 fragments bound to M
 <sup>pro</sup>. The speed with which this was done is breathtaking: protein crystals were first obtained on 13 February 2020, and all experimental data were collected by 7 March. The first crystal structures were made public only three days later, and by the beginning of April 2020 all final structures were released in the midst of the evolving pandemic. If a picture is worth a thousand words, Douangamath et al. have published a novel.
