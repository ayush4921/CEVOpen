<p id="Par2">As of July 2020, more than half a million people worldwide have died of COVID-19. That number will have grown considerably by the time you read this. The research community has responded to the pandemic with unprecedented urgency. Multiple experimental vaccines have entered clinical trials—with several already in phase III—while clinicians explore potential treatments using experimental antibodies and drugs already approved for other indications. With luck, an effective vaccine will soon be available. However, it is worth remembering that while we still do not have an effective vaccine for HIV nearly three decades after its discovery, small molecule drugs have made living with the virus manageable. Creating new small molecule drugs often takes years, which is all the more reason to start early. Some promising steps towards the goal of developing a drug that specifically targets SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, are now described by Douangamath et al. in
