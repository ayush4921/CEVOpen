<p id="Par13">Although vaccines or antibody-based treatments may well be available before a small molecule is approved, the work on M
 <sup>pro</sup> is still worth pursuing. Vaccines may not be 100% effective in preventing infection, so drugs to treat COVID-19 will still be needed. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus to afflict us since the beginning of the century, and there is no reason to think we will not see more. While SARS seems to have disappeared, there are still no approved treatments for MERS, which has a higher mortality rate but a lower transmission rate. Given the close conservation of M
 <sup>pro</sup>, fragment-derived inhibitors could be broadly active against such threats. The fragments discovered by Douangamath et al.—along with efforts carried out worldwide—represent the first steps in a long and uncertain journey. But perhaps someday, one of them will be recognized as a giant leap for humankind.
