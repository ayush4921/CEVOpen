<p id="Par12">There is still much to do. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, this is probably not even the end of the beginning. In the case of the first FBDD-derived drug approved, vemurafenib, it took just under a year to go from fragment to clinical candidate, an extraordinarily short amount of time for small molecule drug discovery. Functional activities for the fragments are just starting to be reported, and while some have sub-micromolar IC
 <sub>50</sub>s, they will likely need to be improved by orders of magnitude. Cell permeability, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity of improved molecules all remain to be assessed and optimized. Even if successful, it could be years before any candidates stemming from this work enter the clinic.
