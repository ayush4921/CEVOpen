 <p>Copper nanoparticles (Cu-Nps) are one of the promising materials for the advancement of nanoscience and technology. In this work, we synthesized telmisartan copper nanoparticles and 2-pyrimidinamines via Biginelli reaction using telmisartan copper nanoparticles (Cu-Nps) as a reusable catalyst. The synthesis of 2-pyrimidinamine derivatives (1a-c) was achieved in water and under solvent-free condition (Green chemistry approach). Synthesis of 2-pyrimidinamine with telmisartan copper nanoparticle (Cu-Nps–Pyr) unexpected product was also isolated from synthesis of 2-pyrimidinamine preparation. Antioxidant and cytotoxic activities were carried out both in 2-pyrimidinamine (1a-1c) and 2-pyrimidinamine with telmisartan copper nanoparticles (Cu-Nps–Pyr). The synthesized 2-pyrimidinamine derivatives (1a-c) were characterized from FT-IR, 
  <sup>1</sup>H and 
  <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy, mass and elemental analyses. The synthesized telmisartan copper nanoparticles (Cu-Nps) were characterized from UV spectroscopy, XRD, SEM, EDX, AFM (atomic force microscopy), profile, waviness, and roughness analyses. Antioxidant activity was screened based on ABTS
  <sup>·+</sup> radical scavenging and linoleic acid peroxidation performance. Cu-Nps–Pyr-1b showed substantial antioxidant (97.2%) activity against ABTS
  <sup>·+</sup> assay and 91.2% activity against AAPH assays compared with Trolox. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using HepG2, HeLa, and MCF-7 cell lines, the Cu-Nps–Pyr-1a is high in toxicities (GI
  <sub>50</sub> = 0.01
