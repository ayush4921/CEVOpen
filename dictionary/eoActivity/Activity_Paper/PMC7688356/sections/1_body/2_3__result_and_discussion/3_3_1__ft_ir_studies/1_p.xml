<p>The main characteristic experimental vibrations of Cu-Nps are obtained from FT-IR shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The literature data of IR values were referred to the analysis of the vibrational frequency presence in the compounds. For spectral values of O−H and C−H stretching, the vibration frequency range was obtained at 4000−2000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>. The O−H stretching in water molecules was assigned at 3432 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> for Cu-Nps. The mode of the antisymmetric and the symmetric carboxylate groups was observed at 1593 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (s, FT-IR) and 1391 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>(vs. FT-IR), respectively. Biphenyl group was found in the IR range between 1600 and 1400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The COOH bends and C-N (Bz) stretching modes was observed at 1235 cm
 <sup>−1,</sup> respectively.
