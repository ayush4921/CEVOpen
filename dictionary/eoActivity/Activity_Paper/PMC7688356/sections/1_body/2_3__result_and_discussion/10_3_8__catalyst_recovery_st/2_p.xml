<p>The application of the catalyst was inspected via optimizing the reaction conditions. A number of aromatic aldehydes were selected to go through the condensation reaction with Cu-Nps (1â€‰mol %) catalytic at room temperature in solvent-free settings, the yield reported in 
 <xref rid="tab3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The Cu-catalyzed performance and reaction mechanism are shown in
