<p>The compound urea (0.01 mol, 0.6 g), Cu catalyst (0.01 mol, 1.7 g), ethyl acetoacetate (0.01 mol, 1.3 mL), benzaldehyde (0.01 mol, 1 mL), and substituted amine (0.05 mol, 1.6 mL) are mixed well together in a mortar and two drops of the con. HCl were added. The precipitate was dissolved in ethanol. The undissolved catalyst was filtered and dried in vacuum and used for the next cycle. The final product was obtained from the evaporation of ethanol from the filtrate and unexpected product also obtained. The final compound was confirmed by TLC. The pure product was obtained from the using suitable recrystallized method. The above procedure was followed for synthesis of the remaining compounds 1b and 1c.</p>
