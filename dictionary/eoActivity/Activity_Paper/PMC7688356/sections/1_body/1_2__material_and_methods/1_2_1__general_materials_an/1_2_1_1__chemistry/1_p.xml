<p>Telmisartan-mediated copper nanoparticle was analyzed from UV, FT-IR, SEM, X-ray with EDX, and AFM methods. FT-IR is recorded via Shimadzu 8201pc (4000-400 cm
 <sup>−1</sup>). The 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>C NMR were recorded via JEOL-300 MHz. An elemental analyzer model (Varian EL III) was used for analysis of elemental presences. Thin layer chromatography was used for purity checking.
