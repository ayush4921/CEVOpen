<p>Pyrimidinamine has great importance as it is widely spread in living organisms and also a broad spectrum of biological activities such as antitumor properties [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], herbicidal [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], fungicidal [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], antidepressant [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and also, amino pyrimidine was an indicator of antitumor [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and antiviral [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] activities. The biological importance of natural and synthetic 2-pyrimidinamine core derivatives are shown in

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the cytotoxic activity of alkaloid marine sponge (bromohymenialdisine) [
