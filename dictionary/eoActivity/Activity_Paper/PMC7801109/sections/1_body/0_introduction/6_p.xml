<p>Herein seventeen new 2-oxindolin-3-ylidene-nicotinohydrazide derivatives (
 <bold>5a–m</bold>, 
 <bold>9a–c</bold>, and 
 <bold>14</bold>) were designed, synthesised, and evaluated for their anti-tubercular activity against drug-susceptible 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain (ATCC 27294) and Isoniazid/Streptomycin resistant 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (ATCC 35823), together with the antibacterial effect against bronchitis causing-bacteria in an attempt to produce new candidates having potential activities with minimal bacterial resistance that may reduce the complications associated with the secondary bacterial infection.
