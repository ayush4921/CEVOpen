<p>In view of the findings stated above and in a continuation of our previous work for the discovery of potential anti-tubercular and anti-microbial agents
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>28</sup>
 </xref>, we decided to extend our research through conjugating different 
 <italic>N</italic>-substituted isatin moieties with a nicotinohydrazide moiety to furnish target hybrids 
 <bold>5a-I</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). In order to explore the impact of C-5 substitution, as well as to ensure different lipophilic environments that may be suitable for the mycobacterial activity, both 5-Cl and 5-Br substituents were grafted at isatin scaffold. As it was suggested that 
 <italic>N</italic>-substitution of isatin scaffold could enhance the mycobacterial activity

 </xref>, 
 <italic>N</italic>-alkylation, or 
 <italic>N</italic>-benzylation of the herein reported hybrids was performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Thereafter, the impact of C-2 and C-6 substitution of the nicotinohydrazide moiety the anti-tubercular and antibacterial activities were investigated through developing the two sets 
 <bold>5j–m</bold> and 
 <bold>9a–c</bold> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>). Finally, an isatin-3-pyridylamine hybrid 
 <bold>14</bold> was synthesised to carry out further elaboration of the target scaffold (
