<p>In a round-bottom flask, the appropriate nicotinohydrazide derivative 
 <bold>2a–b</bold> or 
 <bold>8</bold> (2.5 mmol) were added to an equivalent amount of 
 <italic>N</italic>-substituted indoline-2,3-dione derivatives 
 <bold>4a–i</bold> in 15 ml of glacial acetic acid. The previous mixture was heated under reflux with TLC monitoring, after complete consummation of starting materials, the reaction flask was cooled to room temperature. The formed precipitate was collected under vacuum, washed with hexane, cold water and recrystallized from dioxane/methanol mixture to furnish final compounds 
 <bold>5a–m</bold> and 
 <bold>9a–c</bold>, respectively.
