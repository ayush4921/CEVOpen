<p>Over the past decade, several druggable targets have been utilised in TB-drug discovery to develop new therapies in order to fight the global epidemic of TB. Most of these enzyme targets have an essential role in energy production, cell wall biosynthesis, and DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Examples of these enzymes are; Alanine racemase (Alr), Maltosyltransferase (GlgE),
