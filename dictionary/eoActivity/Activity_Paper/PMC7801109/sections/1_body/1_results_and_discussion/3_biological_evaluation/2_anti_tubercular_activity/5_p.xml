<p>Then we turned our attention to study the impact of substitution at position 6 on the nicotinohydrazide moiety of the new hybrids. Comparing the anti-tubercular activity of 6-methoxy nicotinohydrazide derivatives 
 <bold>5j–5m</bold> against the unsubstituted counterparts 
 <bold>5a–5d</bold>, it was found that the introduction of 6-methoxy group in compounds 
 <bold>5j–5l</bold> (MIC = 0.98-3.9 µg/mL) enhanced the anti-tubercular activity by 2-4 fold compared to unsubstituted analogues 
 <bold>5a–5c</bold> (MIC range: 1.95–7.81 µg/mL) except for the benzyl derivatives 
 <bold>5d</bold> and 
 <bold>5m</bold>. Conversely, the introduction of 6-phenyl moiety to the nicotinohydrazide moiety as in compounds 
 <bold>9a–c</bold> (MIC = 15.63–31.25 µg/mL) led to a reduced anti-tubercular activity that may be due to steric factors.
