<p>Interestingly, compounds 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> showing best anti-tubercular activity with the minimal bacterial resistance against resistant-TB, revealed a broad-spectrum antibacterial action against most of the tested bronchitis causing-bacteria. They were found to be more potent than the reference drug against 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic>, and 
 <italic>B</italic>. 
 <italic>pertussis</italic> (MIC = 0.24–3.9 µg/mL, Azithromycin MIC = 3.9–7.81 µg/mL). Additionally, they were equipotent to Azithromycin against 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae, S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (MIC = 1.95, 0.98, and 0.49 µg/mL, respectively).
