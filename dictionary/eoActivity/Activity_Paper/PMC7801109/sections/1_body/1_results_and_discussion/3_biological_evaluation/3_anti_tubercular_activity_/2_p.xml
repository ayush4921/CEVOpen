 </xref>. Investigating the results of the target compounds 
 <bold>5a–m</bold>, 
 <bold>9a–c</bold>, and 
 <bold>14</bold> (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), it was found that many of the tested derivatives exhibited potent to moderate activity with MIC range = 3.9-62.5 µg/mL. Compounds 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> with the best anti-tubercular effect against 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (ATCC 27294), showed excellent activity (MIC = 3.9 µg/mL) resistant 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strain (ATCC 35823), with more than 32 fold increase in the activity compared to INH and Streptomycin (MIC &gt; 125 µg/mL). Moreover, compounds 
 <bold>5d</bold>, 
 <bold>5f</bold> and 
 <bold>5j</bold> elicited a good activity with MIC = 15.63 µg/mL, whereas derivatives 
 <bold>5b</bold>, 
 <bold>5k</bold>, and 
 <bold>14</bold> produced a moderate activity with MIC = 62.5 µg/mL. Finally, compounds 
 <bold>5a</bold> and 
 <bold>5l</bold> were found to be least active showing MIC value = 125 µg/mL, while the 6-phenyl pyridine derivatives 
 <bold>9a–c</bold> were inactive with MIC &gt;125 µg/mL.
