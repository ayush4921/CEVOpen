 </xref>. The results showed that, most of the evaluated compounds produced a significant antibacterial activity in comparison to the reference drug Azithromycin against the tested bacterial strains. The most sensitive strain towards the new hybrids was 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 43816) with MIC range = 0.49–7.81 µg/mL, while 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> (ATCC 15531) and 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> (ATCC 25238) were the least sensitive strains MIC range = 0.98–125 µg/mL and MIC range = 3.9 to &gt;125 µg/mL, respectively.
