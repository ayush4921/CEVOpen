 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the final compounds 
 <bold>5a–m</bold> and 
 <bold>9a–c</bold> were confirmed with the presence of a D
 <sub>2</sub>O exchangeable singlet signal attributable to the proton of the hydrazide linker at 
 <italic>δ</italic> (13.31–13.86) ppm. Moreover, 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra for compounds 
 <bold>9a–c</bold> confirmed the presence of singlet signal in the aliphatic region for the CH
 <sub>3</sub> group around 
 <italic>δ</italic> 2.71 ppm, in addition to the extra aromatic protons for the 6-phenyl ring at a range of 
 <italic>δ</italic> 7.44–7.57 ppm, whereas, spectra for compounds 
 <bold>5j–m</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> confirmed the appearance of singlet signal for OCH
 <sub>3</sub> groups at 
 <italic>δ</italic> (3.82–3.97) ppm.
