<p>The synthetic strategies adopted for the preparation of final compounds (
 <bold>5a–m</bold>, 
 <bold>9a–c</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold>) were illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="scheme" rid="SCH0001 SCH0002 SCH0003">Schemes 1–3</xref>. In the first scheme, different isatin derivatives 
 <bold>3a–c</bold> were alkylated with the appropriate alkyl halide in anhydrous DMF in the presence of K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> as an acid binder to furnish the 
 <italic>N</italic>-substituted indoline-2,3-diones 
 <bold>4a–i</bold>. On the other hand, methyl nicotinate 
 <bold>1a</bold> and methyl 6-methoxynicotinate 
 <bold>1b</bold> was refluxed with hydrazine hydrate in methanol to produce the key intermediate nicotinohydrazides 
 <bold>2a–b</bold> which subsequently reacted with 
 <italic>N</italic>-substituted indoline-2,3-dione derivatives 
 <bold>4a–i</bold> in absolute ethanol containing a catalytic amount of glacial acetic acid to get the final compounds 
 <bold>5a–m</bold> (
