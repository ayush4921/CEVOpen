<p>In this work, different sets of isatin-nicotinohydrazide hybrids (
 <bold>5a–m</bold>, 
 <bold>9a–c</bold>) and isatin-3-pyridylamine hybrid 
 <bold>14</bold> were designed and synthesised. The anti-mycobacterial activity towards 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (ATCC 27294), as well as towards the INH and Streptomycin resistant 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (ATCC 35823), were evaluated for the seventeen newly synthesised 2-oxindolin-3-ylidene-nicotinohydrazide derivatives. The obtained results identified compounds 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> as the most potent anti-tubercular agents in this study (MIC = 0.24 µg/mL), with minimal mycobacterial resistance (MIC = 3.9 µg/mL). Furthermore, all herein reported hybrids were examined for their antibacterial activity against six bronchitis causing-bacteria; 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic>, 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, and 
 <italic>S. pneumonia</italic>. Most hybrids exerted significant antibacterial activity in comparison to the reference drug Azithromycin against the tested bacterial strains. The most sensitive strain was 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> with MIC range = 0.49–7.81 µg/mL. Interestingly, compounds 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> displayed a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against most of the tested bronchitis causing-bacteria. Moreover, an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> molecular modelling study has proposed DprE1 as a potential enzyme target for herein reported isatin-nicotinohydrazide hybrids. Compounds 
 <bold>5g</bold> and 
 <bold>5h</bold> were able to fit perfectly in the active site of the DprE1 enzyme achieving a higher energy score (−9.7 and −10.1 kcal/mole, respectively) than the co-crystalized ligand (−9.3 kcal/mole). The oxindole ring was engaged in two H-bond interactions via its carbonyl oxygen (C = O) functionality with His-132 and Tyr-415 amino acids, whereas, the NH of the hydrazide linker and the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring were involved in H-bond interactions with His-132 and Asn-385, respectively. In addition, the 
 <italic>N</italic>-isobutyl group of compound 
 <bold>5h</bold> established several hydrophobic interactions with non-polar residues lining a hydrophobic pocket.
