<p id="Par27">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> describes the safety concerns and sources of evidence for the medicines for which aRMMs were introduced or discontinued. The aRMMs of the 14 products introduced post-authorisation addressed 21 safety concerns (median 1, range 1–3), of which 57% involved important identified risks, 38% important potential risks, and 5% missing information. The data sources that triggered the introduction of aRMMs post-authorisation concerned spontaneous reports (64%), post-authorisation clinical trials (50%), observational studies (21%), and non-clinical studies (14%). These percentages do not add up to 100% since multiple sources of evidence could form the basis for the introduction of aRMMs post-authorisation. aRMMs were imposed on gadoversetamide following an EU review of the benefit–risk balance (referral) of gadolinium-containing contrast agents in light of the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
