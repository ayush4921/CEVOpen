<p id="Par26">The median follow-up time for medicines for which aRMMs were introduced post-authorisation was 43 months (range 17–137 months), and the median follow-up time for medicines for which aRMMs were discontinued was 90 months (range 25–96 months) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The probability of introduction of aRMMs post-authorisation for medicines without aRMM at authorisation was 3.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–5.7] within 5 years after authorisation and 6.9% (95% CI 2.6–11) within 10 years after authorisation. For medicines with aRMMs at authorisation, the probability of discontinuation of aRMMs was 0.9% (95% CI 0–2.6) within 5 years and 8.3% (95% CI 0–16.1) within 10 years after authorisation (Figs.
