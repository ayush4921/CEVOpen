<p id="Par23">We identified 476 medicinal products authorised during the study period (January 2006–December 2017), with a total of 32.514 months of follow-up. The median follow-up time was 60 months (range 8–150). The characteristics of the products included in the study are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Of the 476 products, 91% were granted regular MA, 4% were granted conditional MA, and 5% were granted MA under exceptional circumstances; 18% were intended for treatment of an orphan disease. Of the 476 products, 27% concerned “Antineoplastic and immunomodulatory agents”, 19% concerned “Antiinfectives for systemic use”, and 12% concerned medicines targeting the “Alimentary tract and metabolism”. aRMMs were required at the time of authorisation for 27% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 130) of the products. For all 130 products with aRMMs at the time of authorisation, the aRMMs included the provision of educational materials targeted at healthcare professionals in 94% and at patients in 55%. For 14% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 18) of the products with aRMMs, other measures were required in addition to the educational materials. This included two products that had controlled distribution and a pregnancy prevention programme (ambrisentan, pomalidomide) and one product that had controlled access and a pregnancy prevention programme (sitaxentan sodium). At the time of data collection (July 2018), 91% of the products were still authorised, 9% of the products had been withdrawn, and for one product, the MA had been suspended (autologous cultured chondrocytes). Medicines with aRMMs at the time of MA had an orphan designation more often than medicines without aRMMs at the time of MA. There were no other significant differences in product characteristics between medicines authorised without and with aRMMs.
