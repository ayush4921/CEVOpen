<p id="Par25">aRMMs were discontinued for four of 130 medicines authorised with aRMMs during the study period. The products for which aRMMs were discontinued post-authorisation all had regular MA, and none had an orphan designation. The four medicines for which aRMMs were discontinued post-authorisation belonged to the ATC groups “Blood and blood forming organs”, “Antiinfectives for systemic use”, “Respiratory system”, and “Various”. All aRMMs were discontinued for these four products. The discontinued aRMMs involved educational materials targeted at healthcare professionals for all four medicines and educational materials targeted at patients/caregivers for two medicines. All four medicines for which aRMMs were discontinued post-authorisation were still authorised at the time of data collection (Table
