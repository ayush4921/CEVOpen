<p id="Par16">Categorisation of the type of aRMM was based on the current definitions as laid down in the “Good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP)” (module XVI rev 2) guidelines of the EMA, as described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Direct Healthcare Professional Communications (DHPCs) were not included in our study, as these are generally not included in annex IID of the MA and could not be systematically collected from the website of the EMA. One product can have one or more types of aRMM. Educational materials targeting healthcare professionals and educational materials targeting patients and/or caregivers were counted as different categories of aRMMs.
