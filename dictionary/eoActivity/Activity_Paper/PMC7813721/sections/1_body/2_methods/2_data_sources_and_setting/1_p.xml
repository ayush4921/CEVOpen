<p id="Par11">We extracted all centrally authorised medicines from the website of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ema.europa.eu" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ema.europa.eu</ext-link>. We excluded non-innovator applications, such as generic applications, as they have an EU-RMP aligned with the reference product. EMA publishes European Public Assessment Reports (EPARs) for all products authorised through the centralised procedure. We extracted data from the following EPARs: the “EPAR—Public assessment report”, the “EPAR—Product information”, and the “EPAR—Procedural steps taken and scientific information after authorisation”. The “EPAR—Public assessment report” is the summary of the initial assessment of the MA application and includes a summary of the RMP at the time of authorisation. The “EPAR—Product information” includes the most up-to-date product information with the annexes of the MA. The “EPAR—Procedural steps taken and scientific information after authorisation” is a log of all variations to the MA, i.e. any changes in the administrative information (such as transfers of the MA), changes in the manufacturing process, and changes in the benefit–risk profile of the product.
