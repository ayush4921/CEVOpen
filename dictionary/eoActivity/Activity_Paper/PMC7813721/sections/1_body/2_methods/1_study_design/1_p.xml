<p id="Par10">We performed a retrospective cohort study that included all new active substances authorised through the centralised procedure between January 1st 2006 and December 31st 2017. Medicinal products included in our study were followed up from the date of MA until the first occurrence of an introduction or discontinuation of aRMMs, withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of the MA, or the date of data extraction (July 1st 2018), whichever came first. One or more types of aRMM can be introduced or discontinued simultaneously.</p>
