<p id="Par13">We identified products with post-authorisation introduction or discontinuation of aRMMs in two ways to ensure completeness. First, for all products included in the study, the “EPAR—Public assessment report” was reviewed to identify whether aRMMs were in place at the time of MA and the “EPAR—Product information” was reviewed to identify whether aRMMs were in place at the time of data extraction. A discrepancy between these two EPARs was regarded as a change (considered an introduction if the aRMM was not in the initial RMP, but present in annex IID, and a discontinuation if vice versa). Secondly, for all products included in the study, we reviewed the “EPAR—Procedural steps taken and scientific information after authorisation”. All regulatory procedures that included amendments to annex II of the MA were screened to identify whether aRMMs were introduced or discontinued.</p>
