<p id="Par7">Routine risk minimisation measures are in place for all medicinal products, for example, the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), Patient Information Leaflet, pack design, and prescription status. However, some medicinal products may be associated with important risks that may not be sufficiently minimised by these routine measures alone. Additional risk minimisation measures (aRMMs) may be needed to ensure that the benefits of these products outweigh their risks. Types of aRMMs include educational materials that provide information to healthcare professionals and/or patients regarding risks on top of the information in the SPC; controlled access, in which prescription or dispensing of a medicinal product is conditional on fulfilling certain criteria (i.e. following a training programme or performing certain diagnostic testing); controlled distribution, in which all stages of the product distribution are tracked; and pregnancy prevention programmes, which may include one or more of the measures described above [
