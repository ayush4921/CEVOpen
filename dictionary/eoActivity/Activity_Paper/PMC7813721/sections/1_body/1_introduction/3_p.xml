<p id="Par8">A need for aRMMs is assessed at the time of the authorisation. Studies have shown that, between 2006 and 2015, the proportion of products with aRMMs at the time of authorisation ranged from 26 to 42% [

New information regarding risks may become available post-authorisation, requiring introduction of new aRMMs or strengthening of already existing aRMMs. Conversely, new information regarding risks post-authorisation may also allow for the reduction or discontinuation of existing aRMMs. Currently, there are no published data on post-authorisation changes to aRMMs for products authorised in Europe, which translates to an important deficit in our knowledge regarding the life cycle management of medicinal products.
