<p id="Par6">The European Union Risk Management Plan (EU-RMP) has become an integral tool in the proactive life cycle management of medicinal products and facilitates identification, characterisation, monitoring, and minimisation of risks. The EU-RMP first became a mandatory part of the authorisation dossier of innovative medicinal products authorised in the European Union (EU) in November 2005, and became mandatory for all medicinal products in 2012 [

The safety specification describes the safety data available for the medicinal product, with focus on those safety concerns that require further activities post-authorisation. These safety concerns are listed as important identified risks, important potential risks and missing information. The pharmacovigilance plan describes the methods used to monitor and/or further characterise the important risks described in the safety specification. The risk minimisation plan describes the measures to minimise the important risks [
