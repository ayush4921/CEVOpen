The structure and quality of the EPARs, in particular the “EPAR—Public Assessment Report”, evolved over time to include more information in a standardised manner. Particularly for the first part of the study period, identifying aRMMs at the time of MA could be challenging, leading us to develop the two-step approach we used in this study. Although there is residual potential for misclassification, for instance, if the content of the EPARs is not updated correctly, this probability is considered to be small.</p>
