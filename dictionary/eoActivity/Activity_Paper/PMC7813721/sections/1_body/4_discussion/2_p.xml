<p id="Par30">The probability of introduction of aRMMs within 5 and 10 years in our study is low. Besides introduction of aRMMs, regulatory action for safety issues emerging post-authorisation may include further investigation/monitoring, changes to routine risk minimisation measures, or suspension/revocation of the MA. Studies have shown that the vast majority of important post-authorisation safety issues are either investigated further or monitored, or are sufficiently minimised through routine risk minimisation measures [

Moreover, the probability of introduction of aRMMs within 5 and 10 years post-authorisation found in our study is lower than the probability of safety-related DHPC post-authorisation in a study that investigated whether the probability of DHPCs increased with increasing level of innovation of medicines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. DHPCs are listed as a type of aRMM in GVP module XVI rev 2, but differ from the aRMMs investigated in our study due to their one-off mode of action and broader scope of use. Between 1 January 1999 and 1 January 2009, 157 DHPCs were sent out for 112 different active substances available in the Netherlands, and 131 DHPCs were issued between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014 in the UK.
