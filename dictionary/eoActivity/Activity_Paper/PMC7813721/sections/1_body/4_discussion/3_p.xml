<p id="Par31">Spontaneous reports and clinical trials were the most frequent triggers for introduction of post-authorisation aRMMs in our study. These findings are comparable with results of other studies, in which spontaneous reports and post-marketing clinical trials are the most frequent sources of new safety information post-authorisation. aRMMs were imposed on one medicine in our study (gadoversetamide) following a review of the benefitâ€“risk balance of gadolinium-containing contrast agents, i.e. a referral procedure. Although several referrals were conducted and concluded during the study period, these concerned medicines approved before our study period (such as vitamin A derivatives) or medicines not approved centrally (such as sodium valproate). In addition, some referrals did not lead to imposition of aRMMs, such as both referrals concerning sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors.</p>
