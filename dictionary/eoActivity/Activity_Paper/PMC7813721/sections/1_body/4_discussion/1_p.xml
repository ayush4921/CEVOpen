<p id="Par29">The aim of our study was to describe discontinuations and introductions of aRMMs post-authorisation for centrally authorised medicinal products in the EU. We assessed the probability of post-authorisation introduction or discontinuation of aRMMs, rather than proportions, to account for the time required to accumulate sufficient data as justification for an introduction or discontinuation. During the study period, the probability of post-authorisation introduction of aRMMs was 3.5% (95% CI 1.2–5.7) within 5 years and 6.9% (95% CI 2.6–11) within 10 years after authorisation, while the probability of discontinuation of aRMMs was 0.9% (95% CI 0–2.6) within 5 years and 8.3% (95% CI 0–16.1) within 10 years after authorisation.</p>
