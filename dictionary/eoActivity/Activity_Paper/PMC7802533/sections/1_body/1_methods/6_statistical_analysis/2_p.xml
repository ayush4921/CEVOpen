<p>The chemical parameters measured included lipid analysis of the seed oil, and IC
 <sub>50</sub> against the cancer cell lines. All measurements were made in four replications. Effects of the treatments on the chemical parameters were done using one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means separated using Fisher's LSD at α = 0.05. Compositional distributions of the fatty acids in Handel seed oil are done using pie charts. Principal component analysis was used to discern relationship between the fatty acid composition of the seed oil and anticancer activity in the cancer cell lines. XLSTATS premium version (Addinsoft) was used for the multivariate analysis. Statistical analysis was performed applying the Student 
 <italic>t</italic> test using SPSS 10.0 statistical software package (SPSSFW, SPSS Inc). A 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant for the cell lines treated with different concentrations of the oil.
