<p>Handal fruits were collected from desert areas in south Jordan (Figure 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) over a number of growing seasons. The plant material was identified by a botanist from The University of Jordan and deposited with a voucher specimen (ID: C.CorHud‐04–2018) in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, UJ. Seeds were deshelled and dried at room temperature overnight. The dried Handal seeds were ground using an electric blender. Seed oil was then extracted at 25°C using a Soxhlet extractor to determine total fat content. No approval/permission to collect the plant/fruit samples was required.
