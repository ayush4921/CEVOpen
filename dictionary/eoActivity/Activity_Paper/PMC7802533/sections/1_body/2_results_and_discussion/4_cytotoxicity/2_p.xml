<p>Cell growth of cancer cells (Caco‐2 and HCT‐116) and normal skin fibroblast cells were assessed with the MTS assay after 48h exposure period. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values, described as the concentration at which 50% of cell growth is inhibited, are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Notably, there was statistically significant difference between cancer cell growth in wells treated with the examined oil, relative to the growth of normal skin fibroblasts treated with same concentration of the oil. The results indicated that cancer cell viability was considerably affected after 48 hr exposure relative to the human fibroblasts upon treatment with the examined oil, using the MTS assay at concentration points up to 50 mg/ml, suggesting a reasonable anticancer activity and safety profile against the human skin fibroblasts (Bardaweel et al.,
