<p>The results from the current study are in close agreement with previous literature reports on fatty acids composition of 
 <italic>Citrullus colocynthis</italic> L. seed oil from different origins (Ashish et al.,

 <xref rid="fsn31994-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It was found that seed oil is composed of four major fatty acids: palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids. Of the four major fatty acids, linoleic acid is the most prevalent with the value ranging between 55.90% and 74.77%, with the most prominent level found in Jordan seed oil (74.77%). Palmitic acid (C16:0) ranged from 8.35% in oil from Jordan and compared to 11.70% in oil from Nagpur and was the predominant saturated fatty acid. The composition of total saturated fatty acids (Palmitic C16:0 and Stearic C18:0) and unsaturated fatty acid (Oleic and Linoleic) contents of the oil was reported between 13.71–21.40% and 77.50–83.81%, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="fsn31994-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Due to the different origin of the 
 <italic>Citrullus colocynthis</italic> seed and an effect of laboratory variation, the lowest saturated fatty acids were seen from the oil produced in Jordan (this study) and the highest were reported from the group in Nagpur, India. In contrast, Jordan's Handal oil contains the highest unsaturated content (83.81%) as compared to the lowest (77.5%) in the oil obtained from Nagpur (Kulkarni et al.,
