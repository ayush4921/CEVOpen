<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was then employed to determine whether the functional fatty acids in the Handal oil are in correlation with the cell line treatment efficiency. The segregation of major fatty acids and the cell lines treated with the examined oil into different quadrants of the biplot (Figure

The level of Palmitic acid C16:0 was in close correlation circle with the grow inhibition of Caco‐2 cancer cells, while the high concentration of Linoleic acid C18:2n6 in Handal oil was clustered with the growth of normal skin fibroblasts. The HCT‐116 cancer cell line treatment was shown to have significant correlation with the levels of α‐Linolenic acid C18:3n3 and Arachidic acid C20:0 (value in bold shown in Table
