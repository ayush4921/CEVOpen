<p>This narrative review shows possible potential of medicinal mushrooms in complementary cancer treatment. Promising anticarcinogenic effects have been documented 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for several medicinal mushrooms. However, only few clinical studies defined OS or time to disease progression as primary endpoints. Others were too short in duration as to be fitting to strengthen this hypothesis. Immunomodulating effects such as the proliferation of lymphatic cell lines, immunoglobulins and cytokines have also been documented in humans.
