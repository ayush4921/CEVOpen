<p>Compounds of mushrooms may produce hermetic dose-response effects, with potentially beneficial effects at low doses and toxic effects at high doses in normal cells, while in cancer cells only the toxic effects at high doses are potentially beneficial (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Calabrese, 2005</xref>). The supposed hormetic effects of fungochemicals seem to be relatively modest in humans, which may explain why such effects are observable in animal models but less obvious in clinical studies (where several variables and opposing factors may dilute such effects).
