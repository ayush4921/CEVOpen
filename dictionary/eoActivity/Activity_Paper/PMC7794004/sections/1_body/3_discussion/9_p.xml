<p>Altogether, adverse effects were rarely reported. Gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common problem, which may be due to the high amount of dietary fiber and prebiotics known to cause mild stomach upset such as bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and constipation. Tsai et al. observed a significant decrease in platelet count in patients treated with

The data indicated a large difference in the decline in platelet levels between the two groups in patients with lung cancer (84 vs. 5%) and gastric cancer (22 vs. 5%) which could not be explained properly. Also patients with colorectal cancer treated for 6 months with 
 <italic>Agaricus sylvaticus</italic> showed reduced platelet counts compared to placebo (

The assessment of adverse effects of medicinal mushrooms as well as the correct dosage and possible drug interactions must be further clarified in future CTs.
