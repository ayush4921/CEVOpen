<p>The studies evaluated in this narrative review suggest that the use of medicinal mushrooms may improve cancer-related and treatment-related symptoms in patients with different types and stages of cancer when used as a complementary therapy alongside conventional cancer care. Most studies considered in this paper showed beneficial effects in favor of medicinal mushrooms for various cancer entities, especially with regards to quality of life and reduction of side effects of conventional oncological treatment (particularly chemotherapy and endocrine therapy). Also, positive effects on antitumor activity and immunomodulation were reported, e.g., an increased activity of natural killer cells. In addition, there was some uncertain evidence of a longer survival of cancer patients treated with medicinal mushrooms, although in most studies the effect was not significant when compared to placebo. Adverse or negative effects of the used extracts were rarely reported. The only reported adverse effects being gastrointestinal reactions and decrease in platelet count. No serious adverse event due to medical mushroom intake was reported in the reviewed studies.</p>
