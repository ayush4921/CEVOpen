<p>We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE CENTRAL, the Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International CTs Registry Platform Search Portal from inception until June 2020, with no restrictions on the date of publication. Studies were included, if they 1) investigated cancer patients, 2) included whole spectrum mushroom formulations, 3) were in English language, and 4) were used as complementary therapy during or after conventional cancer treatment. Studies were excluded, if they 1) had study designs other than controlled CT or randomized controlled trials (RCT), 2) were animal studies or 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, or 3) investigated participants with no cancer diagnosis. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of the Charit√©-University Medical Center, Berlin, Germany, registration number EA1/172/19.
