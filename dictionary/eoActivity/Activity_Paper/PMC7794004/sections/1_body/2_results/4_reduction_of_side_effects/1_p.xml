<p>Valadares et al. focused on the effects of 
 <italic>Agaricus sylvaticus</italic> extract (2.1Â g/day for a period of 6 months) on side effects of chemotherapy in breast cancer patients in a RCT (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Valadares et al., 2013</xref>). Patients with three cycles of chemotherapy at the beginning of treatment reported poor appetite, with 23% of these patients in the placebo group and 54% of these patients in the 
 <italic>Agaricus sylvaticus</italic> group. After 3 months of treatment with 
 <italic>Agaricus sylvaticus</italic>, 31% of patients in the placebo group reported a reduction in appetite, while no such symptoms occurred in the supplemented group. Compared to patients with six cycles of chemotherapy and use of 
 <italic>Agaricus sylvaticus</italic>, the data showed that, toward the end of the treatment, loss of appetite decreased over time. In comparison, 80% of patients in the placebo group complained about loss of appetite by the end of the study after 6 months. While the majority of the placebo-receiving patients suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, constipation, nausea and vomiting, only two patients in the verum group reported these side effects. Patients taking medicinal mushrooms had nearly no loss of appetite and only in a few cases fever was an occurrence while this was also frequent in the placebo group.
