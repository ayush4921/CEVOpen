<p>The imbalance between the production of free radicals (reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species) and the available antioxidants in the body leads to oxidative stress, which plays a vital role in the pathogenesis and development of various chronic and degenerative diseases such as cancer, arthritis, diabetes, aging, and cardiovascular diseases [

Different types of synthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, and tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) have been widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries to preserve food and drug products from oxidative deterioration and used as a dietary supplement to neutralize the effect of oxidative stress inside the human body. However, this synthetic antioxidant (BHA and BHT) has been reported to induce carcinomas of forestomach in rats and hamsters [
