 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The selection of suitable extraction techniques and solvent is a vital step in the screening of bioactive compounds and investigation of biological activities of plant samples. Several studies have reported 70% ethanol as the best solvent in the extraction of a phenolic compound rich extract with potent antioxidant activity [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Therefore, with the consideration of the objective of the present study, 70% ethanol was selected as a solvent in the extraction.
