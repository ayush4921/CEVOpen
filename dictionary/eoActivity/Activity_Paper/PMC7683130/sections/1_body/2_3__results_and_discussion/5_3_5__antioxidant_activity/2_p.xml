<p>In the present study, all plant samples showed concentration-dependent DPPH radical scavenging activity. Among the studied plant samples, the highest antioxidant potential was exhibited by 
 <italic>M. malabathricum</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>value = 6.27 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), followed by 
 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic>, and 
 <italic>F. esculentum</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 11.7 and 55.98 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. The lowest antioxidant activity was exhibited by 
 <italic>C. thevetia</italic> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>value = 479.77 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL), followed by 
 <italic>A. erubescens</italic>, 
 <italic>A. bidentata</italic>, and 
 <italic>L. neesiana</italic> with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 376.95, 314.56, and 297.89 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL, respectively. The antioxidant potential of standard ascorbic acid was found to be 4.73 
 <italic>μ</italic>g/mL.
