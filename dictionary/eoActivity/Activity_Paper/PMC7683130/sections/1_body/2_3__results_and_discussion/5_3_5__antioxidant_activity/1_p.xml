<p>DPPH radical scavenging assay is a rapid, inexpensive, and one of the most frequently used methods for evaluating the antioxidant potential of plant extracts. This assay is based on the principle of reduction of purple-colored DPPH solution to the yellow-colored diphenylpicryl hydrazine product in the presence of antioxidants [
