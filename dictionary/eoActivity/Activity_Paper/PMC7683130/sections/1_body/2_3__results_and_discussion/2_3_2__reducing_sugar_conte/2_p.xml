<p>The RSC was calculated from the calibration curve (
 <italic>Y</italic> = 0.00058
 <italic>x</italic> + 0.002, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.995) of standard D-glucose and expressed as mg GE/g dry extract weight. The RSC of the studied plant samples ranged from 6.89 ± 2.44 to 674.13 ± 2.43 mg GE/g dry extract weight (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among the seven different plant samples studied, reducing sugar content was found highest in 
 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic> (674.13 ± 2.43 mg GE/g dry extract weight), followed by 
 <italic>M. malabathricum</italic> (455.16 ± 2.43 mg GE/g dry extract weight), and found lowest in 
 <italic>C. thevetia</italic> (6.89 ± 2.44 mg GE/g dry extract weight), followed by 
 <italic>A. bidentata</italic> (48.27 ± 4.87 mg GE/g dry extract weight).
