<p>Sugar plays a pivotal role in plants as both nutrient and central signaling or regulatory molecules that modulate gene expression related to plant growth, development, metabolism, stress response, and disease resistance. Reducing and nonreducing sugar play an important role in the central metabolic pathways and help in the production of secondary metabolites that enhance the medicinal properties of plants [

This method is simple, inexpensive, sensitive, and able to handle a large number of samples at a time. It is based on the principle of interaction of an alkaline solution of DNSA with reducing sugars (e.g., glucose and fructose), where the 3-nitro group (NOO
 <sup>−</sup>) of DNSA is reduced to an amino group and the aldehyde group of reducing sugar is oxidized to the carboxylic acid. In this reaction, orange-red colored 3-amino-5-nitrosalicylic acid is formed which has an absorbance maximum at 540 nm. The intensity of the orange-red color is an index of reducing sugar [
