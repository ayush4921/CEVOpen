<p>In our previous study [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we reported the presence of TPC of 68.34 ± 0.38 and 51.03 ± 0.27 mg GAE/g dry extract weight in the ethanolic and aqueous extract of stems of 
 <italic>L. neesiana</italic>, respectively. Gan et al. [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] have reported the presence of 1.34 ± 0.06 mg GAE/g dry extract weight in 80% methanolic extract of 
 <italic>A. bidentata.</italic> Sharma and Kumar [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] revealed the presence of 210 ± 2.99 mg GAE/g of plant extract in methanolic extract of 
 <italic>M. malabathricum</italic> leaves. The differences in the results of TPC between the present and previous studies may be due to the variation in the extraction solvent, part of the plant used, method of analysis, environmental stress, and climatic and geographical conditions [
