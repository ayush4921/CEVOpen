<p>The quantitative determination of the total phenolic content was carried out using the Folin–Ciocalteu reagent. The TPC was calculated from the calibration curve (
 <italic>Y</italic> = 0.012
 <italic>x</italic>-0.045, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.986) of standard gallic acid and expressed as mg GAE/g dry extract weight. The TPC of the studied plant samples ranged from 14.87 ± 0.41 to 281.71 ± 1.47 mg GAE/g dry extract weight (

 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic> (281.71 ± 1.47 mg GAE/g dry extract weight), followed by 
 <italic>M. malabathricum</italic> (222.08 ± 0.11 mg GAE/g dry extract weight), and found lowest in 
 <italic>A. erubescens</italic> (14.87 ± 0.41 mg GAE/g dry extract weight), followed by
