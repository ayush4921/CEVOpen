<p>The present study demonstrated the reducing sugar, total phenolic content, and antioxidant potential of the seven plants grown in Nepal. A positive and significant correlation was established between (i) reducing sugar content and total phenolic content and (ii) total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. This is the first scientific report on reducing sugar content of the studied plant samples and the first scientific exploration of 
 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic>. Among the studied plant samples, 
 <italic>F. glaberrima</italic> showed the highest reducing sugar and total phenolic content, together with a greater amount of antioxidant capacity. Thus, these plant samples grown in Nepal can be considered beneficial for the promotion of the health of individuals and be considered a boon to the pharmaceutical industry.
