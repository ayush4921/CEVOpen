<p>The reducing sugar content (RSC) was determined using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) method. The measurement was performed according to the procedure of Krivorotova and Sereikaite [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with slight modification. DNSA reagent was prepared by dissolving 1 g of DNSA and 30 g of sodium-potassium tartaric acid in 80 mL of 0.5 N NaOH at 45°C. After dissolution, the solution was cooled down to room temperature and diluted to 100 mL with the help of distilled water. For the measurement, 2 mL of DNSA reagent was pipetted into a test tube containing 1 mL of plant extract (1 mg/mL) and kept at 95°C for 5 min. After cooling, 7 mL of distilled water was added to the solution and the absorbance of the resulting solution was measured at 540 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1800). The reducing sugar content was calculated from the calibration curve of standard D-glucose (200-1000 mg/L), and the results were expressed as mg D-glucose equivalent (GE) per gram dry extract weight.
