<p>The total phenolic content (TPC) of the different plant extracts was determined using Folin–Ciocalteu reagent, following the method of Singleton and Rossi [

Then, the final mixture was incubated in the dark condition at room temperature for 60 min, and the absorbance was measured against the blank at 725 nm using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. The total phenolic content of plant samples was calculated from the calibration curve of standard gallic acid (10-250 mg/L) and expressed as mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram dry extract weight.
