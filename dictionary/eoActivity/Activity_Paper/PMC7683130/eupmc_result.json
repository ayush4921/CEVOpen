    "The aim of the present study was to investigate the reducing sugar, total phenolic content, and <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant activity of 70% (<i>v</i>/<i>v</i>) ethanolic extract of seven medicinal plants grown in Nepal. The reducing sugar content and total phenolic content were determined by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) and the Folin-Ciocalteu method, respectively. The <i>in vitro</i> antioxidant activity was evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. The reducing sugar content of the studied plant samples ranged from 6.89 ± 2.44 to 674.13 ± 2.43 mg GE/g dry extract weight and the total phenolic content ranged from 14.87 ± 0.41 to 281.71 ± 1.47 mg GAE/g dry extract weight. The reducing sugar and total phenolic content were found highest in <i>Ficus glaberrima</i>. Antioxidant activity was found highest in <i>Melastoma malabathricum</i> (IC<sub>50</sub>value = 6.27 <i>μ</i>g/mL), followed by <i>F. glaberrima</i> (IC<sub>50</sub>value = 11.7 <i>μ</i>g/mL). A positive and significant correlation was found between (i) total phenolic content and reducing sugar content and (ii) total phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The present study is the first study for the analysis of reducing sugar content of selected plants and for the scientific exploration of <i>F. glaberrima</i>. The present result suggests that the various parts of these studied plants could be assumed as a rich source of biologically active compounds and considered beneficial for the food and pharmaceutical industries."
