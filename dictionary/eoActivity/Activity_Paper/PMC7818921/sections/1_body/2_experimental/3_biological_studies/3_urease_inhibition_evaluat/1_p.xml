 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). 250 µl of jack bean 
 <italic>urease</italic> (4U) was mixed with 250 µl of different synthesized test compounds and standard of different concentrations [dissolved in DMSO/H
 <sub>2</sub>O mixture (1:1 v/v)]. The mixture was pre-incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in test tubes. 2 ml of 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 500 mM urea and 0.002% phenol red as an indicator were added in sample test tubes after pre incubation and again incubated at room temperature. Absorbance of reaction mixture was recorded by ELISA at 570 nm. Ammonium carbonate increased the pH of phosphate buffer from 6.8 to 7.7 which was produced from urea by 
 <italic>urease</italic> enzyme and the end peak was measured by the colour of phenol red indicator [
