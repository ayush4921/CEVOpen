<p id="Par45">HCT116 (human colon cancer cells) were seeded at 2500 cells/well (96 well plate), allowed to attach overnight, exposed to the respective compounds for 72 h and subjected to SRB assay (570 nm). Data represent mean IC
 <sub>50</sub> of at least triplicates. The compounds were all dissolved in DMSO as stock of 100 mg/ml. DMSO of &lt; 1.5% did not result in cell kill. The highest concentration of each compound tested (100 μg/ml) contained only 0.1% DMSO. Compounds
