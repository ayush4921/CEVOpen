<p id="Par33">The initial material, reagents and solvents were purchased from Loba chemie. The glasswares were obtained from Borosil. The raw material was weighed on calibrated weighing balance. The synthetic scheme was drawn via ChemDraw 8.03. The confirmation of reaction at every step was done by TLC (thin layer chromatography). Melting point of the synthesized compounds was depicted by labtech melting point equipment. For spectral characterizations of the compounds, Bruker 12060280, Software: OPUS 7.2.139.1294 spectrometer using ATR for IR spectra (cm
 <sup>−1</sup>) and Bruker Avance III at 600 NMR and 150 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 
 <sup>13</sup>CNMR (DMSO-
 <italic>d6</italic>, δ ppm) were used. The tested microbial strains like Gram positive, Gram negative bacteria and fungi were obtained from the Institute of Microbial Technology and Gene bank, Chandigarh for the in vitro antimicrobial activity. Waters Micromass Q-ToF Micro instrument was used for mass spectra. Elemental analysis was performed on Perkin-Elmer 2400 C, H and N analyzer and all synthesized compounds gave C, H and N analysis within ± 0.4% of the theoretical results.
