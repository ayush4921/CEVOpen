<p id="p0050">To solve this dilemma in the short term, countries wanting to test herbal remedies as potential therapies for COVID-19 need to reform their existing regulatory policies to facilitate and incentivize sponsors to run their own clinical trials. However, to fully unleash the medicinal power of plants to treat human diseases globally, a significant amount of interdisciplinary research is needed to study the genetics, chemistry, and biochemistry of diverse medicinal plants, develop capabilities of producing bioactive plant natural products and their analogs at will through metabolic engineering, and elucidate their action mechanisms and potential synergistic effects when used in combination (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Li and Weng, 2017</xref>). Future generations of TCM-inspired modern medicines should contain single or combined bioactive plant natural products with known composition and action mechanisms and show equivalent or superior safety and efficacy when compared with traditional herbal remedies. Moreover, to preserve and research the world biodiversity of medicinal plants, agencies such as the World Health Organization could play a role to help establish a framework under which all regions of the world could gain access to funding and expertise to study their own medicinal plants and exchange their knowledge with the rest of the world.
