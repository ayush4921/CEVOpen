<p id="p0065">We have now painfully learned that a global public health crisis like COVID-19 in the 21st century can cost society even more than a regional war. Our inability to eradicate COVID-19 is due to our ignorance about the disease and lack of technological capabilities to dismantle it, both of which can be solved by science. In a post-COVID-19 world, societal funding into science should be significantly increased to better prepare us for future societal challenges like COVID-19. It is important that diverse scientific disciplines should be funded, because it is impossible to predict what the next challenge will be and what scientific solutions will be needed to address it. Given the significant contributions that plant science has made to societal advancement in human history, increasing funding into plant science will be critical and totally worth it.</p>
