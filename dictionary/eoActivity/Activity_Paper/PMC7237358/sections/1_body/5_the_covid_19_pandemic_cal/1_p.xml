<p id="p0060">Scientifically, we were in a better position than ever before when COVID-19 hit. Scientists were able to quickly identify the disease-causing virus, sequence its genome, and develop various methods of disease diagnosis. Within months, a multitude of prevention and treatment strategies were devised, many of which were put into practice. This is a strong testament for the paramount importance of science to the future well-being of humans. Without prior research investment in areas such as virology, genomics, immunology, chemistry, and CRISPR technology, we would not have the tools or the scientific workforce to battle against COVID-19. Without pharmaceutical industry's previous efforts to find cures for other diseases, we would not have the list of investigational drugs and vaccines to quickly enter clinical trials targeting COVID-19. Unfortunately, the pre-COVID-19 world did not seem to value science enough, despite its purported importance. In the United States, for example, the total federal budget for major science funding agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the Department of Energy (DOE), has been miniscule compared with its annual defense budget in past decades. For this year, deep cuts in federal research spending were also proposed (

Had we invested more in science, for instance in the underfunded area of infectious diseases, we probably would have a few more tools in hand to fight against COVID-19, hence reducing its toll on society. Research projects to study medicinal plants with antiviral properties, for which funding was difficult to obtain in the pre-COVID-19 climate, might have yielded potential cures for COVID-19. Even for the seemingly distantly related field of plant engineering, clever heterologous expression systems in plants might well be adapted to produce vaccines or therapeutic antibodies.
