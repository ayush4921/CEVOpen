<p id="p0020">Infectious diseases have afflicted humans since hunter-gatherer days. When the agricultural revolution occurred around 10 000 years ago, the rise of densely populated communities greatly increased the chance of epidemics. Diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, influenza, and smallpox became known during that time. Through numerous trials and errors followed by extensive empirical exercises, indigenous people around the world have independently discovered a plethora of medicinal plants for treating various infectious diseases. For instance, in central Africa,

 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> (sweet wormwood) native to China and 
 <italic>Cinchona officinalis</italic> (Cinchona tree) native to South America are the most well known (

 <italic>Treatise on Cold Pathogenic and Miscellaneous Diseases</italic>, regarded as a crown jewel among ancient TCM texts, was written by Zhang Zhongjing (AD 150–219) during the late Eastern Han dynasty when continuous wars and multi-year pandemics caused great human suffering and death (

Using a dialectic approach, Zhang Zhongjing systematically documented 113 herbal formulae and 397 therapeutic strategies for treating illnesses that were meticulously categorized by their differential disease manifestations and responses to alternative initial investigative treatments. The
