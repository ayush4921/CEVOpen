<p id="p0035">Similar to several other pandemics in recent decades, COVID-19 emerged as a new disease, and currently there is no effective medicine to eliminate SARS-CoV-2. Since a new drug discovery program can easily take more than 10 years with a high probability of failure, finding cures for COVID-19 to meet urgent need through this route seems unattainable. Numerous investigational drugs that have recently entered clinical trials for COVID-19 are all repositioned from molecules previously approved or under investigation for other indications (

A preliminary clinical study in France recently showed promising results of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in reducing the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in COVID-19 patients (

Studies of the quinine scaffold showed that this class of molecules has the unique property to enrich in lysosome, which underpins their antimalarial and antiviral activities. Multiple clinical trials using chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 are currently ongoing (
