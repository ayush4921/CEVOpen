<p id="p0040">In China, TCM has played an important role in the battle against COVID-19. In late January 2020, the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM) organized an urgent study section to identify effective prescriptions of TCM for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Based on symptoms observed in early COVID-19 patients, several TCM formulae were developed, among which the lung cleansing and detoxifying decoction (LCDD) was one of the most widely used, and clinically studied. LCDD is a combined formula developed based on four classical formulae described in the

According to a press conference held by the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council of China on April 17, the initial trial indicated that LCDD was effective on 90% of the 214 enrolled COVID-19 patients. Another trial with additional 1262 patients, including 57 with severe symptoms, showed that 99.28% of these patients have recovered by now and none with mild symptoms developed severe symptoms under LCDD treatment (

Although these trial data are yet to be officially published, NATCM has officially recommended LCDD as a treatment for COVID-19. LCDD has since been widely used in 28 provinces and municipalities and has contributed to the relatively low mortality rate among COVID-19 patients in China. Several Chinese patent medicines (e.g., Lianhua Qingwen capsules) were also used for treating COVID-19 patients with many concomitant clinical observations currently ongoing. This topic has recently been well reviewed by
