<p id="p0070">The COVID-19 pandemic exposes several weaknesses of human nature. The unwillingness to take inconvenient near-term preventative measures to avert predictable long-term crises have hurt some countries during this pandemic. Moreover, when disasters hit, the tribalism nature of humans gets amplified, which hampers our species' unique strength of collaborating with each other. This is the exact opposite of what we need right now to defeat the virus. Although COVID-19 is already bad enough, I can't help thinking about other looming crises of a similar nature. For example, we are currently on a trajectory towardÂ continued increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration, global climate change, sea level rise, and ultimately, environmental and socioeconomic catastrophes. Unlike COVID-19, which will fade away in the coming months to years, the curve of the increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration cannot be easily flattened, and the consequences will stay with us for a much longer term (

Temporary interruptions to the global food supply chain due to geopolitical reasons or a pandemic like COVID-19 put food security at instant risk. In the long term, overpopulation, diminishing arable land, and loss of plant productivity caused by climate change have been forecasting significant global food supply shortfalls compared with demand in the future.
