<p id="p0075">As a society, we must learn from where we succeeded and failed in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemicÂ and take these lessons to heart when addressing other global challenges facing mankind. Again, plant science is well poised to make important contributions to these challenges. Plants are primary sequesters of atmospheric CO
 <sub>2</sub> on Earth, using only sunlight as the energy input. For instance, engineering plants to accumulate inert carbon-trapping polymers such as suberin and sporopollenin can help rebalance the global carbon cycle. Developing crops with enhanced productivity, disease resistance, and abilities to withstand harsh environmental conditions will be critical to ensure future sustainability of humans on Earth. However, we need comprehensive collaborations at a global scale to integrate plant biotechnologies with other technologies and policies to create grand actionable mitigation strategies. As scientists around the world work collectively to defeat COVID-19, sharing their results with unprecedented transparency and speed, I see hope that united as one human race, we will overcome the challenges lying ahead.
