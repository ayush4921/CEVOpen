<p>The ability of the most active compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> to enhance gamma radiation-induced tumor cell death was examined. The results proved the ability of the two compounds to sensitize the cancerous cells to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation (
 <xref rid="t0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> showed enhanced cytotoxicity on all cell lines after irradiation with a single dose of 8 Gy gamma radiation. Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was more potent on all the tested cell lines with IC
