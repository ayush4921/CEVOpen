<p>The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell viability activity of the targeted compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>18</bold> was measured through MTT assay against a panel of cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HepG-2 and HCT-116 human cancer cell lines derived from breast, liver and colon tumors. A closer look at 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> indicates that compounds 
 <bold>4</bold>–
 <bold>18</bold> showed variable IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against the tested cell lines and was compared to erlotinib and staurosporine, as standards. Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> was the most potent against all the cell lines with IC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 1.53 to 5.76 µM. Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> takes second place after 
 <bold>5</bold> as a promising homologue. Compounds 
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>15</bold> displayed more potent activity against MDA-MB-231 cell line in comparison to erlotinib with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values = 1.53, 1.60 and 2.41 versus 3.73 µM. While the remaining compounds showed good to moderate activities towards the tested cell lines. The most potent compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> were screened against MCF-10A normal breast cell line to determine their selectivity and relative safety towards normal cells. The compounds showed low cytotoxic effect with IC
 <sub>50</sub>=61.85 and 49.21 µM against MCF-10A cell line. Measuring the selectivity index
