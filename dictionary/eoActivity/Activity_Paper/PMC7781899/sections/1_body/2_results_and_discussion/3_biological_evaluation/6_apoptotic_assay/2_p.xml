<p>Phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure on the outer plasma membrane was detected during apoptosis and forms the basis for Annexin V/PI (propidium iodide) double staining assay to detect apoptotic cell death. At early apoptosis, the cell membrane excludes viability dyes such as PI and permits the determination of apoptotic cell kinetics according to the cell cycle

 </xref>. To investigate the mode of induced cell death, MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with compound 
 <bold>5</bold> at 0.76 μM for 24 h. Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> induced apoptosis (19.1%) by more than 12 folds over the control (1.54%). Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> induced early apoptosis by 7.36% and enhanced late apoptosis by 11.74% compared with the untreated control cells (
