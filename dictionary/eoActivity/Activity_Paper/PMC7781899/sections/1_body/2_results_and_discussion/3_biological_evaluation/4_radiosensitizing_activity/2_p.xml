<p>Radiotherapy is second to surgery in cancer treatment. The major drawback of radiotherapy is its inability to differentiate between cancerous and normal tissues. Radiation causes ionization and excitation of atoms that result in the generation of short-lived free radicals. These free radicals can damage proteins and membranes, leading to single or double DNA strand breaks

 </xref>. A radiosensitizing agent can induce tumor sensitization to ionizing radiation, thus lowering the required dose for treatment. This enhancement of radiation effects not only control the local tumors but also limit the metastatic spread. EGFR inhibitors can adopt another mechanism of action by inhibiting accelerated repopulation of tumor cells during fractionated radiotherapy as they block the membrane receptors of growth factors or interfere with the signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation
