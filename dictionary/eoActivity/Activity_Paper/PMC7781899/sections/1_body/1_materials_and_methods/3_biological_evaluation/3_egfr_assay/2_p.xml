<p>EGFR kinase kit (0.192 mg/mL) was obtained from Invitrogen. An ATP solution and a kinase/peptide mixture were developed just before use. The solution on the plate was mixed carefully and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Then, 5 mL of the prepared solution was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 1 h and determined by an ELISA Reader (PerkinElmer, USA). Curve fitting using Graph Pad Prism 5 was constructed. Each experiment was repeated three times. IC
 <sub>50</sub> was represented as means ± SE.
