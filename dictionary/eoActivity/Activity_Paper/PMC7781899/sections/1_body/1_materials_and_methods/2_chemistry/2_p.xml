<p>Melting points were determined uncorrected by a Gallen Kamp melting point apparatus (Sanyo Gallen Kamp, UK). Precoated silica gel plates (
 <italic>Kieselgel</italic> 0.25 mm, 60 F254, Merck, Germany) were used for TLC with solvent system of chloroform/methanol (8:2), spots were detected by UV light. IR spectra (KBr discs) were recorded using FT-IR spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, USA). 
 <sup>1</sup>H, 
 <sup>13 </sup>C NMR and 2D NMR experiments were scanned on an NMR spectrophotometer (Bruker AXS Inc., Switzerland), operating at 500 MHz for 
 <sup>1</sup>H and 125.76 MHz for 
 <sup>13 </sup>C. Chemical shifts are expressed in 
 <italic>δ</italic>-values (ppm) relative to TMS as an internal standard, using DMSO-d
 <sub>6</sub> and CDCl
 <sub>3</sub> as solvents. EIMS were measured using Shimadzu-GC/MS. Elemental analyses were performed on a model 2400 CHNSO analyser (Perkin Elmer, USA). All the values were within ±0.4% of the theoretical values. The X-ray data were collected at 
 <italic>T</italic> = 298 K on Enraf Nonius 590 Kappa CCD single crystal diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromated Mo Kα (
 <italic>λ</italic>=0.71073 Å) radiation using ψ–ω scan technique. All reagents used were of AR grade.
