 <sub>3</sub> (0.138 g, 0.001 mol), L-norephedrine 
 <bold>2</bold> (0.151 g, 0.001 mol) was added and refluxed for 10 h. The reaction mixture progress was monitored by TLC. It showed the presence of four products

 <bold>17</bold> and 
 <bold>18</bold> that were separated by silica gel column chromatography (45 × 2 i.d. cm, 40 gm) eluting with chloroform, followed by chloroform/methanol mixtures in a gradient system. Fractions 3–8 eluted with chloroform afforded 
 <bold>15</bold> (111 mg) after crystallization from methanol. Fractions 11–12 eluted with chloroform afforded 
 <bold>17</bold> (56 mg) after crystallization from methanol. Fractions 16–18 eluted with 2% methanol in chloroform afforded 
 <bold>16</bold> (47 mg) after crystallization from methanol. Fractions 27–29 eluted with 5% methanol in chloroform afforded 
 <bold>18</bold> (34 mg) after crystallization from methanol.
