<p>A mixture of 
 <bold>7</bold> (0.207 g, 0.001 mol) and 
 <bold>2</bold> (0.151 g, 0.001 mol) was refluxed in ethanol 95% (30 mL) containing K
 <sub>2</sub>CO
 <sub>3</sub> (0.138 g, 0.001 mol) for 12 h. The reaction was monitored by TLC and indicated the presence of two products 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>13</bold>. The products were separated by silica gel column chromatography (45 × 2 i.d. cm, 30 gm) eluting with chloroform, followed by chloroform/methanol mixtures in a gradient system. Fractions 12–15 eluted with 2% methanol in chloroform afforded 
 <bold>13</bold> (117 mg) after crystallization from methanol. Fractions 23–26 eluted with 5% methanol in chloroform afforded 
 <bold>12</bold> (43 mg) after crystallization from methanol. When the reaction was repeated but in the presence of DMF instead of ethanol, dimer 
 <bold>14</bold> was formed instead of 
 <bold>11</bold>. The products obtained were crystallized from dioxane.
