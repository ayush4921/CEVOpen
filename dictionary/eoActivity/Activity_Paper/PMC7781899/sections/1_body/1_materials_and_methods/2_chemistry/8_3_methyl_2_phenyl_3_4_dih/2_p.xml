<p>To a solution of 
 <bold>1</bold> (0.193 g, 0.001 mol) in ethanol (25 mL) with 
 <bold>2</bold> (0.151 g, 0.001 mol), hydrazine hydrate (0.05 g, 0.001 mol) was added and refluxed for 20 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC that indicates the presence of three products. The mixture was filtered to give three compounds 
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold> and 
 <bold>11</bold>. The mixture was separated by silica gel column chromatography (45 × 2 i.d. cm, 30 gm) eluting with chloroform, followed by chloroform/methanol mixtures in a gradient system. Fractions 4–7 eluted with chloroform afforded 
 <bold>9</bold> (103 mg) after crystallization from methanol. Fractions 10–12 eluted with chloroform afforded 
 <bold>10</bold> (68 mg) after crystallization from methanol. Fractions 21– 24 eluted with 5% methanol in chloroform afforded 
 <bold>11</bold> (71 mg) after crystallization from methanol.
