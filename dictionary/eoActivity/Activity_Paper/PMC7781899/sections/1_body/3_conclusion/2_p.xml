<p>In this study, a novel series of quinazolinone and fused quinazolinone derivatives synthesized by the aid of L-norephedrine were obtained. All these compounds showed variable anticancer activity against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, HepG-2 and HCT-116 cancer cell lines and EGFR inhibitory activity comparable to erlotinib. The 3-(1-hydroxy-1-phenylpropan-2-yl)-2-(methylthio)quinazolin-4(
 <italic>3H</italic>)-one 
 <bold>5</bold> and 3-amino-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(
 <italic>1H</italic>)-one 
 <bold>6</bold> were the most promising in this series towards the cancer cell lines and EGFR. Compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> were further selected to measure their relative safety and selectivity towards normal cells. They showed mild cytotoxic activity towards MCF-10A normal cell line and high selectivity towards MDA-MB-231 cell line. Besides, they displayed radiosensitizing activity through their ability to sensitize the cancer cells to the lethal effect of gamma irradiation. The most potent compound in this series, 
 <bold>5</bold>, undergoes cell cycle analysis and annexin V/PI assay to detect apoptotic cell death. Compound 
 <bold>5</bold> proved to arrest the cell cycle progression at the G2-M phase, induce early apoptosis and enhance late apoptosis. Moreover, molecular docking of compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> showed the key interactions required for EGFR inhibition. Finally, compounds 
 <bold>5</bold> and 
 <bold>6</bold> could be considered as promising leads for the development of new anticancer and radiosensitizing agents.
