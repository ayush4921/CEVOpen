<p>In contrast with the organic extracts, the aqueous extracts (

 <italic>P. porcatus</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), showing tyrosinase inhibition of 65.0 8.7% in comparison with 92.9 7.4% obtained for kojic acid used as positive control. Actually, the

 <italic>P. porcatus</italic> aqueous extracts have some amounts of rosmarinic acid (

 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> and 
 <italic>P. saccatus</italic> had the highest polyphenol content
