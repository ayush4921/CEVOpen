<p>The obtained results for the 
 <italic>P. neochilus</italic> organic extracts strongly suggest that the anti-ChC activity observed is mainly due to pentacyclic triterpenes typically present, particularly (
 <bold>14</bold>) and (
 <bold>15</bold>), previously reported as ChC inhibitors

 </xref>. On the other hand, the high inhibition of 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> organic extracts is most likely due to the presence of other pentacyclic triterpenes, such as (
 <bold>7</bold>) and (
 <bold>8</bold>) and/or abietane diterpenoids (
 <bold>1</bold>â€“
 <bold>4</bold>). Actually, compounds (
 <bold>7</bold>), (
 <bold>8</bold>), (
 <bold>14</bold>) and (
 <bold>15</bold>) have been widely studied for their ability to inhibit both collagenase and elastase, possibly by reversibly binding to the catalytic sites of these enzymes
