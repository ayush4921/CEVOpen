<p>Besides the triterpenes, royleanone-like diterpenes were also very effective in elastase inhibition. These compounds, including (
 <bold>4</bold>) (52.8 3.8%), (
 <bold>2</bold>) (39.2 5.2%) and (
 <bold>3</bold>) (38.3 4.4%), showed highest elastase inhibitory activity (

 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. plants are possible candidates for the treatment or prevention of skin photoageing.
