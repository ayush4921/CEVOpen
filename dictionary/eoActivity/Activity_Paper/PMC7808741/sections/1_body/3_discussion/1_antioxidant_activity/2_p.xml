<p>The antioxidant results obtained for the methanolic extracts of 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> (75.9 1.0%) and 
 <italic>P. madagascariensis</italic> (48.4 1.2%) as well as for the ethyl acetic extract of 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> (62.3 0.4%) can also be explained by their main diterpenoid compounds with an abietane backbone associated with antioxidant activity

 </xref>. Additionally, 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> ethyl acetic (55.5 1.7%) and acetonic (56.9 1.5%) extracts showed relatively higher RSA when compared to the remaining 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> spp. extracts, which held high RSA values only for the methanolic extracts. Actually, 
 <italic>P. ecklonii</italic> and 
 <italic>P. grandidentatus</italic> had the highest antioxidant activity among the studied 
 <italic>Plectranthus</italic> species, with RSA similar to that of quercetin (89.0 2.5%) used as positive control, which is a potent antioxidant flavonoid compound
